{"Headline": "How Did \u2018House of Cards\u2019 Kill Frank Underwood? Very Patiently", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article contains spoilers about Season 6 of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d What did you think of how the show handled Frank\u2019s death? Share your thoughts in the comments section.It takes until the very final scene of the season to get clarity. So if you\u2019re here only to learn how Francis J. Underwood died, we\u2019ll resist the urge to be as coy as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is: He died in his sleep and alone, poisoned by his right-hand man, Doug Stamper.Still, that truth as it pertains to Frank is withheld as long as possible. Morsels of information are scattered through the premiere: Frank was buried in Gaffney next to a father he hated, instead of at Arlington. Claire has not yet pardoned him, but she may still do so. We\u2019re given a shot of his hand in the coffin at the funeral \u2014 the extent of what we get of a physical representation of Frank.Not long into the season premiere, Claire comes right out and drops the M-word, saying, \u201cI\u2019m starting to believe Francis was murdered.\u201d Some very powerful people, possibly even the Shepherds (Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear), wanted Frank dead, and now they may want his widow dead, too. Almost as if the writers were trying preemptively to fend off criticism that they didn\u2019t explain Frank\u2019s death quickly, Claire says in the premiere\u2019s final scene: \u201cA man like Francis doesn\u2019t just die. That would be \u2014 what\u2019s the word? \u2014 convenient.\u201dAnd then she defiantly puts his ring on her middle finger, looking at us as she flips the bird.As the subplots surrounding Claire\u2019s presidency fight for air, the \u201cconvenience\u201d of Frank Underwood\u2019s death continues to smother them at the start of the season. At the end of Episode 2, almost as if she knows the viewer needs an update on what has now become a murder mystery, Claire turns directly to the camera and reveals a few more details about the last night of her husband\u2019s life: They hadn\u2019t spoken since she denied his calls and he showed up in the White House, slurring his words and furious; the public story about his dying in their bed is a lie; he died in his own bedroom; and Claire believes that \u201cthey killed him to shut me up.\u201dEpisode 3 reveals that Frank took too much liver medication, and then Frank fades somewhat into the background for the first time in the history of the show. With the details of his death still unclear, the mystery over his fate returns in the series finale, dominating even the story of Claire\u2019s pregnancy, a potential nuclear attack and a planned assassination attempt. Nothing can steal the focus from Frank for long.The series ends with the tearful revelation by Doug (played by Michael Kelly) that it wasn\u2019t Claire or even the Shepherds who killed him but he who did it, Frank\u2019s closest ally.Frank had come to Doug that night, he explains, and said that he was going to the White House to kill Claire. Doug knew that this would topple everything he had worked with Frank to build, so he found a way to overdose Frank\u2019s medication.In the show\u2019s final moments, Doug looks as if he might kill Claire too, holding the letter opener Frank gave him to her throat. He doesn\u2019t go through with it, breaking down just before Claire turns the opener on Doug, shoving it into his chest. The final scene of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is that of a woman murdering the only person who knows the truth about her husband.It\u2019s telling how many questions the writers leave open \u2014 almost enough for another season should Netflix have second thoughts \u2014 but they know that the saga of Frank Underwood defined this show, and so it ends when his story does, even if his widow gets the final word.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Of Demogorgons and Purple Worms \u2014 a Visual History of Dungeons & Dragons", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cD&D is a game of stories,\u201d write Michael Witwer, Kyle Newman, Jon Peterson and Sam Witwer early in \u201cDungeons & Dragons Art & Arcana: A Visual History,\u201d before noting it also comprises other things, like characters and ideas. But for anyone who\u2019s sampled the iconic role-playing game, D&D is also an exuberant dive into imagination, world-building, teamwork and identity \u2014 especially when played in its original format on a table cluttered with rule books, maps, monster manuals, character worksheets and colorful polyhedral dice nestled among pizza boxes, Funyuns bags and half-empty Mountain Dew cans.Once in the game, you could forget about the dreary annoyances of school as you slipped into your handcrafted persona of a thieving elf with high Strength and Intelligence scores and went off to battle the Demogorgon or a giant toothy Purple Worm with your fellow treasure-seeking friends. And if you were the designated Dungeon Master, narrating the story and directing the plot you mostly made up, that was even better. Just watch the first five minutes of the Netflix series \u201cStranger Things\u201d to see the joyful camaraderie.\u201cDungeons & Dragons Art & Arcana\u201d is an officially licensed (and promotional) history of the medieval combat-and-quest game originally concocted in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. With more than 700 images of guidebook illustrations, game packaging, advertising and ephemera crammed between its covers, it feels as if you\u2019re exploring a document dump of the company archives in convenient coffee-table-book form.The game\u2019s creators apparently never threw anything away. While the amateurish black-and-white sketches and badly typed rule book drafts reveal humble beginnings in the first chapter, the artwork soon becomes much more elaborate as D&D caught on. Cartoonish drawings give way to books and handsome box sets decorated with lavish color paintings and computer-generated graphics as Dungeons & Dragons morphed into a global mass-market transmedia property with its own novels, magazines, video games, television series and other products.While the book is dominated by images of clanking chainmail-clad warriors, columns of text detailing the game\u2019s historical development also snake through its pages. The tone is largely upbeat and earnest, but the authors don\u2019t sidestep the ups and downs of the franchise, like an early cease-and-desist order from J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s estate for unauthorized use of hobbits and ents. Typical business woes of overexpansion, the travails of a marketplace shifting to digital entertainment and corporate acquisition are also covered.However, it\u2019s the discussion of the game\u2019s social impact in the late 1970s and early 1980s that is far more intriguing, as the authors recount the persistent parental fear that D&D\u2019s luridly illustrated manuals were practically inspiring innocent youngsters to construct cardboard altars to Beelzebub in the basement: \u201cTo an audience who had no understanding of the mechanics of a role-playing game, and especially those inclined toward religious fundamentalism, this was all scary stuff.\u201dJ.D. Biersdorfer is the production editor at the Book Review.Advertisement"}

In particular, the book examines what Lewis says was the bungling of day-to-day operations at the Agriculture, Commerce and Energy departments.But with the first announced project being a book critical of Trump, combined with Obama\u2019s recent direct denunciations of Trump on the campaign trail, questions could be raised about whether his company will become a television and film outlet for the former president\u2019s political views.A spokeswoman for Higher Ground said the \u201cFifth Risk\u201d project would focus on the civics lessons contained in the book and would not take shots at Trump. It will be a \u201chumorous series demystifying the little-known ways in which federal agencies improve our lives and serve our nation, from the food we eat to the planes we travel on,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.Lewis, the celebrated author of best-sellers including \u201cMoneyball\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which both became feature films, did tell Couric in the podcast that Obama shared responsibility for the government\u2019s inefficiency and that he did not do enough to fix the problems outlined in \u201cThe Fifth Risk.\u201d\u201cTrump is symptom, not just cause here,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t elect someone who is so ignorant and negligent unless we got to the point where we so misvalue and misunderstand the thing he\u2019s running.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was a snail\u2019s pace to get anything done because it just took so long to get information from Mexico to the United States, and vice versa. He also has to work through the government, and they really don\u2019t want to interfere with things. [It\u2019s a] \u201cthat\u2019s their problem\u201d attitude, even though they\u2019re both feeding each other.I hate to admit that I sometimes found myself rooting for the cartels. You do root for them in a way because \u2014 and this is by no means a justification of what they do and who they are \u2014 they all come from very poor countries. And even if you win and you\u2019re doing great in life, the best you can do is, like, 10th place. That\u2019s like, cleaning toilets somewhere. The educational system isn\u2019t very good. Companies from other countries come in and exploit that, and they keep [their workers living] paycheck to paycheck almost by design. And so it\u2019s very complicated, but in their mind it\u2019s easily justifiable as to why they execute their plan to become drug lords.And now you\u2019re playing yet another D.E.A. agent in \u201cThe Mule,\u201d your second film with Clint Eastwood. Same job, completely different characters. This one is a wisecracking guy. It\u2019s almost, like, just me. Eastwood is the kind of director you\u2019re just like, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? I\u2019ll do whatever.\u201d When you\u2019re in a TV show, you have to pretty much do whatever is on the page because there\u2019s so many moving pieces. But with him you really get to explore.By \u201cbreakdown,\u201d you mean \u2026 ?Fifteen years ago, it was really, really tough because there were these breakdowns for [casting] where it would specifically say, \u201cLead part: Caucasian; second part: Caucasian; Caucasian, Caucasian, Caucasian. And it wouldn\u2019t be until the 10th part that it would be open to African-Americans. And then it would be up to \u201c15: open to all ethnicities.\u201d So the best that I could do back in the day was 15th place. I was offered gangster parts all the time. Nowadays that doesn\u2019t exist.No. It started off as a small part, and then it ended up being something really cool. And there was never, ever any talk of that anyway. It\u2019s all good.Will there be a third installment?I have no idea. They\u2019re figuring it out. And even if I knew, I\u2019d still have to give you the same answer.Despite all your serious roles, do you consider yourself first and foremost a comic actor? Not really. I\u2019m just an actor. Every comedy I\u2019ve ever done, I\u2019ve always played somebody that actually exists. If you imitate another actor, then it\u2019s considered stealing. But if you steal from real life, then it\u2019s a creation.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s shabby and beat-up, the kind of thing you\u2019d pluck from a bargain bin at a used-book store. Scott Shannon, the publisher of Del Rey Books, explains that a huge part of the show\u2019s appeal is \u201cthe cozy nostalgia of its 1980s setting. We worked with our book designers to create something that felt like a relic from that time period.\u201d The end result is so realistic that the shrink-wrapped book boasts a sticker that says, \u201cDon\u2019t freak! This book is supposed to look worn and torn.\u201dThe challenges of creating a guide to a cult-favorite TV hit are enormous. For one thing, you don\u2019t want to make any mistakes, because the show\u2019s most devout followers will ferret them out right away. For another, you have to dig deep to provide the kind of nuanced context and background that those same fans expect. \u201cStranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down\u201d goes even further. The entertainment journalist Gina McIntyre, who wrote it, acknowledges the challenge and says, \u201cWe wanted to do a book that felt like a real representation of the show. When you rewatch old episodes, you find lots of tiny clues that you missed the first time around. We wanted the book to be the same experience \u2014 you can read it straight through and then go back and look for Easter eggs embedded in the text.

{"Headline": "Our Networked (Dangerous) World: Do Australia\u2019s Leaders Get It?", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 79______Not coverage per se, but the way that both are being shaped by two forces: ideological ruptures and digital networks.For both journalism and geopolitics, a breakdown of monoliths and norms has created what sometimes feels like more of everything.Traditional news outlets, especially newspapers, are struggling. In their place are more partisan products and aggregators, more niche publications, greater availability of unfiltered (and often inaccurate) news through social platforms \u2014 and more readers and viewers in more places than most of us could have imagined a generation ago.For foreign affairs, the networked world has also meant proliferation. There\u2019s an equalization that\u2019s happened across the nodes and cables, whereby power can be wielded by far more than \u201csuperpowers.\u201d Ideologies, motivations and methods of mayhem have multiplied.In many ways, it used to be simpler. During the Cold War, the world was mostly divided into two camps with ideologies and spheres of influence that were well known. Now, it can be hard to know where the biggest threats or opportunities come from or which ones deserve the most attention.For many people, all of this creates a sense of dislocation and anxiety. Even within national borders, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really shaping daily life as the world feels progressively harder to understand.At The New York Times, of course, we believe that part of our job is to help with that \u2014 for readers in Australia and everywhere. But we also rely on political leaders to frame goals and strategies for dealing with the forces that affect us all.This week, I got a taste of how Australia\u2019s leaders are managing.Both Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, and Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, gave speeches in Sydney on foreign policy. I attended both.I\u2019d hoped to hear them grapple with some of the new challenges that go beyond nation-states or China vs. America. I\u2019d hoped to hear a sophisticated argument and maybe a vision for what the world could learn from Australia, and what Australia could learn from the world.Instead, I heard status quo thinking and caution.Mr. Morrison, speaking at an Asia Society gathering hosted by Bloomberg, focused more on the benefits of trade and expanded military spending. He started out trying to emphasize values: \u201cWe are more than the sum of our deals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are better than that.\u201dThen he proceeded to talk mostly in transactional terms. The word \u201ctechnology\u201d did not appear once in his prepared remarks.\u201cForeign policy speeches tend to be cautious, as they are directed towards multiple audiences,\u201d said Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute. \u201cAustralian foreign policy speeches are doubly so, as our external conditions have conditioned our foreign policy in the direction of pragmatism.\u201dBut I still find myself left with a question: Do today\u2019s leaders, in Australia and elsewhere, really understand the effects of a networked world enough to grasp the role it\u2019s playing in both their own democracies and in foreign affairs? Are they doing enough deep thinking about this?This week, I saw no signs that they are.Now for our stories of the week, about this part of the world, about technology, and a few other things to smile and think about.______O.K., O.K., let\u2019s start with a little fun.A few other highlights:______Nellie Bowles, one of our most talented tech reporters (who will be in Australia next month for some reporting and writing), published three stories this week that look at how those who have built our digital world are now eagerly protecting their children from it.They were all among the week\u2019s most read stories among New York Times readers worldwide. You\u2019ll want to digest at least one:This week also featured a few stories about animals that will make you smile.

{"Headline": "After Furor, Literary Group Withdraws Honor for \u2018Central Park Five\u2019 Prosecutor", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust two days after it came under fire for announcing an award for a novelist and former New York City prosecutor who oversaw the prosecution of the Central Park Five \u2014 teenage boys wrongly convicted of rape in 1989 \u2014 the organization behind the award withdrew it.Mystery Writers of America, which promotes mystery and detective fiction and presents the annual Edgar Awards, said Thursday that it would no longer honor Linda Fairstein, a best-selling crime author, with one of its \u201cGrand Master\u201d awards for literary achievement.The New York-based organization said in a statement that its board \u201cwas unaware\u201d of Ms. Fairstein\u2019s role in the infamous Central Park Five case until members raised concerns.\u201cAfter profound reflection, the Board has decided that M.W.A. cannot move forward with an award that lacks the support of such a large percentage of our members,\u201d the group said.The furor began on Tuesday when Mystery Writers of America announced that Ms. Fairstein would be one of two writers honored as Grand Masters at the organization\u2019s awards banquet next spring in New York. Ms. Fairstein is the author of 20 novels about a fictional Manhattan prosecutor, Alexandra Cooper, modeled on her own real-life past work as the chief of the sex-crimes unit of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.In June, the city released thousands of pages of internal law enforcement documents from the original Central Park Five investigation \u2014 some never previously made public \u2014 that reinforced the decision in 2002, based on DNA evidence, to overturn the convictions for all five defendants, who had confessed to the crime. In July, Ms. Fairstein wrote an op-ed in the New York Law Journal defending the prosecution. \u201cThe confessions were not coerced,\u201d she wrote.Another writer and Edgar Award winner, Attica Locke, in a series of tweets on Tuesday, urged the organization to honor someone else. \u201cShe is almost single-handedly responsible for the wrongful incarceration of the Central Park Five,\u201d wrote Ms. Locke, who also worked on filmmaker Ava DuVernay\u2019s upcoming Netflix docudrama on the case.Ms. Locke wrote that Ms. Fairstein \u201cnever apologized or recanted her insistence\u201d on the boys\u2019 guilt despite their subsequent exonerations. \u201cJust because she has a flourishing publishing career does not mean we should ignore her past \u2014 or her continued unwillingness to accept responsibility for ruining five innocent men\u2019s lives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI cannot support this decision.\u201dMs. Fairstein fired back at Ms. Locke on Twitter, defending her office\u2019s handling of the prosecution while also minimizing her own role in it. \u201cI was neither the prosecutor nor investigator in the case you mention,\u201d Ms. Fairstein wrote. \u201cI was certainly NOT the person who \u2018single-handedly spearheaded\u2019 the investigation,\u201d Ms. Fairstein wrote.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I have a civilized conversation, so I can refresh you with the facts?\u201d She wrote. \u201cThank you.\u201dOn Thursday, after Mystery Writers of America made its announcement, she thanked the organization for listening to her concerns.Ms. Fairstein, in a statement posted to Facebook on Thursday, she said she was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d with the group\u2019s decision and remained \u201cenormously proud\u201d of her work with the sex-crimes unit.\u201cI thank M.W.A. for the initial honor and for the joy it inspired, which can never be revoked, and I am happy to enthusiastically support the new Grand Master,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Fairstein could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, and a representative responded to a request for an interview on Thursday to the Facebook post.On Facebook, novelist Andrew Gross defended Ms. Fairstein on Wednesday as a worthy Edgar Award recipient: \u201cFor a person who has devoted her career to real-world situations that have advanced women\u2019s rights to be attacked and demonized by people whose toughest real-world decisions are how to define a gerund or what book to review is a sign that the inmates are truly running the asylum.\u201dIn an interview on Wednesday, Kellye Garrett, a novelist, said Mystery Writers of America should rescind the award if Ms. Fairstein did not volunteer to give it up. Ms. Garrett praised the organization but said its leaders should explain how they came to choose Ms. Fairstein in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret, her connection to the Central Park Five,\u201d she said.\u201cThey have work to do,\u201d Ms. Garrett said, \u201cespecially when it comes to inclusivity and embracing writers from marginalized communities.\u201dAt an anxious moment in the city\u2019s history, with violent crime near its peak, police in 1989 arrested five boys, all black and Hispanic and ages 14 to 16, for the rape and near-fatal beating of Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old white woman who was attacked as she jogged through Central Park after work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Douglas Refuses to Age Gracefully in \u2018The Kominsky Method\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "Playing a shabby acting coach in his first ongoing TV role since the 1970s, the \u201cWall Street\u201d star confronts the realities of growing older, onscreen and in his own life.Supported bySandy Kominsky is hardly a man in the prime of his life. Once a sought-after acting coach to the stars, he now makes his living teaching Hollywood wannabes how to audition for sitcoms and shampoo commercials. He has three failed marriages, a grown daughter who barely abides him and a body that is rebelling against him.\u201cAt age 74?\u201d he asked. \u201cGraciously and happily.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re going to find comedy in getting older?\u2019\u201d Douglas added. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m your man.\u2019\u201dIf he was once ubiquitous, idolized and highly bankable, Douglas is at peace with the knowledge that such glories don\u2019t last forever. He hasn\u2019t suffered the steep descent of Sandy Kominsky, but recent chapters of his life have been turbulent. He has overcome a cancer diagnosis to give some of the warmest and most eccentric performances of his career. He has also been accused of sexual misconduct by a former employee.After all this time, it\u2019s not clear how Douglas perceives himself or that he even has a fixed self-image; in his own mind, he is neither a pampered show-business scion nor a self-assured master of the universe.Long-term plans aren\u2019t his style. \u201cI never lined up what the hell I was going to do,\u201d Douglas said.So why not, at an unmoored moment in his work and an uncertain one for the entertainment industry, take his first ongoing television role since the 1970s and play a ragged septuagenarian with a full spleen and an enlarged prostate?As Douglas explained, \u201cI understand that guy whose life just didn\u2019t turn out the way he anticipated.\u201dNothing would immediately seem amiss in the life of Douglas, who was speaking on an October afternoon from the sumptuous Central Park West apartment he has kept for 30 years. He sat in a darkened corner of a living room, where sunlight from a nearby window illuminated only his silver hair and the grin on his face.That last achievement, Douglas said, was when he finally saw himself \u201cstepping out of the shadow of my dad.\u201d\u201cIt gave me a confidence I didn\u2019t have before,\u201d he said. More softly, he added, \u201cI set a high bar for myself.\u201dWhen both men volunteered for the same beer run, DeVito said: \u201cWe looked at each other, and I said, \u2018Do you get high?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yep.\u2019 We were fast friends from then on.\u201dDouglas could be audacious \u2014 \u201cI never swam naked in a pool until I met Michael,\u201d DeVito said \u2014 but was also centered and sympathetic.DeVito pointed out that Douglas\u2019s upbringing as a child of divorce is often overlooked: Kirk and Diana Douglas ended their marriage when Michael was 5, and his stepfather, Bill Darrid, whom Diana married in 1956, was an important influence.\u201cI\u2019m sure Kirk is a cool guy to have as a dad,\u201d DeVito said, \u201cbut a lot of the values that Michael traveled with in his kit were from his mom and his stepdad. His sensitivity and regard for other people came from the way he was brought up.\u201dToday, Douglas is the father of three children: his son Cameron, by his previous marriage to Diandra Luker; and his daughter, Carys, and son Dylan, by his marriage to Catherine Zeta-Jones.He is also a survivor of Stage IV cancer, diagnosed in 2010 \u2014 a \u201clarge, almond-size tumor at the base of my tongue,\u201d as Douglas described it.\u201cWe made a strategic decision to say that it was throat cancer,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the connotations of having your tongue removed and not being able to speak was not a pretty picture.\u201dThe performance won Douglas an Emmy Award, but he was not entirely enthralled with opportunities \u2014 mostly low-budget independent films \u2014 that followed.Then came \u201cThe Kominsky Method.\u201d Chuck Lorre, the creator of the series, is better known for shows like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cMom,\u201d which are hits but have hardly strayed from the time-honored formulas of the multicamera network sitcom.On \u201cThe Kominsky Method,\u201d Lorre said he wanted a show \u2014 single camera, no laugh track \u2014 that would let him address topics about confronting aging and mortality that are usually shunned on such programs.\u201cI just turned 66, and I\u2019m wired to see that there\u2019s comedy there,\u201d Lorre said. \u201cInside the aging body is this witness that thinks it\u2019s 18. There\u2019s the cognitive dissonance of, what\u2019s happening to me? When I\u2019m not crying, it\u2019s funny.\u201dAbout a year ago, Lorre began to sketch out the relationship among the show\u2019s principal characters: a powerful entertainment agent (played by Alan Arkin) whose wife dies of cancer in the first episode, forcing Kominsky to realize that his own time on earth, however degrading, is also limited.Lorre said he could not help but think of Douglas for this role. \u201cThere\u2019s a sublime elegance to the way he presents himself in the world,\u201d Lorre said. \u201cBetween his talents and his experience, he would know how to play the moments \u2014 both the poignant moments and comedic moments \u2014 with great finesse and nuance.\u201dArkin, who had never met Douglas before, initially wasn\u2019t sure what to make of him. But over the course of filming the show\u2019s eight-episode first season, he discovered a person who was very different from his movie roles.\u201cHe has a very determined air in film,\u201d Arkin said. \u201cThere\u2019s something very committed about his demeanor \u2014 \u2018This is the way I am, this is the way it\u2019s going to be.\u2019\u201dOn the series, Arkin said, Douglas was \u201cflexible and present, and I ended up having a lot of fun with him.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s something endearing about him in this series that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen before \u2014 a vulnerability that\u2019s very appealing.\u201d\u201cAs far as women are concerned, my career speaks for itself,\u201d Douglas told me. \u201cMy history of how well women have done in movies with me speaks for itself.\u201dBraudy responded in an email, \u201cMichael Douglas is a good actor and a super-cunning operator.\u201d She added: \u201cHe believed his power was so much greater than mine that he could pull icky/unwelcome sexual pranks without consequence and even take pleasure in my extreme discomfort.\u201dDouglas said he believed his decision to \u201cget out in front of the story\u201d had \u201cturned out to be the best thing,\u201d and he has proceeded in his work without any apparent disruption.While Douglas waits to find out if there will be further seasons of \u201cThe Kominsky Method,\u201d he is also finding new ways to connect with his illustrious 101-year-old father.\u201cHe\u2019s found FaceTime,\u201d Douglas said.Recounting what he said was a typical conversation between them, Douglas played the roles of both himself and father: \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Dad, did you ever think you\u2019d have a son who\u2019s celebrating his 50th year in show business.\u2019 Long pause.\u201dAs Kirk, he answered himself: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThen returning to his own voice, he proudly replied, \u201cYou heard me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Leading the Way to Flushing, Queens", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byrentersAfter they moved to a rent-stabilized building, seven of their friends followed, lured by the affordable rent and the great food in the neighborhood. When Cynthia Chung, 31, and Jeddy Hao, 32, found their one-bedroom apartment on Craigslist five years ago, it seemed like too good a deal.Rent was $1,050 a month, a few hundred less than everything else in the area, with no obvious defects to explain the discount. If anything, the apartment was nicer than others they had seen: It was well sized and well maintained, with large windows and a good layout.To Ms. Chung\u2019s surprise, he turned out to be right. Rent stabilization accounted for the lower-than-average rent. If there was any downside, it was that many of their friends lived elsewhere.But as they would soon discover, the prospect of a rent-stabilized apartment in a pleasant building is a powerful lure. They would not be alone for long.\u201cBack then, it was like, \u2018If you\u2019re in Flushing, you\u2019re hanging out with a bad crowd.\u2019 People were always getting into fights,\u201d said Mr. Hao, who grew up in Whitestone, N.Y. \u201cOur parents wouldn\u2019t even let us go here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not shiny and new like Long Island City, but it has its charms,\u201d Mr. Hao said. \u201cLike authentic Chinese food.\u201d\u201cSo much good food,\u201d Ms. Chung said. \u201cBuying food out is actually cheaper than cooking \u2014 most meals are, like, $6. There\u2019s a great range of high-end and dirt-cheap, but the dirt-cheap is actually better: White Bear, New Curry Leaves, Shiny Tea, New World Mall food court. You can get real milk tea, cheong fun, mala tang premade hot pot. I love it, I just love it.\u201dSuch is the abundance of inexpensive restaurants that the couple has to make a point to cook at home at least one night a week \u2014 but even then, they\u2019re often tempted to take an after-dinner stroll to one of the area\u2019s many dessert spots.$1,350 | Flushing, QueensIt didn\u2019t take long for the couple\u2019s friends to take notice of their cheap rent and Flushing\u2019s charms. The neighborhood\u2019s improved reputation and influx of new development and higher-end restaurants and stores didn\u2019t hurt, either. And as their friends\u2019 leases ended and apartments in the building opened up, they started moving in.The first, a pair Ms. Chung has known since sixth grade, found a one-bedroom listed on StreetEasy and snapped it up immediately. Then two friends considering a two-bedroom in Astoria heard about another opening in the building and decided to take it. Others followed suit, and the couple now has seven friends living in four different apartments in the building.\u201cWe hang out, eat together, lounge together. We\u2019re even all on the same phone plan, and we share Amazon accounts,\u201d said Ms. Chung, who is delighted that so many friends have joined them in their building. \u201cIt\u2019s very open-door, no one would turn you away. It\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, are you bored? Do you want to hang out?\u2019\u201dBesides knocking on one another\u2019s doors, the friends use a Facebook group chat to share leftovers, borrow a vegetable steamer or beg for assistance clearing out a shoe closet. They also coordinate movie nights, video game sessions, Costco runs and evening cocktails at \u201cthe bachelor pad,\u201d the apartment with a bar. A recent afternoon was spent updating the buzzer labels by the front door.Stephen Fang, who lives down the hall with his wife, Ester Linton, said it was a lot like college \u2014 only better: \u201cIt\u2019s like the best of both worlds. You have community, but you also get alone time.\u201d Mr. Hao nodded. \u201cI like to hang out, but not every night exactly. Sometimes you\u2019re tired and you just want to watch TV.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the more social one,\u201d said Ms. Chung, adding that she almost never craves an evening alone. Ms. Linton said she was looking forward to spending even more time together over the holidays, when people are home more often. \u201cLast year we did hot pot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the bachelor apartment for coffee \u2014 they have a really nice espresso machine \u2014 and ours for video games.\u201dWhile Ms. Chung said she has some friends who wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with a no-frills building like theirs \u2014 particularly as the Long Island Rail Road runs directly behind it \u2014 she expected to be welcoming more people in the future.\u201cI definitely think more friends will end up moving in,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are constantly asking us to be on the lookout.\u201dAnd earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a renter in Flushing, N.Y.

Just in a sexual fetishized kind of way.\u201dJames proceeds to get specific, explaining that she has a type of white man she prefers, and it\u2019s not a progressive. \u201cIf I date a white dude,\u201d she says, before zeroing in on a man in the front row, \u201cI want to ruin your family.\u201dSex and politics can make strange bedfellows and thus wonderful comedy. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that many of the funniest political jokes from the sharpest young stand-ups today are smuggled into bits on dating and relationships.Trump barely comes up in James\u2019s jokes, but his effect on the culture infuses so many of her premises. She doesn\u2019t need to mention his name when she says she stopped exercising because the world is coming to an end. You know what (and whom) she\u2019s talking about.She jokes about depression, masturbation and how it\u2019s ridiculous that no one pays for pornography, making the case that its stars work harder than anyone, calling them \u201cbasically slutty athletes.\u201d Once she establishes a playful relationship with the crowd, she shifts from teasing to confrontational. After skewering straight men for not doing more to get better at oral sex, she retreats, for an instant. \u201cNo judgment,\u201d she says, raising her hands in mock surrender, before shifting to a stern stare: \u201cJudgment.\u201dThe rhythm of this fiercely feminist show is contained in those three words. As she builds a case that the pleasure of women is of much lower priority than that of men, Treyger\u2019s set takes a sharp turn from the personal to the political. \u201cWhy don\u2019t women speak up?\u201d she asks about this disparity, then answers her own question with some historical perspective: \u201cOnce Henry VIII chopped off the last woman\u2019s head, we had a meeting and were like: \u2018Size doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201dThis one man, she concludes, taught her what \u201cit means to be a sexy woman.\u201d If not for him, she joked, she would never have tried on a halter top. How does this man know exactly what she wants to hear? She researches the question and says that she found an interview with one of his colleagues who said, to understand what women want, every month, \u201cwe read Cosmo.\u201dWhat begins as a joke about culture turns into a resonant feminist diagnosis of the twisted way men speak for and manufacture art for women. There\u2019s an intrepid intelligence in this joke as it traces the unlikely roots of mass entertainment. As she walks you through her thought process, she makes sure to keep dropping punch lines, albeit ones that don\u2019t build to a declarative point but than unravel into exasperation. She has another excellent joke about how Amazon\u2019s anticipating what you will buy makes you insecure enough to click on products to make you seem cooler.Advertisement"}

Netflix occasionally changes its schedule without giving notice.It\u2019s been over a year since Netflix debuted the first season of the musician Ezra Koenig\u2019s quirky animated science-fiction comedy \u201cNeo Yokio.\u201d There\u2019s no second season scheduled yet, but the denizens of Koenig\u2019s wondrous alt-universe New York are at least returning for a one-off special, \u201cPink Christmas.\u201d This holiday season, the show\u2019s hero Kaz Kaan (voiced by Jaden Smith) will still be handling his \u201cmagistocrat\u201d daily grind \u2014 fighting evil and suffering through low-key personal drama \u2014 while also trying to overcome his usual moodiness to excel at a Secret Santa competition.It\u2019s been over a year since Netflix debuted the first season of the musician Ezra Koenig\u2019s quirky animated science-fiction comedy \u201cNeo Yokio.\u201d There\u2019s no second season scheduled yet, but the denizens of Koenig\u2019s wondrous alt-universe New York are at least returning for a one-off special, \u201cPink Christmas.\u201d This holiday season, the show\u2019s hero Kaz Kaan (voiced by Jaden Smith) will still be handling his \u201cmagistocrat\u201d daily grind \u2014 fighting evil and suffering through low-key personal drama \u2014 while also trying to overcome his usual moodiness to excel at a Secret Santa competition.\u2014\u2014Throughout the first season of \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina,\u201d the show\u2019s writers delivered some unexpectedly bold commentary on the pros and cons of organized religion. Or, at least bolder than one might expect from a stylish horror-drama about a teenage witch. Netflix has been keeping the details of the holiday special \u201cA Midwinter\u2019s Tale\u201d mostly under wraps, only releasing a few seconds of footage as a teaser. But the episode will definitely involve a solstice celebration and a seance, and \u2014 if it follows the lead of what\u2019s come before \u2014 will add nuanced observations about the purpose of spirituality and ritual in everyday life.Throughout the first season of \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina,\u201d the show\u2019s writers delivered some unexpectedly bold commentary on the pros and cons of organized religion.

McGee (who wrote each of the first season\u2019s six episodes) doesn\u2019t ignore the IRA bombings and brawls that rocked Derry at the time, but this series is mostly about four adolescent girls and one transplanted English boy all facing growing pains while engaging in typical classroom hijinks.

It\u2019s no accident that this new \u201cWatership Down\u201d is debuting right before Christmas. The producers are undoubtedly hoping that families will gather around the TV over the holiday season to experience Adams\u2019 classic tale of rabbits on a courageous quest to find a new home.The latest animated adaptation of Richard Adams\u2019 magnificent adventure novel \u201cWatership Down\u201d is the most ambitious and expensive yet: a four-part animated miniseries, co-produced by Netflix and the BBC, with big names like James McAvoy, Ben Kingsley, Gemma Arterton, Rosamund Pike, John Boyega and Peter Capaldi providing the voices.

A cast of future stars \u2014 including Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams, Suzanne Somers and Harrison Ford \u2014 play recently graduated high schoolers, driving through a typical summer night, hooking up and breaking up, while listening to the DJ Wolfman Jack on the radio. The mostly plotless \u201cnight in the life\u201d approach of \u201cAmerican Graffiti\u201d became a common way to tell stories about youth in transition, focusing more on the feel of a time and place than on any big drama.Pre-\u201cStar Wars,\u201d George Lucas had his first box office success with this poignant nostalgia piece, set within the car-crazy teen culture of suburban California in 1962.

{"Headline": "Succession at CBS Will Be Tougher Than It Looks", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe board faces a difficult task in finding a new chief executive. Richard Parsons, the former interim chairman, had discussed the job with HBO\u2019s Richard Plepler, according to two people. Mr. Plepler wasn\u2019t interested. At CBS, succession won\u2019t be swift.The industry backdrop is daunting, too. CBS, the most-watched network for the past decade, is still the king of prime time, but it presides over a dwindling empire. Audiences across television have eroded as tech platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Netflix attract more of their time. Mr. Plepler was not interested, and no formal offers were made, the people said. But the casual approach befits the style of Mr. Parsons, who is known for talking through an idea with a small group before broaching it more widely.His discussions with CBS became moot when Mr. Parsons left the board, but they reveal the early thinking on who could lead CBS \u2014 as well as the challenge of persuading a top-flight executive to take the job. In his departing statement, Mr. Parsons said, \u201cI trust CBS\u2019s distinguished board, now led by Strauss Zelnick, as well as CBS\u2019s strong management team led by Joe Ianniello, will continue to successfully guide this company into its very bright future.\u201dFive weeks into the new season, CBS is still the most-watched channel, with an average audience of 8.8 million in prime time. But total viewers fell 12 percent from last year, reflecting the broader downturn at all TV networks.(CBS reported Thursday that its third-quarter revenue rose 3 percent to $3.2 billion, helped by a 14 percent jump in advertising and a 15 percent rise in licensing fees.)Candidates will be evaluated in the context of the board\u2019s larger strategic plan for CBS, which could involve a deal with another company, the people said.Ms. Redstone, who controls CBS through her family business, National Amusements, has been agitating for a merger with Viacom, the cable company behind MTV and Nickelodeon, which she also controls.The thesis: A tie-up would protect both companies from the onslaught of tech since a larger entity would have more negotiating leverage when bargaining for licensing fees with cable and satellite providers, thus ensuring healthier profits.Leslie Moonves, who was ousted as chief executive in September, was wary of the deal, which led to one of the bitterest boardroom battles in recent memory.In May, CBS sued Ms. Redstone to sap her power through the issuance of a special stock dividend. The suit was eventually dissolved after accusations of sexual abuse against Mr. Moonves \u2014 revealed in two New Yorker articles \u2014 ended his celebrated run at CBS.But the legal battle did offer a window into Ms. Redstone\u2019s thinking, which was made clear in a May complaint against CBS brought via National Amusements, or N.A.I.:Ms. Redstone discussed N.A.I.\u2019s long-term plans for CBS, focusing on a two-step process starting with a merger with Viacom that would strengthen both entities, and continuing thereafter with a sale or merger of the stronger combined entity, with N.A.I. open to the possibility of relinquishing its voting control as part of that second transaction.The exit settlement with Mr. Moonves prevents Ms. Redstone from pursuing that merger for two years. But the CBS board can examine any possible transaction, including a deal with Viacom, independently of Ms. Redstone.If the board considers a merger, that will affect how it chooses a chief executive since the person could end up running both CBS and Viacom. Another strategy might include selling CBS to a bigger company, which would also be a factor in how the board considers candidates.The 61-year-old Mr. Zelnick \u2014 his new book, a health memoir, is titled \u201cBecoming Ageless\u201d \u2014 is sure to play an influential role in the discussion. The same might now be said about CBS. And his appointment of Mr. Nevins as head of programming solved a practical issue created by the absence of Mr. Moonves, who oversaw much of the network\u2019s programming himself.Mr. Moonves had delighted in working with many of the network\u2019s producers. He often had a direct hand in casting decisions, for example. As a result, over 30 people reported directly to Mr. Moonves, an unusually high number for the head of a publicly traded company with nearly 13,000 employees. That\u2019s a notable shift. Mr. Ianniello had figured widely in the legal battle CBS had waged against Ms. Redstone this year. The lawsuit revealed several private messages between him and Mr. Moonves in which Mr. Ianniello enthusiastically showed support for the now-ousted executive.But his rapprochement with Ms. Redstone began almost two months ago when CBS announced Mr. Ianniello\u2019s new role. She offered this simple statement at the time: \u201cWe are confident in Joe\u2019s ability to serve as acting C.E.O.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ruth Gates, Who Made Saving Coral Reefs Her Mission, Is Dead at 56", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRuth Gates, a renowned marine biologist who made it her life\u2019s work to save the world\u2019s fragile coral reefs from the deadening effects of warming water temperatures, died on Oct. 25 in Kailua, Hawaii. She was 56.The Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Manoa, where Dr. Gates was director, announced her death, at Castle Hospital. Robin Burton-Gates, her wife, said that the cause was complications of surgery for diverticulitis. Dr. Gates also had cancer that had spread to her brain, she said.Dr. Gates had wanted to be a marine biologist since she was a child, having been entranced by coral reefs when she saw them on the televised exploits of the underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau.A precious natural resource, coral reefs are often called the rain forests of the ocean because they provide a nurturing habitat for critical sources of food for millions of people, in addition to serving as a major source of tourism dollars.But over the last few decades, at least a third of the world\u2019s reefs, which are highly sensitive to temperature changes, have died, the victims of a rise in global warming, ocean acidification, ecotourism, pollution and commercial overfishing. Scientists say warming trends suggest that much more could be destroyed in the next 30 years, with coral serving as the canary in the coal mine for the eventual collapse of the ocean ecosystem.Dr. Gates was one of the leading scientists trying to protect coral from such a fate. As director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, which is part of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, she was developing a \u201csuper coral\u201d that could be bred to be more resilient to the heat and acidity assaulting the marine environment.In addition to doing cutting-edge research, Dr. Gates brought a passion to her work that animated a larger-than-life personality and made her a sought-after public speaker and the subject of numerous videos. She was president of the International Society for Reef Studies; she spoke about her work at the United Nations and at the Aspen Ideas Festival; and she mentored a generation of graduate students.She was, many said, a Renaissance woman.\u201cShe could do everything well,\u201d Ms. Burton-Gates said in a telephone interview. \u201cShe was good at computers, fantastic at business, she could remodel homes, she was a fantastic cook, she had a third-degree black belt in karate.\u201dShe was also, Ms. Burton-Gates said, \u201ca great athlete in school.\u201d And, it turned out, she could sing. At a karaoke night in Honolulu in 2015, she surprised everyone and stopped the show by belting out \u201cDiamonds Are Forever.\u201dMostly, Dr. Gates, who was British, put her communications skills in the service of saving corals. And she used her command of the Queen\u2019s English to great effect.\u201cShe used to laugh about the fact that you could say the most inane thing, but if you had a British accent people would believe you,\u201d Dr. Margaret McFall-Ngai, director of the Pacific Biosciences Research Center at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said in a telephone interview.\u201cIt\u2019s a very rare day that you have a scientist as charismatic as Ruth,\u201d Dr. McFall-Ngai said. \u201cShe was the Carl Sagan of coral reefs.\u201dRuth Deborah Gates was born on March 28, 1962, in Akrotiri, Cyprus, where her father, John Amos Gates, was stationed while he worked in British military intelligence. Her mother, Muriel (Peel) Gates, was a physical therapist. With her parents constantly traveling, Ruth grew up chiefly in a boarding school in Kent, England.She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in marine biology from Newcastle University in 1984 and a doctorate there in the same subject in 1990. She did much of her initial studying of corals in Jamaica, just as Caribbean corals were starting to die. She conducted additional research at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Hawaii.She met Ms. Burton-Gates, an illustrator, in 2014 through a mutual friend. They married on Sept. 28. A brother, Tim, also survives her.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018In 2013, the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation offered $10,000 for the most promising proposal to mitigate problems caused by an increasingly acidic ocean. Dr. Gates and Madeleine van Oppen, of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, won the challenge with their plan to develop highly resilient coral strains, much the way farmers breed stronger crops.The foundation subsequently awarded them a five-year, $4 million grant, with the longer-term goal of creating a stock of tough coral strains that could replace dying coral reefs around the world.The work has its skeptics. One major question is whether the development of these new coral strains is scalable for worldwide application. Another is whether a mechanism can be created by which the strains can be widely distributed. Yet another is whether the money can be found to pay for these very expensive undertakings.Beyond that, some people question whether this process will actually narrow the diversity of corals, which could lead to unintended consequences.Dr. Gates was generally unfazed by the criticism.Her laboratory remains dedicated to pursuing her work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Year After #MeToo, Hollywood\u2019s Got a Malaise Money Can\u2019t Cure", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResting in the film executive\u2019s sweaty palm was an extremely long rectangular pill stamped \u201cX-A-N-A-X.\u201d\u201cWant half?\u201d he said.It was a hot, windy night in mid-September, and we were walking to our cars after meeting for drinks at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills. I had expected a lively, gossip-fueled conversation, nothing for attribution, of course. Instead, our talk was more like a gloomy therapy session \u2014 in which I was the shrink.I rebuffed the Xanax by joking that even half looked big enough to tranquilize the Incredible Hulk and drove home. But the unsettling encounter stayed with me. I knew it wasn\u2019t just one guy having a bad day. Hollywood is in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis.But euphoria is almost nonexistent in studio hallways. The movie capital is instead mired in a profound malaise.The reason involves fallout from the #MeToo earthquake, both the positive changes it forced, and, lately, the pushback it has incurred. Contributing are the mega-mergers that have left Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox with new owners and may find Sony Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sold or reconfigured before long. The steady march of Big Tech into entertainment also plays a role. Hollywood power players have long clung to the fantasy that the world revolves around them, as if it were 1940 and they were all Louis B. Mayer. But that delusion has been hard to sustain with Amazon and Apple throwing around billions to make TV series, some featuring megawatt stars like Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston.In the 100-year history of Hollywood, rarely if ever has so much upheaval arrived so fast and on so many fronts. For streaming upstarts like Netflix and Amazon Studios, where the cultures are still forming and money is gushing, the disruption is invigorating. But the rest of the entertainment business is filled with a deep unease. It is not just old-guard men moping about the end of their supremacy. It\u2019s midlevel vice presidents at merging companies worried about whether they are about to lose their jobs. It is people initially excited by the Time\u2019s Up insurgency who are concerned about stagnation or even backsliding.\u201cThe vast majority of people feel completely unmoored,\u201d said Amy Baer, whose 30-year movie career has taken her from Sony Pictures to CBS Films to independent producing. \u201cThere is fear. There is tension. And there is no end in sight.\u201dPublicly, everyone in Hollywood says the same thing, almost as if reading from talking points written by publicists: We applaud this long overdue progress and will do everything in our power to make sure the culture changes.Some men in Hollywood quickly revert to sexist and offensive language when speaking anonymously, which is the only way the most powerful ones will talk to reporters. (This is a place, after all, where even corporate publicists say things like, \u201cStrictly off the record, I have nothing to say.\u201d)\u201cI was just curious,\u201d Ms. Baer said. \u201cThis guy is one of the good guys. But he looked at me like \u2018Oh, no \u2014 here she comes,\u2019 like I was taking aim at him, and that speaks to the tension.\u201dBeth Gulas, a management and organizational consultant who focuses on the entertainment industry, said Hollywood was more out of alignment than it seemed on the surface. \u201cThere is fear, but there is also anger,\u201d Ms. Gulas said. \u201cWomen with a point of view, many men with another. Older executives not understanding why younger executives and employees are so adamant about diversity and inclusion. Younger executives and employees angry at their bosses for letting it get this bad.\u201dThe only unifying characteristic: \u201cAll of this change is having a massive impact on people,\u201d she said. \u201cMassive \u2014 as in bigger than people really want to say out loud.\u201d\u201cBrands have become more leery of aligning themselves with actors because of #MeToo,\u201d said Janet Comenos, Spotted\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThat means potentially millions of dollars not flowing into the Hollywood ecosystem \u2014 the managers, the agents.\u201dIt is impossible to know, of course, whether such changes will end or even dramatically reduce the abuses of power that have made Hollywood the center of the #MeToo revolution. There is clearly a palpable difference in behavior. But will an out-of-control business culture that operated for decades be permanently transformed? It will take years to find out, and there is a growing disillusionment among some of those on the front lines.\u201cGenerally speaking, I still don\u2019t see a real willingness to do what it takes to change a troubled culture,\u201d Ms. Gulas said. \u201cIt takes investment, and it takes a lot of stamina to see it through. Most of these companies want a quick solution. They want a Band-Aid.\u201dThe six major studios (soon to be five) declined to comment on inclusion riders. One studio chief, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he feared drawing the fury of advocacy groups, said lawyers at his company nixed the notion because they feared that such quotas might prompt lawsuits under federal and state anti-discrimination statutes.On a more meta level, Hollywood is also wrestling with a question that challenges its core identity: What is a film? No movie backed by Netflix \u2014 shown primarily on TV sets \u2014 has ever been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, but that could change this year with \u201cRoma,\u201d a black-and-white period drama directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n that has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics who have seen it at festivals. It arrives in a smattering of theaters on Nov. 21 and on Netflix on Dec. 14.But studios are mostly worn down from #MeToo fallout. They have become accustomed, for instance, to rolling public relations emergencies.\u201cEstablished protocols \u2014 decades worth \u2014 are changing at lightning speed,\u201d Ms. Baer said. \u201cFor people like me, who believe change is desperately needed in Hollywood, that is exciting. But a lot of people are lost in anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We were very lucky.\u201dNearly everything else about finishing the film, which debuted Thursday in select theaters and goes to Netflix on Dec. 7, has been a struggle that included extensive delays, surprise competition, talks with multiple directors, ownership changes and a distribution plan that was still in flux less than a month ago.By the time this latest version of the beloved Rudyard Kipling story hit screens, it was nearly seven years in the making. Serkis, for whom the film was supposed to be his big directorial debut, directed and released an entire other feature in the time he worked on \u201cMowgli.\u201d Chand, who was 10 at his casting, is now 14.Originally a Warner Bros. production, \u201cMowgli\u201d was conceived as a complex, big-budget hybrid of live-action photography and motion-capture animation, aimed at wide theatrical release. Reports surfaced in April 2012 that the studio was in talks with Steve Kloves, who wrote the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d screenplays, to write, direct and produce. (Kloves\u2019s daughter Callie Kloves eventually wrote it.)But by July 2013, the production encountered its first major setback: Disney announced it was making its own \u201cJungle Book\u201d hybrid. Jon Favreau (\u201cIron Man\u201d) was later named director.By December 2013, Warner Bros.\u2019 plans appeared to have changed. The studio was widely reported to be in talks with Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\u201cThe Revenant\u201d) to direct. A few months later, reports indicated that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was out and Ron Howard might be in.But the race with Disney was on. \u201cIt seemed like every time we announced a piece of casting, Disney announced a piece,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they were feeling the same thing: Who\u2019s going to get their film out first?\u201dSerkis said, \u201cOurs was never going to be a bring-the-whole-family film. We wanted to make it more visceral and have you be able to smell the jungle.\u201dSerkis assembled an impressive ensemble to record the voices, body movements and facial expressions of the characters, including Christian Bale as Bagheera the panther, Cate Blanchett as Kaa the python and Benedict Cumberbatch as Shere Khan the tiger. Serkis plays Baloo the bear.In part because of the hybrid animation\u2019s complexity, Serkis said he quickly realized that beating Disney would almost certainly not happen. Favreau\u2019s PG-rated \u201cJungle Book,\u201d which featured limited use of performance-capture technology, debuted in April 2016. It was a huge hit, and Warner Bros. decided to delay Serkis\u2019s film until fall 2018.The studio briefly brought in the director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (\u201cGravity\u201d) to explore a more family-friendly treatment of the material, but \u201cthat didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Serkis said. Serkis meanwhile acted in \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Last year, he made his directorial debut, but it wasn\u2019t \u201cMowgli.\u201d It was \u201cBreathe,\u201d a love story starring Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield.\u201cThere was a period of craziness,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cAt certain points I was editing both \u2018Breathe\u2019 and \u2018Jungle Book\u2019 at the same time. There were times when I was doing visual effects until 2 or 3 in the morning and then getting up at 5 to work on \u2018War for the Planet of the Apes.\u2019\u201dBut the setbacks weren\u2019t over. Serkis had almost completed his final cut on \u201cMowgli\u201d this summer when word came from Warner Bros. that \u201cMowgli\u201d had been sold to Netflix.\u201cOf course, I was shocked,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cIt was so out of the blue, and I had no prior reason to believe it was going to be anything but a Warner Bros. film.\u201dWarner Bros. declined to comment on the reasons for the sale. But the studio has seen expensive, effects-driven fantasies like \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cJack the Giant Slayer\u201d deliver undersized box-office returns in recent years. There was also, perhaps, the matter of perception.\u201cDisney\u2019s version of \u2018Jungle Book\u2019 was remarkably successful, beyond all expectations,\u201d said Pandya, of BoxOfficeGuru. \u201cAnything was going to pale in comparison to that.\u201dThe initial Netflix strategy, as it was announced in July, was to push the release until 2019, with undefined plans for a limited theatrical release. Early this month, Netflix changed the movie\u2019s course yet again, bumping the release to this year, to lead with a theatrical debut. It is unclear what prompted the change (Netflix declined to comment on its decision), but Serkis was pleased.\u201cI said, \u2018Look, this is a cinematic movie, and it deserves a cinema audience,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have absolutely honored that.\u201dThe vast majority of viewers, however, will see \u201cMowgli\u201d online. The film\u2019s star, Chand, a New York City native, said he was enthusiastic about the prospect.\u201cNetflix is the main way my generation consumes media,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal was to have this movie seen by as many people as possible, so it\u2019s great that Netflix bought it.\u201dAs for Serkis, he has moved on to other projects, including an adaptation of George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d that he is planning to produce and direct for Netflix.\u201cIt\u2019s in the early stages of development, so there are other films that will probably happen before it,\u201d said Serkis, sounding a bit world-weary from his long \u201cMowgli\u201d journey. \u201cIt\u2019s another talking-animals movie, so I need to do something else in between, for sure.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.On Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M. Solomon succeeded Mr. Blankfein as C.E.O. Mr. Blankfein, 64, has stayed on as senior chairman of the board through the end of this year. Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.On Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D. Cohn could have ever succeeded him as C.E.O., he was equivocal.\u201cI think his leaving coincided with a new administration,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t done him the favor of telling him when I was leaving at that point.\u201dAs to whether he would have done anything differently to help Goldman weather the financial crisis, he said more proactive public relations would have helped burnish the firm\u2019s image.\u201cOur mantra was our clients should have the exposure, not us. We\u2019re in the background,\u201d he said of the firm\u2019s approach to publicity in the pre-crisis years. \u201cThat hurt us a lot.\u201d\u2014 Kate KellyMaking a rare public appearanceThursday at the DealBook conference, the 47-year-old executive discussed the family\u2019s latest round of deal making and what it could mean for the family\u2019s other assets. In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.The sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201dThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.Fox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.Lachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone. It\u2019s to the coasts. But also everywhere in-between.\u201dHe cited figures that showed more Fox viewers are tuned to its sober news segments than the fiery opinion hours. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d he said.\u2014 Edmund LeePadma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement.But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one\u2019s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn\u2019t be driven by a man\u2019s being good at a certain job.It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience. The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.While Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.When asked if he was suggesting that social media should be regulated, Mr. Spiegel said only that there was much to learn from how Americans have thought about the responsibility of broadcasters in the past. The challenge, though, is identifying what, exactly, broadcasting is, he said.\u201cWe understand what one-on-one communication is, but let\u2019s say your Uncle Joe, for example, has some very extreme, maybe not so accurate, views on the world and he wants to reach 500 people. Is that OK? If he wants to reach 50,000 people, is that OK? If he wants to reach 100,000, is that OK? Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201dSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.The chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.As the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.That conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said that the company plans to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles in 2019, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market.\u201cWe\u2019re on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,\u201d Ms. Barra said, adding that the company had a strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, Ms. Barra said.She did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company has been testing in San Francisco.Autonomous vehicles rely on what Ms. Barra described as \u201ca suite of sensors,\u201d including radar, cameras and a technology known as lidar. G.M. is focused on advancements to lidar, which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds, she said.\u201cWe do believe in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced at the conference today that the company will be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year.\u201d That would be an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201dCost cutting will help. But Ms. Dubuc characterized the forthcoming changes as a way to become more efficient. \u201cWhen you have expansion everywhere, you\u2019re obviously going to have duplication everywhere too,\u201d she said.Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994 and has traded on its irreverent, brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, Vice now includes an advertising agency, a TV network, a film-production business and programs on HBO.Vice founder Shane Smith responded to the article by pledging a series of changes, including pay equity and reaching gender parity within the work force. In a statement, he said, \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201dMs. Dubuc praised Mr. Smith for his response.\u201cShane did a powerful thing and that was to take seriously the changes that needed to happen at Vice,\u201d she said, later adding that her being named aschief executive was an important signal for the company to send.\u201cI could have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d she said.\u2014 Edmund LeeFor someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.\u201cThese things are not black or white,\u201d he said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in New York.BlackRock has $6.5 trillion under management, giving it great influence over many of the world\u2019s top public companies. In a conversation that ranged from tariffs to bitcoin, Mr. Fink returned repeatedly to ideas about corporate accountability.\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny either,\u201d Mr. Fink said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dOther executives \u2014 including Mr. Dimon, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber \u2014 also dropped out of the event. Despite his refusal to attend what he called a \u201cvery public showcase\u201d of the kingdom\u2019s strengths, Mr. Fink said that BlackRock would continue to conduct business in Saudi Arabia, adding that he \u201cnever believed that decision would cost us all the business.\u201dBut he stressed that his attention to social responsibility is not a passing fad.\u201cI certainly never did this to be in vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re being asked.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuSteve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, concluded his presentation on Thursday with the results of a poll he recently helped run: 61 percent of the people surveyed cared about using researched facts to help form their opinions on policy, beating the 54 percent who said their values shaped their opinions.For Mr. Ballmer, that is central to a project he has been working on since he retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014 and has poured millions of dollars into: USAFacts, a nonpartisan database of federal, state and local government revenue and spending.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of four years trying to understand where government gets its revenue, where it spends its revenue,\u201d Mr. Ballmer told the audience on Thursday.In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr. Ballmer ran through some highlights of the types of data his website provides, hitting on hot-button issues in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Ballmer has called USAFacts \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual financial filings that companies make. In charts, Mr. Ballmer showed how he believes USAFacts can help Americans filter the increasingly convoluted noise.On immigration, for example, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States rose from about 10.5 million to 12.1 million in recent years, according to USAFacts\u2019 analysis of government data. The number of border agents has risen sharply from about 4,000 to 19,000 over the same period, while border apprehensions have decreased from roughly 1.7 million to 300,000, Mr. Ballmer said.The numbers raise natural questions, Mr. Ballmer said. Why are there more border agents today, fewer apprehensions, but more undocumented immigrants?\u2014 Mihir ZaveriDavid Gelles, Corner Office columnist at The New York Times, presented the findings of a DealBook conference task force on diversity in the workplace, characterizing it as a \u201creally lively discussion\u201d that could have gone on for hours. Nonetheless, \u201cwe made a remarkable amount of progress in an hour,\u201d he said.Among the conclusions of the report:\u2022 Aspirational goals are in general a good thing, but they\u2019re not enough, said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. Companies also need to be transparent in how they\u2019re achieving those goals. In addition, there can\u2019t be separate business and diversity scorecards \u2013 diversity needs to be part of the business.\u2022 Legislation and federal policies need to play a role. John Hope Bryant, founder and chief executive of Operation HOPE spoke about the need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships, and when the effort is especially aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get a double credit for that double reach,\u201d he said.\u2022 Companies have to realize diversity is a long-term goal, and it has to be baked into its culture. \u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it,\u201d it won\u2019t work, said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase. And everyone has to join the conversation, she said.\u2014Alina TugendRebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of New York Times, described the conversations of a DealBook conference task force, intended to establish guidelines on how to ethically implement A.I., as one of the \u201chighest level discussions she has ever seen\u201d about the technology.Among the conclusions of the panel:\u2022 Companies should take care to scrutinize their machine learning initiatives (and algorithms in general) for biases that may be passed on from their creators, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. These technologies should be developed with greater consideration for the public interest.\u2022 In New York City, when considering artificial intelligence in transportation, companies should be transparent with the data they use in order to ensure the technologies are a benefit to society, said Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer of the New York City Department of Transportation.\u2014 Mihir ZaveriA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the people shown.

{"Headline": "Apple Will Stop Revealing How Many iPhones It Sells. That\u2019s a Bad Sign.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has giant revenues, profit margins that are the envy of corporations everywhere and a stock market value of $1 trillion.Despite those obvious strengths, Apple told investors on Thursday that it would stop reporting numbers central to understanding the performance of its biggest business: selling iPhones.The company said it would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter. Without this data, investors will not be able to track the average selling price of iPhones, a crucial number for assessing whether consumers are balking at paying up for Apple\u2019s higher-priced phones.The decision, along with Apple\u2019s disappointing forecast for this quarter\u2019s sales, helped drive the company\u2019s stock price down more than 7 percent on Friday, a move that weighed on the wider stock market.Apple\u2019s move to cut back its disclosures also should serve as a jolt for all investors.For much of the year, investors seemed to ignore the warning signs hanging over large technology companies and pushed their stocks higher. Their plunge last month \u2014 Netflix\u2019s stock is down 26 percent from its high, and Amazon is off 19 percent \u2014 has most likely made investors more aware of the problems these companies face in their core businesses.But Apple\u2019s decision to make its iPhone sales less transparent may underscore the seriousness of these challenges. \u201cAn abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter,\u201d Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst for Nomura, wrote in a research note.Sales of iPhones have stalled in recent years. As a result, Apple has raised prices to bolster its iPhone revenue. The average selling price of an iPhone was $793 in the three months through September, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. Without the tally of phones sold, calculating the average selling price won\u2019t be possible, and outsiders will find it harder to gauge consumers\u2019 sensitivity to the price of iPhones. \u201cWe believe unit volumes and A.S.P.\u2019s are reflective of the loyalty and satisfaction consumers have in their devices,\u201d Mr. Kvaal wrote in his note, referring to average selling prices.Selling iPhones at a premium price to a relatively small portion of the global smartphone market has been at the heart of Apple\u2019s strategy. With less data, investors will probably find it harder to tell whether this approach remains successful.Other big technology companies have removed data from their regular financial reports. And some simply do not disclose figures that would be helpful in determining trends in their business. Twitter, for instance, does not provide the overall number of daily average users, a number that Facebook gives out.Facebook does not disclose Instagram\u2019s revenue, a number that would help investors understand the attraction of each platform to advertisers.Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, on Thursday contended that removing the data would not affect investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s performance. Over the last three years, he said, there was no correlation between price and the number of phones sold. And Apple said it would disclose new information, including the cost of sales for its two main businesses, called products (selling items like iPhones) and services (for instance, subscriptions to Apple music).But the new information may not make up for what\u2019s being taken away. Sales of iPhones accounted for nearly three-fifths of the company\u2019s revenue in its latest quarter. And the decision to stop providing iPhone sales comes at a pivotal time for smartphones. Sales of smartphones in more affluent countries are slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer. While sales are still growing in emerging markets, such as India, the handsets that dominate those markets are cheaper. So as the sales mix shifts to those countries, it could crimp profit margins.\u201cI think we\u2019re at peak smartphone,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, a tech sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix for Conservatives? Fox News Introduces Fox Nation, a Streaming App", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you have ever wondered about the culinary skills of a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host, wonder no longer. On the new show \u201cCooking With Steve Doocy,\u201d the pink-faced Fox News anchor makes chili with Dr. Oz, shares a kitchen with Kellyanne Conway and whips up stromboli with Anthony Scaramucci and his wife.\u201cSteve poured the wine!\u201d Mr. Scaramucci wrote in an email. \u201cIt was an awesome time.\u201dFox News viewers are fiercely loyal to their network. But will they pay to watch a \u201cFox & Friend\u201d work a griddle?That, in a gourmet nutshell, is the question for Fox Nation, the subscription-only streaming service \u2014 think Netflix for conservatives \u2014 that debuts on Tuesday and ushers the cable news business into a brave, uncertain new era.For $5.99 a month, viewers can purchase on-demand access to live political commentary and hundreds of hours of original programming from familiar Fox News faces. Another \u201cFox & Friend,\u201d Brian Kilmeade, has a history show called \u201cWhat Made America Great.\u201d Maria Bartiromo interviews Eric Trump for \u201cThe First Family.\u201d \u201cBorked\u201d covers the 1987 Supreme Court non-confirmation of Robert H. Bork.True-crime enthusiasts can opt for \u201cThe Fuhrman Diaries,\u201d in which famous cases are examined by Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective who was revealed as a racist during the O. J. Simpson trial.Fox Nation may be the id of Fox News, but it is also a potentially shrewd bet for the Murdoch family, which is testing the digital waters ahead of news rivals CNN and MSNBC.Networks like ESPN, CBS, and HBO have introduced stand-alone streaming apps as audiences move away from traditional TV. Lachlan Murdoch, who will oversee a reconstituted Fox empire after the company sells most of its entertainment assets to the Walt Disney Company, is ready to modernize. And Fox News, with juggernaut ratings and ad revenue, commands a devoted audience.\u201cWe have fans,\u201d said John Finley, the executive overseeing Fox Nation. \u201cOther news organizations simply have viewers.\u201dStill, every bet needs a hedge. Unlike HBO Now and CBS All Access, Fox Nation does not include any shows from the network\u2019s regular broadcast, and its news-side anchors, like Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith, are not participating. In an effort to make sure it does not sap the ratings of the prime-time shows, Fox Nation will end its live programming around 7 p.m., in time for viewers to switch to cable for Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.For now, Fox News is not divulging the number of subscribers who have signed on for Fox Nation, saying only that it was pleased by the initial response. About 70 percent of sign-ups came from a mobile device, Mr. Finley said, calling it a promising sign for the product\u2019s appeal to technologically adept consumers.About that: The median age of a Fox News viewer is 65, hardly the target audience for a streaming app. Even Mr. Kilmeade, in an interview last week, conceded that cable TV was becoming pass\u00e9 with a new generation.\u201cIt\u2019s scary, right?\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said, recalling that his college-age son was the only student in his dormitory with a cable subscription. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Dad, nobody\u2019s watching cable anymore.\u2019\u201dFox News, whose website has enormous traffic, is keen to point out that the median age of its TV viewers is a year younger than MSNBC\u2019s. The network also beats CNN and MSNBC in the coveted advertising demographic of 25- to 54-year-olds, although cable news viewership skews older over all.Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research, said Fox News should not be concerned about its older audience. \u201cMy mom\u2019s over 70, and she has a Roku,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThese devices are becoming so easy.\u201d But he faulted the network for wading, not diving, into the streaming sphere.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to take Fox News and offer it directly to consumers; they want to see if they can skim off the top some incremental dollars from cord-cutters,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cIf these companies had guts, it wouldn\u2019t be ESPN Plus, it would be ESPN. It wouldn\u2019t be Fox Nation, it\u2019d be Fox News.\u201dFor now, Fox Nation is being pitched as complementary content for Fox News \u201csuperfans,\u201d as the network likes to call them. \u201cThey\u2019re all in; they feel like they know you,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said.

{"Headline": "Why Oscar Season Is Crazy, Frustrating and Still Essential", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerWhen people find out that I\u2019m the new Carpetbagger columnist, tasked with covering Oscar season for The Times, they usually have two questions.\u201cWhy is it called the Carpetbagger?\u201d they\u2019ll ask.And, inevitably, it\u2019s followed by that old chestnut: \u201cDo the Oscars really matter anymore?\u201dThe answer to the first question might suggest why so many are tempted to ask the second. If you count yourself among the curious, let me explain.Sometimes, it was their first time working the beat, and this could produce a wonderful friction, since the Carpetbagger was liable to spot details or ask questions that a jaded industry reporter might not think of.I\u2019m the fourth Carpetbagger, but the first departure from this time-tested model. For one, I live in Los Angeles. (Still, I like to say that we\u2019ve retained the column name because now, as a Southern California native writing for The New York Times, I\u2019m carpetbagging in the opposite direction.)I\u2019m also no novice to the award-season beat, and that probably informs my answer to the second question, about the Oscars\u2019 relevance. As your new Carpetbagger, I\u2019m not going to spend these column inches pondering whether the Oscars continue to matter. I know they do, and from the start of my tenure here, I\u2019m going to tell you why.This isn\u2019t rah-rah boosterism: These awards can frustrate and often miss the mark, but that\u2019s why they remain so crucial. If the Oscar nominations provide a snapshot of that year in Hollywood, and Hollywood helps shape the way we see ourselves, then examining them can tell us not only where the industry is headed but also where our cultural blind spots still lie.Other movements, like #MeToo and TimesUp, reached a cultural tipping point in part because of narratives that arose during award season. Many people now wonder how the disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein was able to flourish in Hollywood for so long, given how many women he allegedly victimized (he has denied wrongdoing), but Weinstein constructed an ecosystem where the path to making an Oscar-worthy film almost always went through him, then leveraged that power in harrowing ways.But there are more granular Oscar-season details that can also reveal a lot about the way we think. Twice over the last four years, a situation arose where only one of the best actress nominees fronted a film nominated for best picture, while four of the best actor nominees hailed from movies contending for that top prize. This is an all-too-familiar trend for award watchers, and yet more proof that our culture has a tendency to take male-led stories more seriously, whether it\u2019s on the Oscar stage or elsewhere.Given all this, what can we divine about the state of Hollywood from how our current award season is shaping up? Quite a bit, and some of it is heartening.The streaming-service Netflix is also likely to make history this year in the pursuit of Oscar gold. The academy has limited the big N\u2019s influence in previous seasons, mostly recognizing the company in feature-documentary and documentary-short categories. Last year, the period drama \u201cMudbound\u201d was Netflix\u2019s big play, and while it failed to penetrate the best-picture lineup, it did crash the cinematography race, where Rachel Morrison was the first woman to score a nomination in that category.The irony is that this year\u2019s best picture winner has the potential to be the most widely seen in years. The front-runner, \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d is nearing a domestic gross of $200 million and would be the most successful winner since \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d (2003), while the likely nominee \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is the third-biggest film of all time at the American box office. (Even \u201cRoma,\u201d an art piece by any measure, can be watched in more than 100 million households thanks to Netflix.) We didn\u2019t need a popular-film Oscar. We just needed better popular films.Advertisement"}

She describes the highs and lows of her husband\u2019s eight years in office, like learning the gutting news of the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn., and how her husband summoned her to his side for comfort, something he rarely did during work hours, and the moment he told her that the mission to kill Osama bin Laden was successful.But as the first African-American first lady, Mrs. Obama\u2019s experience was far from typical, and she writes about feeling greater scrutiny than her predecessors.\u201cI was humbled and excited to be first lady, but not for one second did I think I\u2019d be sliding into some glamorous, easy role,\u201d she writes. \u201cNobody who has the words \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 attached to them ever would.\u201dShe describes wanting to protect her daughters from the glare of public life, and recounts her difficulties becoming pregnant and suffering a miscarriage. She reveals, for the first time, that Malia and Sasha were conceived through in vitro fertilization, and describes feeling resentful about administering shots to herself while her husband was away at his job in the state legislature: \u201cNone of this was his fault, but it wasn\u2019t equal, either,\u201d she writes.Despite some revealing passages and an intimate tone (she details her early courtship with Mr. Obama, describing a rush of \u201clust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder\u201d), Mrs. Obama, not surprisingly, doesn\u2019t let her guard down entirely, a protective posture that is consistent with her public persona.Toward the end of the book, Mrs. Obama takes aim at Mr. Trump, denouncing his policies and tenor in sweeping terms.\u201cI\u2019ve lain awake at night, fuming over what\u2019s come to pass.

{"Headline": "Five Things to Bring on Every Long Flight", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel tipsKeep yourself sane, snug, and distracted while you fly through the air with the greatest of ease.As an inveterate traveler, I fly multiple long flights a year. My personal longest was 17 hours from Johannesburg to Atlanta, but 10-12 hour flights are my norm. But then, I\u2019ve been on sub-5 hour flights with fellow passengers lamenting how it was \u201csuch a long flight.\u201d It\u2019s all relative. No matter your definition, there are two keys to making any long flight seem short: comfort and distraction. Here are five(ish) items to help pass the time and miles.Every major airline, and most of the smaller ones, have seat back entertainment. Generally these are of the on-demand variety, letting you choose from a variety of movies and TV episodes. But will they be the movies and TV shows you actually want to watch? You\u2019re probably better off bringing what you want. Netflix, Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, and others all have mobile apps that let you download content to watch offline. If you paid for the movie or episode, you shouldn\u2019t have an issue downloading it. If it\u2019s Netflix, or included with Amazon Prime streaming, there\u2019s no guarantee, though, and you should check well before your flight. You will not be able to stream anything from these services on the plane, even if you pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi. You\u2019ll probably have a hard time downloading at the airport too, so this is all something best done at home.Since you\u2019ll likely use your phone or tablet for a good chunk of the flight, you\u2019re going to need to keep it charged. Long-haul flights usually have an airline\u2019s oldest planes, so you can\u2019t be sure if there will be a power or charging outlet available at your seat.Noise canceling headphones reduce steady droning sounds like airplane engines. They\u2019re not a cone of silence, but can make flights can go from \u201cclamorous and tiring\u201d to \u201cloud, but tolerable.\u201d At least, the best ones can. For the past several years, I\u2019ve reviewed every major noise canceling headphone on the market, and even though there are dozens to choose from, the vast majority reduce very little actual noise.You could, if you want to go the really budget route, just use earplugs (which many airlines provide in amenity kits). However, those rely on getting a good seal between the plugs and your ear canals which, on some people (like myself), isn\u2019t easy. Plus, even if you get a good seal, the sound of an aircraft engine probably isn\u2019t going to be reduced as well as it would be with a good pair of noise canceling headphones.I\u2019ve never been on a flight that had a steady or predictable temperature. It\u2019s pretty much impossible, given the cold air outside, the humid, heat-producing mammals inside, and that pesky ball of fusion in the sky (or the lack thereof, depending on the time and weather). Layers are key. Some airlines will give you a threadbare blanket to \u201cwarm\u201d yourself if it gets really cold, but I\u2019ve never regretted bringing a hoodie or pullover. Worst case, it doubles as a pillow. I\u2019ve had good luck with Smartwool outer layers, but they\u2019re expensive and really anything easily removable will work here. I also tend to never wear shorts since I\u2019ve been cold on planes more regularly than I\u2019ve been hot, but you know your body best.Different parts of the plane will also have some effect on the temperature. Window seats are likely cooler than aisles, and exit rows cooler than all others.There is a massive market for in-flight comfort products. Most are pretty useless. For example, if you only fly once or twice a year, spending money on a travel pillow probably isn\u2019t worth it. Before you\u2019re tempted to spend money on things you\u2019ll use once or twice, consider saving that money for a seat upgrade.However, other things may be good to pack in your carry-on. Most airlines on long, overnight flights, will also give you a sleep mask and a small tube of moisturizer, both of which you might find handy to bring yourself if you have a mask or brand of lotion you prefer. Airplane air gets very dry, and even at night there are lights around the cabin you might find distracting.Usually you\u2019ll get a bottle of water for free, but if you\u2019re the thirsty type, bring an empty water bottle and fill it before you board. A snack won\u2019t hurt either; just keep in mind that many countries, especially smaller island types, won\u2019t let you enter with fresh fruit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesProject ahead a year or two: It is much easier to make a case for a troubled stock market than for a booming one.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.That abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201dI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201dGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.The stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201dMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.That last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.The stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.And that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.Yet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201dI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.The odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.If that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.But he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.After a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Her Face Droops Without Explanation. Can You Tell Us Why?", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.\u201cYou might have had a stroke,\u201d the doctor told the 44-year-old woman. \u201cThe right side of your face is paralyzed.\u201d Ann (who asked that we use an abbreviated version of her name to protect her privacy) nodded in agreement. It was, after all, why she had called for the appointment with her doctor just a couple of hours earlier.That morning she woke with the worst headache she ever had. It seemed to start at the back of her head and extend down her neck into her right shoulder. Her jaw \u2014 also on the right \u2014 had been painful off and on for the past three months, and it was worse than ever that morning. She called her dentist who had recently given her a mouth guard to wear at night. It wasn\u2019t working, she told the young woman who answered the phone. But as she tried to explain her symptoms, Ann\u2019s words sounded strangely slurred to her own ears.When she got off the phone, she hurried to the bathroom to see if she could figure out what was making her voice sound so odd. She hardly recognized the face she saw in the mirror. It was lopsided, asymmetric. The right side looked strangely flat as if all the air had been let out of the natural bulge of her cheek. The usual upward curve of her lip was gone and the corner of her mouth seemed to actually sag downward. She forced a smile and while the left side creased upward into a say-cheese kind of smile, the right side of her face didn\u2019t move at all.She called her doctor right away and made the appointment to see him that afternoon.For the past year, Ann felt as if she had been dealing with an overwhelming set of medical problems. Nearly 30 years earlier she developed diabetes but managed the disease by using an insulin pump. She had been a little too heavy when she was younger but lost most of her excess weight by eating better and exercising more often. But over all, she was healthy and happy until the year before when she developed a terrible burning pain and pressure in her throat and stomach any time she ate.She was diagnosed with heartburn, what doctors often call reflux, and a gastric ulcer. Her doctor gave her an acid-reducing medication, as well as one to protect her stomach lining called Carafate. A scope a few weeks later showed that the reflux and ulcer were better, but her pain remained. Recently, simply eating any solid foods became excruciating. And so, four months earlier, she put herself on a liquid diet. If she drank her meals, she felt less pain.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.But suddenly she developed a new pain. The right side of her jaw, just over the joint, began to feel stiff and achy. She wondered if her jaw muscles had weakened because she was not chewing her food. Or perhaps she was grinding her teeth at night. She called her dentist, who said that she was likely experiencing a problem with her Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and gave her a bite guard to wear when she slept. It didn\u2019t help. Still, at that point, the pain was intermittent, and she could put up with it.But over the course of the next few weeks the pain in her jaw grew more intense. It went from intermittent to constant and she felt as if it was affecting her ability to chew or even open her mouth.She finally went to see her dentist who examined her and said that her jaw seemed misaligned. He made impressions of her teeth and sent her to an oral surgeon. The surgeon agreed that her bite was a little off but didn\u2019t feel that anything needed to be done. (You can see one of the X-rays of her jaw here.)As Ann\u2019s jaw pain worsened, so did her headaches. And then she developed the strangest symptom of all. Every now and then her upper lip, on the right, would go flaccid. It didn\u2019t hurt \u2014 one of the few places on the right side of her head that didn\u2019t hurt \u2014 but it was strange and it sometimes made her speech sound a little funny. That was just a few weeks before the whole right side of her face did the same thing.Her doctor was worried as soon as he saw her asymmetric face. Most of the time, unilateral facial paralysis is caused by something known as Bell\u2019s palsy \u2014 a type of temporary paralysis of (usually) one side of the face caused by damage or trauma to the facial nerves.The facial nerve \u2014 also called the seventh cranial nerve \u2014 travels through a narrow, bony canal in the skull, just below the ear, to carry information to and from the spine to the muscles on either side of the face. For most of its journey, this nerve is encased in this bony shell.Each facial nerve directs the muscles on one side of the face, including those that control blinking and facial expressions such as smiling and frowning. The seventh cranial nerve is also in charge of the tearing of the eye (lacrimation) as well as the sense of taste. When Bell\u2019s palsy occurs, the function of the facial nerve is interrupted, and so the messaging between face and brain stops, resulting in facial weakness or paralysis.Current thinking within the medical community is that a viral infection such as an upper respiratory infection or the common cold sore virus \u2014 herpes simplex \u2014 is the most common cause of this kind of nerve injury. The viral infection causes the nerve to swell and press up against the bony canal, damaging the nerve or the fatty protective layer called myelin that surrounds it. Other possible causes of Bell\u2019s Palsy (named for Charles Bell, the 19th-century Scottish surgeon who first identified the facial nerve) include trauma, Lyme disease, tumors, high blood pressure, influenza or other upper-respiratory infections. Diabetes \u2014 which this patient had \u2014 is also an important risk factor for Bell\u2019s Palsy.On the other hand, her diabetes, although very well controlled, also increased her risk of having a stroke. Which was it? Her doctor wasn\u2019t sure. So, although the doctor thought Bell\u2019s was more likely, he wanted her to go to the hospital to make sure it wasn\u2019t anything else. (You can see her primary-care doctor\u2019s note here.)Ann drove herself to a nearby medical center. There was no reason for her not to drive \u2014 she got herself to the doctor\u2019s office an hour before. But as she drove, her right eye suddenly shut, and she couldn\u2019t open it. She could drive with only one eye open but it was unnerving not being able to open her eye. When she arrived at the emergency room, she went to the registration desk. While she was there, signing the needed documents, she felt as if she couldn\u2019t control her right hand. Her signature was shaky and strange. Her right leg felt weak as well. Someone helped her into a wheelchair and brought her back into the treatment area.Hearing the patient\u2019s story of progressive neurological symptoms that extended far beyond the face worried the doctors enough to have the patient admitted. A neurologist saw her in the emergency room. (You can see the notes from the E.R. here.) She was in the hospital for five days as her team looked for the cause of these strange symptoms.She had many tests. A CT scan of her head was unrevealing as was an M.R.I., so it wasn\u2019t a stroke or a tumor. A lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal tap) was performed and was normal, showing the cause of her symptoms wasn\u2019t an infection or some kind of malignancy. It wasn\u2019t Lyme, it wasn\u2019t myasthenia gravis; it wasn\u2019t multiple sclerosis; it wasn\u2019t Sjogren\u2019s. She wasn\u2019t pregnant. It wasn\u2019t H.I.V. or syphilis. Her inflammatory markers were in the normal range. So was her thyroid hormone level. (Many of the specific lab results can be found here.)What was really strange about Ann\u2019s case was that her symptoms would wax and wane. Her right eyelid would close. Then it would open again. Her face would droop \u2014 only on the right \u2014 and then it would go back to normal. Her doctors had many hypotheses about what might cause these unusual symptoms, but testing didn\u2019t support any of them. She was discharged from the hospital and told to follow up with a neurologist as an outpatient.She found a nearby neurologist, Adam Mednick. She brought in a timeline of her symptoms to help him see the full picture. (You can see Ann\u2019s timeline here.) Given the patient\u2019s waxing and waning symptoms, he thought that the most likely cause was a tear in one of the blood vessels going into the brain. When the inner lining of a blood vessel tears \u2014 something known as a dissection \u2014 the torn segment can flap back and forth, sometimes obstructing the flow of blood into the brain and sometimes leaving the vessel wide open. That kind of intermittent obstruction might account for her rapidly changing symptoms. He ordered an M.R. study with contrast to enhance the blood vessels to look for such an injury. He didn\u2019t find it. All of the major vessels going into her brain were fine.If not a dissection, the neurologist wondered if these changing symptoms could be from an atypical migraine. Ann had headaches, these strange palsies or episodes of paralysis, although they didn\u2019t always happen at the same time, which made it a little less likely that a migraine was the cause. Beyond that, he wasn\u2019t sure what she might have. But she was clinically stable, so he didn\u2019t feel like he absolutely had to treat these odd paralyses until he had a more definitive diagnosis. (You can read Mednick\u2019s thoughtful notes here.)Meanwhile, the patient continued to limit her diet to liquids. She saw a gastroenterologist who performed an endoscopy that showed that Ann\u2019s ulcer was gone, with only a small area of inflammation. A biopsy showed evidence of chronic reflux and the only abnormality found in this very thorough workup was that her gallbladder wasn\u2019t working as well as it should. Although the gastroenterologist didn\u2019t think this was the cause of the patient\u2019s abdominal pain, she referred Ann to a surgeon to remove the poorly functioning gallbladder. And since Ann had no symptoms or stones, surgery to remove the gallbladder seemed to her to be unnecessary so she didn\u2019t call.Because the patient had symptoms but normal studies, the gastroenterologist suspected that Ann\u2019s stomach and throat pain came from what is called a functional disorder. These are disorders that affect the way a body system works. Testing is normal; there is no structural or biochemical abnormality. But something about the way some system in the body works \u2014 in this case, the GI tract \u2014 causes the patient to have pain or discomfort.This is not a psychiatric diagnosis; it\u2019s not caused by stress, though, like many disorders, stress can make it worse. Our understanding of functional disorders is still inadequate. We basically have no idea why some people (nearly 25 million people in the United States) feel what they feel. These symptoms can disabling, however.And they can often be improved with low doses of an old class of medicines called tricyclic antidepressants. Although these drugs were originally used to treat psychiatric disorders, the doses needed to treat functional disorders is a tiny fraction of what is needed to have any effect at all on a psychiatric disease.To treat Ann\u2019s stomach pains, the gastroenterologist started her on a tiny dose of one of these medications, nortriptyline. It took some time, but the medicine seemed to help. After a month, the burning in her chest stopped. The sharp stabbing pains disappeared. Slowly Ann was able to add solid foods, one by one, back into her diet. At this point, she\u2019s able to eat a normal healthy diet and she has stopped losing weight. After a few months, Ann noticed that her joints didn\u2019t hurt as much, and her headaches became rare and manageable. Even her facial droop, Ann feels, is a little better since she started taking the nortriptyline.This medication has done so much more than either Ann or her gastroenterologist expected. As you can see, however, from the video, her facial droop remains a prominent symptom. (You can see the gastroenterologist\u2019s notes here.)Have you seen anything like this? Do you know what might be causing Ann\u2019s intermittent facial paralysis? Do you have any suggestions on how a definitive diagnosis can be made? If so, please let us know. Your suggestions will be shared with the patient, who will share them with her neurologist. Help us find an answer for Ann. Enter your comments below, and I\u2019ll let you know what happens in the case as it develops. Please briefly describe your thinking.

{"Headline": "How China Is Rewriting Its Own Script", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "\nWhen was the last time you watched a movie with a Chinese villain?If you can\u2019t remember, that may not be too surprising. Take the 2012 remake of the Cold War drama \u201cRed Dawn.\u201d It  depicted Chinese enemies invading an American town.In the end, MGM spent $1 million digitally erasing evidence of the Chinese Army, frame by frame, and substituting in North Koreans instead.China wields enormous influence over how it is depicted in the movies Americans make and watch. It\u2019s part of a broader push by the government to take control of its global narrative and present a friendlier, less menacing image of China to the world.China\u2019s booming box office and seemingly inexhaustible cash reserves have provided a much-needed boost to Hollywood as it faces slowing ticket sales in the United States and challenges from Amazon and Netflix.But Hollywood\u2019s embrace of China has not come without strings attached.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see something that\u2019s like \u2018Seven Years in Tibet\u2019 anymore,\u201d said Larry Shinagawa, a professor at Hawaii Tokai International College who specializes in Asian and Asian-American studies. Studios that make films critical of China, he said, risk being banned from releasing movies in the country.At stake for China is more than just the validation of Hollywood\u2019s powerbrokers and celebrities. In speeches and at forums, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well\u201d \u2014 to make sure a coherent, compelling and, most important, Communist Party-sanctioned narrative of China\u2019s rise to power reaches global audiences.\u201cThere is a notion that its propaganda has not worked well enough,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cSo this is where the film industry comes in. There\u2019s a real sensitivity to the blockbuster power of Hollywood.\u201dChina has raised its influence in Hollywood by bankrolling a growing number of top-tier films.Of the top 100 highest-grossing films worldwide each year from 1997 to 2013, China helped finance only 12 Hollywood movies:199719992000200520062007200820102012201319971999200020052006200720082010201220131997199920002005200620072008201020122013But in the five years that followed, China co-financed 41 top-grossing Hollywood films:201520162014201720182014201520162017201820142015201620172018Hollywood studios are also eager to grab a slice of China\u2019s fast-growing box office market, which surpassed the United States\u2019 in total revenue for the first time ever in the first quarter of 2018.Success in China can make up for a disappointing box office performance at home or even transform a hit into a global blockbuster. By the same token, getting shut out of the Chinese market can be devastating for a movie.That\u2019s a powerful incentive to avoid causing any offense to China.One of China\u2019s top movie regulators spelled it out in a speech at the U.S.-China Film Summit in Los Angeles in 2013.\u201cWe have a huge market, and we want to share it with you,\u201d said Zhang Xun, then the president of the state-owned China Film Co-Production Corporation, speaking to a room full of Hollywood executives.Then came the condition. \u201cWe want films that are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see positive Chinese images.\u201dChina\u2019s campaign to push a positive image abroad has extended beyond Hollywood.Since then, China has stepped away from the big-budget co-production model, focusing instead on making features that cater to its large and still-expanding domestic market. To do that, it has enlisted Hollywood talent \u2014  producers, technical experts and even top celebrities.But they have had to walk a fine line.A number of actors, musicians and other celebrities have been barred from entering the country over behavior deemed inappropriate or critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Here\u2019s why some of them were barred from China:The difference in the \u201cChinese perspective\u201d was most evident in CGTN\u2019s coverage this year of an unexpected proposal to abolish presidential term limits in China\u2019s Constitution. While Western news media outlets raced to explain why the amendment, which would open the door to President Xi\u2019s indefinite rule, was unprecedented, CGTN\u2019s anchors were calm \u2014 and eerily synchronized \u2014 in their message praising the change.It is difficult to tell whether China\u2019s push to soften its image through movies, media and cultural projects has been successful.\u201cChinese soft power has not been that successful outside of the developing world,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese society and cinema. \u201cIf China does have any soft power, it\u2019s probably because of the success of their economy and the Chinese model that they\u2019re pushing very hard now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Read what everyone else is saying and share your own thoughts in the comments section. Watch out for spoilers ahead.Daniel Fienberg\u2019s pre-air take acknowledged that the show struggles to get over the loss of Kevin Spacey, but he argues that the show is actually better now because of it. Clearly not a fan of Spacey\u2019s \u201chammy and increasingly dreadful lead performance,\u201d Fienberg admires the shift in focus to Claire Underwood: \u201cThe shift in focus from Frank to Claire Underwood finds the series somewhat reinvigorated through its first five new episodes. It\u2019s a change that comes far too late for the show to escape many of its worst narrative instincts, or a surplus of flat recurring characters, but for the first time in years, \u2018House of Cards\u2019 has something new and frequently interesting to say.\u201dJack Seale is dissatisfied with the final chapter of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d writing that Spacey\u2019s absence drains the show of strength and energy despite glimpses of what could have been if the writers had ever allowed the series to be truly driven by its female characters. \u201cEven the sex and murder is limp,\u201d he writes. \u201cNobody\u2019s relishing the transgression in the way Frank would. Season 6 is a web with no spider at the center.\u201dPatricia Puentes likes the final season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d so much that she wonders if it wouldn\u2019t have been better to jettison Frank Underwood sooner, ending her piece with hashtag suggestions for #RenewHoC or #ClaireDeservesHerOwnShow. In her spoiler-free review, she writes: \u201cAs influential a character as she\u2019s been all along, Claire\u2019s always been Frank\u2019s wife. Now she\u2019s just a strong individual, who also happens to be president, and it\u2019s a pleasure to watch her fight to be defined on her own terms, not Frank\u2019s.\u201dThe critic Tyler Coates admires Robin Wright\u2019s work and seems to think that the show could have survived without Spacey, but he laments a downward slide that says began happening before the controversy. \u201cThe overall quality of the show dipped dramatically when Willimon left after Season 4,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy now, the show feels limp, especially compared to the real-life political drama unfolding around us every day.\u201dHours after the full first season dropped on Friday, we dug into the season\u2019s central mystery surrounding of Frank\u2019s death, which the writers waited until the final scene of the entire season to reveal: \u201cRather than treat the subject of their fallen star directly in the premiere and then move on, as the writers of \u2018The Conners\u2019 did, the \u2018House of Cards\u2019 team all but keeps Spacey in the cast.\u201dBen Travers at IndieWire extrapolates his feelings about the final episodes of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d into a look at the entire business model at Netflix, which he argues is focused more on quantity than quality. \u201cThe final season doesn\u2019t feel like a final chapter; it feels like content,\u201d he writes. \u201cSure, Netflix executives can say \u2018House of Cards\u2019 is complete \u2014 to entice any new viewers who have been waiting to binge it all the way through \u2014 but the body of work feels more valuable than the work itself. Making original content is more important to Netflix than making great programming.\u201dTodd VanDerWerff admits he isn\u2019t a loyal fan of the series, but he tries to put himself in their shoes in his vicious pan of the final season. Comparing the final season to the notoriously loathed final stretch of \u201cDexter,\u201d VanDerWerff writes, \u201cI cannot imagine being a fan of the show, getting excited for the sixth and final season, watching Season 5\u2019s buildup to that sixth and final season, and then sitting down to watch and getting \u2026 this.\u201dBefore the show returned, Variety did a complete history of the drama surrounding Spacey\u2019s departure and how the show was saved from critical condition. The show\u2019s co-showrunner Melissa James Gibson offered a glimpse into how the program would use Frank Underwood, telling Variety\u2019s Debra Birnbaum, \u201cIt would have been absurd to deny the powerful existence and shadow of Francis Underwood, so all the rest of the characters have to navigate what went on with him prior to this season.\u201dOne of the questions that can never be completely answered is how \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d would have been different if Spacey hadn\u2019t been removed. Liz Shannon Miller came close. Her conversations with the show\u2019s cast and crew indicate that Season 6 would have been a power play for the White House between Claire and Frank. In Miller\u2019s feature, the co-showrunner Frank Pugliese says, \u201cEssentially at the end of Season 5 there\u2019s a promise Francis makes, that he\u2019s going to own the White House by owning Claire.\u201d He later adds: \u201cSo again, [in] Season 6 we knew that all these forces were trying to control her and own her. That seemed like something we wanted to explore and dramatize.\u201d\u201cWhat would the first female president wear?\u201d asks the Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman. Season 6 seems to provide some clues. \u201cThe show is as dark and twisted as ever, both in terms of plot and the corrupting psychology of power,\u201d Friedman writes, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a pretty convincing take on how the first Madam President might present herself.\u201dMichael Ausiello got Gibson and Pugliese to really discuss the final season, including what it felt like to scrap episodes that had already been shot and then start over. Pugliese tells him: \u201cWe had close to 11 episodes worked out and ready to go. It\u2019s hard to lose that. But the only response you can have is to be creative and tell the best story possible. So those 11 episodes became part of the process. You can\u2019t mourn too long.\u201dSandra Gonzalez spoke with a few of the stars of the final season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d including Robin Wright, Greg Kinnear, Diane Lane and Michael Kelly. Lane commented on the emphasis on women in the new season, saying: \u201cSometimes if we don\u2019t see the representation coming at us through the screen, we don\u2019t believe that we can project that going forward. It\u2019s interesting how that works, isn\u2019t it? We told the fairy tale, therefore you can dream that big.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Grief and Defiance, Arts Help Process 2015 Paris Attacks", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Three years to the day after he lived through the worst terrorist attack in France\u2019s modern history, Fred Dewilde and other survivors, neighbors and families of victims gathered on Tuesday for a subdued commemoration in the area of Paris hardest hit by the violence.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know each other, but we do understand each other and we\u2019re here for one another,\u201d said Mr. Dewilde, 51, who was at the Bataclan concert hall on Nov. 13, 2015, and attended the memorial held in a square nearby, where the crowd released balloons into the sky. \u201cWe\u2019re all citizens of the 13th.\u201dThat day, like Tuesday, dawned clear and warm for November, but after night fell, suicide bombers attacked France\u2019s largest stadium, armed men shot randomly at busy sidewalk bars and cafes, and three gunmen attacked the crowded Bataclan with Kalashnikov rifles; all told, they killed 130 people and wounded nearly 500.A spate of books, graphic novels, documentaries and exhibitions has emerged, as artists and their audiences try to capture and understand that terrible day.\u201cMemory is a puzzle,\u201d Mr. Peschanski said. After a traumatic event, whether people were in immediate danger or just watching on television, they instinctively want to \u201cfind the pieces of a puzzle,\u201d he said.Creative works are now filling in some of those gaps.They are personal, but also trace aspects of the attacks that many people will recognize \u2014 a body of art that also serves as shared testimony. In addition to the therapeutic value they have for victims and witnesses, the artistic endeavors, many of them open to interpretation, can help others understand what they and their society are going through.The ball brings nightmares, erases her memory of how to do her work and makes her cry easily. She feels distant from friends and family.She learns about her condition and accepts that she needs help, and gradually, the immense ball shrinks. By the book\u2019s end, she can hold it in her hand and says: \u201cOne day I will manage to throw that ball away and free myself.\u201dEven people who experienced traumas unrelated to the Paris attacks have told her they found solace in her work, she said.\u201cA father told me that he had lost his son and that after that he had cut himself off from those close to him because they did not understand,\u201d said Ms. Bertrand, 38. \u201cWhen he read my book it made him feel so good that he wrote to thank me. This is my most beautiful success.\u201dMr. Barraud, a former professional rugby player, was shot three times as he shielded his sister with his body. He nearly died, suffering injuries so severe that he was forced to end his playing career.For him, writing the book was a way to cope with the trauma, and to fill the void left by his sport.At the book\u2019s end, Mr. Dewilde\u2019s character vanquishes the dark stain and malevolent serpent, finding that he has the strength to leave them behind.While no one work can contain an event as vast as the Paris attacks, the documentary \u201cNovember 13: Attack on Paris\u201d by the award-winning filmmakers Jules and G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet manages to capture the day in its alternating normality, horror and heroism.As Paris natives who had made a documentary about the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, they were drawn to do the same for Paris.Their Nov. 13 documentary relies on eyewitnesses \u2014 victims who survived, firefighters, police officers and government officials, including the president at the time, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. They obtained contemporary footage from a television crew traveling with some of the firefighters who responded, and from the offices of the emergency dispatchers.The result is a remarkable three-part account that opens with the kind of postcard images of sunrise over Paris that are beloved by morning news shows, and moves through the day and night, intersplicing interviews with 42 people who were there.The main point is not to forget either the good or the bad, or to become too emotionally distant from what happened, G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet said.In New York, \u201cfirefighters, family, friends, the people who survived, they are extraordinary, their basic response was positive in the sense that they did not want to let what happened to them destroy them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same spirit in Paris.\u201dThe Naudet brothers were in Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, so their cameras captured the disaster as it unfolded.\u201cIn 9/11 you were there because we were there,\u201d said Jules Naudet. They did not witness the Paris attacks, but wanted the same immediacy, so they asked those they interviewed to speak in the first person and in the present tense.\u201cHere we wanted to recreate the same thing but without the images, with only being in the people\u2019s heads,\u201d Jules Naudet said.The Naudet brothers decided to show not only the horror and destruction of terrorism, but also the resilience they discovered in those who are touched by terrorism.\u201cNone of the survivors talk about hatred, revenge and killing,\u201d G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet said. \u201cYou have a choice: You go the dark way or you go the way with light.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Honea, announced late Monday that the death toll in the fire that incinerated the wooded community of Paradise in the northern Sierra had risen to 42.Emergency personnel were overwhelmed when the fast-moving flames raged into Paradise last week. Now they are overwhelmed in their effort to find the dead and identify them.Adding to the 13 coroner teams from across the state that are already working to locate the dead in and around Paradise, the sheriff announced a sharp increase in experts who specialize in finding human remains: 150 extra search-and-rescue personnel, cadaver dogs and two portable, temporary morgue units from the military. Sheriff Honea is also seeking to bring in a machine to \u201cexpedite the analysis of DNA\u201d to speed up the identification of remains.Search teams have found the remains of Paradise residents in cars, homes and outdoors. The sheriff on Monday identified three of the victims: Ernest Foss, 65; Jesus Fernandez, 48; and Carl Wiley, 77.\u201cMy sincere hope is that I don\u2019t have to come here each night and report a higher and higher number,\u201d Sheriff Honea said.Jim Broshears, the emergency operations center coordinator in Paradise and the town\u2019s former fire chief, seemed to dash those hopes.\u201cThe numbers of losses of life are probably going to go much higher, I fear,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Fires Coverage From Across the StateIn Other NewsYuval Noah Harari doesn\u2019t carry a phone, and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid.Is Silicon Valley undermining democracy and ushering in a dystopian hellscape?

{"Headline": "Satanic Temple Sues Over Goat-Headed Statue in \u2018Sabrina\u2019 Series", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Satanic Temple filed a lawsuit on Thursday against Warner Bros. and Netflix, alleging copyright violation of its goat-headed statue, which it says appears in the new \u201cSabrina\u201d series.In the lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs ask for at least $50 million for each alleged infraction: copyright infringement, trademark violation and injury to the business\u2019 reputation. They also request an injunction barring the companies from redistributing the series with the image of the statue. The temple argues that the television show not only copied its conception of the deity \u2014 a muscled figure with two young children staring up at it \u2014 but also that it gives the statue and the Satanic Temple itself a bad rap.\u201cThe reason the statue was commissioned was to be a symbol that they could bring out when they felt government wasn\u2019t separating church and state,\u201d said Bruce Lederman, the lawyer for the Satanic Temple.But in \u201cSabrina,\u201d the lawsuit argues, the statue is an evil symbol representing the show\u2019s antagonists. The statue sits at the center of the academy where Sabrina is sent to learn magic, and it is considered a homage to the \u201cDark Lord,\u201d whom Sabrina is fighting against.Mr. Lederman said the concern is that the next time the temple uses its statue to send a message about the separation of church and state, people may associate it with the television show instead.Warner Bros., which produced the show, declined to comment. Netflix referred questions to Warner Bros.The lawsuit argues, however, that \u201cSabrina\u201d copies particular details from the Satanic Temple\u2019s Baphomet statue that have not been reproduced elsewhere. For example, it argues that the appearance of the children staring up at the goat-headed deity is identical to what appears in the Netflix show.Lucien Greaves, a co-founder of the Satanic Temple, said designing and constructing the statue took over a year and cost about $100,000. Mr. Greaves said that the icon had become a sort of logo for Satanists and that it was distressing for him to watch it get swept up into the plot of a major television show.\u201cIt makes you feel that all the work you\u2019ve done can be totally eclipsed by this mega-giant media company,\u201d he said.On Twitter, Mr. Greaves compared the depictions on top of each other, with the show\u2019s image below.In an interview with VICE last month, Lisa Soper, the production designer for the show, said she thought the similarity between the statues was \u201ckind of a coincidence.\u201d She said hundreds of depictions of Baphomet existed, some with people surrounding him.Mr. Lederman said that depending on how the lawsuit progresses, one remedy for the situation could be editing the image of Baphomet out of the show.\u201cIt won\u2019t cure what\u2019s been done,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at least they should go back and change it in each of the scenes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Huxley Trap ", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow technology and masturbation tamed the sexual revolution.Opinion ColumnistThere are times in any columnist\u2019s life when you worry about being too much oneself, too on-brand, too likely to summon from one\u2019s readers the equivalent of the weary line delivered by a colleague listening to J.R.R. Tolkien read aloud from his Middle-earth sagas: \u201cNot another [expletive] elf!\u201dBut like Tolkien with his beloved elves, I\u2019ll persevere, because the articles are worth the recommendation. For Politico, Tim Alberta tells the story of how the internet essentially killed off the anti-pornography movement, by making pornography so ubiquitous and porn use so pervasive that trying to regulate it in any meaningful way seemed like giving orders to the tide.Then Kate Julian\u2019s Atlantic examination of what she calls the \u201csexual recession\u201d looks at a surprising reality of life in the sexually liberated West \u2014 the fact that despite (or because of?) our permissive culture and the sweeping availability of entertainments that cater to every kind of sexual desire, the sexual act itself has fallen somewhat out of fashion, along with its usual accompaniments (relationships, marriage, childbearing), while onanism and long-term celibacy are on the rise.What both writers are describing is a post-sexual revolution landscape that almost nobody expected \u2014 with one notable exception, to be discussed below.Conservatives didn\u2019t expect it because they believed that sexual liberation would inevitably lead to social chaos \u2014 that if you declared consent the only standard of sexual morality and encouraged young people to define fulfillment libidinally, you would get not only promiscuity but also a host of dire secondary consequences: Teen pregnancy rates and abortion rates rising together, a pornography-abetted spike in rape and sexual violence, higher crime rates among fatherless young men \u2026 basically everything that seemed to be happening in the 1970s and 1980s, when the anti-porn crusade Alberta describes was strongest.So the pornified, permissive post-sexual revolution order today seems much more stable than conservative pessimists expected 30 years ago, with no social collapse looming on the horizon.But liberal optimists were wrong as well \u2014 wrong to expect that the new order would bring about a clear increase in sexual fulfillment, wrong to anticipate a healthy integration of sexual desire and romantic attachment, wrong to assume that a happily egalitarian relationship between the sexes awaited once puritanism was rejected and repression cast aside.Instead we\u2019ve achieved social stability through, in part, the substitution of self-abuse for intercourse, the crowding-out of real-world interactions by virtual entertainment, and the growing alienation of the sexes from one another. (\u201cI\u2019m 33, I\u2019ve been dating forever, and, you know, women are better,\u201d one straight woman in Julian\u2019s story says. \u201cThey\u2019re just better.\u201d)This isn\u2019t the sex-positive utopia prophesied by Wilhelm Reich and Alex Comfort and eventually embraced by third-wave feminists. It\u2019s a realm of fleeting private pleasures and lasting social isolation, of social peace purchased through sterility, of virtual sex as the opiate of the otherwise sexually unsuccessful masses.And the one person who really saw it coming was Aldous Huxley in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the essential dystopia for our times, which captured the most important feature of late-modern social life \u2014 the way that libertinism, once a radically disruptive force, could be tamed, domesticated and used to stabilize society through the mediation of technology and drugs.True, none of our pharmaceuticals quite match his \u201csoma\u201d \u2014 the \u201cperfect drug,\u201d a booster calls it, with \u201call the advantages of Christianity and alcohol\u201d but no hangover or religious guilt. (Our own versions are more dangerous and unevenly distributed.) But our hedonic forms of virtual reality are catching up to his pornographic \u201cfeelies\u201d and his \u201cViolent Passion Surrogate.\u201d (\u201cAll the tonic effects of murdering Desdemona and being murdered by Othello, without any of the inconveniences.\u201d) And on the evidence of many internet-era social indicators, they increasingly play the same tranquilizing and stabilizing roles.Above all Huxley nailed the way that a society sufficiently far gone into hedonism will lose even the language to describe clearly why, say, \u201ca single-use silicone egg that men fill with lubricant and masturbate inside\u201d (a recent Japanese innovation mentioned by Julian) might not be a positive development.The people trying to argue against porn in Alberta\u2019s article, or the people struggling to articulate their sexual and romantic discontents in Julian\u2019s, are trying to find their way back to a worldview that takes moral virtue and human flourishing seriously again. But they inhabit a society that often recognizes only arguments about pleasure versus harm, and that at some level has internalized the logic of Mustapha Mond, one of the Controllers of Huxley\u2019s world civilization: \u201cChastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and neurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization. You can\u2019t have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.\u201dPleasant vices and stability: With some technological assistance, that\u2019s the sexual culture we\u2019ve been forging. The only good news, and the best evidence that we might yet escape Huxley\u2019s trap, is that we retain enough genuinely-human aspiration to be unhappy with it.Advertisement"}

He adjusted Mr. Huisman\u2019s grip, asking him to use only one finger on the back of the paddle.\u201cNobody ever told me,\u201d Mr. Huisman said, amazed.Mr. Suchy gave him a few more tips, because if Mr. Huisman is often a subtle actor, he is not a subtle player.\u201cTry not to slice so much,\u201d Mr. Suchy said. \u201cMore spin, more top.\u201dAnd a moment later, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t smash, spin.\u201dMr. Huisman took the advice.

The expanded Disney television empire will be overseen by incoming Fox executives.Ms. Dungey, who took over the struggling broadcast network in February 2016, will be replaced by Karey Burke, a programming executive at the youth-oriented cable network Freeform. Ms. Burke will become the fourth person in eight years to hold the title of president of ABC entertainment.Still, the decision to leave was Ms. Dungey\u2019s, and she will stay with the company for an unspecified amount of time to help with the transition.

I was there with my young daughter and son, and it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve contemplated what pop music could teach my kids about the United States.The Republicans added seats in the Senate but the results will no doubt lead to more pressure for the president and more open political conflict.House leaders have already signaled that they plan to use their subpoena power to demand more from Mr. Trump (including his tax returns) while the president has threatened that he would retaliate with investigations of his own.But before the battle gets going, let\u2019s take a breath and ask: What do the results tell us about the country on a deeper level?A few things to look at:All three of those developments point to an electorate with more people who have become more frustrated with President Trump, including many of those who voted for him two years ago.If the age trends hold, and with a bunch of the winners coming from the more moderate side of the Democratic Party, it may also mean a future with more consensus than we have now.Imagine that, an America united. I admit, I have a hard time picturing it.But if we look beyond the what-ifs and issues and ideology \u2014 if we really step back \u2014 maybe we can see something more illuminating.The results and the messiness of American democracy \u2014 with ridiculously long lines to vote, with far too many ways to cast ballots, with oodles of money sloshing around from billionaires \u2014 all spotlight the jumble of paradoxes that have shaped the United States since settlement.It\u2019s a country founded as a utopian \u201ccity on a hill\u201d \u2014 and defined by ruthlessness in capitalism and politics.It\u2019s a country where white nationalism is surging \u2014 and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is the year\u2019s top box-office earner.I could give you a dozen more of these with 10 minutes and a beer, but I don\u2019t live there anymore so I won\u2019t bore you with that.And really, Taylor Swift said it best. With just her guitar, playing in the middle of a giant stadium, with most of her big budget production taking a rest, she stripped down America to its essence:\u201cWe\u2019re happy free confused and lonely in the best way,\u201d she sang. \u201cIt\u2019s miserable and magical, oh yeah.\u201dNow for some other stories.

{"Headline": "Olivia Colman: Uneasy Lies the Head That Wears the Crowns", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Olivia Colman does not have a process. She is apologetic, since she understands that this makes for uninteresting conversation about the many fascinating characters she has played \u2014 most recently the imperious, needy, vulnerable, monstrous Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d for which she is hotly tipped as a best actress Academy Award nominee.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d she said, squirming slightly, during a recent interview at a London hotel. \u201cLet me think.\u201d She brightened up. \u201cI ate a lot to put on weight,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that count?\u201dThe spotlight is not where she likes to be. \u201cI hate the loss of anonymity,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one teaches you how to deal with that. I now just tend to stay home because it\u2019s so weird not to be on an equal footing with people. They know your face, and you don\u2019t know them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t lovely,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s harder to deal with than you imagine.\u201dColman is the most ordinary extraordinary person you have ever met. She is smiley, charming, apologizes frequently and plays down her talents at every opportunity. Her colleagues trip over their words trying to find enough adjectives to describe her likability, decency, kindness, her friendliness to the entire crew on any shoot, her lack of diva-dom. After several attempts at describing how much she adored Colman, Emma Stone \u2014 one of her co-stars in \u201cThe Favourite\u201d \u2014 gave up. \u201cYou can tell I\u2019m in love with her,\u201d she said. Rachel Weisz, her other co-star, described her as \u201ca proper delight \u2014 and with a very filthy sense of humor.\u201dShe also seems to have little vanity about how she is perceived. For the role of Queen Anne, where she is frequently shown in deliberately unflattering scenes, she put on 35 pounds without a murmur.\u201cI much prefer these sorts of roles because there is no pressure to be something you are not, and I am obviously not glamorous,\u201d Colman said. (In fact, in the wake of a photo shoot, she did look glamorous, dressed in a belted black dress, high heels and long earrings. \u201cI\u2019m more a jeans and sweater-with-something-spilled-on-it person,\u201d she said as she arrived.)\u201cFor Anne, I wasn\u2019t meant to look nice or be nice, and it was liberating and brilliant,\u201d she said. \u201cI find it more embarrassing to try to look good. I think I\u2019ve been fortunate to be cast in these roles, because it\u2019s very difficult for young women or men who are seen in one way, and then they are not allowed to age.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Lanthimos said that after seeing Colman\u2019s performance in \u201cTyrannosaur\u201d and working with her on \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d he couldn\u2019t think of anyone else to play Anne, and had shifted the schedule to accommodate her.\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have made the film without her,\u201d he said. \u201cThat role is quite difficult, quite complex. It needed a lot of different qualities from an actor, the ability to alternate between different states at different times. It has a lot to do with instinct. She reads the lines and goes to the right place without thinking about it too much.\u201dColman says she doesn\u2019t think about it at all. She hates rehearsal periods when actors and directors break down the script and motivation. \u201cFor me, when I really love a script, it\u2019s visceral,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why, but I feel it; I want to say those words, be that person.\u201dGrowing up in the city of Norwich, in the east of England, Colman said she dreamed of being an actor from a young age, but \u201cit was a secret dream, like talking to animals.\u201d Instead, she went to teacher training college in Cambridge, where she successfully auditioned for Footlights, an amateur dramatic club run by Cambridge University. There she met her future husband, Ed Sinclair (with whom she has three children), and followed him a year later to the Bristol Old Vic drama school.After graduating in 1999 she went to countless auditions and didn\u2019t get a single job for a year. \u201cMy mum had said, \u2018You\u2019ll probably give it a year.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I\u2019ll give it 10 years,\u2019\u201d Colman said, betraying a smattering of steely resolve. A trickle of bit parts followed. She worked as a secretary \u2014 \u201cnot a very good one, although I was cheery\u201d \u2014 and a cleaner. Although discouraged, she never thought of giving up. \u201cI never wanted to do anything else,\u201d she said. Then with sincere Colmanesque self-deprecation: \u201cAlso, I\u2019m no good at anything else.\u201dHer breakthrough came in 2003, when David Mitchell and Robert Webb, fellow actors at Footlights, asked her to play a central role in \u201cPeep Show,\u201d a series that developed a cult following over nine seasons. Her talent for deadpan comedy didn\u2019t go unnoticed, and Colman began to pick up bigger roles, mostly in sitcoms and comedies.That led to \u201cBroadchurch,\u201d and the role of Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller, one of the lead investigators (alongside David Tennant\u2019s Detective Inspector Hardy) in a search for the killer of an 11-year-old boy. The series was a huge success in Britain and abroad, and even though Tennant was the bigger name, Colman\u2019s portrayal of a woman enduring the harrowing personal consequences of the investigation made the series hers.Jodie Whittaker (\u201cDoctor Who\u201d), who played the bereaved mother Beth, Ellie\u2019s best friend, said that Colman was \u201cone of the only actors who can make you laugh and cry at the same time.\u201d\u201cShe brings such humor and vulnerability and playfulness to everything,\u201d she said.Colman has subsequently starred in several large-scale projects, notably \u201cThe Night Manager\u201d (for which she won a Golden Globe) and the coming BBC production of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d But the call from \u201cThe Crown\u201d still came as a shock, she said.Remembering the first meeting with the producers, she laughed. \u201cI was very uncool when I went to meet them,\u201d she said. \u201cI just said, \u2018Oh yes please,\u2019 and they were totally taken aback.\u201d The role of the young queen brought Foy a Golden Globe and an Emmy, among other awards, and international fame. It was hard to imagine filling her shoes, Colman said; her solution is not to think about it and \u201cjust plow on.\u201dBut her no-process approach had to be modified here, she admitted. \u201cThe research department is a massive operation,\u201d Colman explained. \u201cI absorb best through watching videos, and I\u2019ve spent hours and hours doing that.\u201d She has also spent a great deal of time with voice coaches perfecting the queen\u2019s voice and accent, and with a movement coach who has helped her master a particular posture and way of walking. \u201cI walk a bit like a farmer, not a queen, and I\u2019m not a very good physical impersonator,\u201d Colman said. \u201cSo there is a dollop of artistic license.\u201dShe made a series of impressively unregal grimaces, eyes widening, mouth pulling down, nose wrinkling. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said Englishly, \u201cdon\u2019t behave badly; they may not ask you back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prison Romances, Standing the Test of (Hard) Time and Cameras", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGarrett has a lot going for him, at least in the eyes of his girlfriend, Johnna. He\u2019s good looking and fit. He\u2019s romantic and attentive. In the minus column, he\u2019s a felon serving a seven-year sentence for grand theft, grand theft auto, credit card fraud, selling stolen property, drug possession and burglary. But did we mention he\u2019s romantic and attentive?Those last two attributes were more than enough for Johnna \u2014 and for the viewers of \u201cLove After Lockup,\u201d the WE TV show on which Garrett was one of the first-season stars.Equal parts dating show and slice-of-life documentary, \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d follows six couples \u2014 one con and one \u201cnon-con,\u201d in the shorthand of the producers \u2014 as they contemplate weddings and post-release living arrangements. The show was the fastest-growing new cable series for 2018 and returns for a second season on Dec. 7. In many ways, its popularity hinges on our seemingly bottomless fascination with all things prison-related, even as the couples themselves try to move on and put all of that jailhouse nonsense behind them.When \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d debuted last January, it entered a crowded field of prison-themed reality programs. Over the past decade, there have been shows about jails (\u201cJail,\u201d \u201c60 Days In\u201d) and county jails (\u201cLockup: County Jails\u201d); maximum security prisons (\u201cHard Time\u201d) and megajails (\u201cLouis Theroux: Miami Mega Jail\u201d); female inmates (\u201cGirls Incarcerated\u201d) and their kids (\u201cBorn Behind Bars\u201d); hardened lifers (\u201cLockdown\u201d) and newbie guards (\u201cBehind Bars: Rookie Year\u201d). \u201cLocked Up Abroad,\u201d on Nat Geo, is still going strong, 12 seasons in. Even MSNBC\u2019s \u201cLockup\u201d franchise, which ran for 25 seasons and spawned a half dozen spinoffs before being canceled in 2017, is ubiquitous on Netflix.The popularity of these shows, for both producers and viewers, isn\u2019t tough to figure out: They\u2019re cheap to produce (no expensive sets to build, or professional actors to pay), and promise both voyeuristic thrills (violent prison riots! Blurred-out body cavity searches!) and reassuring morality tales where no felon goes unpunished, and then some.Elizabeth Barfoot Christian, a professor of media and communication at Louisiana College who has written about prison reality shows, believes that many of them, like \u201cLouisiana Lockdown,\u201d which was set in nearby Angola Prison, feed into and even promote negative stereotypes about the incarcerated. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s no accident that that show was on \u2018Animal Planet,\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cLove After Lockup\u201d is part of this larger trend toward kinder, gentler prison shows, with its sympathetic cons and lovestruck non-cons. The focus on families and friendships over rap sheets has resonated with viewers. The show\u2019s target audience of women ages 25 to 54 nearly doubled over the course of the season; the series finale, \u201cPrison Cells to Wedding Bells,\u201d drew nearly 725,000 viewers.And at first glance, the show seems very similar to a batch of other prison-based relationship shows, like Lifetime\u2019s \u201cPrison Wives Club\u201d and Investigation Discovery\u2019s \u201cPrison Wives.\u201d But the show has one key attribute the others lack: On \u201cLove After Lockup,\u201d the inmates actually get out (or at least most do). And unlike other prison reality shows, which rarely leave the lockups and tend to focus on the most unsavory aspects of prison life, \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d is all about, well, love or what passes for it under extraordinary circumstances like these. Will Garrett still want to marry Johnna, once he\u2019s experienced the charms of Florida\u2019s strip clubs? Will Andrea\u2019s friends still support her after they discover that her fianc\u00e9 has been in prison for the past 18 years, not, as she has told them, in Canada?\u201cI think the couples are all very relatable,\u201d said Kate Farrell, one of the show\u2019s executive producers. \u201cThey have to work out how they\u2019re going to live together. They look at wedding dresses, and buy cars. But still, in the back of your mind you\u2019re thinking, this person was in prison for 18 years.\u201dThe series began life in 2016 at WE TV\u2019s annual \u201cpitch fest,\u201d a mandatory event in which company employees split up into 10-person teams and brainstorm ideas for new shows. The winning pitch featured elements of some of the biggest shows on WE TV, whose bread and butter are reality series aimed at women ages 25 to 54: unrealistic wives-to-be (\u201cBridezillas\u201d); unlikely couples (\u201cMarriage Boot Camp\u201d); and personal transformations (\u201cMama June: From Not to Hot\u201d).As with a lot of reality shows, \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d lives or dies with the cast. To assemble the six couples, the producers looked at online support groups (Facebook\u2019s \u201cPrison Wives of Florida Inmates\u201d) and Instagram hashtags. According to Farrell, they were looking for non-cons who had compelling stories, wanted to get married (like, now), and were currently dating incarcerated felons, but not excessively violent ones. \u201cNo murderers, no rapists,\u201d she said.The first season was marked by unwise acts (over a period of three years, Scott sends Lizzie, one of the show\u2019s two female inmates, $90,000, which she spends on meth and heroin, among other things) and threats from jealous lovers (\u201cI will hurt a chick,\u201d says Andrea, \u201cand I say that in the name of Jesus Christ, amen\u201d). There are questions from nosy friends (\u201cHas he hurt any children?\u201d) and inquisitive family members (\u201cHave you ever gotten shanked?\u201d).This season stars four new couples, as well as two couples from last season whose romances were stymied by delayed prison release dates. One of the newcomers, Caitlin, is a 32-year-old administrative assistant in Washington who falls in love with Matt, a 28-year-old inmate she met through a \u201cstrictly platonic\u201d Craigslist ad. Most of Caitlin\u2019s family doesn\u2019t know about her new beau, who\u2019s in prison for possession of a firearm, stolen property and eluding the police. And although their prison meetings were limited to four visits \u2014 albeit all-day ones \u2014 she doesn\u2019t see her relationship as all that different from other couples.\u201cWe dated,\u201d Caitlin said in a phone interview. \u201cMaybe not to society\u2019s norms. But we spent five months communicating day in and day out. We took time to get to know each other.\u201d\u201cI get that it might not look normal to everybody else,\u201d she conceded.And who says normal is necessarily all that great? Farrell points out that prisoners can spend more time wooing the person on the outside. \u201cThey have a lot of time to write letters. Whereas someone that you or I might date, who has a job and responsibilities, they\u2019re not sitting there going, oh, I think I\u2019ll write Kate a poem today.\u201dOne of the two returning non-cons is Angela, 45, who was stood up by her boyfriend Tony on his supposed release date at the end of the first season, which left Angela wondering if she had been played. That\u2019s another not-uncommon element of the show: For many prison couples, it\u2019s the partner on the outside who\u2019s sweating things out, hoping their lover on the inside is telling the truth. \u201cHe is a manipulator,\u201d Angela said by phone from her home in Mississippi.And yet, there\u2019s something about the guy that charms. \u201cOne of the sweetest things he ever sent me was a half dozen roses he made out of toilet tissue, and colored with Kool-Aid from prison,\u201d she said.In the end, the producers insist, the series is really all about love stories and second chances. \u201cSometimes you do something stupid and you get a bad break,\u201d said Marc Juris, president of WE TV. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a good person and you don\u2019t deserve love.\u201dAnd that sentiment is one reason the non-cons say that they sign up for a show like this. It\u2019s certainly not for all the abuse they receive on social media from strangers calling them idiots and losers and worse. \u201cI did not do the show for fame and fortune,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI did it because people who are incarcerated are so stigmatized by society. I had an opportunity to share my story on television, and let others know that, hey, it\u2019s O.K. to be in love with an inmate. They\u2019re people too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Founder\u2019s Big Idea to Revive BuzzFeed\u2019s Fortunes? A Merger With Rivals", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Supported byBut efforts to re-establish its fortunes have already begun. The company expects to surpass $300 million in revenue this year, the three people said. To get there, BuzzFeed now sells cookware at Walmart and accepts banner ads on its web pages. It runs a morning show on Twitter, a weekly one on Facebook and another on Netflix, all of which are paid for by the platforms. Its newsroom and its entertainment studio churn out thousands of videos and articles each week, to an audience of 690 million people every month. The company also gets a commission when a reader buys a product on Amazon or other commerce sites after clicking through from one of BuzzFeed\u2019s recommended product links, known as affiliate marketing. And on Monday, BuzzFeed News announced a membership model that provides exclusive access to newsletters and behind-the-scenes content for $5 a month. A $100 donation gets you a tote bag. (BuzzFeed\u2019s website will remain free.)\u201cYou have Vice and Vox Media and Group Nine and Refinery,\u201d Mr. Peretti said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of them that are doing interesting work.\u201d He extolled the logic of combining forces: A larger entity could lobby for a higher percentage of the ad dollars Facebook and Google share with publishers whenever their content, videos in particular, runs on the platforms. In turn, publishers can supply them with content that is safe for users and friendlier for advertisers.\u201cHaving some bigger companies that actually care about the quality of the content feels like something that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said. Though initial discussions involving a few companies have taken place, they were all very preliminary, according to five people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. BuzzFeed has spoken to at least one other company, while other publishers have had separate discussions, these people said. Mr. Peretti declined to name which companies he has talked to regarding any potential mergers. Any deal would be difficult to pull off given the number of investors involved and the compounding losses that would result from combining several money-losing start-ups. Staff cuts would be inevitable.Still, publishers have been getting squeezed by the tech platforms as online advertising rates continue to level off. \u201cIf BuzzFeed and five of the other biggest companies were combined into a bigger digital media company, you would probably be able to get paid more money,\u201d he said. A natural camaraderie exists among the digital publishers, which could make a potential partnership more palatable, said Benjamin Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my competition is BuzzFeed or Vox or Vice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe compete on a day-to-day basis for business, but the ultimate competition here is us against traditional TV and also protecting ourselves against the big platforms.\u201dMr. Lerer and Mr. Peretti have been friends for over a decade, and Mr. Lerer\u2019s father, the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer, is the chairman of BuzzFeed. He also sits on the board of Group Nine. But the younger Mr. Lerer stressed that any business deal between the two would not include his father to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201cConsolidation in digital media is something that is going to happen,\u201d he added.Money for a merger wouldn\u2019t be an issue, according to Mr. Peretti. The sticking points would center on who would run a combined entity as well as how each business would be valued in a merger. The combined valuation of the companies Mr. Peretti mentioned exceeds $7 billion.Other publishing executives acknowledged the seeming inevitability of consolidation. \u201cWe\u2019ll always consider ways to better serve our audiences and strategically grow our business through building, partnering and acquisition,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media. Philippe von Borries, a co-chief executive of Refinery29, said that in the next year or so there might be \u201can opportunity for the leading media and entertainment companies that emerged over the past decade to come together,\u201d provided all parties could settle on a shared culture and vision.Vice Media did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Peretti, 44, started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a kind of experimental project while working at The Huffington Post, an early giant of web publishing that he founded with Arianna Huffington and Kenneth Lerer. In many ways it was a return to his first media obsession: what makes something go viral. In 2001, while a graduate student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, Mr. Peretti got in a heated email exchange with customer service representatives at Nike. The company allowed buyers to customize their shoes with a word or phrase. Mr. Peretti chose \u201csweatshop.\u201dThe request was denied. Mr. Peretti insisted \u201csweatshop\u201d had not violated Nike\u2019s criteria, but the company wouldn\u2019t fulfill his order. He forwarded the email thread to several friends who sent it on to several others. It eventually reached millions of people. Mr. Peretti ended up appearing on the \u201cToday\u201d show debating labor issues with a Nike executive.The story has become the stuff of internet lore, but it also represents the heart of BuzzFeed. The early chat bot became a website, which led to original content and then the formation of a newsroom, which now boasts a huge monthly audience.As BuzzFeed\u2019s audience has grown, so has the diversity of its content. Hard-hitting investigative journalism lives alongside listicles, quizzes and cooking videos.\u201cBuzzFeed has always been very experimental,\u201d he said. The ethos that led to its viral content and mining of memes to explain the day\u2019s news is now being applied on the business side, he said, \u201cto consider commerce and advertising and even donations.\u201dThe company is positioning its membership model as a way of supporting its journalism, despite being a for-profit company. BuzzFeed had experimented this year by soliciting donations from readers for its news division. The high level of interest spurred the creation of memberships, which sound similar to fund-raising drives by nonprofits like PBS.Last year, native advertising slowed down considerably, so BuzzFeed started accepting banner ads. After President Trump was elected, a lot of brands didn\u2019t know what they wanted to say, Mr. Peretti said.\u201cSome of them got scared to say anything because everything seemed polarized,\u201d he said. That prompted the move to accept traditional ad formats.This year, BuzzFeed started selling cookware based on the popularity of its Tasty cooking videos. The company licensed the name to a manufacturer that sells the branded pots and pans at Walmart, a deal worth more than $20 million to BuzzFeed, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Making sure the business can thrive is important to Mr. Peretti, even if it comes in the form of bakeware and banner ads.At a staff meeting in Los Angeles a few years ago, someone asked Mr. Peretti what he would do if he won the lottery.He responded: \u201cI already won the lottery when we sold HuffPost to AOL. After that, I went out and bought a Honda Odyssey.\u201dMr. Peretti acknowledges the anecdote but said it shouldn\u2019t be characterized to mean he doesn\u2019t care about money, or its importance to BuzzFeed.\u201cA company that doesn\u2019t generate money isn\u2019t a company that gets to do very much,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, money is a means to an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweden\u2019s Push to Get Rid of Cash Has Some Saying, \u2018Not So Fast\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "Cash is disappearing in the country faster than anyone thought it would. Now, officials are trying to slow its demise as they determine the societal costs.Supported by\u201cWhen you are where we are, it would be wrong to sit back with our arms crossed, doing nothing, and then just take note of the fact that cash has disappeared,\u201d said Stefan Ingves, the governor of Sweden\u2019s central bank, known as the Riksbank. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn back time, but you do have to find a way to deal with change.\u201dConsumer groups say the shift leaves many retirees \u2014 a third of all Swedes are 55 or older \u2014 as well as some immigrants and people with disabilities at a disadvantage. They cannot easily gain access to electronic means for some goods and transactions, and rely on banks and their customer service.And the progress toward a cashless society could upend the state\u2019s centuries-old role as sovereign guarantor. If cash disappears, commercial banks would wield greater control.Among 18- to 24-year-olds, the numbers are startling: Up to 95 percent of their purchases are with a debit card or a smartphone app called Swish, a payment system set up by Sweden\u2019s biggest banks.Ikea, whose flat-box furniture is a staple of young households, has been experimenting to gauge the allure and effect of cashless commerce. In Gavle, about 100 miles north of Stockholm, managers decided to go cashless temporarily last month after they realized that fewer than 1 percent of shoppers used cash \u2014 and Ikea employees were spending about 15 percent of their time handling, counting and storing money.Patric Burstein, a senior manager, said the cashless test had freed employees to work on the sales floor. So far, around 1.2 of every 1,000 customers have been unable to pay with anything but cash \u2014 and mainly in the cafeteria, where people tend to spend change. Rather than bother with bills, Ikea has been offering those customers freebies.\u201cWe said, \u2018If you want a 50 cent hot dog, be my guest, take it. But next time maybe you can bring a card,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Burstein, who is 38.The test so far suggests that cash is not essential and, instead, may be costly, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of resources on a very small percentage that actually need the service,\u201d he said.The nearby branch of the Swedish National Pensioners Organization has led protests against the experiment, in part, because many retirees like to go to the Gavle Ikea for a bite to eat.\u201cWe have around one million people who aren\u2019t comfortable using the computer, iPads or iPhones for banking,\u201d said Christina Tallberg, 75, the group\u2019s national president. \u201cWe aren\u2019t against the digital movement, but we think it\u2019s going a bit too fast.\u201dThe organization has been raising money to teach retirees how to pay electronically, but, paradoxically, that good effort has been tripped up by an abundance of cash. When collections for training are taken in rural areas \u2014 and the seniors donate in cash \u2014 the pensioner in charge must drive miles to find a bank that will actually take the money, Ms. Tallberg said. About half of Sweden\u2019s 1,400 bank branches no longer accept cash deposits.\u201cIt\u2019s more or less impossible, because the banks refuse to take cash,\u201d she said.Banks have propelled the cashless revolution by encouraging consumers and retailers to use debit and credit cards, which yields banks and credit card companies lucrative fees. That includes the bank-developed Swish smartphone app.Sweden\u2019s banks have cut back on cash in part for safety reasons after a rash of violent robberies in the mid-2000s. The national psyche is marked by an infamous helicopter heist in Vastberga in 2009, when thieves landed on the roof of a G4S cash service depot and stole millions \u2014 a drama now being turned into a Netflix film. Last year, only two banks were robbed, compared with 210 in 2008.In recent years, banks have dismantled cash machines by the hundreds. So little cash is used now that it has become expensive to track and maintain, said Leif Trogen, an official at the Swedish Bankers\u2019 Association.There are two proposals by the Swedish authorities to keep cash at hand. Parliament wants just the biggest banks to handle cash. The central bank is holding out for all banks to keep money flowing. Swedbank, SEB and other big Swedish financial institutions are fighting the lawmakers\u2019 demands, saying it would place an undue burden on them to provide greater access.\u201cThe demand for cash is decreasing at an ever faster pace,\u201d Mr. Trogen said. \u201cTherefore, it is fundamentally wrong to legislate to influence the demand for cash.\u201dChristine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noted last week that several central banks were \u201cseriously considering\u201d digital currencies. \u201cWhile the case for digital currency is not universal, we should investigate it further \u2014 seriously, carefully and creatively,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of an official at the Swedish Bankers\u2019 Association.

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s \u2018Hollowed Out\u2019 Politics, Explained", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 83______What does it all add up to?So what do you make of the week\u2019s head-spinning political developments? They say history happens slowly and then all at once. I think the convulsions we are seeing in Australian politics right now \u2014 in fact , since John Howard was defeated in 2007 \u2014 are a culmination of decades-long trends that center on the slow decline of our two big political parties.The more popular explanations \u2014 the acceleration of the news cycle, the social media information bubble, the rise of populism \u2014 may play a part, but the big factor is the transformation of our political parties from mass movements to professionalized and hollowed-out political machines.This is a common phenomenon in Western democracies. With party membership (and union membership) in decline, both major parties lack a real social base, a group of people that defines who the party represents and what it stands for.The two major parties remain powerful because they have engineered the political and electoral system to their benefit, but that arrangement is now straining against the decline in their vote share.Right now, it is the Liberals who are suffering, but Labor has had its turn and it will have another.One headline I saw called Australian politics \u201cfractured.\u201d How would you describe it?I would say hollowed out. There\u2019s a void at the center of our politics because the public and the political class have both retreated. Again, this is happening in all Western democracies: people have stopped joining political parties and civic organizations with a political voice, and the parties have responded by making politics more elite and professional.For most Australians, politics these days is a spectator sport rather than a participatory sport.And the trend is self-reinforcing \u2014 when a major scandal now breaks, the public distrust in politics is so severe that often the first instinct of politicians is not to address it themselves but to call a Royal Commission.The prospects for independent candidates and small parties are better than ever. At the last federal election, nearly 25 percent of voters gave their primary vote to an independent or small party, and that figure is on a slow upward trend as the primary vote of the two major parties declines.I know the conventional wisdom right now is for a thumping Labor victory at the next election, but remember that Labor has won only one federal election outright in the last 20 years.I would not be at all shocked to see Labor form a minority government after the next election because dissatisfaction with the government will benefit independents and minor parties rather than Labor.In fact, minority government might be the new norm in Australian federal politics.That\u2019s not necessarily a disaster \u2014 Julia Gillard would argue with some justification that the minority government she led got an awful lot done, and many Western democracies function perfectly well that way.The question will be how the major parties behave as they decline. Can they adjust to this new norm?I\u2019m sure Julie Bishop has a point, but the fault does not lie only with politicians. The public needs to take its share of the blame, too. If you feel strongly that politicians are not trustworthy, then muck in. Get involved and change things!Unfortunately, however, I don\u2019t think the cynicism about politicians actually motivates the public to get involved. In fact, it may just reinforce the retreat I talked about.Now, for the most part, that has not been terribly damaging \u2014 O.K., politics is hollowed out and Australians are deeply cynical, but by global standards the place is still pretty well run, and economically we are in enviable shape.The risk is that politics becomes so broken that the voters, who are largely disengaged, are more or less forced to intervene to fix things.That\u2019s what happened in the U.K. with Brexit. Britain\u2019s relationship with the E.U. was a white-hot political issue within the Tories, but it\u2019s not as if the British public was clamoring for a vote on that subject. It was only because the Tories could not solve their internal dispute that it was \u201cexternalized.\u201d Essentially, the Tory leadership said to the public: \u201cWe can\u2019t fix this \u2014 you sort it out!\u201dThe expectation, of course, was that the public was just as invested in Britain\u2019s European future as the vast majority of the political class was. That turned out to be dead wrong.What might that look like in Australia? Is there an Australian Brexit on the horizon?Well, in a sense this has already happened. The Liberal Party was hopelessly split on the question of same-sex marriage, so it called on the public to intervene.If you\u2019re looking for a more direct parallel with Brexit, well, what about immigration, which was a key issue in the Brexit campaign? Australia\u2019s commitment to high levels of immigration is pretty well entrenched across the two major parties, but in the past leaders of both parties have flirted with the argument that Australia is \u201cfull.\u201dIf one of the two big parties went to an election on that kind of platform \u2014 not just a cut in migration but a sustained policy of zero net population increase \u2014 Australia would effectively be faced with a referendum on immigration.And a vote like that would be a proxy for some pretty fundamental issues of Australian identity and our place in the region.Now for news and features of the week from around the world ...______It\u2019s another fascinating sign that the \u201cisms\u201d of the 20th century have been stripped of idealism in favor of raw power and networking. This is our new era, resembling many of old.Also big news from China: ______Climate change is complicated, and there\u2019s no shame in asking questions. In fact, we encourage it.Bonus Read: ______Then he proceeds to tear down that argument, which was spurred on, of course, by Australian morning TV and a question about spanking.Extra credit: ______Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not all we do.

But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre\u2019s precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either.Putting Douglas in the role of a silver-haired Hollywood Lothario (his hair is fantastic) who chose integrity over stardom can be seen as a clever bit of casting, both for and against type. The real (unintentional) twist, though, is having him play an acting coach who pushes his students to be honest onstage \u2014 given that Douglas, in his highly successful career, has consistently given closed-off, impenetrable performances.The one really notable exception was his relaxed, completely convincing portrayal of the middle-aged writing teacher Grady Tripp in \u201cWonder Boys\u201d (2000), and the scrambling, half-principled Sandy is a little like Grady 20 years down the road, without tenure. Douglas is clearly comfortable with Sandy, and his performance is amiable and easy to like. But it\u2019s not much more than that: As a showrunner and writer, Lorre (who gets full or partial writing credit on all eight episodes) hasn\u2019t done anything to raise Douglas\u2019s game.What he has given him are platitudes and attitudes, the outline of a well-meaning Peter Pan confronting mortality and isolation without the substance. A sitcom character, in other words. You could argue that this is the point: As Sandy skirts financial ruin and vacillates over his relationship to an \u201cage-appropriate\u201d woman (played by Nancy Travis, 17 years younger than Douglas), Norman frequently calls him out on his shallowness.But those observations aren\u2019t insights so much as obligatory comic beats. Moving into single-camera naturalism, Lorre carries with him the structures and comic sensibilities of the multicamera network sitcom \u2014 he just slows the pace, stretching out the setups, and ratchets down the jokes, as if explosive laughs would be unseemly in these quieter surroundings.And while the bromance of Sandy and Norman is the heart of the show, the masculinity-in-moth-balls atmosphere can be overpowering. If you\u2019re a man who hasn\u2019t heard of retrograde ejaculation, you\u2019ll Google to see if it\u2019s a real thing, after which you\u2019ll feel a little sick to your stomach.Particularly egregious is the treatment of Norman\u2019s daughter, a pill-popping head case played by Lisa Edelstein who shows up for a few episodes to vex her poor father and is completely forgotten once she is dropped off at rehab.Norman, who experiences a tragic early loss and grows progressively morose and antisocial, is a bum part. But Arkin, still bringing sharp wit to aggravation and aggrievement, is the best thing about \u201cThe Kominsky Method,\u201d even when the writing takes Norman into kvetching \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d territory. If you have to listen to someone complain about the modern world (\u201cSkype \u2014 what a stupid word\u201d), it might as well be him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Narcos: Mexico\u2019 Premiere: \u2018It Doesn\u2019t Have a Happy Ending\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNarcos\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story. But I\u2019ll be honest. It doesn\u2019t have a happy ending.\u201dThat\u2019s the first line of narration from the season premiere of Netflix\u2019s \u201cNarcos: Mexico,\u201d which dropped today. The \u201cNarcos\u201d franchise, now in its fourth season, has never been about endings. It has always asked that its viewers come along for the ride, even while the basic plot details are well-known. After all, it is based on historical events, complete with regular splicings of television news clips.The first two seasons of the show focused on Pablo Escobar, the former kingpin in charge of the Medellin cartel in Colombia. But it started with Escobar already in power, rather than with his beginnings. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of history knew that Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout in the 1990s. But the show was compelling regardless, mostly because of the simultaneous humanity and depravity Wagner Moura brought in spades to portraying Escobar. Moura, much like James Gandolfini and Bryan Cranston, was able to force the audience to catch itself in often rooting for a complex monster.In Season 3, \u201cNarcos\u201d surpassed expectations in a post-Escobar universe, shifting focus to the Cali cartel that filled the vacuum left behind by Escobar\u2019s death: Its four charismatic leaders were equally monstrous, but they had more flair. It helped that Pedro Pascal\u2019s Javier Pe\u00f1a was a compelling leading man, whose frustration with the drug war becomes more evident with each passing episode.Now, Pe\u00f1a is gone, probably having a drink somewhere and blurring legal lines. (O.K., technically, he\u2019s probably training to be in law enforcement since the show now takes place in the 1980s.) Instead, \u201cNarcos: Mexico\u201d tracks the beginning of the Guadalajara cartel, which went on to become one of the post powerful in the world. The season is a battle of the soul for two ambitious, young operatives on the opposite ends of the drug war: Kiki Camarena (Michael Pe\u00f1a), a real-life Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is looking to climb the ladder and isn\u2019t afraid of shaking things up to do so. On the other side is Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo, played by Diego Luna. He is a former law enforcement agent, now looking to become a drug kingpin himself, even though he is not taken particularly seriously where he is currently, the Mexican state of Sinaloa.Camarena and Gallardo are presented symmetrically in this table-setting episode. Camarena arrives in Guadalajara from Fresno, Calif., because he was passed over for a transfer to Miami. \u201cIf I stay here, my career is just going to die,\u201d he tells his pregnant wife, Mika (Alyssa Diaz). Gallardo comes to the city from Sinaloa, which the Mexican government has invaded and has burned the fields where marijuana is grown. \u201cWe\u2019re nobodies here,\u201d Gallardo tells Don Neto (Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo). He wants to expand their boss\u2019s footprint in Guadalajara, but really, the writing on the wall is clear: Both Camarena and Gallardo have bigger plans for themselves. They both also have loving significant others who support those plans. They\u2019ll clash. And it\u2019s likely Gallardo wins.Both seem like men who want to kick beehives rather than stick to the status quo. Gallardo does it as soon as he arrives, executing a brash plan to assassinate one of the Naranjo brothers and set his plan into motion. He also possesses a superior product to anything the Naranjos were selling: a strain of marijuana that is easier to transport.And Camarena, while seeming eager to do what the team needs of him, already expresses surprise to his superiors at how toothless the D.E.A. seems to be. When he is told by his new boss that Guadalajara is more of a \u201cdata gathering assignment\u201d than Camarena is probably used to, he responds, \u201cLike a neighborhood watch.\u201d Later in the episode, at a local bar, he tells a corrupt officer that there is blood on his shoes \u2014 a local kingpin on the C.I.A.\u2019s payroll, whom we\u2019ve just seen executing the second Naranjo brother in the scene before.Moments later, Camarena has a wry smile on his face. He has no intention of being a glorified bystander.Looking Ahead:\u2022 In many respects, \u201cNarcos: Mexico\u201d is very much like its previous iterations. Corrupt policemen, seeming good guys who bend the rules, gratuitous violence, criminals killing other criminals: That\u2019s the \u201cNarcos\u201d style. It\u2019s also still too early to know whether Pe\u00f1a and Luna will be able to bring enough distinctive charm for the show to recapture what the first three seasons did without its feeling like a repeat. The visuals remain top notch, but the action scenes seem \u2026 well, we\u2019ve been here before right? If you\u2019re looking for a show that grows and surprises the audience, \u201cNarcos: Mexico\u201d is not that show.\u2022 But it\u2019s early still! I\u2019ll circle back on this and other questions when I recap the rest of the season, once you\u2019ve all had a little time to watch the rest of the episodes.

Sabrina, \u201cthat cute little witch,\u201d who first showed up in a 1962 humor anthology \u201cArchie\u2019s Madhouse,\u201d , is another.Archie wasn\u2019t really made for boys like Aguirre-Sacasa. Born in Washington, D.C., to Nicaraguan parents, Aguirre-Sacasa knew he was gay early on and, until recently, the Archie universe was pretty much all white and definitely all straight.But the comics showed him a place, he said, \u201cwhere everyone was basically nice and everyone was basically friends and everyone would go and have hamburgers every night and everyone would go to dances.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be friends with them,\u201d he said.Now he is.After college at Georgetown and an M.A. in English at McGill University and a brief stint as a journalist (\u201cBecause Clark Kent was a reporter,\u201d he said), he enrolled in the playwriting program at the Yale School of Drama. Just as he was graduating from Yale, Marvel Comics recruited him; his first issues appeared in 2004.About a decade ago he began pivoting away from theater and toward television, writing first for \u201cBig Love\u201d and then for \u201cGlee.\u201d While he was at \u201cGlee,\u201d he met Jon Goldwater, the head of Archie Comics and proposed a crossover issue, in which the Archie characters would meet the cast of \u201cGlee.\u201d (To sweeten the deal he sent Goldwater a picture of his Halloween costume: Archie.) Under Goldwater\u2019s watch, he oversaw titles like \u201cArchie vs. Predator\u201d and \u201cAfterlife With Archie.\u201dHis first attempt at creating a show, a \u201cBride of Frankenstein\u201d project, didn\u2019t sell. But as he was becoming Archie\u2019s chief creative officer, he teamed up with the producer Greg Berlanti (who\u2019s responsible for much of the CW\u2019s schedule including \u201cSupergirl\u201d and \u201cArrow,\u201d and who previously wrote for \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cEverwood\u201d), and his partner Sarah Schechter, and they put together \u201cRiverdale.\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa described the updated story of the Archie gang as a mix of \u201cOur Town,\u201d \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d Hitchcock and grindhouse. He\u2019d first envisioned the Sabrina character as a fun way to close out a season, but then he realized she could be her own show.\u201cHe just genuinely is bursting with stories to tell,\u201d Berlanti said.And yet, by throwing in just about everything he\u2019s ever loved \u2014 comics and teen soaps and great books and slasher films \u2014 and hitting the button for frapp\u00e9, Aguirre-Sacasa has made something original: shows that are sexy and smart, story-drunk and story-driven, pointedly inclusive. Unlike the comics he read as a kid, these are worlds where everyone \u2014 boy, girl, nonbinary, gay, straight, questioning, jock, brain, burnout \u2014 belongs. Well, everyone who is preternaturally gorgeous and Algonquin-Round-Table quippy.The day began at the \u201cRiverdale\u201d stages in a sprawling warehouse, a 45-minute drive from downtown Vancouver. In the parking lot, behind razor wire, was the set for Pop\u2019s Chock\u2019lit Shoppe, with real cakes glistening in the display case. Inside, a humidifier diffused a scent of root beer and pine and there were posters recruiting for an upcoming softball game against the \u201cSabrina\u201d team. (\u201cRiverdale\u201d would win, 16-9.)His cultural knowledge is encyclopedic in a World Book, shelf-buckling way. (\u201cI don\u2019t distinguish between higher art and low art,\u201d he would tell me, unnecessarily.) Toning the episode, \u201cThe Man in Black,\u201d he started with a Simpsons reference, then moved to \u201cOn the Road,\u201d \u201cDracula,\u201d and the recent remake of \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d Stephen King came up, Steven Soderbergh and Ingmar Bergman, too, plus \u201cCasino,\u201d \u201cDouble Indemnity,\u201d \u201cShock Corridor,\u201d the original \u201cSuspiria,\u201d Edgar Allan Poe, \u201cDays of Heaven,\u201d \u201cThe Nun,\u201d \u201cThe Seventh Seal\u201d and the crusading journalism of Nellie Bly.The meeting took maybe two hours. At one point, Aguirre-Sacasa paused to take a call from a \u201cRiverdale\u201d actor who was asking if he could leave his shirt on during an upcoming scene. (The answer was yes.) His ardor, which can skew grandiose (\u201cIt\u2019s the fight for Archie\u2019s soul!\u201d), never flagged and I lost count of how many times he used the words mythical, classic, iconic, iconographic, archetypical.It wasn\u2019t all fanboy exuberance. When Pillai suggested a nifty practical effect, Aguirre-Sacasa vetoed it. He agreed that it would look cool, but he felt it pushed the episode out of realism and into fantasy. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to ground it,\u201d he said.Then it was a three minute drive over to the \u201cSabrina\u201d set, where Shipka, outfitted in a flowing rose-gold wig, was starring in her witch school\u2019s passion play. The passion was Lucifer\u2019s and the school auditorium was lit with open flames.We moved to the wardrobe department, where bolts of sequins and tulle crouched on shelves near a tidy maze of suits, shimmering gowns and schoolgirl chic. One whole rack bulged with timber wolf pelts. Real ones.A little while later, the cast, dressed in sweatshirts, ceremonial cloaks and Gucci shoes with insect clasps, trooped upstairs for a table read of \u201cLupercalia,\u201d an episode for the second season. Someone coughed and Aguirre-Sacasa called for Purell. As the cast read the script aloud, he occasionally tapped at his laptop, which his husband, the production stage manager Barclay Stiff, had outfitted with keyboard stickers: a Spider-Man on the S, a Joker on the J, \u201cSHAZAM!\u201d for return. He laughed as loud as anyone, maybe louder.Aguirre-Sacasa, who is convinced that Riverview is haunted, arrived after dark and didn\u2019t leave until after midnight, which wasn\u2019t especially late. Not like the time he left that \u201cSabrina\u201d graveyard shoot at 4:30 a.m. and frogs attacked him on the way to the car. \u201cIt did feel like a scene out of a horror movie,\u201d he said delightedly. Expect to see it repurposed in some later script.His fanboy soul, his open heart, his until-the-wheels-fall-off zeal, they\u2019re felt everywhere, from the bonkers chandeliers in the headmaster\u2019s office (dragons grip the bulbs in their talons) to the friendly way the \u201cRiverdale\u201d cast mingles off-camera with one another, and with him.Aguirre-Sacasa has built these worlds and he\u2019s welcomed all of us \u2014 actors, writers, gaffers, teen viewers and viewers of good middle-age \u2014 to enjoy them as much as he does. Every episode is an open invitation to share a hamburger, to crash a school dance. That dance might end with the discovery of a corpse. But still.I asked him why he was so attracted to these coming-of-age stories and he said he\u2019d never really put together that they were coming-of-age stories. He said maybe it was because adolescence is something everyone goes through or maybe it was a way to hang on to his own youth or maybe because the stories of those adolescent Archie characters were the first stories he really loved.Then he gave a good middle age answer: \u201cI will definitely have to talk to my therapist about it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the comic Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa oversaw. It is \u201cArchie vs. Predator,\u201d not \u201cArchie Meets Predator.\u201d It also misidentified one of the shows that the producer Greg Berlanti wrote for. It is \u201cEverwood,\u201d not \u201cFelicity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\n          ADVERTISEMENT\n          \n        What does it mean to be digital? Think back to a decade or two ago. It meant being on the web. Then it meant adopting new shiny IT. No more. Digital is a way of doing business. Its being innovative. Quick. Adaptive. Busting hierarchies. Using technology to drive change--and profits.But how well do companies harness and profit from \u201cbeing digital\u201d?  More successful companies bear similar hallmarks: they define digital as a way of doing business, they have a mindset that embraces innovation they work with, less bureaucratic decision-making, and they put experience high on the priority list. They\u2019re transcending a product or service and becoming an experience, a name that rolls off the tongue, according to research from PwC\u2019s decade-plus research on Digital IQ. What makes the 8% great?What separates the companies\u2014across  industries and countries\u2014that are financial superstars from the rest?  For starters, top performers have embraced a forward-looking definition of digital. They are twice as likely their lower-performing peers to define digital as a reflection of a mindset that embraces constant innovation, less-bureaucratic decision-making, and the integration of technology, as a tool that helps everyone work smarter. They\u2019ve long since blown through the murky, discovery stage\u2014unlike their peers whose definition of digital is much more likely to center on technology and IT.  Sound like the company you work for? Probably not. But, there\u2019s a path to success and the 8% can show the way.It\u2019s the combination of these crucial elements that lead to much more than just financial success for companies in the 8%. They\u2019re doing what we all want to: creating and delivering better products and services, fostering happier, more savvy employees, wowing customers, really getting tech right--for the company, for employees, for customers--and living a way of working that makes it happen.Silos or synthesis?If you knew you needed to transport your entire workforce across the continent, you wouldn\u2019t build an airplane off in a side building, at one-tenth the scale you need, a side project delegated to a handful of people who \u2018get\u2019  or just want to \u201cexperiment\u201d with planes. Yet, that\u2019s exactly what many companies do with digital\u2014silo a small project off in the corner in the form of an innovation group or a digital subset, forgotten on another floor or another P&L statement and not a part of overall strategy or success of the company. Who runs that digital thing? Oh, right, that guy. We should invite him to a meeting now and then. Sound familiar?Top-performing companies are far more likely to involve the executives responsible for executing on digital strategies in their higher-level corporate strategy efforts at twice the rate of their less-successful peers\u2014although only about half explicitly incorporate digital strategy into overall corporate strategy. Digital capabilities are the single-most driver of top-line growth\u2014and failure to include digital executives in strategy expresses a commitment to failure.  Digital is everythingTop performers are putting their money where their mouth\u2014and strategy\u2014sits. A full 59% of top performers are investing 10% or more of their revenue in digital efforts\u2014and one-in-six of them are investing 20%-to-25%.  Compare that to their less successful peers: just 29% are investing at least 10% in their digital efforts, according to PwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ survey. And they are more likely to see those investments pay off more than expected off in critical areas. Among them: creating better customer experiences, innovating products and improving talent retention and recruitment\u2014key elements of taking a company from a product-and-service world into a platform that ascends want and turns into need. That, in turn, is translating into better profits, better decision making, enhanced brand and bigger cost savings.Leaders or laggards at the top?High organizational digital IQ flows from the top, with senior leaders modeling the skills and behaviors they need from the digital workforce. While there\u2019s no difference between top performers and the rest when it comes to having a CEO that champions digital (72% say they do), there\u2019s a gap in know-how: 54% of top-performers say their leadership is digitally savvy and helps the workforce think in new ways, according to PwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ survey. That leaves plenty of room for improvement, but compared with just 41% of less successful peers, it\u2019s a world of difference.  Even digitally-savvy Apple struggled to meet customers\u2019 desire for in-store tech-enabled but still-human human experiences. It looked outside to help transform its stores into thriving town squares under the aegis of Angela Ahrendts\u2014the former Burberry CEO who\u2019d restored that brand\u2019s luxury roots with strategic cuts to anything creating noise around the brand.It\u2019s that incremental disruption that can be a company-killer. Imagine if Netflix had ignored the burgeoning fascination with streaming and insisted on sticking with mail-and-return movie rentals, or dismissed the idea of owned content as a fad and stuck with movie streaming. A full 64% of top financial performers do view disruption as a serious threat; only 27% of posers say the same, according to PwC\u2019s 2018 Digital IQ survey. That belief guides digital investment and prioritization as well as strategy and workforce upskilling.Top performers are more than twice as likely to expect their digital investments to help combat disruption or help them disrupt their own or other industries. And they are finding success in doing so. Being digital isn\u2019t something extra. It\u2019s not a nice to have. It\u2019s now. It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s having a mindset that embraces constant innovation. It\u2019s flatter, data-guided decision making. It\u2019s developing a workforce and culture that hones the types of skills and behaviors that speed innovation and bolster experience. The companies that have embraced this \u201cit\u2019s all digital\u201d approach offer a roadmap of sorts for those who are playing catch up. It\u2019s not too late to take control and win in the digital world. The hallmarks of a truly digital company help drive results.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Hear It (Quickly) for the Half-Hour Drama", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe new Amazon drama \u201cHomecoming\u201d has a lot going for it. Julia Roberts in her first starring TV role. Bravura directing from Sam Esmail of \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d A top-notch supporting cast, taut writing and a mind-bending military-corporate thriller plot.With today\u2019s expansive TV drama installments typically running an hour (or more), each episode of \u201cHomecoming\u201d felt like a gift certificate for 30 extra minutes of sweet, unencumbered life. Thirty more minutes to work, to sleep or \u2014 why not? \u2014 watch a second episode.They were no less captivating for being short. They may have even been better.Somewhere in its history, TV formalized the idea that drama is a marathon and comedy a sprint. Network schedules established sitcoms at 30 minutes, with commercials; dramas \u2014 with early exceptions like most seasons of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d \u2014 settled in at 60.Only a hypocrite would praise the short installment at great length. So I\u2019ll be brief.First, short dramas are just practical. One could argue that only a TV critic frets about episode length: It\u2019s a first-world problem in a first-world job. But look, I\u2019m paid to do this. I\u2019ve got plenty of time.People with actual productive jobs, on the other hand, have ever more TV to fit in their limited free time. Epic drama means greater investment: You have to put in six or eight hours to get to the point where, your friends swear to you, \u201cOzark\u201d really gets good. (It doesn\u2019t. Saved you a day.)Short dramas are economical. Longer series have to serve a bigger roster of characters, spinning off subplots for each. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is an hour; the portion I want to follow any given week is maybe 20 minutes.\u201cHomecoming,\u201d likewise, has two timelines but one story. There isn\u2019t A, B, C and D plot, nor should there be; it would distract from the thriller\u2019s stage-like technique of building suspense through conversation.The half-hour drama also reflects where the real creative energy is in TV today. Some of the best work is happening in half-hour hybrids \u2014 \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cBetter Things,\u201d \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cBarry,\u201d to name a few \u2014 that are \u201ccomedies\u201d for awards purposes but half drama, or more, in substance.Then there\u2019s rhythm and velocity. Bingeing a lengthy drama can feel like sinking into quicksand; I\u2019m not so much absorbing the story as it absorbs me. I start to feel like my immobility itself is the product: my butt on a couch, adding hours logged to some clicking meter in a media company\u2019s accounting office.When a series like Netflix\u2019s pharmacological head trip \u201cManiac\u201d switches up with a 26-minute episode, it underlines the sense of play and unpredictability in the storytelling itself. It\u2019s bracing; it\u2019s a changeup; it\u2019s narrative syncopation.Of course, neither is \u201cshorter is better\u201d an absolute rule. Wasted time is the problem rather than time itself, and there is certainly value to series like \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d that take advantage of the silent frame and the extended pause, allowing momentum to build and detail to accrete in such a way that, though their episodes might run past the usual length, they appear to fly by in a fraction of the usual time.But since when does length equal seriousness? \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d? \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d? \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d? Short, short, short! Pithiness is power.I\u2019d say more, but I have screeners to watch. At heart, TV\u2019s time crunch is a tribute to how the medium has become worth our time. All the more reason to appreciate the shows that recognize that we don\u2019t have all the time in the world.Advertisement"}

A lively winter tradition grows even brighter this year, as Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, during its annual New York City Center season, celebrates its 60th anniversary. Starting with the season-opening gala on Nov. 28, nearly every program will begin with \u201cBecoming Ailey,\u201d a multimedia ode to the company\u2019s founder. Nov. 30 brings the premiere of \u201cLazarus\u201d by the brilliant hip-hop choreographer Rennie Harris. The two-act work explores the persistence of racial inequities in America, from 1958, when Ailey, surmounting those hurdles, established his company, until today.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna do some love songs,\u201d said Syd, the singer of the Internet, during a Los Angeles music festival this month. Contemporary R&B\u2019s most exciting band challenges expectations with its stripped-down sound and hip presentation, but its lyrics and lush backing vocals could hardly be more classic. The group\u2019s unhurried tempos recall the slow-jam heyday of the \u201980s \u2014 but with a beach breeze and a drag of California-legal smoke instead of satin sheets and rose petals.On Friday, Nov. 30, at Hammerstein Ballroom, attendees can expect songs that are understated and deceptively simple; the Los Angeles-bred group\u2019s remarkable technical facility is employed in a mission of making deeply felt, soulful music, not flaunted for its own sake. The overall effect is unabashedly seductive, a welcome result for its swooning audiences.\u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d which he wrote and directed with his longtime collaborator Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Estienne, fills in those bare outlines with the story of a man named Mavuso (Hiran Abeysekera), who killed his father for having sex with his own daughter. Though she is Mavuso\u2019s sister, he too is attracted to her, and she to him. To quote Madonna, \u201cPower is being told you\u2019re not loved and not being destroyed by it.\u201d And Agatha Raisin \u2014 M.C. Beaton\u2019s London publicist turned Cotswolds sleuth, played by the delightfully irrepressible Ashley Jensen (\u201cCatastrophe,\u201d \u201cUgly Betty\u201d) \u2014 has just made it her mantra.In \u201cAgatha Raisin and the Wizard of Evesham,\u201d the first of three Season 2 movies on Acorn TV, Agatha has left her heart in Cyprus and rejoined the mischief makers of Carsely Village, where dead bodies lurk beyond the hedgerows with frightening frequency. Then a bad hair day leads Agatha to a hunky new stylist who has a way with women, especially lonely ones with bulging bank accounts. And soon the cobblestones are awash in blackmail, arson and murder, with Agatha naturally in the thick of it.The materials list for Peter Halley\u2019s seven-and-a-half-foot-tall 2002 painting \u201cEmulation,\u201d one of ten in \u201cUnseen Paintings: 1997-2002\u201d at Sperone Westwater Gallery in Manhattan, includes \u201cfluorescent acrylic, pearlescent acrylic and Roll-a-Tex,\u201d and the canvas\u2019s layout evokes a psychedelic circuit board. In \u201cHappy as Lazzaro,\u201d Alice Rohrwacher travels back into a not-so-distant Italy where an extended family of farmers \u2014 like something out of Bruegel\u2019s \u201cThe Harvesters,\u201d save for the Walkman \u2014 toils in the tobacco fields of an absentee noblewoman known as the Cigarette Queen. Lazzaro (Adriano Tardiolo), a saintly teenager, bears the brunt of the work with blissful acceptance, undertaking tasks that no one else wants. Then the queen arrives for a rare visit, bringing along her unhappy son, Tancredi (Luca Chikovani). Everyone exploits someone, she explains to him: she, by failing to inform the workers that sharecropping was outlawed years earlier; the workers, by unloading their unwanted tasks on Lazzaro. Tancredi suggests that Lazzaro exploits no one, before then enlisting his help in plotting Tancredi\u2019s own kidnapping.At that point, \u201cHappy as Lazzaro\u201d is propelled into the present, a fable of biblical proportion set amid a decaying Italy \u2014 and requiring a leap of faith. Rohrwacher won for best screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival this year but lost out to Matteo Garrone\u2019s \u201cDogman\u201d as Italy\u2019s Oscar submission for best foreign-language film.Advertisement"}

I am filling in this week for Ian Austen on the Canada Letter.There were at least five illegal outlets within five minutes of my hotel downtown. Some were signposted with lurid lights outside. Others looked more like sterile drugstores or hipster cafes, only instead of cough syrup or lattes, they were selling cannabis-infused face creams, potent marijuana concentrates and jelly treats.When a senior City Hall official told me Vancouver had more black market marijuana dispensaries than Starbucks outlets, I was skeptical. But a marijuana dispensary crawl across the city and a call to Starbucks soon revealed that she was right.The coffee chain had 50 outlets in the city of Vancouver. There are roughly twice as many illegal pot retailers.But the opposite seems to have happened.Shortages aside, the illegal trade remains as resilient as it is defiant.Ms. Emery, who grew up in British Columbia and was convicted in 2017 of trafficking marijuana, told me the black market was here to stay, since there was neither political nor public will for a crackdown. Even if the authorities came to close down her stores, she said she would merely reopen them.As it is, she has already been served with an injunction, and said her criminal record made it all but impossible for her to get a legal license.Others marijuana retailers like Jessika Villano, owner of Buddha Barn in the bohemian neighborhood of Kitsilano, welcomed legalization, saying they were tired of living in fear of being shut down.Ms. Villano told me she opened her health store about five years ago after seeing how the cannabis cakes she baked for her mother helped her emphysema. She has paid $7,500 to apply for a provincial license and $30,000 for a municipal license, and has turned over three years of financial records to the government.She has also rebranded her shop, since operating a medical marijuana retail operation is officially illegal. But as of Friday, the provincial authorities had still not granted her license.

So why do the digital elite adore him so?Supported byThe futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari worries about a lot.He worries that Silicon Valley is undermining democracy and ushering in a dystopian hellscape in which voting is obsolete.He worries that by creating powerful influence machines to control billions of minds, the big tech companies are destroying the idea of a sovereign individual with free will.He worries that because the technological revolution\u2019s work requires so few laborers, Silicon Valley is creating a tiny ruling class and a teeming, furious \u201cuseless class.\u201dBut lately, Mr. Harari is anxious about something much more personal. If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?\u201cOne possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?\u201d a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s more worrying. Maybe I\u2019m missing something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are \u2014 it\u2019s insane he\u2019s so popular, they\u2019re all inviting him to campus \u2014 yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,\u201d said Tristan Harris, Google\u2019s former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: \u201cUtopia and dystopia depends on your values.\u201dHe followed up with \u201cHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\u201d which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari\u2019s future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals\u2019 strange delight. \u201cIf you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\u201d he told me, sounding weary, \u201csome of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\u201dMr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X\u2019s offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look \u2014\u00a0like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get. At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn\u2019t a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. \u201cPart of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re chimpanzees. They\u2019re sapiens. This is what they do.\u201dHe was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him. An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari\u2019s team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution. He said he had resigned himself to tech executives\u2019 global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. \u201cI\u2019ve met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they\u2019re good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.\u201dSome of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. \u201cSome may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,\u201d Mr. Harari said. Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don\u2019t want to frighten them,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cThey can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.\u201dC.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari\u2019s acumen are indeed not hard to come by. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.And Mr. Hastings wrote: \u201cYuval\u2019s the anti-Silicon Valley persona \u2014 he doesn\u2019t carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.\u201d He added, \u201cHis thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.\u201dA few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term \u201cuseless class.\u201dHe told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d and \u201cfollow your heart,\u201d and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world\u2019s people are not even needed enough to be exploited. \u201cNow you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don\u2019t need me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.\u201dThe useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. \u201cIf a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can\u2019t shoot all of us because they need us,\u201d he said, citing army service and factory work.Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. \u201cYou\u2019re totally expendable,\u201d he told the audience.This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. But we are nice, so we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\u201cIf humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don\u2019t reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow do you live when you realize \u2026 that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.\u201dMr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.\u201cSilicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.\u201d He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav\u2019s mother is their accountant.Most days, Mr. Harari doesn\u2019t use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea. He works until 4 or 5 p.m., then does another hour of meditation, followed by an hourlong walk, maybe a swim, and then TV with Mr. Yahav.The two met 16 years ago through the dating site Check Me Out. \u201cWe are not big believers in falling in love,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cIt was more a rational choice.\u201d\u201cWe met each other and we thought, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s move in with each other,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yahav said.Mr. Yahav became Mr. Harari\u2019s manager. During the period when English-language publishers were cool on the commercial viability of \u201cSapiens\u201d \u2014 thinking it too serious for the average reader and not serious enough for the scholars \u2014 Mr. Yahav persisted, eventually landing the Jerusalem-based agent Deborah Harris. One day when Mr. Harari was away meditating, Mr. Yahav and Ms. Harris finally sold it at auction to Random House in London.Mr. Yahav used to meditate, but has recently stopped. \u201cIt was too hectic,\u201d he said while folding laundry. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get this kind of huge success and a regular practice.\u201d Mr. Harari remains dedicated.\u201cIf it were only up to him, he would be a monk in a cave, writing things and never getting his hair cut,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, looking at his husband. \u201cCan I tell that story?\u201dMr. Harari said no.\u201cOn our first meeting,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201che had cut his hair by himself. And it was a very bad job.\u201dThe couple are vegan, and Mr. Harari is particularly sensitive to animals. He identified the sweatshirt he was wearing as one he got just before one of his dogs died. Mr. Yahav cut in to ask if he could tell another story; Mr. Harari seemed to know exactly what he meant, and said absolutely not.\u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201cwhen there is a mosquito, he will catch him and take him out.\u201dBeing gay, Mr. Harari said, has helped his work \u2014 it set him apart to study culture more clearly because it made him question the dominant stories of his own conservative Jewish society. \u201cIf society got this thing wrong, who guarantees it didn\u2019t get everything else wrong as well?\u201d he said.\u201cIf I was a superhuman, my superpower would be detachment,\u201d Mr. Harari added. \u201cO.K., so maybe humankind is going to disappear \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s just observe.\u201dFor fun, the couple watches TV. It is their primary hobby and topic of conversation, and Mr. Yahav said it was the only thing from which Mr. Harari is not detached.They just finished \u201cDear White People,\u201d and they loved the Australian series \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d That night, they had plans to either meet Facebook executives at company headquarters or watch the YouTube show \u201cCobra Kai.\u201dMr. Harari left Silicon Valley the next weekend. Soon, in December, he will enter an ashram outside Mumbai for another 60 days of silence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Military Apologizes for Booklet With Racially Offensive Language", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States Central Command apologized on Thursday for posting racially offensive language in an online welcome booklet for troops deploying to Saudi Arabia, and said it would review other documents posted on its website to ensure that the term \u2014 Negro \u2014 was deleted.A section of the booklet, titled \u201cPeople and Population,\u201d described the Saudi population as \u201cmainly composed of descendants of indigenous tribes that have inhabited the peninsula since prehistoric times with some later mixture of Negro blood from slaves imported from Africa.\u201dThe 69-page booklet has since been taken off the internet. It was published in June for the United States Military Training Mission to Saudi Arabia, a small force of roughly 140 military advisers and conduits for American arms sales to Riyadh.In a statement, Capt. Bill Urban, the spokesman for Central Command, said that military officials were conducting \u201can internal review of our posting processes, and are conducting a survey of previously posted material to ensure there is no further instances of inappropriate material on our website.\u201d\u201cWe regret that inappropriate material was posted to our website without a more fulsome review and apologize to anyone who took offense,\u201d Captain Urban said.Another military official said that the language had probably been copied from years-old versions of the booklet and not caught when it was pasted into the updated document on the command\u2019s website.Other parts of the booklet included language that was updated from previous versions, including information about Wi-Fi and data streaming speeds. Other parts of the book talk about Saudi Arabia\u2019s climate and economy, as well as customs and courtesies.On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a cease-fire in neighboring Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels since 2015, leaving millions displaced and tens of thousands of people killed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How AT&T Fooled the Federal Judiciary", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe telecom giant promised it wouldn\u2019t use its merger with Time Warner to hurt consumers. But now it is doing precisely that.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust and telecommunications.So it\u2019s disheartening to see this venerable institution of pop culture wielded as a weapon by AT&T \u2014 HBO\u2019s new owner since the blockbuster merger in June between AT&T (a telecommunications giant) and Time Warner (a media giant). Last week, HBO went dark for both DISH and DISH-Sling, the main competitors to DirecTV and DirecTV Now, AT&T\u2019s television services. This brazenly anticompetitive strategy does not portend a happy future for the viewing public, or for HBO itself.Post-merger, AT&T has the means and the incentive to raise prices on valuable content (like HBO or the coverage of the N.C.A.A. \u201cMarch Madness\u201d basketball tournament) for cheaper, \u201cunintegrated\u201d telecom competitors that have been saving consumers money. If its rivals refuse to pay up, it can withhold the content entirely, diminishing them as competitors.Defending its proposed acquisition of Time Warner in federal court in the spring, AT&T declared, swore and promised that it would never use Time Warner\u2019s media properties as leverage against its rivals. The acquisition was all about \u201cvision\u201d and a \u201cnew AT&T\u201d \u2014 a company that would be able to better compete with the content creation and distribution abilities of upstart powerhouses like Amazon and Netflix.At trial, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, was asked if AT&T might use its ownership of content like HBO to raise prices or otherwise undermine its telecom competitors. Under oath, he answered that the premise was \u201cabsurd.\u201dBut what looks absurd now is the reasoning of Judge Richard Leon of United States District Court in Washington, who took Mr. Stevenson\u2019s bait, hook, line and sinker. Sitting as judge and jury, Judge Leon seemed to buy AT&T\u2019s self-serving testimony, ignoring or dismissing the warnings of most people in the industry. He concluded that AT&T was merely attempting to retool itself for the 21st century, not looking for a structural advantage.To reach that conclusion meant neglecting some basic economics. Presented with a clear demonstration by the economist Carl Shapiro of how AT&T\u2019s bargaining power would increase after the merger, Judge Leon opted to assume that AT&T was not interested in profit maximization.Unfortunately, there is every reason to think AT&T will keep using HBO and other media properties as weapons in the industry. The more it raises prices or withholds content, the more it either harms its rivals or gains new customers for itself. It\u2019s a win-win situation made possible by the merger\u2019s integration of content and content delivery.Nor should we ignore the effects of AT&T\u2019s anticompetitive tactics on the nature of the content created by HBO and its other media properties. After all, the more people there are who watch HBO, the more effective HBO is as a weapon for attacking other telecom companies and pushing people into becoming AT&T or DirecTV subscribers. This creates an incentive for AT&T to refashion HBO into a network that aims for the widest possible audience \u2014 as opposed to its traditional emphasis on quality.Is it a coincidence that AT&T recently shut down the enormously popular FilmStruck subscription-streaming service from WarnerMedia (as Time Warner is now named), which gave viewers access to the best of Turner Classic Movies and Criterion Collection films? Or did FilmStruck fail the crucial test of providing sufficient leverage?Given the new and concrete evidence that AT&T does plan to use HBO in an anticompetitive fashion, state and federal government ought not sit on the sidelines. The Justice Department has already appealed Judge\u2019s Leon\u2019s merger approval, and while judicial review is generally confined to the record of the case, the court of appeals might remand the case for more fact-finding or cite AT&T\u2019s post-merger conduct as evidence of the errors in Judge Leon\u2019s economic reasoning.Meanwhile, it is not too late for a state to bring an antitrust lawsuit to undo the merger, based on the new evidence. The most obvious candidate is New York, where HBO is headquartered, and where Letitia James, the attorney general-elect, might want to prove her bona fides.Whoever takes the lead, there is simply no calculation in which the use of HBO as an anticompetitive weapon is good for the future of America \u2014 for its telecom industry, its customers or its TV shows.Tim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia, the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of AT&T\u2019s chief executive. He is Randall Stephenson, not Randall Stevenson.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a Simple, Classic European Fantasy Win Over Jaded American Kids? This One Just Might", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChildren\u2019s BooksWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Since its publication more than 50 years ago, the book has sold millions of copies in Europe and been adapted as a movie; it is being developed as a series by Netflix. So the new reader coming to it must ask not if it works but how its mechanism runs \u2014 and, perhaps, whether it will run well for a generation of impatient, fantasy-besotted young American readers.The answer is that the book is a fascinating exercise in exactly the poetic benefits \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the literalism that its title promises. There may never have been a book more shallowly written, more straightforwardly imagined, with minimal unexpected turns or true surprises. And yet the shallowness has a kind of handcrafted sweetness. To call its action wooden is merely to describe it, and not in a necessarily pejorative way. It is like watching well-made marionettes handled by a not entirely expert puppeteer: You see the strings, and the movement, yes, is jerky, but the action still has charm in its complete lack of pretension. If the reader responds with impatience at the simplicity, there is still satisfaction in a sound story so simply told.The plot is introduced with little buildup. or back story. Tiuri, a young would-be knight in some vaguely medieval period in some clearly Northern clime, is interrupted during the vigil preceding his knighthood, when young squires were expected to stay up all night praying by candlelight in a chapel before the next day\u2019s ceremony. Though Tiuri is forbidden from opening the door, when an urgent knock is heard he does, and is hustled off by a hermit-squire who tells him to take a letter to the king at once. \u201cI have a letter here, with a message of vital importance. One might even say that the fate of an entire kingdom depends on it,\u201d he explains, directly. Tiuri, with oddly minimal resistance given that it will pull him away, perhaps for good, from his ambition to become a knight, goes off with the letter on a stolen horse. Though he is to deliver the letter to \u201cthe Black Knight with the White Shield,\u201d that knight is, no surprise, found grievously wounded \u2014 and it turns out Tiuri, no surprise again, will have to deliver the letter to the king himself.Readers accustomed to sinister or deeply entrenched mythological imaginings, or to the ambivalences of emotion and motive that by now are expected in a fantasy novel \u2014 the satirical and dystopian impulses of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d series, say, or even the busier, benevolent educational ones of Rick Riordan \u2014 will be startled by the elementary storytelling and simple colors of this one. I mean simple colors in the most literal sense. On a single page, one comes upon Red Riders, the Green River, two black knights, one with a red shield and one with a white shield, and the Black Knight with a White Shield, while a page later Tiuri rides with Gray Knights along a Blue River.Yet as the book unfolds, its charms, and its at first mysterious appeal, become more evident. There are rewards in its lack of cunning. An earnest innocence is evident on every page, with a charming note of Dutch practicality perpetually ringing out: \u201cThis bread is fresh. Leave your old bread here. I can use it to make some bread pudding,\u201d a character remarks one morning as the hero is sent on his way. We never see the bread pudding, but we like that, despite the epic setting, it was made. Later, we are directed to the Hills of the Moon, then told that \u201cthey\u2019re called that because they look best by moonlight.\u201dThe message in the letter turns out, on its climactic revelation, to be somewhat, well, anticlimactic. Its news is less world-altering than narrowly dynastic, far less cosmic than one would want such hard-carried secrets to be. What\u2019s more, Tiuri\u2019s quest turns out to have been slightly redundant: A second messenger was wisely, if anti-dramatically, entrusted with the same message. Yet Tiuri, if not particularly well fleshed out as a character, is a receptive vessel for any child\u2019s imagination, and his quest, exactly because it lacks refinement of purpose or any overlay of adult allegory, should have a deep appeal to an open-minded child, though perhaps a younger one than is usual for such long-winded fare. (The second volume of the series, \u201cThe Secrets of the Wild Wood,\u201d has also been republished. It involves secrets in a wild wood.)Tiuri goes through a lot, all of it in a spirit of quiet, purposeful innocence that is doubtless more appealing to many kids than the more psychologically convoluted heroes of more mature recent books. Those of us who like to read more richly metaphysical or satirical fantasies may be, in Dickens\u2019s phrase, envious of the ease with which Dragt\u2019s readers have for so long been entertained. But the virtue of simplicity is straightforwardness, and its reward is, often, undivided attention.Adam Gopnik is a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of two fantasies for children, \u201cThe King in the Window\u201d and \u201cThe Steps Across the Water.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate.

{"Headline": "The New TV Season: Reboots and Reality Shows Are Sinking. Fallon Counters a Move by Colbert.", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s \u2026 everything else.Viewership for entertainment programming on the broadcast networks continues to fall as audiences flock to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Among adults under the age of 50, the number of viewers for network shows has tumbled an additional 10 percent this season.Leadership changes at the four major broadcast networks have added to the uncertainty. Fox, ABC and NBC have all announced new heads of entertainment since September, and CBS ousted its longtime leader, Leslie Moonves, after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct.As for the shows themselves, medical dramas have made a comeback, reboots and reality shows have lost some of their luster, a veteran producer has proved his mettle yet again and a new front in the late-night wars has opened between Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon.Oh, and football. Viewers still can\u2019t get enough, which has come as a relief to network executives.Even with the internal upheaval and the continued migration of viewers to streaming services and premium cable outlets, the networks can still point to one sign of relevance: Their collective audience, while shrinking, is still huge. With several prime-time series moving into midseason hiatus, let\u2019s look at the highlights and lowlights so far.The good news for the \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d revival on CBS? Its audience is stable.That\u2019s about it.The reboot of the classic sitcom has largely been a ratings dud. In the 18-to-49 age bracket, \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d ranks 43rd among entertainment programs, drawing roughly the same number of viewers as \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d a Friday night comedy on Fox about retirees.Networks have employed the reboot strategy in recent years as a way to give viewers shows that are at once new and familiar. But as the tactic has lost its novelty, it has become less of a sure thing.\u201cMagnum P.I.\u201d \u2014 which returned to CBS with the stubble-faced Jay Hernandez taking over the role once played by the mustachioed Tom Selleck \u2014 is performing at about the same level as \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d And \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d the groundbreaking sitcom that NBC brought back with much fanfare in 2017, has lost more than half its audience from a year ago.Fox has seen solid returns from \u201cLast Man Standing,\u201d a comedy starring Tim Allen that was revived this season after it was canceled by ABC in May 2017. And even without Roseanne Barr, \u201cThe Conners\u201d has done well for ABC, generating numbers that suggest it is a sustainable draw. Through five episodes, its ratings are on a par with the CBS hit \u201cYoung Sheldon,\u201d good enough for seventh place among entertainment programs. It is also ABC\u2019s highest-rated sitcom.The audience for late night is smaller than that of prime time, but the battle between \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d on CBS and \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d on NBC is perhaps fiercer than ever.Viewers made their decision on which of the two late-night leaders they preferred in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when Mr. Colbert, whose monologues regularly skewer the president, leapfrogged the fun-and-games-minded Mr. Fallon in total audience. Mr. Colbert has since become the runaway winner, typically leading his main rival by more than a million viewers a night.But while the CBS show was on the rise, \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d managed to cling to something valuable: A lead in the 18-to-49 age bracket prized by advertisers.In handing the show to Mr. Bell, NBC seemed to mimic a strategy employed by CBS in 2016, when it placed Chris Licht, a former producer of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d in charge of \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d Under Mr. Licht\u2019s guidance, the show made its steady climb to late-night ratings dominance.Mr. Bell will have his work cut out for him. Nearly all of the late-night shows have had ratings decreases, but none have dropped like \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d In the two years since President Trump was elected, Mr. Fallon has lost 28 percent of his audience, according to Nielsen. More worrisome to NBC, Mr. Fallon has lost 41 percent of adults under 50 in that time.As young viewers flee to streaming services, network executives are running to Mr. Wolf, the 71-year-old producer.He accounts for an entire night of programming on NBC, with his three Chicago-based dramas on Wednesdays. Another of his NBC shows, \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit,\u201d continues to deliver consistent results. And Mr. Wolf has a new series showing promise on CBS, \u201cFBI.\u201dMr. Wolf\u2019s five dramas are among the 21 highest-rated shows on network television. \u201cFBI\u201d is the sixth-most-viewed drama of the season, with over 12 million viewers a week, according to Nielsen\u2019s delayed-viewing data.His empire is likely to grow. CBS is considering expanding the \u201cFBI\u201d franchise, with the chances of a spinoff series looking better each week.One thing that is almost totally absent among television\u2019s top-rated series: reality programming.Barely squeaking into the top 10 is \u201cThe Voice,\u201d the NBC singing competition whose numbers have slid. \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d has stumbled for ABC, down more than 31 percent this year. Add in a loss of 33 percent in the audience for ABC\u2019s \u201cShark Tank,\u201d and you have a trend that is keeping producers of so-called unscripted television awake at night.\u201cThe importance of reality and competition shows is waning,\u201d said Preston Beckman, a former executive at NBC and Fox. \u201cNone of these shows are the biggest shows on television anymore. And they were once the drivers.\u201dThe biggest bomb was an ABC talk show hosted by Alec Baldwin, which seems headed toward cancellation. The network moved it from Sunday to the prime-time boneyard of Saturday night.CBS will also debut \u201cThe World\u2019s Best,\u201d a talent competition show from the reality TV masterminds Mark Burnett and Mike Darnell, immediately after the broadcast of the Super Bowl in February. Mr. Darnell, who oversaw \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d at Fox, is confident that the genre has not worn out its welcome.\u201cYou can still get a big smash hit,\u201d Mr. Darnell said.At this point, the results may suggest otherwise.A Fox procedural series about emergency medical workers starring Angela Bassett, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d was a sleeper hit when it arrived at the tail end of last season.Co-created by Ryan Murphy, the drama lacks the critical and cultural cachet of \u201cPose\u201d or any of Mr. Murphy\u2019s limited series, like \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d but it has continued to deliver. The show has scored the fifth-highest ratings among network entertainment programs and is the top scripted show on Fox.NBC has scored hits with two new shows, the thriller \u201cManifest\u201d and its medical drama \u201cNew Amsterdam.\u201d \u201cManifest\u201d is in third place among all entertainment shows, but it requires viewers to track intricate twists and turns, and its numbers have started to slide in recent weeks.A notable development: One of television\u2019s sturdiest genres, the medical drama, is resonating anew. In addition to NBC\u2019s \u201cNew Amsterdam,\u201d ABC has two medical shows, \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d among the ratings leaders. That trend will not be lost to network executives, said Mr. Beckman.\u201cThere\u2019s a very quiet, subtle increase in medical dramas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see more of them. Everybody is getting a little bit away from the procedurals. And everything\u2019s a trend. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery in television.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the network that broadcasts the program \u201cShark Tank.\u201d It is ABC, not NBC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Talk TV for a Post-TV Generation", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookOf all the formats native to television, the late-night talk show may be the one most bound to the structure and conventions of old-fashioned TV. You switch on a specific channel at a specific time; you have a standing date to watch a host talk to interesting stars (or make boring stars interesting); you go to bed.So the genre has had an especially tough time adjusting to an era where the TV channel is just one media pathway among many. Who needs a late-night chat with the stars when stars are available on Instagram and Twitter, 24/7 and without intermediation? What is \u201clate-night\u201d talk on a streaming platform, where, as on a casino floor, neither day nor night exist?I\u2019m not sure anyone really knows the answer, which is why, even as talk shows have multiplied in recent years, many have struggled.I do like Busy Philipps, and that\u2019s pretty much the price of admission to \u201cBusy Tonight.\u201d Where other new talk shows often work to introduce the host, this one assumes you\u2019re already a follower, and even consider yourself a virtual pal.There\u2019s no desk; Philipps curls up on the couch, a fellow pop culture junkie sitting down for a night\u2019s TV with you. (\u201cAre you eating your kids\u2019 candy?\u201d she asked on Halloween night. \u201cAre you stealing it and filming it for Jimmy Kimmel?\u201d)\u201cBusy Tonight\u201d is a quick half-hour: a round of chat (Philipps uses a trio of her writers as a Greek-chorus collective sidekick), a field piece and a celebrity interview. Philipps is, like Jimmy Fallon but in a different way, an audience surrogate, a fellow fan. She\u2019s not out to pry into her guests but to hang with them. The show is, the cruelly earworm-y theme song reminds you, about \u201cMe and my friends.\u201dEach segment speaks the Instagrammar of enthusiasm. Philipps, in one of her favorite words, is \u201cobsessed\u201d with lots of things: Steven Tyler, babies, her aunt, the way Vanessa Hudgens tosses her neck in SoulCycle class.Philipps mainly steered clear of politics her first week, something that used to be standard in late night. But there was some personal-as-political \u2014 underscoring how women are still underrepresented in late night \u2014 when she used a graphically funny ramble about menstruation to speak out on a Nevada ballot initiative to repeal the \u201ctampon tax\u201d on feminine hygiene products: \u201cPoverty is sexist.\u201dThe early question for \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d is whether TV \u2014 a stage in your living room \u2014 can reproduce the intimacy of a medium you hold in your hand. Philipps\u2019 Instagram stands out partly for its approachable ordinariness, an effect that dissipates when you\u2019re spending half a show talking with celebrities.But Philipps works to connect, ending each episode pouring a margarita, putting on a nightgown \u2014 \u201cMr. Nightgown,\u201d she calls it \u2014 singing a good-night song and saying \u201cI love you\u201d directly to the camera.\u201cWas that just weird?\u201d she said, laughing, during her final signoff of the week. Not necessarily. But it\u2019s definitely more personal than Johnny Carson ever tried to get.\u201cPatriot Act\u201d has a different challenge: to make the talk show work on Netflix, despite a dearth of evidence that binge-watchers want it. The streaming outlet has canceled attempts by Chelsea Handler, Joel McHale and Michelle Wolf, while Norm Macdonald and even David Letterman made scarcely a ripple in the vast ocean of binge.Minhaj\u2019s show is modeled less on classical late-night than the thinkpiece-with-jokes format of his fellow \u201cDaily Show\u201d alumnus, John Oliver. Like Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d Minhaj\u2019s show is \u201ctalk\u201d only in the sense that, yes, someone is talking the whole time.The first thing you notice on \u201cPatriot Act\u201d is the stage, an alien mother ship of blazing light and geometry that looks, Minhaj pre-emptively jokes, \u201clike Michael Bay directed a PowerPoint presentation.\u201d The second is Minhaj himself, jittery and pacing, seeming to absorb energy from the jillion-watt setting, his legs spring-loaded.There is no shortage of news-junkie comics, armed with research and graphics, cracking wise from the left these days. Minhaj\u2019s first two episodes leaned into one thing that sets him apart, his background as a Muslim Indian American and the child of immigrants.His first topic was a recent lawsuit against Harvard\u2019s affirmative-action policy, which seeks to advance a longtime complaint of white activists by leveraging complaints that Asian-Americans have been discriminated against.It\u2019s a subject that\u2019s, literally, more than black and white: It involves pitting minority groups against one another, using historical concerns for manipulative ends. Minhaj, bounding between history and pop-culture references, was able to approach the issue as an insider, playing on stereotypes that would be radioactive coming from an outsider. Citing statistics showing that Asian-Americans make up 5.8 percent of the population but over 22 percent of Harvard\u2019s class of 2021, he added: \u201cBut in classic Asian-parent fashion, we\u2019re like, \u2019Twenty-two percent? Why not a hundred percent?\u2019\u201dMinhaj\u2019s early topic selection is similar to Oliver\u2019s: drawn from the news but not too perishable. I tend to store \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on my DVR, and usually the segments hold up just as well a week or more later.If \u201cPatriot Act\u201d can find this sweet spot \u2014 urgent but not immediate \u2014 it may be a better fit for streaming TV, where you can talk as much as you want, but people don\u2019t listen until they\u2019re ready.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Profit Soars, but Focus Remains on Its Coming Streaming Service", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Disney returned to annual profit growth on Thursday after a difficult 2017, the result of blockbuster movies, rising theme park attendance and a stabilizing ESPN.Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, unveiled the name of the streaming service on Thursday, telling analysts on a conference call that it would be called Disney Plus, styled by the company as Disney+. The name parallels the one for Disney\u2019s fledgling sports streaming service, ESPN Plus.Disney Plus will also feature a live-action Marvel series about Loki, the god of mischief from the \u201cThor\u201d movies. Tom Hiddleston will reprise that role.Mr. Iger also gave an update on Disney\u2019s $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. European regulators approved the deal on Tuesday, which Mr. Iger called a \u201cmajor milestone.\u201d Disney is still waiting for approval from a handful of countries, but Mr. Iger said he expected the deal to close \u201cmeaningfully earlier\u201d than June, Disney\u2019s initial time frame.For the most recent quarter, the fourth in Disney\u2019s fiscal year, net income totaled $2.3 billion, a 33 percent increase from a year earlier. Profit for the year rose 40 percent. Analysts had expected far less growth for both the quarter and year.Although Disney ended its fiscal year on a high note, the coming quarter may be rough. Christine M. McCarthy, Disney\u2019s chief financial officer, cautioned that movie operating income could fall by as much as $600 million \u2014 or roughly 70 percent \u2014 because of comparisons to \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d in 2017. The lack of a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie over the holidays will also hurt Disney\u2019s consumer products business. And programming costs at ESPN will climb because of the timing of sporting events.And Disney turned to discounting to prop up attendance at Shanghai Disney Resort. \u201cWe saw some softness in the tourism market in China,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cNot just for us, but across the board.\u201d He added that much of the discounting had ended. \u201cWe still believe very, very, very bullishly\u201d in the resort, he said.Over all, however, it was a strong quarter for Disney, with each of its biggest divisions \u2014 movies, theme parks and television \u2014 contributing in a significant way to results, a contrast to a year ago, when movies and television sputtered.Movie operating income more than doubled, to $596 million, because of fewer film-related write-offs and scorching ticket sales for \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp.\u201d Disney\u2019s theme parks had operating income of $829 million, an 11 percent increase, because of growth at Walt Disney World in Florida, which suffered from Hurricane Irma in 2017.And quarterly profit at Disney\u2019s vast television business, which includes ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and the Freeform network, climbed 9 percent, to $5.96 billion.Results at ESPN were flat; higher subscription fees were offset by a decline in advertising. Lower costs helped Disney Channels Worldwide and Freeform deliver improved results. ABC benefited from sales of reruns for the sitcom \u201cblack-ish,\u201d but continued to suffer from declining ratings: Increases in political ad revenue were offset by \u201clower network impressions.\u201dDisney shares climbed about 1.7 percent in aftermarket trading, to $118.Advertisement"}

The dragon looks as if it paused in midflight to catch a worm or pose for a coat of arms. It\u2019s as blankly ornamental as the rest of the movie, which stars Claire Foy as a preposterously jacked-up version of the renegade hacker. Salander is still typing furiously and retains a taste for black clothes and vengeance, but her running and gunning now suggest a Goth cosplaying James Bond.A wash of murky hues and murkier narrative developments, the movie was directed by Fede Alvarez, who shares script credit with Jay Basu and Steven Knight. Alvarez tries to pep things up with chases, near escapes, dramatic rescues, fetish wear and female nudity. But the whole thing is a bummer, at times risible, as when swarms of law-and-order types conveniently overlook a laughably visible surveillance camera. Joining Foy in her travails are Sverrir Gudnason as Mikael Blomkvist, Salander\u2019s ally and former lover. Lakeith Stanfield, Stephen Merchant and a badly used Vicky Krieps also drop by for abuse, though their exploitation pales compared with that endured by Salander enthusiasts.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

After all, the last two words of Season 5 were spoken directly into the camera by now-President Claire Underwood (Wright): \u201cMy turn.\u201d After Frank resigned the presidency to join the kingmakers and power players behind the scenes, he needed only his wife to pardon him for his many misdeeds, which she promptly chose not to do, refusing even to return his phone calls. Season 6 was once conceived as a battle between Frank and Claire for power but now the Oval Office is all hers.Season 5 ended with a slew of murders. Most important, Claire committed murder for the first time (that we know of), poisoning her lover, the writer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks), during sex. Neve Campbell\u2019s LeAnn Harvey was run off the road, likely because she knew too much. It wasn\u2019t too clear if she was dead, but Campbell does not appear to be returning for Season 6. Finally, the N.S.A. contractor Aidan Macallan (Damian Young) invaded the privacy of voters on a national level, but he suspiciously killed himself. And remember when Frank rather blatantly pushed his secretary of state, Cathy Durant, down the stairs? A news report near the end of the season revealed that Cathy was merely injured, and we know now that Jayne Atkinson, the actress who plays her, will be in Season 6.The devoted newspaperman Tom Hammerschmidt (McGiver) refused to give up on the murder of Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara). When it seemed as if Frank Underwood might finally face justice for one of his first crimes, Doug took the blame instead. Does this mean Frank\u2019s loyal chief of staff isn\u2019t in Season 6? Of course not. Michael Kelly is all over the trailers for the new season, but it is unclear how he will work his way back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and whether he\u2019ll be an ally or enemy of Claire\u2019s.Given that Season 6 will be the final one for \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d cardinal sins from all of the first five seasons could come back to haunt Claire. There are a great number of unsolved cases in the Underwood ledger, including the murders of Peter Russo, Rachel Posner, Gavin Orsay, Lucas Goodwin, and now Harvey and Yates. Could one of Frank\u2019s crimes take Claire down? Or even her own? The two have used each other as political human shields for five seasons \u2014 what happens now that Frank is gone?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man Who Brought Weimar Into Germans\u2019 Living Rooms", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 Like many people, Volker Kutscher reads daily newspapers to keep up with things. What\u2019s less usual is that the two papers he relies on, the Vossische Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt, have been out of print for more than seven decades.In the papers \u2014 which he reads front to back on microfilm in the city\u2019s old state library, weeks\u2019 worth in one sitting \u2014 he finds news of violent demonstrations, rising rents, traffic accidents, robberies and murders. He finds reviews of risqu\u00e9 cabarets, modern theater and promising new media (talking films). And in federal politics, there is endless news of weak coalition governments that take far too long to form.To modern Germans all this \u201cnews\u201d would seem eerily familiar.Mr. Kutscher has sold more than 1.7 million books in Germany, while tens of millions have watched the TV show there. Two of his books are in print in the United States, with at least two more coming, and Netflix is offering \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d in America.\u201cHis trick is ingenious,\u201d said Tom Tykwer, the principal creator of \u201cBabylon Berlin.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s created a portrait of an era through the lens of genre fiction.\u201dHaving spent a good part of his professional life in the two tumultuous decades between two world wars, the 55-year-old former journalist has found success as Germans have increasingly become fascinated with the era.By bringing an American-style detective story to Weimar Berlin \u2014 a city Mr. Kutscher calls the most American European city \u2014 he has helped popularize an era that has remained shrouded in Germany because of the monstrosities and guilt of the Nazi era that succeeded it. His novels have become almost essential reading in a German discussion about the creation of the modern democratic state, founded 100 years ago.And with the contemporary rise of populist nationalism and the perception that \u2014 despite a booming, culturally blossoming era \u2014 chaos is at the doorstep, the era is one that many Germans recognize as a mirror \u2014 if a warped one \u2014 of their present-day country.\u201cI\u2019m very much against direct comparisons: to say that we live in the Weimar Republic again is not \u2014 luckily \u2014 true,\u201d said Mr. Kutscher, before gamely pointing out the key differences.The modern German economy is humming, whereas in 1929, the year Mr. Kutscher\u2019s first novel is set, the stock market crash had shaken a nation already traumatized by hyperinflation. The current populists, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, who entered Parliament last year for the first time, are not the National Socialists.\u201cBut when I started writing, I would not have thought that we would once more live in a time where democracy is similarly endangered,\u201d he said.Daniel Sch\u00f6npflug, a historian of the era, has praised \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d for its historical accuracy and for making the era accessible to a wide audience.Mr. Kutscher has done this in part by giving his characters modern habits and placing well-known brands in the story.\u201cSome of my characters shower almost every day, which wasn\u2019t normal then, but I wanted them to be relatable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just much cleaner than their brethren.\u201dMr. Kutscher admits that part of his success is luck. His works became best sellers at a time when Germans were ready to re-examine the Weimar Republic. Mr. Tykwer, of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d concurs.\u201cWe started writing the script in 2013,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was almost uncanny how the real world around us seemed to want to conform to the era we were describing.\u201dBesides the $45.5 million TV show \u2014 the most expensive ever made in Germany \u2014 the books have spawned radio theater, a comic book, a podcast and walking tours. Mr. Kutscher created one picture book with Kat Menschik, a well-known illustrator, that tells the back story of one of the characters in his world without being part of the detective series.Like his main character, the dogged and ethically compromised police inspector Gereon Rath, Mr. Kutscher is actually not a Berliner, but a longtime resident of Cologne.\u201cIt was like being the priest or the mayor, maybe less important, but you were visible and had to be responsible,\u201d he said.\u201cThe city was much less colorful then,\u201d he said during an extensive interview in a hip hotel in Berlin, right at a spot where a fictional tobacconist introduced Inspector Rath to Camel Cigarettes in 1931.After seven years as the local editor of the paper, he quit to focus on his project: a series of books that would document the Weimar Republic and the first years of the Nazi era. Since he had written only three relatively unknown local crime thrillers (a new genre in Germany at the time), finding a publisher to consider such a hefty project took nearly two years. By the time Kiepenheuer & Witsch signed on for the first book \u2014 with options for the following manuscripts \u2014 he had almost given up and was looking for his next job in journalism.\u201cThe goal really was just to be able to do this full-time,\u201d he said. That was assured after his third book, \u201cGoldstein,\u201d came out in 2010 and made it onto the German best-seller list (it\u2019s available as an e-book in the United States from Picador Press, with a paperback to follow next year).His latest novel, \u201cMarlow,\u201d yet to be translated, is set in the city after the Nazis have come to power. The Vossische Zeitung has closed after a nearly two-century run, while the liberal Berliner Tageblatt, in Jewish hands since its founding in 1872, has been taken over by the Nazis.Mr. Kutscher still forces himself to read it, to know what his characters, navigating Berlin in 1935, would have read.\u201cIt\u2019s just awful now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.And the stock markets are a mess.On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.The stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.The pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.The sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.But the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201dUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.So far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.But those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.Strong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.In recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.On Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.Apple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.Oil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.Last quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.In 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.For the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.Disappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.In other words, the market may be messy for a while.\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201dClifford Krauss and Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Mike Birbiglia Is a Very Nervous Dad in \u2018The New One\u2019", "Date": "2019-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s PickBut Mr. Birbiglia has great respect and affection for this kind of sofa, and so should you. As he explains in this one-man show, which opened on Sunday night under the seamless direction of Seth Barrish, a couch is \u201ca deceptively simple piece of technology.\u201dIt is, to be precise, \u201ca bed that hugs you.\u201d And in delivering that deceptively simple classification, Mr. Birbiglia\u2019s voice becomes a low, wraparound, pleasure-drenched caress.This somnolent sound makes you feel both relaxed and attentive, drowsy and giddy. And somehow an expensive night with a lone comedian starts to feel like a better bargain than bingeing and chilling at home.In an age in which starry stand-up is instantly accessible to anyone with a Netflix subscription, dropping big bucks to see a low-key, self-effacing comedian in person might seem like a waste. Such an attitude doesn\u2019t account, though, for the paradoxically lazy energy that Mr. Birbilgia emanates \u2014 a seductive force of physics that can be felt only partly when he\u2019s onscreen.As he does so, he kicks at and stumbles over invisible obstacles. Mr. Birbiglia is retracing the road map of his life, which has always been cluttered with his neuroses and physical ailments. In the months he describes in \u201cThe New One,\u201d that life has become even more congested, almost to the point of paralysis.That\u2019s because of the before and after events surrounding the arrival of the play\u2019s title character, a baby named Oona. Yes, she\u2019s his child. Except she\u2019s not quite.Men, he contends, are born jerks, a universal truth that he believes accounts for the state of the world today. (\u201cThe men we used to think were great were priests, politicians and gymnastic doctors. It hasn\u2019t ended well for great.\u201d) He supports this contention with humiliating stories of his own bad behavior, including a graphically detailed account of sex with a prostitute in Amsterdam.His status as male is only one of the reasons he once thought that he and his wife shouldn\u2019t have children. In the show\u2019s opening section, he lists seven arguments against his becoming a father. They range from assorted physical ailments (an early experience of cancer, diabetes and his tendency to act out his dreams while asleep) to his suspicion that \u201cconsciousness is only a hallucination.\u201dThe list in and of itself is not funny (although I did love the self-explanatory brevity of \u201cNo. 4: I have a cat\u201d). The conversational detours the list inspires can be sublime. That caveat about consciousness and hallucinations? It somehow segues into a description of the role of Roman Catholicism in Mr. Birbiglia\u2019s childhood as \u201cthis weird three-way with God\u201d and his mom.Unlikely similes and metaphors become a means of both addressing and (temporarily) defusing terrors and tensions. Presumably, verbal felicity is part of what brought Mr. Birbiglia and Ms. Stein together originally.He quotes her poem about their daughter at eight months: \u201cAn infant reaches for something (I don\u2019t know what), pushes it farther away and cries in frustration each time she reaches without realizing she is crawling for the first time. She is just like her father.\u201dThat\u2019s also a pretty good description of Mr. Birbiglia\u2019s style as a performer here. As he restlessly circumambulates, verbally and physically, he\u2019s always reaching for explanations that seem to explode on him. Yet, in the end, a symmetry emerges from the chaos he describes and embodies. Such is the gentle genius of one man\u2019s comfortingly haphazard approach to comedy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayra Langdon Riesman, Movie Website Creator, Dies at 64", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayra Langdon Riesman, who in the mid-1990s turned her fascination with movies into Film Scouts, an early and ambitious website that offered film festival coverage, movie reviews, trailers and interviews with Hollywood personalities, died on Nov. 4 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.Her husband, Michael Riesman, said the cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease.Ms. Riesman had done some acting, sold designer clothes, worked for a German film distributor and served as an associate producer on a movie when she became intrigued by the idea of covering the film industry in a realm known as the World Wide Web.Film Scouts, which started on AOL in 1994 and shifted to its own website two years later, took an entertaining approach to storytelling that earned it high rankings among the growing selection of movie sites by Yahoo and Netscape. Visitors to the site were guided by an animated character, Jerry the usher, to the site\u2019s \u201ctheaters\u201d to read or watch its content.As the self-proclaimed Chief Film Scout, Ms. Riesman toted a camcorder to festivals to record interviews with dozens of actors, including Andy Garcia, Kenneth Branagh and Rosanna Arquette, and directors like Robert Altman and Mike Leigh. She also wrote diary posts about her festival experiences and, with Kathleen Carroll, a former film critic for The Daily News in New York, irreverent guides to the Cannes Film Festival.\u201cShe was elegant and quite bright and just loved movies,\u201d Ms. Carroll said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd she loved being in places like Cannes. It gave her a great role to play.\u201dMs. Riesman, who financed Film Scouts through sponsorships, developed a network of writers and critics who filed dispatches from festivals, transcribed festival news conferences and reviewed films.\u201cWhen the spirit moved me, I\u2019d tell her I was going to a festival and send her some things,\u201d David Sterritt, a former film critic for The Christian Science Monitor, said in a telephone interview. He added, \u201cIt was a smart and energetic venture that reflected Mayra\u2019s own vitality and intelligence.\u201dMs. Riesman understood that in the late 1990s, well before the rise of streaming services like Netflix, the internet was not mature enough technologically to show full-length films to broad audiences.\u201cRight now, the Net is not a way to see movies,\u201d she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1998.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Ms. Riesman learned she had Parkinson\u2019s in 2000 and began reducing her stewardship of Film Scouts. The site still exists as a raw-looking time capsule of the film industry of the \u201990s, albeit with reports filed by contributors over the years since she stepped away.Mayra Phyllis Levy was born on April 5, 1954, in Perth Amboy, N.J. Her father, Kalman, a brush salesman, died when she was an infant. Her mother, Bernice (Kluft) Levy, took jobs as an office manager after her husband\u2019s death. A childhood interest in theater led Mayra to study drama at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt., and perform with the radical Bread & Puppet Theater, then the school\u2019s theater-in-residence.She struggled for acting work and took a variety of jobs, from curator of a Soho art gallery to associate producer of \u201cSeven Minutes,\u201d a 1989 film by Klaus Maria Brandauer. She adopted the Langdon name from a friend and mentor, the actor Robert Langdon Lloyd.Around that time she tried, unsuccessfully, to produce a film based on a manuscript of medieval poems and dramatic texts called \u201cCarmina Burana.\u201dFilm Scouts became her avenue to success, melding her passion for films with prescience about the power of the internet.Asked in the 1999 interview about the future of the site, she said it would be \u201cdiscovering just what it is that this unique medium can do.\u201d\u201cI have glimpses of that even now,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we are still in the very infant stages.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warrior Princesses. Spaceships. Cool Boots. \u2018She-Ra\u2019 Is Back.", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLENDALE, Calif. \u2014 In many ways, \u201cShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power,\u201d a new Netflix series from DreamWorks Animation, will be familiar to fans of the campy original. Adora is here, discovering the magic sword that transforms her into She-Ra when she invokes \u201cthe honor of Grayskull,\u201d and so is Catra, her feline friend and on-again, off-again foe. There are rainbow-colored flying unicorns and villains with giant red claws for hands, not to mention cool spaceships and battles royale.\u201cI love the original,\u201d Stevenson, 26, said. \u201cBut we wanted to take what was fun about it and deepen it, and flesh it out.\u201dThe original series, which ran for just two seasons, was probably best known for its ties to a popular Mattel line of action figures. But Stevenson \u2014 a graphic novelist and artist whose \u201cNimona,\u201d about a mischievous shapeshifting girl who can belch fire and turn into a Triceratops, was nominated for a National Book Award \u2014 thought the cartoon offered possibilities for a reimagining.On a recent afternoon, Stevenson was in her office here at DreamWorks, explaining how she had adapted a story about a sword-wielding teen heroine and her group of superpowered pals for 2018. In the original, nearly every heroine was the exact same size and shape, with matching faces and swimsuit-model bodies (which made it easier for the animators, not to mention the folks who made the toys, which were really what that original show was all about). They all had big \u201980s hair. And nearly all of them were white (Netossa, a late addition to the show, was a notable exception).\u201cOne of the first things we wanted to do was make the characters different sizes, shapes and ethnicities,\u201d Stevenson said.In the new series, which debuts Nov. 13, there are black warriors, Asian ice princesses and brown mermaids. Body types run from waif-slim to roundish; hairstyles include Rapunzel-long tresses, bobs and fades. The voice cast, which includes Karen Fukuhara (\u201cSuicide Squad\u201d), Reshma Shetty (\u201cRoyal Pains\u201d), Vella Lovell (\u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d), and, in a guest spot, Sandra Oh (\u201cKilling Eve\u201d), is as diverse as the characters they play.Aimee Carrero, who was born in the Dominican Republic and grew up in Miami in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, is the voice of the show\u2019s very Nordic-looking lead. \u201cI\u2019ll never be a blonde,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I get to be a blonde as She-Ra.\u201dDreamWorks acquired the rights to She-Ra in 2012, along with more than 450 other Classic Media properties, like Casper, Lassie and Voltron: Defender of the Universe. Not long after, Beth Cannon, a DreamWorks development executive and \u201cNimona\u201d fan, reached out to Stevenson about developing a story pitch. There was a lot that Stevenson liked about the Filmation original, from its action figure tie-ins (\u201cit really felt like playing with toys\u201d) to the crazy characters (\u201cthere\u2019s a princess who can turn her legs into a fishtail\u201d). Even so, she acknowledged its artistic limitations, from its choppy, often sparse movement to its routine use of stock footage. \u201cThe animation was limited,\u201d Stevenson conceded.For the reboot, the animation team created vivid backgrounds and sci-fi landscapes reminiscent of Moebius (\u201cHeavy Metal\u201d) and Roger Dean (those iconic \u201cYes\u201d album covers). There\u2019s the eco-friendly ethos of Miyazaki and stylistic nods to contemporary anime. (Adora\u2019s eyes become giant and shimmering when she sees a horse for the first time.) \u201cI wore out the pages in my Kill La Kill/Sushio artbook,\u201d said Keiko Murayama, who helped create the character designs for She-Ra/Adora, Bow, Glimmer and Catra.The artists imagined She-Ra as a slim, fit teen, with white bike shorts and a high-collared top. They replaced her high heels with boots (granted, ones with a stylish white, blue and gold colorway). \u201cThe one thing we spent time on was She-Ra\u2019s boots,\u201d Murayama said. Even so, the new look drew the ire of a small but vocal group of online fanboys who slammed the new She-Ra for not being sexy enough.\u201cWe have a wall of fan art that is floor to ceiling, full of art from people who connected with that character,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s who we were doing this for. If you want to watch a pretty lady with an hourglass figure, you can go to so many places to find that.\u201dInside the DreamWorks recording studio, Stevenson took a break from her showrunner duties to provide the voice of Spinnerella, one of She-Ra\u2019s princess pals, alongside Carrero, Merit Leighton (\u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d) and Krystal Joy Brown (who played Diana Ross in the Broadway musical \u201cMotown\u201d). Spurred along by the voice director Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, the four women battle Evil Horde forces and play a spirited game of iceball, all capped off by a hearty \u201cFor the Honor of Grayskull!\u201d from Carrero.\u201cThey always save those for the end of the day, because they know that after that, my voice is totally done for a few hours,\u201d Carrero said.Not counting one lone guy, everyone inside and outside of the studio was female. The show has one male actor on the regular voice cast (Marcus Scribner, from \u201cblack-ish\u201d) and an all-female writers\u2019 room (a first for all concerned).\u201cAnimation is still very male oriented, so this is the first time I\u2019ve worked with so many women,\u201d said Josie Campbell, the story editor who wrote the episode \u201cPrincess Prom.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been such a treat. Every one of our writers is so strong, and we\u2019re all a bunch of geeks.\u201dFran\u00e7oise Mouly, a longtime comics publisher and art editor at The New Yorker, was a judge on the panel that awarded Stevenson\u2019s \u201cNimona\u201d a best web comic prize for 2012. \u201cIn Noelle\u2019s work, you can see why it\u2019s so important to have talented young women in high-powered creative roles,\u201d Mouly said. \u201cHer work goes way beyond passing the Bechdel test.\u201dHeady stuff aside, the relationships form the core of the show, Stevenson said. Throughout the series, there\u2019s wide-eyed love and heart-rending jealousy, crushes and infatuations, and everything in between. \u201cThey\u2019re teenagers,\u201d she said.And that includes Adora/She-Ra herself.She can flatten you with one swing of her mighty sword. But when the series starts, she\u2019s never been to a dance (or danced, even), or gone to a party, or fallen in love. She worries if her new friends will like her, or if she should even be doing this whole warrior-princess thing.Advertisement"}

Also looking out for the boy, for reasons no one can quite figure out, is the mystical, sardonic python Kaa (Cate Blanchett).The first half of the movie, wherein Mowgli (Rohan Chand) trains with the lovable/irascible bear Baloo (Serkis) for a contest that will determine whether he can join the wolves in their hunt, is a striking if at times too-pretty feat of fantasy world-building. The teenage Chand (who was 11 at the time of filming) gives a scarily credible physical performance.Callie Kloves\u2019s script, which situates the action in early 20th-century India, diverges from the Kipling stories considerably and at times uneasily. In the second half, after Mowgli is compelled to join human society, the movie makes some daring moves exploring what one might call the dual nature of Mowgli. He\u2019s not fully a jungle creature, and some of what he sees of humanity delights him. But the human hunter (Matthew Rhys), who\u2019s looking after him in his new world, breaks Mowgli\u2019s heart, which in turn unleashes the boy\u2019s anger.The filmmakers are clearly trying to bring an uncommon maturity to the fantasy film, and in many respects they succeed.

{"Headline": "Netflix Put a Movie in Theaters. Good Luck Finding It.", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the United States, the movie played in just three cities \u2014 New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 at a Landmark Theater in each, and for just four days, Nov. 8 through 11, rather than a standard week.After the opening weekend, anyone looking to see the film between Monday and Thursday this week would have been out of luck. (On Friday, the Coens\u2019 film will reopen in a handful of theaters on the same day it begins streaming on Netflix. As for how many tickets were sold last week, Netflix, in keeping with its past practice, has not released information on box office grosses.)Adding to the confusion, the film opened on a Thursday, not a Friday, when most films are released domestically. Jared Gores, a podcaster and a documentary producer in the San Francisco Bay Area, had read the news of the sudden theatrical release but still thought the Coens\u2019 film was opening on Friday. At the Embarcadero Center Cinema in San Francisco to buy a ticket for a different movie that Wednesday, he happened to see that \u201cBuster Scruggs\u201d was listed as opening the next day.\u201cIt was kind of a coincidence that I happened to be looking at the right time to catch it,\u201d Gores said.He added, though, that he doesn\u2019t have an issue with Netflix. \u201cThey\u2019ve put money behind stuff that probably wouldn\u2019t get made in the first place,\u201d he said.\u201cRoma,\u201d scheduled to open Nov. 21, will pose the next test of the sincerity of Netflix\u2019s interest in theaters, and also of the limitations of its release plan.

Netflix has said it will release \u201cRoma\u201d theatrically in more than 20 countries, though the number of theaters is still unknown. Netflix did not respond to questions for this article.The Alamo Drafthouse chain, which does not have a Netflix ban, will not screen \u201cRoma\u201d at its 70-millimeter-capable Downtown Brooklyn theater. The chain\u2019s founder, Tim League, said in a statement that it wouldn\u2019t be showing the movie because of \u201ca variety of circumstances that include prior commitments to other studio partners.\u201d He added that he was hoping to offer select screenings of the film at other locations after Thanksgiving.Two December openings, \u201cMowgli: Legend of the Jungle\u201d a new movie version of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cJungle Book\u201d stories with a cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch and Cate Blanchett, and \u201cBird Box,\u201d a thriller starring Sandra Bullock, will also test Netflix\u2019s commitment to theaters.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u2019 Review: A Grim Western From the Coen Brothers", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s Pick\u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d is one of the darkest movies by Joel and Ethan Coen, and also among the silliest. It swerves from goofy to ghastly so deftly and so often that you can\u2019t always tell which is which.And sometimes even then. In the first episode \u2014 there are six in all, presented as if they were chapters in a handsomely illustrated old clothbound volume \u2014 the title character, played by a grinning Tim Blake Nelson, takes the prospect of his own demise in stride, as he does everyone else\u2019s. There must be an afterlife, this cheerful killer surmises, since there are so many songs about it, one of which he sings as he ascends heavenward.Known (among other nicknames) as the San Saba Songbird, Buster rides the dusty range strumming a black guitar, a Gene Autry with a murderous streak. His adventures \u2014 shootouts, bar fights and poker hands punctuated by musical numbers and bouts of genial, straight-to-camera philosophizing \u2014 set the tone for what follows.And yet it\u2019s always a mistake to take their frivolity at face value. They are serious not in spite of their facetiousness but by means of it. Even as \u201cBuster Scruggs\u201d is more frolicsome than, say, \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d or \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d it\u2019s also in its way as haunting as either of those films.Aesthetic pleasure has always occupied a crucial place in the Coen universe. They take evident delight in the mechanics of screenwriting and filmmaking \u2014 flaunting their ingenious wordplay, profligate storytelling and nimble editing (under the pseudonym Roderick Jaynes) \u2014 and also ensure that art, both lofty and popular, is integral to the experience of their characters.Entertainment is poor compensation for the brute fact of mortality, but it\u2019s what we have. And so Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan), a young woman on the Oregon Trail whose brother has died and whose own survival prospects are precarious, stops to giggle at the antics of a colony of prairie dogs. A crusty prospector (Tom Waits), digging for an elusive pocket of gold in a pristine mountain valley, sings a wistful ballad, as does a gentlemanly bounty killer (Brendan Gleeson) during a tense stagecoach ride.People tell stories and jokes and engage in mock-learned debates \u2014 not to arrive at any solutions but to pass the time between now and the grave. Eloquence, in Coen territory, is its own reward, even if it isn\u2019t always appreciated. In \u201cMeal Ticket,\u201d the grimmest and cruelest of these yarns, a man without limbs, known as Hamilton, the Wingless Thrush (Harry Melling), is carted around by a grizzled impresario (Liam Neeson) and made to perform feats of elocution amid the mud and dust of remote frontier settlements.And \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\u201d which will make its way to the Netflix streaming platform on Nov. 16 after a week in theaters, can be thought of as a Coen brothers concept album. It works just fine in sequence, but some tracks \u2014 the one with James Franco as a dumb bank robber, for instance \u2014 only need to be played once. Others invite a specific needle drop: Kazan\u2019s expression of surprise when she receives a marriage proposal; her awkward conversations with Bill Heck; her utterly natural delivery of the word \u201capothegm\u201d; Waits stealing eggs from an owl\u2019s nest and then putting all but one of them back.The last chapter, called \u201cThe Mortal Remains,\u201d is the deepest cut, the one that might send you back to the beginning, in search of hidden meanings and buried patterns. Five people on a stagecoach journey converse idly and argue heatedly. A wizened trapper (Chelcie Ross) contends that people are all the same, \u201clike ferrets,\u201d to which a proper lady (Tyne Daly) responds that people can be sorted into two kinds, \u201cupright and sinning.\u201d A Frenchman (Saul Rubinek) maintains that every individual is distinct, the unique product of history and temperament.Their journey ends not in violent death, as nearly all the other verses of this \u201cBallad\u201d do, but with something stranger and chillier that casts its shadow on what came before. As if the morbid jokes were really existential riddles all along, and we were only laughing to drown out the terror.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

The anonymous writer called her Arabic salutations \u201cinappropriate and very jarring,\u201d and said it was \u201cimproper\u201d for the station to allow them. Yet the writer sounded respectful, and closed with an old-fashioned Hebrew expression: \u201cAlu v\u2019hatzlichu,\u201d or \u201cGo forth and succeed.\u201dMs. Aharish posted the missive online and drew comments praising her support for coexistence and religious tolerance, most of them from Israeli Jews \u2014 including some who took note of the letter writer\u2019s polished Hebrew phraseology.On Monday, however, the same anonymous viewer renewed his complaint in a more belligerent tone. If Ms. Aharish needed the \u201crelief\u201d of speaking Arabic, he wrote in an email, \u201clet her go to the bathroom, give a speech in Arabic to the toilet bowl and come back and talk to us only in Hebrew.\u201d If it was so important to her, he said, \u201clet her go to Al-Jazeera.\u201dMs. Aharish shared this screed online, too. But that was not enough for her.It was a witty rejoinder to an unseen umbrage-taker. The clip spread rapidly on social media in Israel.The duet was both a striking tableau and a tentative stepping out for a husband and wife who had earned fame in the Israeli art and media worlds very much on their own, only to be attacked when their marriage became public.No sooner had their wedding been reported than the interior minister, Aryeh Deri, condemned their union as an example of assimilation that he said was \u201cconsuming the Jewish people,\u201d and urged Ms. Aharish to convert, lest their children face \u201cserious problems.\u201dA right-wing lawmaker known for rabble-rousing, Oren Hazan, accused Mr. Halevi of becoming \u201cIslamicized\u201d and suggested he had gotten carried away with his role in \u201cFauda\u201d as an Israeli counterterrorism agent who goes undercover as an Arab.It wasn\u2019t just from politicians that they encountered criticism, Ms. Aharish said. A woman on a motorcycle accosted her husband on the street in Tel Aviv, warning him, \u201c\u2018What you\u2019re doing is a big mistake, and we need to talk about it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that people feel they can be involved in the decisions you make in your private life.\u201dBut Ms. Aharish and Mr. Halevi got support in some quarters, even from other politicians, and many Jewish TV colleagues went on the air and wished them \u201cmabrouk\u201d and \u201cmazal tov.\u201dJewish-Muslim marriages are relatively uncommon in Israel, although Arab citizens make up some 21 percent of the population, and those Muslim-Jewish couples who do tie the knot rarely garner much attention. But the Aharish-Halevi union may have been the first such high-profile, celebrity wedding.Israel is replete with opinionated people, of course; and Ms. Aharish is no exception. On her return to the anchor\u2019s chair in October after her wedding, Ms. Aharish delivered a broadside against politicians who had bothered to pontificate about her marriage when serious social and security problems \u2014 women being murdered, sick children waiting for their medications, the \u201cburning south\u201d near the Gaza border \u2014 were languishing unsolved.Mr. Halevi, for his part, suggested that Mr. Hazan instead \u201coccupy himself with love.\u201dOn Wednesday, the newlyweds concluded their song with a mock marital spat poking fun at the sensibilities of anyone irked by the sound of Arabic, or by the idea of Mr. Halevi and Ms. Aharish living happily ever after.Mr. Halevi grumbled that he was going \u201ccrazy\u201d with \u201cthat masa\u2019a al-kheir\u201d and stalked off the set.\u201cDarling,\u201d Ms. Aharish called after him, as if she would be following him home shortly and would need a shower at the end of her shift, \u201cturn on the hot water, will you?\u201dIsabel Kershner and Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Oscar Bid, Netflix Will Release 3 Movies in Theaters First", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Netflix softened its longstanding view on movie distribution, saying late Wednesday that it would release three prestige movies in a way that it had repeatedly said was a nonstarter \u2014 in cinemas first, and on the streaming service later.Most theater chains, including AMC and Regal, insist on a 90-day period of exclusivity. They worry that moviegoers will be reluctant to buy tickets if they know they can catch the same film just a few weeks (or days) later in their living rooms, and for less money. Single tickets cost $15 or more in New York and Los Angeles. A basic Netflix subscription is $8 monthly.But some independent theaters have been willing to work with Netflix, even when movies are planned for immediate streaming. Netflix booked its drama \u201c22 July\u201d into theaters in about 20 cities in North America in October, for instance, while simultaneously adding the movie to its streaming service.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate. But the move is really about winning Oscars and wooing Hollywood talent.\u201cRoma\u201d will receive the longest exclusive theatrical run, rolling out in cinemas starting Nov. 21 and arriving worldwide on Netflix on Dec. 14. Netflix said \u201cRoma\u201d would eventually be released in theaters in more than 20 countries. Some 70-milimeter presentations are being planned.Scott Stuber, Netflix\u2019s film chief, positioned the exclusivity decision as an evolution and not a retreat.\u201cNetflix\u2019s priority is our members and our filmmakers, and we are constantly innovating to serve them,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur members benefit from having the best quality films from world-class filmmakers,\u201d he added, noting that directors also benefit from the global reach of Netflix\u2019s platform.Now, Netflix must explain to its many other filmmakers why their films do not merit more robust theatrical runs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best TV Shows and Movies New to Netflix Canada in December", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for December, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.What if \u201cSave the Last Dance\u201d were Norwegian? That\u2019s the gist of this teen romance, which sparks the friction between a prim, formal dance student and the hip-hop specialist whose unconventional moves re-energize her on and off the dance floor. As \u201cBattle\u201d opens, the affluent heroine (Lisa Teige) is reeling from her father\u2019s bankruptcy, which has had a devastating effect on her confidence. After she meets a hip-hop dancer (Fabian Svegaard Tapia), their star-crossed collaboration opens her up to the liberating, improvisational world of battle dancing.The choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher (\u201c27 Dresses,\u201d \u201cThe Proposal\u201d) specializes in the sort of lightweight rom-coms and crowd pleasers that Hollywood no longer has much interest in financing. So Fletcher has taken her latest comedy to Netflix, casting Jennifer Aniston as a former beauty queen whose plus-sized daughter, Willowdean, doesn\u2019t seem likely to extend her mother\u2019s pageant dominance. Played by Danielle Macdonald, who had a breakout role in the 2017 Sundance buzz magnet \u201cPatti Cake$,\u201d Willowdean\u2019s confidence wavers when she enters a local pageant to impress a guy she likes and justify her mother\u2019s faith. Dolly Parton worked heavily on the soundtrack, which features six new songs and a few rerecorded versions of older ones.Just two years after Disney turned \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d into a live-action feature, Netflix is offering its own expensive-looking take on the Rudyard Kipling standard (bought from Warner Bros.), with a big-name voice cast (Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch and Naomie Harris, among others) and a director, Andy Serkis, who is known as a pioneer in motion-capture acting. The outlines of \u201cMowgli: Legend of the Jungle\u201d are familiar \u2014 an orphaned \u201cman-cub\u201d (Rohan Chand) raised in the jungles of India goes on to confront his humanity \u2014 but the film is more of a straight-up adventure than either Disney version of \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d which may bring it closer to the Kipling source.Social media and YouTube accounts have created a generation of D.I.Y. celebrities who pitch their selfies, videos and pop-philosophical musings directly to the fans they have cultivated. With \u201cThe American Meme,\u201d the director Bert Marcus attempts to make sense of this phenomenon by speaking to the stars themselves, including Paris Hilton, Emily Ratajkowski, Kirill Bichutsky and Josh Ostrovsky, better known as \u201cThe Fat Jew.\u201d Although many of these subjects lack evident talent \u2014 Ostrovsky, for one, was exposed as a serial joke-stealer \u2014 they share a common savvy for cultivating an audience online and feeding it all the self-promotional nuggets they can manage.In the lead-up to \u201cPaddington,\u201d the cuddly Peruvian bear, with his floppy hat and his marmalade sandwiches, became a frequent subject of Photoshop memes, most of which emphasized his creepy, anthropomorphic look. Then the film came out and the memes stopped cold. It turns out this live-action adaptation of the popular children\u2019s stories by Michael Bond isn\u2019t a mirthless trip to the uncanny valley but a gentle, adorable family comedy about the virtues of kindness and generosity. The sequel got into more complicated slapstick adventure, but \u201cPaddington\u201d keeps it simple, following the young bear as he adjusts to his new urban environs.For seven years, a young woman has been held against her will \u2014 five of those years with her son, who was born in captivity and whose biological father is the monster keeping them in a shed in his backyard. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, \u201cRoom\u201d contends with the twin traumas of confinement and release: The boy (Jacob Tremblay) doesn\u2019t know the world that exists beyond this grim space and his mother (Oscar-winner Brie Larson) has trouble adjusting to life once they escape. The limited setting of the first half, combined with the shocking cruelty and stress inherent in the story, made \u201cRoom\u201d a tough sell, despite excellent reviews. But the performances are exceptional, and it builds to an inspiring (if sobering) testament to human resilience.As a stand-alone theatrical experience, the too-muchness of \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d is difficult to withstand, especially for those who haven\u2019t spent the past few years counting all the Infinity Stones spread among various Marvel properties. The expectation is that viewers will remember each previous film as if they saw it yesterday, or else scramble to catch up on the mythology that leads Thanos (Josh Brolin) to amass the Stones in a diabolical plot for universal domination. \u201cInfinity War\u201d feels like binge-reading a stack of superhero comic books for 149 minutes. And it\u2019s only half the story.The popular HBO series \u201cHard Knocks,\u201d which follows a different N.F.L. team through preseason every year, has long been considered a curse to the teams chronicled by it, which tend to have dismal seasons afterward. The eight-episode documentary series \u201cSunderland \u2019Til I Die\u201d makes that same pain an absolute certainty for English soccer fans and players alike. Over two straight abysmal seasons, the professional soccer team Sunderland A.F.C. performed so poorly that they were relegated to lower leagues, plunging the club into chaos. \u201cSunderland \u2019Til I Die\u201d takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to the team\u2019s humbling first year in EFL League One.After John Grisham dominated the best-seller list \u2014 and, later, the box office \u2014 with legal thrillers in the \u201990s, it\u2019s perhaps fitting that he get a share of the true-crime documentary craze currently sweeping through streaming services and podcast networks. Adapted from his nonfiction book \u201cThe Innocent Man,\u201d the film concerns Ron Williamson, a former minor-league baseball player who was sentenced to death for rape and murder in Ada, Okla., in 1988, but exonerated 11 years later by DNA evidence. The series delves into the startling details of the case and how the conviction was reversed.Given Bruce Springsteen\u2019s renown for playing three-hour concerts in the biggest arenas in America, his decision to play five nights a week at the Walter Kerr Theater, a 960-seat venue in New York City, was a tantalizing change of pace. And while \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d has enjoyed an extended run far beyond its original eight-week stint, tickets were hard to come by, especially once word of its intimate mix of music and theatrical storytelling started to spread. This Netflix taping brings unexpected access to the event, as Springsteen leads an audience through his life story and plays solo version of his songs on acoustic guitar and piano.Patrick S\u00fcskind\u2019s novel \u201cPerfume\u201d has been adapted once before, infamously, as \u201cPerfume: The Story of a Murderer,\u201d a curious and lurid historical thriller from the director of \u201cRun Lola Run,\u201d Tom Tykwer. Now it has been revived and updated as a six-episode German-language series that shifts the action to the present day and switches the genre to a serial-killer procedural. The killer\u2019s modus operandi remains the same \u2014 the victims\u2019 bodies are mined for an intoxicating smell \u2014 but here the grisly murders are rooted in a boarding school where boys discover ways to manipulate people through human scent.Marijuana aficionados tend to consider California\u2019s Humboldt County a mellow source of premium weed, but this six-part documentary series seeks to harsh that buzz. In recent years, dozens of people have gone missing in a community that has been seized by the lawlessness, corruption and violence surrounding the lucrative illegal drug business. The title \u201cMurder Mountain\u201d suggests the case for Humboldt\u2019s troubles will be made bluntly, but it\u2019s a healthy reminder to consumers that the drugs that make them feel good are often sourced from places with a darker vibe.Advertisement"}

But a new effort to focus attention on one of its oldest characters, Mickey Mouse, is truly something to behold.Disney executives describe the effort as a chance to polish the company\u2019s broader brand and remind people \u2014 as Netflix moves deeper into family entertainment and Disney prepares to unveil its own streaming service \u2014 that the Magic Kingdom has been serving up beloved characters for decades. Mickey made his official debut in 1928 in \u201cSteamboat Willie,\u201d Hollywood\u2019s first cartoon with synchronized sound.Disney has billions of dollars in merchandise sales to consider.

A springtime poll by the company showed that 26 percent of the United States population ranked Mickey as a favorite cartoon character, far above the average. Mr. Schafer said Mickey\u2019s appeal was particularly high among Latinos, 39 percent of whom said he was a favorite.Disney\u2019s vast theme park operation is one reason the squeaky-voiced rodent has remained so embedded in the culture.

And the term was starting in T minus 12 hours. All I could do now was pray.Then something amazing happened. God called me! Well not quite, but close enough. My agent. I had auditioned for a film early on in the summer holidays, had heard nothing for two months and had long since concluded that I had not been successful. Yet this was the call from Hollywood myth: \u201cKid \u2026 you\u2019re in the movie.\u201dAs this life-changing news began to sink in, and on top of the relief from narrowly escaping detention, what was most exciting to me was the prospect that this job might be the point after which I could legitimately call myself an actor.I had wrestled with this idea for the last few years. I knew I wanted to be an actor. I had won a place at a top drama school and had even played a small part in a film. Admitting, however, that I was an actor (to anyone who might ask) made me feel like a fraud; I would find myself instead saying things like \u201cI\u2019m trying to be an actor\u201d or \u201c I want to act.\u201d It was like I hadn\u2019t earned the right to the title yet. Surely sharing the screen with Al Pacino would change that.The next few months spent filming this, my first major motion picture, was everything that I could have imagined it would be. It all still feels like a dream, littered with incredible moments, but one in particular stands out.We were filming in a remote part of Luxembourg before a Christmas break that happened to include my 21st birthday. In order to keep morale high the producers hired a private dining room in a restaurant nearby, and twice or three times a week the whole cast would be invited to dinner. Not everyone attended every meal, and I would say on average people went once a week.Not me! I was there Every. Single. Time. I never missed a dinner. It wasn\u2019t for the free food or out of boredom, but because we never knew on which nights Mr. Pacino would turn up. Even if I were never seated anywhere near him, I wasn\u2019t going to miss the opportunity to \u201chave dinner with Al.\u201dNow although Mr. Pacino was always friendly on set, none of my inexhaustible efforts to say something fascinating or hilarious on this evening led to the explosive conversation I had hoped for. Truth be told we barely spoke to one another. The producer on Al\u2019s other side selfishly hogged him for most of the evening, which I felt was rather uncharitable!As we got up to leave, however, and probably in another lame attempt to engage him, I mentioned to Al how cold it was outside. This is how I recall the banter that followed:\u201cCold huh? \u2026 Where\u2019s your leather jacket?\u201dI froze. He sounded like someone doing a clich\u00e9d impression of Al Pacino.\u201cLeather jacket?\u201d I repeated. \u201cUmm. I don\u2019t have one.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201dSilence.\u201cWell you gotta get one,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery actor has to have a leather jacket.\u201dThat was it. Not the most memorable exchange of all time, and undoubtedly forgotten by Al by the time he had stood up and donned his own, impossibly cool leathers.What he couldn\u2019t have known, of course, was that he had answered a much larger question of mine. I could have sworn I had grown a few inches taller. Impostor syndrome be gone \u2014 I was officially an actor. The Godfather himself had declared it!On the way back to the hotel, my head still in the clouds, my dad called to arrange picking me up for the holiday break at the airport.Just before we hung up I heard my mother\u2019s voice interrupt him in the background. \u201cOh, yes, Coxy,\u201d I remember him saying. \u201cMum wants to know what you want for your birthday.\u201dA knowing smile crossed my face. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you mention that \u2026\u201dCharlie Cox is the star of \u201cMarvel\u2019s Daredevil,\u201d now in its third season on Netflix.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice, Italian Style: 9 Years, 13 Trials and Few Answers", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileROME \u2014 Before her brother Stefano died in the prison wing of a Rome hospital on Oct. 22, 2009, Ilaria Cucchi lived what she described as a \u201cnormalissima\u201d life, as a model wife and working mother of two.That all changed after she saw her brother\u2019s body stretched out on a morgue slab, his face emaciated, his eyes ringed by dark purple bruises. It was immediately clear to her that he had been beaten after his arrest a week earlier \u2014 with a stash of hashish and cocaine that he said were for personal use \u2014 and that he might have died as a result.In that moment, she has said countless times in countless interviews and public encounters over the past nine years, looking at the \u201ctortured corpse\u201d of her brother, Ms. Cucchi vowed to establish how he had been allowed to die \u201cin solitude and indifference.\u201dThat quest \u2014 undertaken with unshakable determination \u2014 has transformed Ms. Cucchi into one of Italy\u2019s best-known and admired human rights crusaders. In her search for truth, she has coolly faced down antagonistic prosecutors, law enforcement officials, politicians and news media outlets.But still, after nine years, 13 separate trials and the attendant publicity \u2014 there is even a film about her brother\u2019s final days \u2014 such is the challenge of navigating Italy\u2019s multilayered judicial system that the truth of what happened has not yet fully emerged.\u201cPeople constantly stop and thank me on the street,\u201d she said in an interview in her comfortable Rome apartment this week. \u201cBefore, I\u2019d think, \u2018Why are you thanking me?\u2019 Now, I realize that they recognize what I am doing, what my family has endured. It\u2019s the frustration we all feel when we come up against hostile institutions.\u201dMs. Cucchi\u2019s public appearances draw hundreds, even thousands, of supporters at events, and she has been feted with commendations and awards. She has become a fixture on television talk shows, her appearances often coinciding with a spike in ratings. A Neapolitan street artist recently immortalized her along with Che Guevara and the soccer legend Diego Maradona.Italians have also responded to her indignation at her brother\u2019s death in the custody of institutions \u2014 law enforcement, legal and medical \u2014 that exist to protect citizens.\u201cHe died amid the indifference of others,\u201d Ms. Cucchi said during a break on Wednesday at yet another court hearing. \u201cStefano was seen by 150 people in the week between his arrest and his death \u2014 we counted \u2014 and all of them pretended not to see him,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only did they not act out of human compassion, but none did their duty as public officials.\u201dSome of those 150 people \u2014 medical staff members, social workers, prison guards, lawyers, prosecutors and judges, as well as the Carabinieri officers who first arrested and detained him \u2014 have already been tried in relation to his death. But in nearly all of those cases a final judgment has not been reached. In part, that is because prosecutors and Ms. Cucchi have challenged almost every acquittal, and new investigations have opened more leads.Ms. Cucchi, who is 44, sat attentively throughout Wednesday\u2019s daylong hearing, as she and her parents have done untold times during all those trials. \u201cWe\u2019ve never missed a hearing. Not even with a fever,\u201d she said.The courtroom was packed with television cameras and print reporters, as well as ordinary Romans attracted to the high-visibility case. Ms. Cucchi did not flinch when one witness, a male nurse, described finding her brother dead in his hospital bed during a routine morning call. She did, however, seek out her parents, sitting in the back row of the courtroom, whose suffering through the years has been discernible, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s their son\u201d being talked about, she said.Ilaria Cucchi never expected to end up as one of Italy\u2019s most famous human-rights activists. After high school she worked for her father, a surveyor, before taking a course to become a condominium administrator. She married her high school sweetheart and had two children, Valerio, now 16, and Giulia, 10. \u201cI was happy,\u201d she said.But Stefano\u2019s death and the years of legal battles have turned her life upside down. She separated from her husband, and is now romantically involved with Fabio Anselmo, her family\u2019s lawyer, whom she hired to take her brother\u2019s case. His first piece of advice to her had been to have photographs taken during the autopsy.Those graphic images, which show evident bruising on Stefano\u2019s face and back, did much to sway public opinion. She has brandished the photos on several occasions to draw attention to the case when it risked slipping into general indifference or when the narrative became distorted because of her brother\u2019s past drug use.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot. It shows that people are tired of a justice system\u201d that does not look out for the powerless, she said. \u201cThe state has to stop protecting itself and start protecting citizens.\u201dShe is often suggested as a political hopeful, but after one unsuccessful run for office she claims to have no further aspirations. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing politics, fighting for the rights of the least powerful for the past nine years,\u201d she said.The trial of the five carabinieri involved in Stefano\u2019s arrest now playing out in a Rome courtroom is colloquially known as the Cucchi-bis trial. Three of them have been charged with involuntary manslaughter, the other two with slander and making false statements. The trial took an unexpected turn last month when it emerged in court that one of the five had given testimony last summer admitting to having witnessed two fellow officers brutally beating Stefano. It was the public admission that Ms. Cucchi had been waiting and hoping for.A parallel investigation is underway on a possible cover-up of the crime within the Carabinieri, and prosecutors are looking into accusations of false testimony and falsified documents that are making their way up the chain of command.If Stefano Cucchi\u2019s case was already well known here, thanks to his sister\u2019s perseverance, it became an even greater cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after the presentation in August at the Venice Film Festival of \u201cSulla Mia Pelle,\u201d (\u201cOn My Skin\u201d) a dramatization of his final days, directed by Alessio Cremonini.Ms. Cucchi and her family have also been subject to harassment, mostly through social media. She said she had become a habitu\u00e9 of the local police station, where she regularly files charges against people who have threatened her.\u201cBefore, people used to insult Stefano,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that the truth is emerging, they have begun insulting us.\u201dMs. Cucchi is optimistic that the current trial, which began last year, will lead to the conviction of the Carabinieri officers. A sentence is expected next year, but appeals are, again, likely to follow.She says she has great confidence in the prosecutor trying the case, Giovanni Musar\u00f2, who previously brought mob bosses to trial in southern Italy. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop in front of anything,\u201d she said.As it turns out, neither has she.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thanksgiving Deer Hunt? Sounds Like a Great Time to Talk to the Kids About Guns", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q\u2019SWhen your child expresses anxiety about a family tradition filled with firearms, it\u2019s worth having a discussion about it.We were finalizing our travel plans for Thanksgiving, which we spend with my family in Vermont. Our 13-year-old son, who usually loves going, was hesitant about the trip this year, but he wouldn\u2019t say why. So, we asked his older sister to investigate; they\u2019re close. She told us his reluctance has to do with a family deer hunt that the men and boys go on the morning after the holiday. We told him he didn\u2019t have to go hunting, but he doesn\u2019t want to be around guns at all. Any advice for dealing with this?PETEI\u2019m just speculating, Pete. But if I were your adolescent son, and my short lifetime had included a terrifying spate of school and mass shootings, I would be skittish around guns, too. (Hunters: I\u2019m definitely not equating you with school shooters!) But there\u2019s only one way to figure out what\u2019s really going on here.Parents have to talk with their children about guns and gun violence in an age-appropriate way. Given the frequency of tragedies, it\u2019s only natural for kids to be anxious, even if they never bring the subject up. (It\u2019s often the scariest things we don\u2019t talk about.) Ask your son: Is it hunting that bothers you, or guns in general? How do you cope with your feelings? What can we do to help?The fact that he confided in his sister suggests that he may be ready to explore his feelings. An open conversation with you and his mother may be useful for both kids. If you need help preparing, reach out to a school counselor for resources.In my experience, engaging with fears also helps us manage them. Maybe your family can get involved with a gun safety initiative in your area. Together, talk and action may reduce your son\u2019s stress level (and possibly produce a fix for Thanksgiving).I am a woman in my 20s. Often I plan meals with friends who have their phones out the whole time: scrolling and texting, chatting with me, and eating at the same time. I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve also started dating a guy who seems to think we have to document every date with multiple selfies and post them on social media. I like him, but his posting habit is ridiculous. I know the stuff I\u2019m complaining about is pretty common. But can I get people to tone it down?ALIPossibly, but don\u2019t get your hopes up. I, too, find it annoying when people can\u2019t commit to me (for an hour!) without multiple phone checks. Every glance fractures the conversation. And I\u2019m not shy about speaking up: \u201cLet\u2019s put away our phones. They\u2019re distracting.\u201d Some people can oblige, while others experience immediate phantom phone pain.Here\u2019s the thing: We can be in the moment with someone or on the lookout for moments to post for other people. Many folks try to do both, but multitasking is a slippery tightrope. Consider a compromise with your boyfriend. Dates are just for you two (maybe one post allowed?). If he wants, he can live the rest of his life selfie by selfie.My husband and I eloped. We never hosted a celebratory party, but most of our relatives sent gifts \u2014 except for one branch of the family in California (including a cousin whose wedding we attended and to whom we gave a generous gift). Now, another cousin from the California branch is getting married, and we\u2019re invited. We\u2019re torn about attending and giving a gift. Are we being too sensitive?ANONYMOUSDefinitely! The whole point of eloping is to escape the rituals of a traditional wedding, one of which, typically, is collecting presents from those who attend. It seems that you wanted it both ways: forgo the occasion and still collect the gifts.It\u2019s terrific that your family was mostly generous with you. And you needn\u2019t attend weddings of people who hurt you. But I\u2019d make that decision based on overall feelings of closeness, not just whether they spontaneously sent a gift-wrapped package.My friend became a vegan recently. She goes on at length about the cruelty of killing other living creatures for our food. My husband is skeptical about her conversion at age 40. He thinks she\u2019s jumping on a bandwagon. Problem: She\u2019s giving a potluck dinner and asked guests to bring vegan dishes only. My husband thinks it would be funny to bring meat. (They have a teasing relationship.) You?J.Q.I think your husband needs to punch up his material before he pitches a comedy special to Netflix. Bringing meat would be disrespectful, not hilarious. The terms of the party are pretty clear: Come with a vegan dish or decline the invitation. Your call! But judgments about your friend\u2019s diet are not necessary, and needling her would be a lame gag.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Onscreen, Women Are Giving Patriarchy the Pink Slip", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the #MeToo movement catapulted into the mainstream more than a year ago, survivors around the globe felt more emboldened than ever before to break their silence about sexual abuse at the hands of men. Their stories not only censured the much-deserving perpetrators but also led to a reckoning about gender inequality and misogyny that continues to galvanize society.His wife, Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), cunning and manipulative in her own right yet long suffering under her husband\u2019s oppressive ego, found herself in position to seize the presidency. Even though Claire\u2019s master plan had always been to become president, the fact that she continues on this path in Season 6 \u2014 without a man trying to pull the strings \u2014 is considered an intolerable act of defiance to Frank\u2019s staff, which remains in place even though Claire is in charge. And like life imitating art, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d fans and critics alike voiced concerns about how, quite literally, the show would go on without Spacey \u2014 and whether it should. The series\u2019s bold final season has obliterated all those doubts.But first, Claire has to contend with that male-dominated staff, which, from the moment she steps up, makes it clear that it does not trust her authority and does everything possible to get rid of her, even conspiring to have her assassinated. So she devises a plan of her own to remove each one and is equally cutthroat and unapologetic.Although she effectively gives the patriarchy the pink slip by installing an all-female cabinet, she\u2019s still castigated for simply being a woman exerting power \u2014 something for which Frank would have been heralded. \u201cFrancis was a son of a bitch, but he was a talented son of a bitch,\u201d says the lobbyist Bill Shepherd (Greg Kinnear), one of Claire\u2019s biggest antagonists, implying that her talent remains to be seen and her malice is more self-serving than anything else.Because Claire\u2019s ascension followed Frank\u2019s death, her opponents determine that it is ungrounded, forcing her to work twice as hard just to be taken seriously as a potential threat. But if there is anything this final season has confirmed, it is that \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d has always been perfectly set up for Claire\u2019s shrewd supremacy. Some people were just too busy watching the other guy to notice.But what the brothers aren\u2019t prepared for is that the women, terrified as they may be at first, are willing to go through with what would have been their husbands\u2019 next heist. These widows aren\u2019t superheroes. They\u2019re not trained vigilantes who carry weapons and run up on people inside their homes. These women are people you know who have lost children and businesses and are consistently reminded of their insignificance by men who claim they love them \u2014 to the point that they had been reduced to mere transactions.Veronica is fueled by grief and helplessness after the wrongful death of her son at the hands of the police. Linda is a mother desperate to rewrite her story so she is no longer the wife who watched as her overbearing husband tanked her business and left her with a pile of debt. Alice wants to prove that she is worth more than the cheap sex for which too many men have used her.These are women on the periphery who are fighting the very basic and routine battle for a seat at the table. They refuse to be bullied by men any longer, and now that they\u2019re pushed against the wall, they\u2019re forced to react in ways outside of what is expected of them \u2014 incited by their own fury, untapped tenacity and fear of what can happen to them if they don\u2019t fight back. Ultimately, they become fully realized characters who reciprocate the intimidation and menace that have been used against them. But for them, it\u2019s about finally being seen as more than trinkets who can be disregarded in a world that was not built with their value in mind. It\u2019s about being counted \u2014 and if that has to be through brute aggression at this point, so be it.But they soon rebel against this condition. The \u201cFrankenstein\u201d novelist Shelley (Elle Fanning) goes as far to leave her husband, Percy (Douglas Booth), and demand a public retraction after he tries to convince her that his name on a book so dark is more credible than her own. Colette (Keira Knightley) confronts both her philandering husband, Willy (Dominic West), and gender norms by becoming just as popular in ladies\u2019 bedrooms as he is while using her virility to reclaim authorship of her famous Claudine novels.These characters tackle systems of oppression in their own homes, at work and on the streets, and underscore how fundamentally capable and deserving they are without men setting the terms. They\u2019re moving outside the limits put in place by patriarchs, and occupying spaces from which they\u2019ve been dismissed. As a result, they\u2019re taking back what has always been rightfully theirs: the voices that were stripped from them and the power they\u2019ve now clenched. It\u2019s about time.Advertisement"}

Not much of a sleeper, Offset had run to the store in his lime-green Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. But upon his return, he could hardly stand or speak, and he gripped in his hand a thick Cuban link chain that had fallen from his neck. Everyone was certain he\u2019d been shot.He\u2019d managed to throw his hands up before the airbags deployed, he explained, but the force sent his fists into his mouth, busting up his bottom teeth. His eye socket was broken, and his chest felt like it might cave in, but he was lucky to be alive, the police told him later. Recounting the details, he grew short of breath. He hadn\u2019t been wearing a seatbelt.\u201cSlow down,\u201d Offset said when asked how the accident affected him. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest lesson: Slow down. Take your time. Think through your moves.\u201dYet for a member of the Atlanta trio Migos, the biggest rap group in the world \u2014 one whose M.O. has always been more everything, all the time \u2014 such mantras are hard to put into practice. The day after the crash, bandaged like a bejeweled mummy, Offset was back in the studio.With a new family nucleus and superstardom on the horizon, however, slowing down has still proved challenging. Ten days after Kulture was born in July, Offset was arrested in Georgia and hit with felony charges, including possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, after police discovered three handguns, some marijuana and about $100,000 in cash in his car during a traffic stop. He performed the entire Drake tour while out on bond.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t really know Offset,\u201d he said, because of the group structure and the flashy blog headlines about his various legal and romantic troubles. He allowed that his face, which has a panther-like intensity, is frequently in a scowl and covered in tattoos, making him \u201ca little intimidating.\u201d But he stressed his sense of humor, his obsession with music industry data-watching and his dedication to his mother, stepfather, friends, siblings and children, many of whom surround him at all times.\u201cWhen people talk to me, they\u2019re like, \u2018Damn, bro\u2019 \u2014 and they don\u2019t even notice that I notice them saying, \u2018You ain\u2019t no ignorant [expletive],\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI like that. I\u2019m going to start opening up more.\u201dIn Offset and Cardi\u2019s sparsely decorated mansion in the leafiest part of northern Atlanta, the tags were still on the furniture, the platinum plaques had yet to be hung and the only thing on the kitchen counter was Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir. Just two of the rapper\u2019s nearly a dozen dogs \u2014 Bentley and Fat Mama \u2014 were in the backyard, dining on Waffle House. But down in the basement on a recent Saturday, the home studio was coming together as Migos ended its three-month concert run with three hometown shows.After his personal audio engineer, J Rich, dug through a fanny pack of hard drives and a maze of computer folders titled OFFSET SESSIONS, the rapper\u2019s forthcoming solo tracks blared from the speakers. While some were trademark Migos \u2014 jabbing taunts, boasts and catchphrases \u2014 Offset did, in fact, sound like a different man on songs like \u201cHibernation, \u201cRed Room\u201d and \u201cFather of 4,\u201d his voice softened by vulnerability and his verses edging away from rapid-fire trap imagery toward something more like storytelling.\u201cDaddy on dope/we don\u2019t speak,\u201d he raps on one track, adding on another: \u201cHow I grew up, my mama was my dad.\u201d The preoccupation with fatherhood makes up the core of the album\u2019s emotional content as Offset details his own rebellion; his subsequent experiences with the criminal justice system; and its effects on his mother and children, all of whom he addresses directly with apologies for everything from missing birthdays to his dependence on lean and Percocet.\u201cJordan, my first son \u2014 I was getting locked up trying to feed this\u201d kid, Offset recalled. As a 17-year-old father, \u201cI was hitting licks, breaking into people\u2019s houses to bring it back.\u201d Being a criminal was preferable to being a deadbeat like his own father, whom he last saw when he was around 5, he said. (Offset\u2019s first felony conviction, in 2012, was for possessing stolen property.)But he also maintained that his home life was not to blame for his wayward years. \u201cThat was me being a knucklehead, trying to find the ropes,\u201d he said. He was raised in the Gwinnett County suburbs north of Atlanta, and his mother, Latabia, remains a fixture in his life. (\u201cMama!\u201d is not just a Migos ad-lib; it\u2019s what everyone calls her.)It\u2019s this complex, detail-rich and mostly obscured biography that Offset is beginning to reveal, in fits and starts, on his solo album. Carlos Desrosiers, an A&R executive at Motown Records who has been working with Migos on their individual projects, said, \u201cPeople need to know the story. Nothing\u2019s better than your fans knowing who you are.\u201dStill, the overall message Desrosiers imparted was: \u201cGive \u2019em substance, give \u2019em you.\u201dFor Offset, leaning into his gradual metamorphosis has been a matter of finding confidence in his presence and songwriting, which he said lagged behind the other members\u2019 because of his time in jail.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, I just rolled with the punches,\u201d Offset said of the craziness that came with rejoining the group at various points throughout its ascent. \u201cI just felt like I had to get better at my craft. A lot of people don\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t on choruses because I felt like I couldn\u2019t do them at first.\u201dOn this trip through the legal system, Offset has another ally in his corner: Cardi B. \u201cThe difference that I\u2019ve seen in him lately is that he\u2019s in an adoring, loving relationship,\u201d Findling said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous Cardi fan and in like fashion, she\u2019s a tremendous Kiari Cephus fan.\u201dBusiness is the couple\u2019s romance language. After he scrolled past an Instagram post reporting on the sales for Cardi\u2019s recent fashion partnership, Offset beamed and announced to the room, \u201cMan, my girl sold $10.8 million dollars in three hours,\u201d before FaceTiming her and inquiring about her royalty rate. \u201cYou might as well start adding that money up,\u201d he said.Minutes later, she called back. \u201cThat\u2019s the wife,\u201d Offset said diligently as he fished a second cellphone from his sweatpants pocket and sought some privacy.Settling down was \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s happened to me personally, which helps me make the music, which helps my career,\u201d Offset said, estimating that he had another decade left in music. \u201cI have no distractions. And me and her? We haven\u2019t even dropped an album yet. That\u2019s a whole other realm.\u201d\u201cI have a wife and a child \u2014 that changed my whole everything,\u201d he added. \u201cI was a young hothead, but now I understand the value of life.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the relationship between Offset\u2019s mother, Latabia, and his father-figure, Kevin. Kevin is her ex-husband, not her husband.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The End of Endings", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe age of the sequel is over. Now it\u2019s the age of the sequel to the sequel. Also the prequel, the reboot, the reunion, the revival, the remake, the spinoff and the stand-alone franchise-adjacent film. Canceled television shows are reinstated. Killed-off characters are resuscitated. Movies do not begin and end so much as they loiter onscreen. And social media is built for infinite scrolling. Nothing ends anymore, and it\u2019s driving me insane.Today the tradition of the novel has been supplanted by that of the comic book: Stories extend indefinitely, their plot holes patched through superpower, magic and dreams. Or maybe every story is a soap opera now: Nobody dead is dead forever, not Dan Conner of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and definitely not all of the superhero genocide victims of \u201cInfinity War.\u201d Of course, to Hollywood\u2019s bean counters, sequels are mere brand extensions of intellectual property. But something bigger is happening, too: The logic of the internet is colonizing everything.At the same time, social media is pushing the limits of limitlessness. What Instagram has branded \u201cStories\u201d is an endless feed of images, one-liners and special effects that carries no pretense of progression. All it does is continue.The novel\u2019s bounded story was a technological innovation as much as a formal one. Benjamin wrote of it skeptically, charting its rise alongside the spread of the printing press. But even in 1936, a new form was on the horizon: what he called \u201cinformation.\u201d A novel must end because the physical object of the book will eventually run out of pages. But news wires and radio reports just keep coming, and, as Benjamin put it, \u201cBy now almost nothing that happens benefits storytelling; almost everything benefits information.\u201dFor Hollywood branders, the appeal of endlessness is obvious. And for creators, it can present a tantalizing opportunity: a do-over. A series that was canceled too soon, without the closure of a real ending, can claim one now: \u201cDeadwood\u201d will soon be extended as a TV movie. One that was pushed too far \u2014 like \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d which aired a disappointing final season without its creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino \u2014 can attempt to overwrite the bad feelings with fresh plots.And what do we get? Something to talk about. A Silicon Valley buzzword \u2014 \u201ccommunity\u201d \u2014 seems to apply increasingly to our cultural properties, too. While Mark Zuckerberg sells us his morally suspect advertising vehicle under the banner of global connectivity, Hollywood launders its tedious installments and revivals through appeals to fan service. Marketers may love franchises for their ability to break through the clutter \u2014 a revival sells itself \u2014 but audiences, too, cling to these comforting cultural billboards. The security of recognizable characters and a built-in community that understands the same reference points can supersede the material itself. Criticism gives way to fan theories, with endless possibilities but little significance.At least this story ends.Advertisement"}

Circumstances matter: the kind of turkey; the method of cooking; the amount of free time I have between When I Can Get Out of Work and When the Guests Arrive.For Wednesday dinners, I try to cook without a recipe, in the hopes of passing along a theme on which you might improvise: a no-recipe recipe that\u2019s designed to intrigue. This week: eggs for dinner, on toast, with a mushroom gravy and wilted greens. Start with the gravy: Saut\u00e9 sliced mushrooms in butter until they\u2019ve released their liquid and that liquid is gone. Hit them with salt and pepper, and then with enough cream that it can reduce a little, and you\u2019ll think of it as gravy. Pour the mushrooms and their sauce into a small bowl and wipe out the pan. Heat some olive oil in it over medium-high heat, and toss in a bunch of leafy greens \u2014 some Tuscan kale, for instance \u2014 to wilt them. Put these greens on a plate next to the mushroom gravy and return the pan to the heat. Add olive oil and a pat of butter to melt while you put toast in the toaster. Crack as many eggs as you need into the fat and cook as you like \u2014 I like sunny side up, with lacy edges.Toast is done. Top it with mushroom gravy, then greens and then an egg like a hat.

{"Headline": "3 Books That Take Us Inside the Lives of Britain\u2019s Royals", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistBritain\u2019s modern-day royal household appears to run like a well-oiled machine: It has its own human resources department and employment comes with a standard package of benefits. But it was not always so. In this domestic history of five centuries of palace life, Tinniswood paints a picture of barely controlled chaos.If a flattering history of British royalty exists, this isn\u2019t it, perhaps because no one looks good through the eyes of servants. Sovereigns, courtiers and unruly royal children are cast in unforgiving light as Tinniswood, in some cases quite literally, airs their dirty laundry. While a few sympathetic characters emerge, for the most part members of the royal family appear variously insane, opportunistic, petulant and mercurial.Pulled from ledgers, maps and other correspondence, this is a chronicle of beleaguered officials\u2019 attempts to impose some structure and economy on the royal household. The subjects are equerries and clerks, courtiers and grooms of the stool (an office that, in its original incarnation, was responsible for keeping the sovereign company during his or her bowel movements). A good portion of the people employed by the royals appear to have been freeloaders.Tinniswood is constrained by the source materials available to him, which at times can make for dry reading. This is a history of stuff as much as people, especially in the early years: food, jewels, robes, tapestries, renovations. Procuring, managing and distributing the goods the royal household needs seems to be half the job of maintaining the crown. However, the author displays a knack for uncovering the absurd and delightful. A wit borne of a deep intimacy with his subject shows through. It all has the effect of bringing the monarchy down to earth. Behind the somewhat surreal pomp and pageant, Tinniswood reveals the all-too-human reality of royalty.Legend has it that if the ravens of the Tower of London ever leave, the kingdom will fall. Hence the need for a ravenmaster. And that\u2019s where Skaife comes in. In this memoir, he dives into the day-to-day minutiae of the birds\u2019 care and keeping, their habits and history, and the journey that led him to become their steward.As ravenmaster, a post he took up after more than two decades of military service, Skaife is responsible for more than just the birds. He serves as a tour guide, a ceremonial guard and an amateur historian, bridging the distance between Britain\u2019s past and present. An earnest and exuberant custodian, he\u2019s enthralled by the mythologies of the ravens and the storied, haunted tower they inhabit.His esoteric topic at times clashes with the clunky colloquialisms Skaife deploys when talking about himself. He identifies with the birds, drawing parallels between his identity as a soldier and the symbolism of the ravens, since both are associated with death. But to his readers the connection can feel like a bit of a stretch \u2014 personally meaningful but not particularly effective on the page.Thankfully, the awkward analogizing is soon forgotten as Skaife plumbs the depths of his knowledge of raven lore, of their place in history and in literature. And he becomes more poetic in his recollections of his life as he shares memories from his time in the military and his love for his wife.Ultimately, Skaife\u2019s enthusiasm is contagious. He is entirely likable, and even if the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for his memoir isn\u2019t immediately clear, the corner of British history that he lives, breathes and embodies is illuminated by his efforts.Before a media circus engulfed Princess Diana, her children and eventually their spouses, there was the first celebrity prince, who briefly became King Edward VIII. The media darling of the American and British press, Prince Edward was for a while considered the greatest hope for the monarchy. Of course, he\u2019s best known now for abdicating the throne in order to marry his divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. More recently, the prince was portrayed rather unflatteringly on the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown.\u201dThe Prince Edward of Powell\u2019s account is somewhat more sympathetic. Here he\u2019s seen as an enthusiast of all things American, the modernizing and \u201cdemocratic\u201d prince of the people, the celebrity and would-be king. Powell traces the influence of this American connection on Edward\u2019s personal identity, and on his ultimate, unprecedented decision. Edward\u2019s Americanization, Powell says, fundamentally altered his sense of himself, separated him from his family and sowed the seeds for his abdication. The argument is convincing and serves as a corrective for histories that have laid the blame for his action squarely at Wallis Simpson\u2019s feet.In writing a history of Edward\u2019s life through this perspective, Powell has chronicled the story of America\u2019s growing cultural, political and economic power as seen through foreign eyes. The United States of the prince\u2019s imagination is a familiar one, consonant with America\u2019s own dominant narrative about itself: full of possibility, innovation, freedom and adventure. The telling, probably by design, illuminates much about the prince and his country, but little new about America.As readable as it is dense, Powell\u2019s book is rich and thorough, expertly crafted and completely accessible. An adept storyteller and historian, Powell manages to humanize a monarch who has at times been dwarfed by the voluminous publicity surrounding his abdication.Emma L. McAleavy is a former news assistant at The Times and Fulbright fellow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Fallout Ruptures Democrats\u2019 Longtime Alliance With Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut those tensions burst into open warfare this past week after revelations that Facebook executives had withheld evidence of Russian activity on the platform for far longer than previously disclosed, while employing a Republican-linked opposition research firm to discredit critics and the billionaire George Soros, a major Democratic Party patron.Democrats now face a painful reckoning with longtime friends in the tech industry, relationships girded by mutual interest in issues like immigration and cemented with millions of dollars in campaign contributions.It reinforced criticism from the left \u2014 by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, among others \u2014 that Amazon, Facebook and Google are unaccountable monopolies, digital analogues to the railroad trusts of the Gilded Age.And it complicated life for tech\u2019s remaining allies in the party, such as Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a voracious fund-raiser and a tech booster whose relationship with Facebook goes back almost a decade.\u201cI think 2016 exposed the dark side of technology,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, a Bay Area Democrat. Widely considered friendly with the tech industry, Mr. Khanna criticized Facebook on Friday for its aggressive tactics, and said the company should \u201ccertainly fire the people who were in any way involved in the decision to peddle opposition research.\u201dThe clash intensified on Friday when four Democratic senators wrote to the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide more details about Facebook\u2019s lobbying activities. The lawmakers also raised a potentially more explosive issue: whether Facebook had ever used its own data and platform against critics.\u201cWe need to know if Facebook, or any entity affiliated with or hired by Facebook, ever used any of the vast financial and data resources available to them to retaliate against their critics, including elected officials who were scrutinizing them,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats who wrote the letter.\u201cAs more and more information comes out about how these guys operate, it\u2019s becoming conventional wisdom among Democrats that there is a serious policy problem here,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated.\u201cThese companies are not credible,\u201d Mr. Stoller added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s becoming clear to Democrats that they aren\u2019t friends \u2014 they are the problem.\u201dFacebook cut ties with the opposition research firm this past week even as executives there denied acting improperly.\u201dOur strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\u201d said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, in an interview with CBS on Friday. \u201cIt was not what I was doing, nor was it the company\u2019s strategy, to deflect, to deny or to hire P.R. firms to do things.\u201dBut Facebook and other tech companies now face increasing criticism from within their own ranks. In an interview, Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce and a major donor to Democratic causes, said his industry faced \u201ca tension between trust and growth.\u201d\u201cThese companies are going to have to recognize that they have to change,\u201d Mr. Benioff added. \u201cAnd the C.E.O.s have to change.

In 2011, he joined Ms. Sandberg to announce the opening of the company\u2019s first East Coast engineering office, in New York City, where he had worked to promote start-ups and other tech businesses.In 2015, Ms. Sandberg co-hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer in her Bay Area home, according to a Facebook employee briefed on the event. (The same trip featured a Schumer fund-raiser held by Bruce Sewell, then Apple\u2019s general counsel, and attended by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, according to an executive who declined to be named.).By the end of the 2016 cycle, Mr. Schumer had raised more money from Facebook employees than any other Washington lawmaker. All told, Senate Democrats have benefited from over $3 million in political contributions from Facebook\u2019s employees and founders over the years.Relations began to cool after the 2016 elections, when evidence mounted that Facebook and YouTube had become fertile ground for foreign interference and domestic misinformation, threatening not only the party\u2019s values but also its electoral prospects.Early last year, Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat, walked over to the Capitol to deliver a warning to Mr. Schumer, newly elected as Democratic minority leader.Mr. Tester\u2019s warning grabbed the attention of Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, who began to press Facebook and other social media companies to fix the problem.Disinformation was a particular focus for Mr. Schumer, according to an aide with knowledge of the senator\u2019s thinking. In March last year, Mr. Schumer summoned Adam Mosseri, then a vice president overseeing Facebook\u2019s News Feed feature, for a briefing on how the company would limit the spread of bogus news and propaganda. He later sent two aides to Silicon Valley to keep pressure on executives at Facebook, Google and Twitter.But as it became clear that the companies had understated their problems \u2014 and were moving slowly to fix them \u2014 the senator steered a middle course. When he and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, unveiled the party\u2019s \u201cBetter Deal\u201d platform for the midterm elections, a proposal to attack \u201ccorporate monopolies\u201d focused on airlines, beer companies and eyeglass makers.\u201cI am more sympathetic because I think they\u2019re in very difficult position and I worry about government regulation,\u201d he said.Mr. Warner\u2019s growing focus on privacy concerns led to a clash with Mr. Schumer, who confronted Mr. Warner in July, The Times reported this week, warning him to back off Facebook.Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that the senator \u201cworried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence Committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important for Facebook to recognize that this isn\u2019t a public relations problem \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Facebook previously signaled that it was ready to work with Mr. Warner and others in Congress on new regulation. Yet at the same time, Facebook turned to a conservative opposition research firm that sought to undermine detractors by publicizing financial links to Mr. Soros, a harsh critic of both Facebook and Google.\u201cTheir mantra has been, \u2018We\u2019re different, we\u2019re special, we\u2019re tech, all we do is good,\u2019\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees consumer protection and data security. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to find out, very graphically, that they do a lot of harm, and in fact they cover up the harm they do.\u201dHe added, \u201cTech is now like every other industry, in my view.\u201dJack Nicas and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Chef Behind \u2018Salt Fat Acid Heat\u2019 on Her Most Prized Possession", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Story of a ThingSamin Nosrat recalls the time she crossed the country to help a friend host an unforgettable night \u2014 and received a one-of-a-kind keepsake.Three years ago, Sarah and her partner had to cull their flock for the first time. That October, a local guy who does the slaughtering and butchering came over. Sarah and her partner decided to have a lamb roast \u2014 their first party on the farm \u2014 both because they\u2019d culled the lambs and because they\u2019d finally renovated the barn enough to invite people to sit down at tables. I told them I\u2019d come out from the West Coast and cook.The farm is gorgeous but very bare-bones. They didn\u2019t have a kitchen, so we essentially built a rudimentary outdoor one. We cooked everything over fire using oil barrels and dragged over a hose so there\u2019d be running water. We harvested Sarah\u2019s vegetable garden and made a delicious salsa from all the green tomatoes and a huge green salad using all the kale. I\u2019d never cooked squash under coals, but I made a coal bed and stuck the squash in there. I made lamb asado.Cooking for my friends is where I really bring it. Same thing, I think, with florists like Sarah. When you get hired for a job, it\u2019s one thing, but when you get to do it for yourself, you put all your crazy ideas into practice. We were able to do something that was really spectacular and beautiful. You can\u2019t produce that magic on demand.Sarah had built tables, made a gorgeous chandelier out of fall leaves from around the farm, used these little ears of Indian corn for name cards and bought a bunch of Civil War-era silverware from Etsy. She knew when to bring out the disco ball and speakers. We were people who knew how to throw a big party.Around 75 or 80 people came, and we camped in tents on the property. It was this funny crew of people who were bonded by hard work, ultimately \u2014 the work to bring this artistic vision to life. There was no money, no magazine article, there was nothing \u2014 we were just doing it for ourselves.My \u201cpayment\u201d for cooking this meal was the sheepskin from one of the young rams they had culled. Sarah gave it to me the next time I visited the farm. She has this funny sense of humor, so they had named the lambs that year after \u201cTop Gun\u201d characters, and this guy was Iceman. It sits on the couch in my little apartment, and I\u2019m grateful I get to experience it every day.This interview has been edited and condensed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Wins Chinese Approval for Fox Deal, Clearing Major Hurdle", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company said on Monday that Chinese regulators had unconditionally approved its purchase of 21st Century Fox assets, pushing the $71.3 billion deal closer to completion.Disney\u2019s takeover of most of 21st Century Fox was initially expected to be completed by June of next year. On an earnings-related conference call with analysts on Nov. 8, however, Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said he expected the deal to close \u201cmeaningfully earlier.\u201dDisney is buying the Fox television studio, which has more than 30 series in production, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio, which controls the \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d franchises. Also coming to Disney will be the cable networks FX and National Geographic; a controlling stake in Hulu, which has more than 20 million subscribers; and Star, a fast-growing media company in India.Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wanted: 12 People Willing to Serve as Jurors in El Chapo Trial", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWanted: Twelve people who can take four months off work and who don\u2019t mind sitting in judgment of a man said to be the most notorious criminal of the 21st century. Payment: About $40 a day.Picking a jury is always hard, but it is even more so when the defendant on trial is Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the former head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, a man accused of trafficking drugs by the ton and of having a hand in at least 30 murders.Still, as jury selection started Monday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, it was largely smooth sailing as the potential jurors seemed to evince little fear of the man who sat across from them, silent but watchful, in a navy blue suit and a crisp white shirt that was open to his sternum.Amid questions about their views on marijuana, their feelings about law enforcement and their fluency in Spanish, only one said that she was afraid of Mr. Guzman. Another admitted that the words \u201cEl Chapo\u201d mostly made him think about a bagel sandwich served by a deli near his workplace that was named for the defendant. A third spent most of his time as he was questioned talking about his job as a Michael Jackson impersonator.Many of the jurors said they recognized Mr. Guzman\u2019s name and had at least heard that he was an international kingpin who had famously escaped from two Mexican prisons. Of the 46 people questioned on Monday by Judge Brian M. Cogan, 17 were dismissed, most of them because they said they could not be fair to Mr. Guzman or because the long trial would cause a financial hardship.Security was exceedingly tight. The courthouse was guarded by marshals, local court officers, a bomb-sniffing dog and a heavily armed tactical team of New York City police officers. Precautions like these apparently unnerved one potential juror, who admitted that the prospect of deciding Mr. Guzman\u2019s fate made her feel \u201cunsafe.\u201d\u201cWhat scares me is I read that his family will come after jurors and their families,\u201d the woman said. She added that she knew that Mr. Guzman had two sons who were still at large. When a defense lawyer asked her if that made her nervous, she admitted that it did.But the sobering facts at the heart of the case did not preclude jury selection from veering at times into the absurd. There was, after all, the juror who noted that his local deli had a sandwich called the \u201cEl Chapo.\u201dWilliam Purpura, one of Mr. Guzman\u2019s lawyers, wanted to explore this coincidence, asking what precisely the sandwich was made of. It was, as it turned out, a bagel with cream cheese, capers and lox, the man explained.\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s called the \u2018El Chapo,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s delicious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Anyone Slow Down the Chiefs\u2019 Offense? Try the Chargers", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Kansas City Chiefs have possessed the ball for 5 hours 23 minutes and 1 second this season, and they have used that time, about as long as a solid Netflix binge, to recalibrate how offensive football is played in the N.F.L.Kansas City would welcome a rematch \u2014 with either team. Both, really. The Chiefs don\u2019t play this weekend, but before the playoffs \u2014 and, quite possibly, during them \u2014 they will encounter an opponent that appears equipped to slow them, a defense that coaxes interceptions and excels in the red zone and might prevent them from scoring so darn quickly and often.That team lurks in the Chiefs\u2019 division \u2014 the A.F.C. West \u2014 and just happens to be visiting Arrowhead Stadium in mid-December.That is when the Chiefs conclude their season series with the Los Angeles Chargers, three months after the teams opened in California with a 38-28 Kansas City victory. Back then, Mahomes tossed four touchdown passes in a performance that introduced his otherworldly talents. He has blossomed since then, and Kansas City\u2019s offense has evolved, but so have the Chargers (7-3), whose combination of pass-rushers and playmakers in the secondary has helped them seize fifth place in the A.F.C., which will be the top wild-card spot if they hold on.Since losing to the Rams in Week 3, the Chargers have won six of seven games. Over that stretch, they have allowed the fewest points in the league, an average of 16.6, because of their stinginess in the red zone, where opponents have scored touchdowns against the Chargers only 47.1 percent of the time, the fourth-best mark in the N.F.L.The Chargers stopped a late, go-ahead 2-point conversion in a 20-19 victory against Tennessee in Week 7, and then after their bye prevented Seattle from scoring a touchdown on the final play that could have forced overtime. The Chargers have forced four turnovers in red-zone situations, a figure matched only by Miami, while allowing a 68.4 passer rating that ranks second in the league, according to PFF.Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley coached the Seahawks\u2019 Legion of Boom secondary in its embryonic stages. He had an intimidating strong safety, Kam Chancellor, with diverse talents: Chancellor was an enforcer against the run, a dynamo in coverage, an asset in the pass rush. Now with the Chargers, Bradley has a promising equivalent in the rookie Derwin James, the 17th pick of the draft.Like Chancellor, James aligns mostly in the box but has ranged all over the field. He leads all safeties in sacks, with four, and pressures (sacks, hits and hurries), with 15. His 35.7 pressure percentage, according to PFF, is best among the 25 safeties with at least 12 pass-rush snaps this season.As teams more regularly deploy three- and four-receiver sets, defenses counter by playing more defensive backs, amplifying the significance of slot cornerbacks. The best are versatile enough to cover smaller, faster receivers, like Julian Edelman of New England, or athletic tight ends like Travis Kelce of Kansas City, while also providing run support and, at times, aiding a blitz.In Desmond King, the Chargers have a superb nickel corner. He has faced more targets in the slot without allowing a touchdown (38) than any other defensive back, according to PFF, while limiting quarterbacks to a league-low 62.2 passer rating when throwing his way \u2014 partly a product of his three interceptions.What could undermine the Chargers\u2019 defense is its diluted front seven, which lost linebacker Denzel Perryman and defensive tackle Corey Liuget to season-ending injuries and has yielded at least 103 rushing yards in each of the last five games. In other words, even if the Chargers manage to suppress Mahomes and the league\u2019s most creative passing offense, they still have to contend with Kareem Hunt, the A.F.C.\u2019s leading rusher.The Chargers will have their own expectations to draw from, plus almost a season\u2019s worth of Chiefs tendencies to study and parse and explore. They hope to do better than last time, better than others who have struggled. Their best might just be good enough.Advertisement"}

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.Of course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly. Just this year, the combined market value of those five companies has tumbled 7 percent or more during three separate periods. In each instance, the stocks resumed their march to fresh highs within weeks.The question now, though, is whether this time will be different.An earlier version of this article misstated the combined market value of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet at the end of August. It was $3.6 trillion, not $3.6 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of Turkey Brining", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDear Thanksgiving cooks of America: On behalf of food writers everywhere, I apologize.But like the length of a trouser leg, turkey fashion shifts. Interviews with the big players in food media over the past few weeks suggest that the wet, salty turkey has lost its appeal among many of the people who once did the most to promote it.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to admit evolution has occurred with my cooking, and I\u2019ll go on record as someone who has a great brine recipe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut right now I am in a no-brining phase.\u201d Why the change of heart on brining? \u201cIt\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s wonky. It\u2019s ambitious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t always love the texture.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s essentially koshering,\u201d said Miriam Morgan, the food editor who oversaw the newspaper\u2019s project. Now retired, she will be brining again this year, as she has ever since that recipe was developed.\u201cThe reason I think it all started was because back then pretty much all we had were mass-produced turkey, which had no flavor, so you were trying to put more flavor and moisture back into the turkey,\u201d she said. \u201cThe turkey is delicious, so end of story.\u201dThanksgiving brining recipes flourished through the early 2000s, when Cook\u2019s Illustrated issued a definitive endorsement of the method. Christopher Kimball, its former editor, said brining was the most popular turkey method the magazine had ever developed when he led America\u2019s Test Kitchen.That\u2019s in no small part because the process was ready-made for writers who wanted to dig deep into its scientific side. Articles explained how sodium attaches itself to intertwined muscle proteins, weakens them and makes them separate so salty water can force itself deeper into the turkey and stay there. Brined fibers don\u2019t contract as much when they cook, and hold more moisture.\u201cSince I cook Thanksgiving in Vermont, I have a tiny kitchen and one not-too-large fridge, so there ain\u2019t no room for it,\u201d he wrote in a recent email. \u201cI just braise the bloody thing.\u201d\u201cI was saying brining works, if you\u2019re O.K. with watery meat, essentially,\u201d he explained in a recent interview.Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s tests involved cooking and analyzing three turkey breasts and 24 chicken breasts in various states of salting. Brining, he contended, gives poultry the texture of luncheon meat. In addition, the molecules in cider, herbs and other flavorings are too large to penetrate the membrane surrounding the meat before the salt molecules do, and so they fail to carry much flavor into the turkey.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s useless,\u201d he said of wet-brining, \u201cbut it\u2019s not worth the effort, because I think you get better results from dry-brining.\u201dWhat you might call the dry-brine era began quietly in 2006, when Russ Parsons, then a former (and future) food editor at The Los Angeles Times, was desperate for a new approach to holiday turkey.On Mr. Parsons\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Rodgers tried dry-brining and liked it. In homage, he called it the Judy Bird. The method could not be simpler: Use a tablespoon of salt for each five pounds of meat. Rub it into the breasts and thighs, sprinkle some inside and let the turkey sit in the refrigerator for a few days. Allow it to air-dry in the fridge for eight hours if you want the skin crisper.The result is well-seasoned, succulent meat without the hassle of all that water and the salt-choked drippings. You can even dry-brine a frozen turkey while it thaws, he discovered.But it was clear that wet-brining was on its way out, and this year it seems to have hit bottom. Even dry-brining is losing its appeal in some households. Time seems more precious than ever. Politics have exhausted us all. Perhaps it\u2019s time to simplify.The trick, he explained, is to treat the meat the way barbecue pit masters treat pork: Cook it low and slow, so the proteins don\u2019t seize up and squeeze out moisture, then thinly slice the white meat (to an eighth of an inch if you can) and soak it in a jus made with wine, stock and drippings.It\u2019s easy enough to recreate the effect in the kitchen. Simply roast the turkey at 325 degrees on a rack over a roasting pan until the thigh hits about 160 degrees. (Mr. Goldwyn suggests just roasting the turkey on the oven rack itself, with a pan below it to catch juices. Proceed with that at your own risk, or just use your V-rack and call it a day.)While the turkey roasts, simmer the ingredients for the jus on the stove. Then mix the drippings into the jus. You can even save some of the jus to whisk into a roux for gravy, which you\u2019ll want for mashed potatoes and traditionalists.Still, that method may end up going the way of turkey trends past. In some cooking circles, even turkey itself is on the way out.This year, Ms. Nosrat is taking a hard turn toward a turkey-free holiday. Guests at her Bay Area table will enjoy Dungeness crab and fried chicken with lots of vegetables.\u201cI get that it has a sentimental place,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I am so over turkey.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated who the food editor of The Los Angeles Times was in 2006. It was Leslie Brenner, not Russ Parsons, who was food editor from 1999 to 2002 and from 2008 to 2014.Advertisement"}

Our country, it\u2019s in such a state right now.\u201d She declined to comment on terms of the deal.\u201cWe want to honor her legacy,\u201d Mr. Elliott said in a separate interview. \u201cHer artistry and her genius are alive in every frame.\u201dAnchored by an 11-minute version of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d the record includes definitive interpretations of songs like \u201cMary Don\u2019t You Weep,\u201d a slavery-era spiritual. The Rev. James Cleveland, the pioneering gospel singer, was on hand to introduce Ms. Franklin. Mick Jagger sat in a pew toward the back.Frustrated film editors at Warner Bros., which financed the shoot, ultimately gave up, having missed the 1972 release of the \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d album. Mr. Pollack turned to a new directing project, \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford. And the \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d negatives began to gather dust in the Warner vaults.Mr. Elliott, who had been obsessed with the lost footage since working as a music executive in the mid-1980s, ultimately persuaded Warner to sell him the reels in 2007. (He mortgaged his house.) By 2010, digital technology had evolved to a point that syncing film and sound was finally possible.Film insiders speculated that the release of the movie, which ends with a young Ms. Franklin performing \u201cNever Grow Old,\u201d was simply too difficult for the ailing singer to confront \u2014 that she knew it amounted to a eulogy.\u201cThere was clapping and crying,\u201d Ms. Owens said.Mr. Elliott said that he spoke to Ms. Owens as he left for the airport and she said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dAnd the dramatic late arrival of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d is sure to shake up the race for best documentary at the Oscars. The film\u2019s producers may also try for a best picture nomination.\u201cAretha would want us going for a best picture,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cAnd she\u2019d want to win, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
