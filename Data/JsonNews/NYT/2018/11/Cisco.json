{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201dTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Advertisement"}

(What is that like?!)Supported byMr. Raz cuts in, astonished. \u201cBut half a billion dollars \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, wow.\u201d\u201cTwo billion is more,\u201d Mr. Saban says.\u201cWas money \u2014 becoming really rich \u2014 did that motivate you?\u201d Mr. Raz asks a moment later.There\u2019s a moment like this in every episode of How I Built This. The guest has let his or her guard down and revealed something intimate, or financial, or financially intimate, and Mr. Raz keeps the disclosures rolling by reacting with total marvelment.The Betterment chief executive Jon Stein, whom Mr. Raz stokes with 12 individual \u201cwow\u201ds, details an agonizing split with his partners. The Cisco co-founder Sandy Lerner, amid 15 of Mr. Raz\u2019s wows, tells about being ousted from her own company. Eighteen further wows get Bobby Trussell, who created the Tempur-Pedic mattress empire, to describe a breakthrough moment with the Brookstone chain of stores: \u201cTalk about high-fiving!\u201dThe jewel in Mr. Raz\u2019s earbud empire remains How I Built This. Produced by NPR, the series began in September 2016 with Mr. Raz interviewing the Spanx founder Sara Blakely, setting the tone that it would be about business without being stodgy.\u201cYes, the baseline is that somebody eventually is going to make a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Raz says. But the show succeeds because it taps into something deeper: \u201cWho are you when you\u2019re on the bathroom floor in the fetal position, crying because you are not going to make it to the next day?\u201dIn each installment, Mr. Raz takes listeners on a journey through the free market toward some of capitalism\u2019s most glorious finales: Howard Schultz builds Starbucks, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger build Instagram, Eileen Fisher builds Eileen Fisher.\u201cBusiness is filled with crisis and failure and sadness and tension and discomfort and then triumph,\u201d Mr. Raz says. He calls How I Built This a show about vulnerability. And it is \u2014 in that it is a show about how much we will do to our lives and ourselves for money, and how vulnerable we are in the face of the enormous desire for capital and power. Mr. Raz gets founders to open up and tell wrenching stories about sacrifices, late nights, self-doubt and the mistakes that led to success.How Mr. Raz built How I Built This is inseparable from his interview voice of constant wonder.Mr. Raz sounds like no matter what he is saying, he is also saying \u201cWow.\u201dWhen he says \u201cbillions,\u201d he pops the \u201cB.\u201dIf a voice could be wearing pool-blue acrylic glasses, his would be. When I meet Mr. Raz, he is.The biggest name in business podcasts arrives at a Berkeley coffee shop on a cargo bike. The back has seats for his sons to ride, and in front Mr. Raz has installed a grocery rack. He shows me a layer of padding that is present specifically to keep farmers-market tomatoes from bruising on the ride home.\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s Nellie Bowles!\u201d is how he says hello to me, and to almost anyone whose name he knows. To be on the receiving end of this welcome is delightful, like we are all CEOs to this buoyant man.Mr. Raz seems as surprised as anyone that he has emerged as one of capitalism\u2019s biggest boosters. His background is not in business, but in globe-trotting radio journalism: He was NPR\u2019s Berlin bureau chief by 25, then London bureau chief; he covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and spent two years with CNN in Jerusalem; then he returned to NPR, where he was the defense correspondent and finally the weekend host of All Things Considered.In 2012, feeling ground down at 37, Mr. Raz left the news cycle. He started working on the TED Radio Hour, which is co-produced with NPR and explores one big human experience per episode, like \u201cWhy do we have the capacity to imagine?\u201dAnd to Mr. Raz, no stories captured the human experience as much as clawing out a living. \u201cThe question from everyone was, \u2018What makes this different from Bloomberg and CNBC?\u2019\u201d Mr. Raz said. \u201cAnd the case I was making was: I\u2019m not looking for news, I\u2019m not interested in your fourth-quarter strategy, I\u2019m looking to get into your heart and mind.\u201dHe decided from the start that How I Built This would feature only entrepreneurs he liked. He spends months researching them before an interview to make sure they align with what he and his team want to put into the world.\u201cWe had this responsibility to find people who kind of reflected a certain way of doing business,\u201d Mr. Raz says. \u201cPeople we think are generally kind. Are generally moral and ethical. Did you run your business honestly? Did you treat people well?\u201dHe also demands that those who sit for an interview are completely open. \u201cI ask them, \u2018Are you willing to come to this interview and surrender?\u2019\u201d he says.Some people say no. But most yield. They do so because they know that at the moment their belly is upturned, their worst decisions laid bare, Mr. Raz will guide them gently back to where they both know this is going: success. He does not consider himself a reporter anymore, he says.Mr. Raz insists that he is not trying to glorify money, even if his show occasionally does just that. \u201cThere are definitely people who believe in a world, a just world, or a more equal world that would find How I Built This offensive,\u201d he says. He worries about this, and he wants to make it clear that the free market just happens to be where he found a narrative groove.\u201cThere aren\u2019t an infinite number of narrative arcs,\u201d he says, citing Joseph Campbell\u2019s theory of storytelling archetypes. \u201cIt\u2019s like how every romantic comedy is the same movie with slight differences.\u201dThe arcs Mr. Raz describes are finding an audience. His podcasts have a combined monthly audience of 19.2 million downloads. In the coffee shop, Mr. Raz tries to argue that this does not necessarily mean he has become a celebrity himself.\u201cI know the numbers but, you know, look,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of the day, nobody knows who I am.\u201d A few minutes later, the man sitting next to us interrupts, apologizes, and says he just has to tell Mr. Raz that his wife is a big fan.In October, in San Francisco, Mr. Raz hosted the How I Built This Summit \u2014 the largest event of its kind that NPR has ever put on. The session was held in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the same space where Apple used to introduce its gadgets, and its 850 spots, costing between $699 and $899 a person, quickly sold out. Featuring the Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, the Stitch Fix co-founder Katrina Lake, the Lyft co-founder John Zimmer, and the Carol\u2019s Daughter founder Lisa Price, the event established Mr. Raz as one of radio\u2019s most marketable personalities, up there with the likes of Ira Glass and Terry Gross.I meet Mr. Raz for a second time backstage. He\u2019s alone in the dark and seems sedated. I get a softer \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s Nellie Bowles.\u201dOnstage, though, Mr. Raz switches on his persona: bounding, effusive and handsome in a clean-cut way. His hair maintains an immaculate side part. He looks like a game-show host or the dad in a TV show from the 1950s.Everyone is celebrated. It\u2019s like a kinder, less carnivorous \u201cShark Tank.\u201dMr. Gebbia comes onstage for a chat. Mr. Raz asks, \u201cWhat was your trough of sorrow?\u201d He jokes that this is exposure therapy, and he\u2019s the therapist.At the entrance to the theater, American Express has sponsored a selfie-friendly wall display of blue hats with block letters on the front: \u201cMoney Manager,\u201d \u201cHype Person,\u201d \u201cCEOOOOO,\u201d \u201cMaster Motivator.\u201d Jenelle Isaacson, who owns a real estate brokerage in Portland, Ore., and her 11-year-old daughter are in line to take pictures.\u201cThis is the podcast she\u2019s always requesting in the car,\u201d Ms. Isaacson says. \u201cAnd then we found out she\u2019s listening to it while she\u2019s doing her homework.\u201dThe energy is jarringly friendly for a tech conference, possibly because the How I Built This audience skews slightly female, with an average age of 28. In a Summit bathroom, one woman turns to another and says, \u201cThis is weird, but I just wanted to tell you, your hair looks great.\u201d The second woman responds that she was just about to say the same thing.Several of Mr. Raz\u2019s fans tell me they consider the show basically an M.B.A. course. His founder interviews function as case studies. Listeners get inspired. Many say the show makes them feel less lonely. Others say they cue up an episode when their business is a mess and they need a kick of enthusiasm. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m having one of those days, when I think I\u2019m going to quit, I listen to one,\u201d says Jenny Brien, 35, the founder of Snohomish Pie Company in Seattle. Sometimes she listens to the same episode over and over again.\u201cI won\u2019t hire someone at Rent the Runway unless they\u2019ve listened to my How I Built This interview,\u201d Ms. Hyman says. \u201cYou can\u2019t listen to that podcast without understanding who I am as a person and a leader. It gets to the core of me. There\u2019s nothing more authentic to me as a person than that interview.\u201dAcross the street from Mr. Raz\u2019s event, his wife, a consultant named Hannah Raz, is catching up with their friends Stewart Butterfield, the founder of Slack, and Jen Rubio, who co-founded the smart-luggage start-up Away.Ms. Raz is not quite sure how to describe Mr. Raz\u2019s hobbies without making him sound \u201clike such an NPR dad.\u201d Truly, it is difficult. \u201cHe loves to cook,\u201d she says. \u201cHe made his own almond milk, but moved on because of water issues, so now he makes cashew milk.\u201dMr. Raz, she says, is obsessed with kale and tries to eat paleo. He is awake and ready to go each day at 5:30 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of things that don\u2019t make him sound so precious,\u201d Ms. Raz says.Mr. Butterfield jumps in. \u201cOh, I can help,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the cast-iron pans.\u201d\u201cHe does love to oil his cast-iron pans,\u201d Ms. Raz says, resigned to the emerging narrative.\u201cAnd coconut aminos, carbon-neutral beef,\u201d Ms. Rubio chimes in. \u201cAnd the salmon.\u201d\u201cOh god,\u201d Ms. Raz says.Mr. Raz\u2019s unchecked enthusiasm across subject areas, from Alaskan seafood to risk-adjusted returns on capital, helps to explain how he came to create a founder-friendly podcast at a cultural moment that is trending anti-start-up, if not anticapitalist. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are constantly in the news for allowing hate and disinformation to spread, and across the political spectrum, C.E.O.s are hardly seen as moral leaders.\u201cI\u2019m not some rah-rah, \u2018Go, capitalism!\u2019 person,\u201d Mr. Raz says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in human experiences, and building a business is rich with natural drama.\u201dMr. Raz\u2019s own possibilities keep expanding. He just got a How I Built This book deal from the educational publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, for publication in the autumn of 2020.Mr. Raz\u2019s next podcast, Wisdom From the Top, will debut in early 2019, and highlight people who run big companies, organizations, nonprofits or entire cities. The animating idea, he says, is \u201cAre you born a leader, or do you become a leader?\u201dAbout that title, I say. Might it trigger those already worried he is glorifying the rich?\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good point,\u201d Mr. Raz says. \u201cWe can change the name.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Poise and Pinstripes, Notre Dame Rolls Past Syracuse in the Bronx", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotre Dame 36, Syracuse 3Even as Notre Dame has marched toward an undefeated regular season, there have been questions about just how good the Fighting Irish really are. Their best victory, over No. 4 Michigan (10-1), came at home in the season opener, and the rest of their opponents have not been all that formidable.And while Notre Dame is ranked No. 3 in The Associated Press poll, the team entered Saturday\u2019s game against Syracuse just 15th in average scoring margin.But in what amounted to an unofficial home game at Yankee Stadium, where the Irish have often played over the decades, they quieted skeptics with a 36-3 victory over No. 12 Syracuse, their most impressive showing since beating the Wolverines.\u201cThis narrative of \u2018Who\u2019s playing great? Who\u2019s not playing pretty good?\u2019\u201d Coach Brian Kelly said after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re playing pretty good right now.\u201dSyracuse Coach Dino Babers was more direct. \u201cNotre Dame is better than what people think they are,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf they play the way they played us, they\u2019re probably going to have a chance to play for a national championship.\u201dNotre Dame\u2019s defense dominated a Syracuse offense that had entered the contest averaging 44.4 points per game, sixth best in the Football Bowl Subdivision. The Orange were held to just 234 total yards, did not get deep into Notre Dame territory until well into the fourth quarter and did not score until just 10 seconds remained in the game.In last Tuesday\u2019s rankings, the College Football Playoff selection committee slotted Notre Dame third behind Alabama (11-0) and Clemson (11-0). There is every reason to expect the three schools to remain in that order when this Tuesday comes around.But what Notre Dame\u2019s impressive victory did was put pressure on playoff contenders from other conferences \u2014 particularly the Big Ten, the Big 12 and the Pacific-12 \u2014 to distinguish themselves in the selection committee\u2019s eyes. If Notre Dame wins its last game, there is likely to be just one playoff spot for those conferences to fight over.Notre Dame quarterback Ian Book, a junior who took over as the starter a few games into the season and transformed the Fighting Irish offense into one with a greater vertical threat, had missed last weekend\u2019s victory over Florida State after sustaining a rib injury.As a result, he may have been a little rusty, at least in the first part of Saturday\u2019s game. The Irish left three or seven points on the table, depending on how you look at it, when they elected to go for it on 4th and 1 from the Syracuse 1-yard-line, and Book tripped and aimlessly flung the ball into the end zone, where Syracuse safety Andre Cisco easily intercepted it. But by then the score was 13-0, Notre Dame, and by halftime it was 20-0, so Book could afford to make a mistake.He finished the afternoon with 23 completions in 37 attempts for two touchdowns and also ran the ball six times for 16 yards.One of his receivers, Chase Claypool, often seemed overpowering. Claypool is built like a tight end \u2014 he stands 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 227 pounds \u2014 but he moves far more nimbly. He turned a short completion on a crossing route into a 33-yard gain on an early drive and caught a 10-yard slant for a touchdown to ice the game late in the third quarter.Claypool noted after the game that Syracuse had been in man-to-man coverage for most of his catches, and he simply \u201ctried to beat them with my speed.\u201dIt did not help Syracuse that its starting quarterback, Eric Dungey, left the game in the first quarter with what the team called an upper body injury. His backup, the redshirt freshman Tommy DeVito, completed 14 of 31 passes for 105 yards and threw two interceptions.At least one of those interceptions wasn\u2019t his fault. On maybe the game\u2019s best defensive play, DeVito hit freshman receiver Taj Harris only for Notre Dame safety Alohi Gilman to rattle Harris into coughing up the ball right to him. Gilman then rumbled for 54 yards, setting up a 9-yard touchdown run by Jafar Armstrong on the next snap. Kelly gave Gilman the game ball afterward.Syracuse\u2019s first trip to the red zone did not come until midway through the fourth quarter, when it already trailed, 29-0. The Orange managed to get the ball to Notre Dame\u2019s 5-yard-line, where, on fourth down, a face-saving field goal clanged off the left upright.A good part of the crowd went wild. Still, Syracuse got one more chance to get 3 points and succeeded. But all of that was a footnote to the four-quarter statement by Notre Dame.Advertisement"}
