{"Headline": "Voting Problems Surface as Americans Go to the Polls", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom closed polling sites to malfunctioning machines, Election Day brought frustration for some voters in contests shadowed by questions about the security and fairness of the electoral system.In Gwinnett County, Ga., four precincts \u2014 out of 156 \u2014 suffered prolonged technical delays, while some voting machines in South Carolina lacked power or the devices needed to activate them. There was also some confusion in Allegheny County, Pa., which includes Pittsburgh, where at least four polling places were changed in the last two days.Problems with casting ballots are a regular feature of Election Day, and making sense of them could take days and weeks. But the number of calls to voting hotlines maintained by a collection of advocacy groups quickly outpaced those received in the last midterm election of 2014.The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonprofit group that oversees 20 election call centers, said that as of 5 p.m. Tuesday it had received 24,000 phone calls, compared with 14,000 at the same time four years ago.Four states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas \u2014 stood out as particularly problematic, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee.Any issues experienced this year are more likely to jangle an electorate already unnerved by the fraught 2016 election, whose aftermath has been picked over amid concerns of Russian interference and President Trump\u2019s repeated warnings, without evidence, of widespread voter fraud.A handful of precincts were also held open for several hours in Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta. One of the precincts was Forbes Arena, which hosted a rally last Friday featuring Stacey Abrams, the Democrat seeking to become the first African-American woman elected governor in any state, and former President Barack Obama.Georgia\u2019s elections system was a highly contentious issue during the campaign between Ms. Abrams and Brian Kemp, her Republican opponent, who is also the secretary of state and thus the state\u2019s chief elections administrator.Ms. Abrams and her allies accused Mr. Kemp of trying to suppress the vote through overzealous interpretations of state laws and procedures. Mr. Kemp argued that he was simply trying to make it \u201chard to cheat,\u201d and called accusations of voter suppression a \u201cfarce.\u201dAlthough long lines were reported at some polling places, other Georgia voters moved in and out with ease. \u201cIt\u2019s been very smooth all day long,\u201d Mr. Kemp said Tuesday afternoon, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re getting the normal questions of people calling asking where do they go vote, are they registered. Nothing unusual at all.\u201dAt Annistown Elementary School in Snellville, Ga., in Gwinnett County, voters reported standing in line for hours amid problems with voting machines.One resident, Ontaria Woods, said it took her nearly five hours to vote after arriving around 7 a.m., when the polls opened. After about 30 to 45 minutes, poll workers alerted those standing in line to an issue with the ExpressPoll voting machines, she said.\u201cPeople were not surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, the term \u2018voter suppression\u2019 was used many, many times.\u201dSeveral voters declined provisional ballots after worrying that they would not be counted, she said, and some left to buy food and water from a Walmart. The machines were finally fixed around 11 a.m., and Ms. Woods cast her ballot about 45 minutes later before heading to work \u2014 hours late.Gwinnett, a rapidly diversifying patchwork of suburbs near Atlanta, has long been a Republican stronghold, but Hillary Clinton carried the county in 2016.A spokesman for the county government, Joe Sorenson, said the four problematic precincts reported issues with the system that creates voter access cards for Georgia\u2019s electronic polling system. A judge extended hours at several locations in the county, including one that was to remain open until 9:25 p.m., well past the planned 7 p.m. close.Bradford Berry, the general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said, \u201cWe need to make sure that the machines that are breaking down in Georgia are not in certain parts of town, and not in others.\u201dAlthough county elections officials appeared at fault for some of the issues in Georgia, a spokeswoman for Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign, Abigail Collazo, put the blame on Mr. Kemp.\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly inspired by how many Georgians are turning out to vote and are staying in line to cast their ballot, despite the fact that some polling locations were not properly prepared by the secretary of state\u2019s office,\u201d Ms. Collazo said in a text message.In Arizona, voting-rights monitors reported major delays at some sites because of problems with printing ballots. The complaints centered in Maricopa County, the state\u2019s most populous county, where a shift from local polling places to regional voting centers caused chaos two years ago.Voters at the regional centers were being turned away or endured long waits after printers that produce ballots tailored to their home precincts malfunctioned, according to Common Cause, which was monitoring polling problems.Ms. Clarke said the Maricopa County problems were \u201camong the most significant we\u2019ve seen today\u201d and involved unusually large numbers of minority voters. In four of the afflicted voting centers, registered minority voters \u2014 Latinos, African-Americans and Native Americans \u2014 outnumbered white voters by roughly 15,700 to 2,800.In South Carolina, a spokesman for the State Election Commission said problems with malfunctioning voting machines were limited.\u201cThese issues were attributable to human error in preparation of the system, and in most cases, were resolved earlier this morning,\u201d the spokesman, Chris Whitmire, said in an email.At least two polling places on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota ran out of preprinted ballots, forcing the Sioux County auditor, Barbara Hettich, to make photocopies. Matt Samp, an organizer with the advocacy group Four Directions, said that he had asked Ms. Hettich a week ago to print more ballots, but that she insisted she had enough.The polling place in Cannon Ball, N.D., started the day with only 195 ballots for a voting-age population of more than 500. Midway through the day, Ms. Hettich had to make 100 more. In Porcupine, the precinct was down to three ballots before more arrived. Mr. Samp said a Four Directions worker drove the copies from Fort Yates to Porcupine \u2014 about 30 miles \u2014 because Ms. Hettich\u2019s office did not have anyone available to do it.Reached Tuesday night, Ms. Hettich said only that she had shipped the new ballots in time.The Justice Department deployed election monitors to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states, but Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, drew concern among Democrats for emphasizing fraud as well as civil rights.\u201cWe are dealing with a very different climate in 2018,\u201d said Karen Flynn, the president of Common Cause. \u201cWe do not have a Department of Justice that is working hand in hand with our network to be solving these problems, we don\u2019t have the protections of the Voting Rights Act, and we have a president that is putting out messages that can feel threatening to many voters.\u201dIn El Paso, the federal Border and Customs Protection agency abruptly canceled an exercise along the Mexico border Tuesday morning after civil-rights groups and Democratic leaders complained of voter intimidation. The crowd-control exercise would have taken place near a border crossing adjacent to the heavily Latino Chihuahuita neighborhood, and less than a half mile from a polling station used by Latino voters.\u201cIt was just really ham-handed and insensitive at the minimum \u2014 and possibly worse,\u201d said Nina Perales, the voting rights legal director at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.Not all problems were as sinister as some feared. A viral video at a polling site in Columbus, Ohio, showed a voter casting an electronic ballot for the Republican candidate for governor, Mike DeWine. But the paper record in the video shows a vote cast for Mr. DeWine\u2019s Democratic opponent, Richard Cordray.The voter was allowed to recast her ballot on a working machine, but the video was shared thousands of times on Twitter, often by people referring in their profiles to QAnon, a sprawling pro-Trump conspiracy theory.Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting from New York, Simon Romero from Phoenix, Kevin Roose and Maggie Astor from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding the Perfect Cocktail in Buenos Aires ", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Cynar Juleps are more common than Mint Juleps, perhaps partly because bourbon is hard to come by here. Negronis and Negroni variations are everywhere; Argentina is the world\u2019s third largest market for Campari. And Fernet and Coke might as well be the national drink. It\u2019s not for nothing that Argentina has its own Campari and Fernet Branca distilleries. Thirsts must be met.These longstanding drinking traditions have been interwoven into Buenos Aires\u2019 robust cocktail scene, which encompasses more than 50 bars. They include every recognizable variety of drinking den, from hidden joints like the Harrison Speakeasy, to restaurant bars such as Casa Cavia; from historical standard bearers like Los Galgos, to the theme-park extravaganza Uptown, whose entrance exactly resembles a New York subway station \u2014 tile walls, turnstiles, sliding train doors and all. While they all keep an eye trained on global cocktail trends, each saloon has a distinctly Argentine edge.\u201cThere are small and personal bars, and there are large and popular bars,\u201d explains Rodolfo Reich, a local journalist and cocktail authority. \u201cThe lack of some imported drinks is supplanted with artisanal recipes from each bartender.\u201dAnd none of the watering holes are too far from a purveyor of Buenos Aires-style pizza, which is heavy on the cheese, may come on a flatbread made with chickpea flour, and could possibly be the best drunk food in the world. (G\u00fcerrin and El Cuartito are two recommended pizzerias.)Also, the Argentine peso has fallen by nearly 50 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, making Buenos Aires an even more affordable destination for travelers. The country\u2019s currency crisis is extremely tough on Argentina\u2019s citizens, but helped boost tourism arrivals in September by 12 percent, according to government statistics.If you want to take in the full gamut of porte\u00f1o cocktailing, here is a suggested six-stop itinerary that covers most of the culinary and cultural bases.

He is also a big advocate of local heritage brands like Amargo Obrero, a mild regional amaro, and Hesperidina, an orange liqueur that, in 1876, became Argentina\u2019s first patented product.

{"Headline": "U.K. Opens Hate-Crime Inquiry Into Anti-Semitism in Labour Party", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After several months of scandal within Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party over its handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks, investigators in London said on Friday that they have opened a criminal inquiry into accusations that some party members posted anti-Semitic threats online.The Metropolitan Police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said in an interview with BBC Radio 4 that officers were looking into online posts by Labour members that amounted to more than just offensive comments. The police are consulting with prosecutors at this stage of the investigation.\u201cWe are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been a crime committed,\u201d she said.Ms. Dick said that the Labour Party itself was not under investigation, and that while she hoped political parties policed themselves on issues like anti-Semitism, officers had an obligation to look into such allegations.The radio station said the dossier included a message stating, \u201cWe shall rid the Jews who are cancer on us all,\u201d and another threatening a \u201cZionist extremist\u201d lawmaker with \u201ca good kicking.\u201dWhen LBC handed Ms. Dick a copy of the dossier after an interview in September, she turned it over to hate crimes specialists who started investigating, she said.It was not clear whether the comments were made by obscure rank-and-file Labour members or elected officeholders. Ms. Dick declined on Friday to offer any details about what or how many crimes may have been committed, except to say the law set a high bar for online posts to be deemed criminal.A Labour official said the party had already been reviewing some of the allegations when Ms. Dick was given the dossier. But it was not clear what disciplinary action, if any, Labour has taken against the party members accused of writing the posts.\u201cThe Labour Party has a robust system for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour Party rules by its members,\u201d the party said in a statement. \u201cWhere someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way.\u201dIn particular, the committee declined to endorse several examples of what the alliance defined as anti-Semitism, including describing Israel\u2019s existence as a racist project and accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country.The committee tried to calm a growing furor in early September by reversing itself and adopting the full text. It also tried to make clear that this should not prevent criticism of Israeli government policies, particularly toward Palestinians.Advertisement"}

Singer and Emerson T. Brooking describe the surprising role of online communication in spurring gang violence in Chicago. They quote Chicago Alderman Joe Moore saying that, contrary to popular belief, most gang disputes begin not with conflict over drug sales or territory, but with insults hurled on the internet. (Slang terms for online threats, the authors report, include \u201cFacebook drilling\u201d and \u201cwallbanging.\u201d) According to Singer and Brooking, \u201c80 percent of the fights that break out in Chicago schools are now instigated online.\u201dWithout Facebook, Donald Trump probably wouldn\u2019t be president, which is reason enough to curse its existence. The platform was an essential vector for Russian disinformation. It allowed the shady \u201cpsychographics\u201d company Cambridge Analytica to harvest private user data. And Facebook helped decimate local newspapers, contributing to America\u2019s widespread epistemological derangement.Now we\u2019re nearing something close to a progressive consensus: Facebook is bad. The question, as always, is what is to be done.In theory, there could be a bipartisan coalition against Facebook, since many conservatives also fear and resent it, believing it is biased against them. (Trump has floated the idea of using antitrust law against some of the major tech platforms to pressure them to give more exposure to right-wing voices.) Given the polarization of our politics, however, it\u2019s hard to imagine Republicans actually siding with Democrats to regulate Facebook, as opposed to simply using the threat of regulation as a cudgel.Democrats, of course, are hardly united in seeing Facebook as a problem. As The Times reported, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer \u2014 who in 2016 received more donations from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress \u2014 pressured Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, to back off from his pointed inquiries into the company. Sandberg, a veteran of Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, has lots of connections in Democratic politics; there were rumors she was being considered as a potential Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration.Still, there are plenty of Democrats who are ready to take on Facebook, and we can expect the new Congress to hold hearings about the exponentially expanding influence of the biggest tech platforms. The \u201cchallenge of this enormous concentration of economic power and corresponding political power is a very serious problem facing our country,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is in line to head a House subcommittee that deals with antitrust law.The important thing is that there are solutions; the overweening dominance of the tech platforms need not be seen as an immutable fact of nature. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these problems in the past,\u201d said Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Institute and organizer of the Freedom From Facebook coalition, which Facebook sought to smear. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen analogous types of corporations in the past.\u201d He pointed to \"network monopolies\" like railroads, AT&T and electrical utilities, saying, \u201cthere was a period in every single instance in which the people who commanded those corporations exploited the power within them to enrich themselves and to control other people in bad ways. And in every case, America said, \u2018Hey, we know how to regulate this problem.\u2019\u201d America once had the confidence to subdue tyrannical plutocrats.

{"Headline": "How Did We Get to Be Human?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 Things We\u2019d Really Like to KnowEvolution did not draw a straight line from early hominins to modern humans. At one point, we shared the planet with a number of near-relatives. I spoke recently to a scientist who was writing up a summary of what we know about human evolution. He should have had a head start, having written a similar article five years ago. But when he looked at what he had written then, he realized that little of it was relevant. \u201cI can\u2019t use much of any of it,\u201d he told me.As a journalist, I can sympathize. In recent years, scientists have offered a flood of insights into how we became human. Fairly often, the new evidence doesn\u2019t square with what we thought we knew.Instead, many of these findings demand that researchers ask new questions about the human past, and envision a more complex prehistory.When Science Times debuted 40 years ago, scientists knew far less about how our ancestors branched off from other apes and evolved into new species, known as hominins. Back then, the oldest known hominin fossil was a diminutive, small-brained female unearthed in Ethiopia named Lucy. Her species, now known as Australopithecus afarensis, existed from about 3.85 million years ago to about 2.95 million years ago. Lucy and her kin still had apelike features, like long arms and curved hands. They could walk on the ground, but inefficiently. Running was out of the question.Hominin evolution appeared to have taken a relatively direct path from her to modern humans. The earliest known members of our genus, Homo, were taller and had long legs for walking and running, as well as much larger brains. Eventually, early Homo gave rise to our own exceptional species, Homo sapiens.Now, it\u2019s clear that Lucy\u2019s species wasn\u2019t the beginning of our evolution; it was a branch that sprouted midway along the trunk of our family tree. Researchers have found fossils of hominins dating back over six million years. Those vestiges \u2014 a leg bone here, a crushed skull there \u2014 hint at even more apelike ancestors. But even the earliest known hominins were like us in one important regard. They appear to have been able to walk on the ground, at least for short distances.Paleoanthropologists have uncovered a wealth of new fossils from all points on the spectrum of hominin evolution. Some clearly belonged to known species, such as Australopithecus afarensis. Some were so distinct that they deserved a new designation. But others have fallen somewhere in between. Often they look like mosaics of other species, carrying remarkable combinations of traits. Some of these mosaics may have been the result of interbreeding between species. But it may be, too, that hominins independently evolved many traits many times, along separate lines of evolution. And a few we\u2019d rather not discussAll this mixing and experimentation produced as many as 30 different sorts of hominins \u2014 that we know of. And one kind did not simply succeed another through history: For millions of years, several sorts of hominins coexisted. Indeed, our own species shared this planet with near-relatives until just recently. At that time, too, Homo erectus, one of the oldest members of our genus, still clung to existence in what is now Indonesia. The species did not go extinct until at least 143,000 years ago.Homo erectus and Neanderthals are hardly new to paleoanthropologists. Neanderthals came to light in 1851, and Homo erectus fossils were discovered in the 1890s. But still other hominins, recent research has shown, shared the planet with our own species.In 2015, researchers unearthed 250,000-year-old fossils in a South African cave. Known as Homo naledi, this new species had a Lucy-sized brain, but it was also a complex structure in ways that resembled our own. The wrist and other hand bones of Homo naledi were humanlike, while its long, curved fingers seemed more like an ape\u2019s.While Homo naledi thrived in Africa, another mysterious species could be found on an island now called Flores, in Indonesia. Known as Homo floresiensis, these hominins stood only three feet high and had brains even smaller than that of Homo naledi. The species may have arrived on Flores as early as 700,000 years ago, and these hominins endured until at least 60,000 years ago. Homo floresiensis appears to have made stone tools, perhaps to hunt and butcher the dwarf elephants that once lived on the island.Paleoanthropologists today are no longer limited to just examining the size and shape of fossils. Over the past 20 years, geneticists have learned how to extract DNA from bones dating back tens of thousands of years. In one remarkable discovery in Siberia, researchers examining a nondescript pinkie bone discovered the genome of a separate line of hominins, now known as Denisovans.But in one way, we are still living with them. Both Neanderthals and Denisovans interbred with our ancestors some 60,000 years ago, and billions of people today carry their DNA. Still mosaics, after all this time. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Compromised by Russia", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael Cohen's latest plea is proof.Opinion ColumnistOne of the chief questions in the Trump-Russia scandal has been whether Vladimir Putin has leverage over the president of the United States, and, if so, what that leverage looks like. The significance of the fabled \u201cpee tape,\u201d after all, is not that it would reveal Donald Trump to be a pervert bent on defiling the place where Barack Obama slept. Rather, the tape matters because, if real, it would show the president to be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.In an August 2017 letter to the House and Senate intelligence committees, Cohen said that the Moscow project ended in January 2016. He claimed not to recall contacts with Russian government officials about a potential deal. Cohen told Congress that he spoke about the project with Trump \u2014 identified as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in the criminal information document that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, filed on Thursday \u2014 only three times. He said he never briefed Trump\u2019s family.According to Mueller\u2019s filing, all of this was false. Efforts to obtain Russian government approval for a Trump-branded development in Moscow went on until \u201capproximately June 2016,\u201d after Trump had effectively secured the Republican nomination for president. Cohen, Mueller\u2019s document said, \u201cdiscussed the status and progress of the Moscow project with Individual 1\u201d more than three times. He also \u201cbriefed family members of Individual 1 within the company about the project.\u201dSo we now know that Trump lied to the American people about at least one part of his business relationship with Russia, a geopolitical foe that interfered in our election process on his behalf.\u201cIf the Russians are aware that senior American officials are publicly stating things that are not true, it\u2019s a counterintelligence nightmare,\u201d Adam Schiff, the California Democrat in line to take over the House Intelligence Committee, told me. As he points out, this issue contributed to former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s downfall. Flynn, you might remember, appeared to have lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. This alarmed Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, because the Russians would have known that Flynn was deceiving Pence, and could have used that knowledge against him. \u201cLogic would tell you that you don\u2019t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,\u201d Yates told the Senate last year. The same, said Schiff, \u201cis true in spades for the president of the United States.\u201dIn light of some other recent revelations in the Mueller inquiry, we can even see Trump getting talking points, albeit indirectly, from Moscow.There are still many shoes to drop in this scandal. \u201cGiven the extraordinary obsequiousness the president has shown in his relationship with Putin, it begs the question of whether there\u2019s more leverage than this,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re so determined to make sure that we look into any credible allegations of financial entanglements, whether that involves potential Russian money laundering in the Trump Organization or anything else.\u201d But even before those inquiries begin, we can see that Putin has been in possession of crucial information about Trump\u2019s business interests that the president deliberately hid from the American people. In a normal political world, Republicans would have enough patriotism to find this alarming and humiliating. Every day of the Trump presidency is a national security emergency. The question now is whether Senate Republicans, who could actually do something about it, will ever be moved to care.Advertisement"}

Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. \u201cIts leadership squirmed over Russian meddling investigations:\u201cMr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss.

On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called [Apple\u2019s C.E.O. Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.\u201dAnd Mark Zuckerberg was apoplectic about the criticism:After Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.The bottom line:\u201cAs evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201dThose moves will be important when the company tries to convince public-market investors that it\u2019s worth a sky-high valuation when it files for an I.P.O.

And few people were returning Marv\u2019s. He nearly lost his house to foreclosure. Someone like Les Moonves seemed vastly beyond his reach.So when reporters covering the #MeToo reckoning called Marv late last year to ask about a long-ago incident between one of Marv\u2019s clients \u2014 the actress Bobbie Phillips \u2014 and Mr. Moonves, Marv sensed opportunity. Suddenly, his access to Ms. Phillips gave him leverage.Other guests were impressed that Mr. Moonves showed up at Marv\u2019s 75th birthday party. The executive not only returned Marv\u2019s calls but the two also began a correspondence that turned into hundreds of texts, all reviewed by The Times. While dangling Ms. Phillips\u2019s continued silence before him, Marv cajoled Mr. Moonves into finding a part on a CBS TV show for Ms. Phillips \u2014 a process vividly depicted in the text messages.Marv told me he simply saw an opportunity to be a \u201cgood guy,\u201d to help both Mr. Moonves, by discouraging Ms. Phillips from talking, and Ms. Phillips, by finding her a part and reviving her career. \u201cThat\u2019s what managers do,\u201d he told me.Ms. Phillips rejected the offer. The scheme blew up, and CBS\u2019s board fired Mr. Moonves once they learned about it. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that, for many survivors and perpetrators in Hollywood, there may be third parties in a position to take advantage of painful situations. The Moonves-Dauer correspondence is a rare example that has come to light. But it seems likely that there are many more.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The Times reporter Dan Levin reports that it can be pretty brutal manual labor. You sit for long periods of time, and you\u2019re paid by weight, so every morning, trimmers race for the biggest buds.It has previously also been a lucrative short-term gig.

{"Headline": "How Google Photos Became a Perfect Jukebox for Our Memories", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artGoogle Photos, introduced in 2015, has become one of the most emotionally resonant pieces of technology today. It is also shaping our narratives along the way.The first time Google Photos made me cry, it was with a sucker punch. Google\u2019s computers can recognize faces, even as they age over time. Photos also seems to understand the tone and emotional valence of human interaction, things like smiles, giggles, frowns, tantrums, dances of joy and even snippets of dialogue like \u201chappy birthday!\u201d or \u201cgood job!\u201d The resulting montage, synced to a swelling Hollywood score, mixed obvious highlights \u2014 birthdays, school plays \u2014 with dozens of ordinary moments of childhood bliss. This is what I mean about a sucker punch: Who expects software to make them cry? Images on Instagram and Snapchat may move you regularly, but Google Photos is not social media; it is personal media, a service begun three years ago primarily as a database to house our growing collections of private snaps \u2014 and a service run mostly by machines, not by other humans posting and Liking stuff.With its heavy focus on artificially intelligent curation, Google Photos suggests the dawning of a new age of personalized robot historian. The trillions of images we are all snapping will become the raw material for algorithms that will curate memories and construct narratives about our most intimate human experiences. In the future, the robots will know everything about us \u2014 and they will tell our stories.But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves. Before fretting about the sci-fi tomorrow, it\u2019s worth marveling at the basic utility of Google Photos today. Tech companies have been trying to create ways to manage digital photos ever since we began ditching film. Most efforts have failed; the better our portable cameras get, the more photos we take, and the more photos we take, the less able we all are to make sense of the stash.\u201cWith the invention of the smartphone, there was nothing that humans did, absolutely nothing, that they didn\u2019t also make an image of,\u201d said Martin Hand, a sociologist at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the author of \u201cUbiquitous Photography,\u201d an academic inquiry into the blessed problem of too many photos. \u201cBut that brought about its own problems \u2014 it started to get overwhelming.\u201dMore than a decade ago, the tech world hit on one partial solution to picture overload: Make images social. Through services like Flickr, then Facebook and Instagram, we tried to curate our images by getting others to do it for us. The best photos of you were the ones that were ranked highly in your social feed; the worst were the ones you didn\u2019t post. But social media created another set of problems \u2014 there was a fear of missing out, a sense of performative anxiety, loneliness and an erosion of privacy. \u201cThere was a sense in which because everything was public, young people had to constantly curate the idea of themselves in public,\u201d said Mr. Hand.Its reimagined service would do three things: Offer nearly limitless storage for your photos essentially free (you can pay more to have your images stored in higher-resolution sizes). It put them in the cloud, so they could be accessed anywhere. And, crucially, Photos would lean on Google\u2019s famed A.I. to address what it saw as the key problem of the smartphone era \u2014 the fact that we all take photos but rarely look at them.\u201cWe noticed that you would never relive or reminisce about any of these moments,\u201d said Anil Sabharwal, the Google vice president who led the team that built Photos, and still runs it. \u201cYou would go on this beautiful vacation, you\u2019d take hundreds of beautiful photos, years would pass, and you would never look at any of them.\u201dWhen it started in 2015, Google Photos brought immediate relief. For instance, face recognition made sharing pictures automatic. Now, when I take a photo of my kids, Google recognizes them and shares those photos with my wife; her photos are shared with me. Incredibly, instantly, without thinking, we each have a complete collection of the children\u2019s photos, and any anxiety about keeping them secure has vanished.Then there are Google\u2019s daily prompts to reminisce. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how good Google\u2019s machines are at mining your collection to find new stuff to awe you. In one series, called Then and Now, it will find pictures of the same person, or groups of people, in similar poses at two different time periods: Your children on the first day of school this year versus last year, or you in front of the Empire State Building 10 years ago and today.I worry, given all this, about how A.I.-curated memories are shaping our narratives about ourselves. I think of Samara and children like her: how she will one day watch videos like the one Google produced of her, and she will come to certain conclusions about her childhood only because a for-profit, ad-supported tech company\u2019s machines made choices about what sort of scenes to show and what to hide.At the moment, there is no calamity here: Google Photos\u2019 videos are sunny and bright. But if history is about who tells your story, Photos pushes us into a new realm.The machines, now, are increasingly making sense of our human world \u2014 shaping our reality in the deepest way possible, and like cameras themselves, they\u2019re inescapable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Did Manafort Cooperate With Trump Over Mueller? ", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawyers for Manafort and Trump engaged in a brazen violation of criminal defense norms. The move could pay off, or it could blow up spectacularly. Mr. White, a criminal defense lawyer, is a former federal prosecutor.The first development isn\u2019t much of a surprise. Wise prosecutors know that cooperating witnesses can be notoriously unreliable. It\u2019s not unusual for prosecutors to catch cooperators in lies or recidivism.Mr. Manafort, like many of the hapless former luminaries snared in Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, had a joint defense agreement with Mr. Trump. Such a pact lets defense lawyers exchange information without waiving attorney-client privilege. Under normal circumstances, if a lawyer reveals what a client said in confidence, or reveals strategy and analysis of a case, that information is no longer confidential, and the government can compel testimony about it. A joint defense agreement allows lawyers for people with a common interest in a case to share what they learned from clients without that information losing its confidential nature. Because everyone in the agreement has a common interest in defending the case and has agreed to keep the information secret, the theory goes, sharing the information within the group doesn\u2019t waive its confidentiality. But the pacts almost always explicitly require the parties to withdraw from the agreement immediately if they cooperate with the government. After all, once someone begins to cooperate, his interests are no longer common with the other members of the joint defense agreement \u2014 by definition, they\u2019re now adverse. This is often how we learn that someone will soon plead guilty: The former national security adviser Michael Flynn had a defense pact with the president, but his withdrawal from it signaled his cooperation and plea. If they revealed client confidences, they waived the attorney-client privilege. Mr. Mueller can, and perhaps should, try to find out what Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers said to one another about their respective clients after Mr. Manafort began cooperating. The resulting legal battles over privilege would be spectacular.Some analysts speculate that Mr. Mueller intended this result \u2014 that he knew that Mr. Manafort would lie to him, knew that Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers would brief Mr. Trump on those lies, and knew that Mr. Trump would foolishly repeat those lies in his written statement to Mr. Mueller, thus committing a new federal crime.That\u2019s a good plot for a legal thriller, but it\u2019s not how real federal prosecutors work. Mr. Mueller is a by-the-book sort of prosecutor, not one to indulge in such ploys. To the extent he trusted Mr. Manafort and revealed details of his investigation, he made a mistake. Of course, the president\u2019s team \u2014 never a font of shrewd criminal defense strategy \u2014 may have made a mistake, too, if they incorporated Mr. Manafort\u2019s lies into their own written responses to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions. That could expand the scope of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation to include new false statements to the F.B.I., the downfall of several of his targets.Mr. Mueller\u2019s mistake is understandable. Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers\u2019 communications with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are shocking and unprecedented, a brazen violation of criminal defense norms notable even in an investigation full of them. They are consistent with only one conclusion: Mr. Manafort and his lawyers seek a presidential pardon, not a reduced sentence through sincere cooperation.Ken White, a former federal prosecutor, is a criminal defense lawyer and First Amendment litigator at Brown White & Osborn in Los Angeles, and a host of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Lawyers,\u201d on radio station KCRW.Advertisement"}

But it said that with the addition of Reserve, which works with about 1,000 restaurants, most of them in Chicago, Washington and Boston, it will now serve about 4,000 restaurants in the United States. And since April, when it connected several international reservation platforms to its technology, Resy is used by 10,000 restaurants worldwide. OpenTable, founded in 1998, charges restaurants based on the number of reservations it makes for them, in addition to a flat rate, but says it is experimenting with a new pricing model it will roll out in the next quarter. Reserve and Resy, which both started in 2014, charge restaurants only a flat rate for use of their software. (None of the three charge diners.)\u201cWe\u2019re attacking and dismantling some very stale, inadequate, overpriced products,\u201d Ben Leventhal, one of Resy\u2019s founders and its chief executive, said in an interview last week.He said the company\u2019s revenue has doubled in each of the last four years. It now seats about 1.4 million diners each week, and its no-show rate \u2014 a critical metric for restaurants, which lose money when people with reservations don\u2019t turn up \u2014 averages just under 5 percent, Mr. Leventhal said. The industry average is closer to 15 percent, and can spike around holidays like Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cThe market for OpenTable and such companies was always more limited, because some people just didn't use it,\" said John A. Gordon, a principal at Pacific Management Consulting Group, which analyzes restaurants\u2019 strategies and earnings.\u201cWe\u2019ve got over a million restaurants in the United States and all restaurants are trying to collect more information about their customers,\u201d he added. \u201cThat information is useful because it can create a deeper relationship with the brand and it\u2019s more personal and more efficient than running an ad.\u201d\u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Mr. Leventhal said. \u201cOur goal in five years is for every restaurant that works with Resy to not worry about closing.\u201d \u201cWe moved away from that because restaurants told us there was a bigger opportunity,\u201d Mr. Leventhal said. \u201cRestaurants helped us understand we were focused on something pretty niche, in the end.\u201dFor now, Resy will continue to run Reserve\u2019s service as it is. The work of moving restaurants from Reserve to Resy\u2019s platform will happen slowly, beginning early in 2019, after the holiday rush of private parties and events \u2014 the most chaotic time of the year in the restaurant business.As Mr. Leventhal put it, \u201cWe can\u2019t ask restaurants to just rip and replace tech as critical as reservations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Son Was Dead. Did I Feel Better Holding a Gun?", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Gibson is a writer and a gun control activist.In 1992, my son was killed in a school shooting in Massachusetts, a random victim of a disturbed fellow college student who\u2019d purchased a semiautomatic rifle at a local gun shop and smuggled it onto campus. College officials had been warned that this student had a gun, but they didn\u2019t know how to respond; school shootings were still too new. America\u2019s response to our gun problem has taken some strange turns since 1992. We no longer ask, \u201cHow could this have happened?\u201d Gun violence has become reliable content in the 24-hour news cycle. I think of the crowded school library in which my son died. I try to imagine a librarian drawing her Glock and returning fire.I put the question to a man I know, a retired Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who specializes in training people to use guns defensively \u2014 the kind of training that this administration might want to give teachers, the kind that the National Rifle Association imagines could stop the killer in a mass shooting. This man spoke with me about the low proficiency of the average gun owner: \u201cImagine shooting hoops in your driveway and thinking you can play in the N.B.A.\u201d He spoke of the hundreds of hours necessary to achieve the Zen-like level of expertise in which, in the midst of chaos, responses are instantaneous and instinctive. He spoke of the continual training necessary to maintain those skills, and he generously agreed to take me through an abbreviated version of that curriculum, training intended to turn an average shooter into, well, what exactly? I wasn\u2019t sure. He took me to an indoor range \u2014 a wide, low hall separated into shooting lanes, reminiscent of a bowling alley, tucked in the woods behind an ice skating arena. For my introductory lesson, he had me practice keeping my finger on the trigger as it came forward after a shot and firing again the instant it reset, putting more rounds into the target in less time. Hypothetically, anyway. It was a hot day. The gun wriggled in my hands like a slippery metal fish as I pulled the trigger, got back on target, felt the trigger catch and fired again. If I did it over and over, from every conceivable position, in every possible situation, at some hypothetical time in the distant future I would be transformed into a \u2014 let\u2019s be honest about it \u2014 trained killer. A highly trained killer, perpetually in a state of lethal hypervigilance, in a college library trying to kill a less trained killer. This thinking, of course, was the sort of distraction that would get me killed in the scenario for which I was training. I steadied my grip on the gun.I know. This is my weird trip. Part of my survivor\u2019s journey. Twenty-six years and counting. I thought of the anguished parents of the people who died in Thousand Oaks, of all the parents of any child who is fatally shot. I wondered where their journeys would take them.  Betsy DeVos will eventually leave her job. But where will we be by then? What becomes of us when civilians need guns to keep them safe from civilians with guns?We might succeed in training the rare history teacher or rabbi to shoot like a special forces operative. But that's no guarantee our children will be any safer 26 years from now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Standoff With Russia, What Does Ukraine\u2019s Martial Law Decree Mean?", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukrainians were thrown into confusion this week over their country\u2019s martial law emergency as the president pressed Parliament to enact the measure without a complete public version of what it contained, including the effective date.Mr. Poroshenko sought to reassure the public through a television interview and Facebook posts that the law, a response to what he called new Russian military threats this past weekend, would only be enforced in the event of an invasion and that it would not restrict civil liberties.But lawyers, diplomats and other experts said that the rollout shrouded the whole thing in fog.\u201cNothing is known about the restrictions themselves,\u201d said Eugene Krapyvin, a lawyer who works on government reform.Here are some of the main questions surrounding what led to the martial-law decree, the latest chapter in a sudden escalation of a nearly 5-year-old conflict between Russia and Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people.Both Moscow and Kiev accused the other of flouting the rules of passage through the strait.Russia seemed to pass the whole thing off as a criminal matter, with its courts placing the captured Ukrainian sailors in two months of pretrial detention on charges of crossing the border illegally.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called the clash \u201ca border incident, nothing more\u201d on Wednesday in his first public comments on the episode.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is replete with competing, murky versions of events. The ship confrontation is no exception.The two sides agree that three Ukrainian military vessels were trying to enter the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on Sunday.Ukraine accuses Russia of violating a 2003 treaty between the two countries treating the Sea of Azov as shared territorial waters, and the international law of the sea about free, \u201cinnocent\u201d passage through any strait.Russia maintains that under new rules put in place in 2015, any vessel transiting the strait must seek permission 48 hours in advance. Russia claims that two Ukrainian warships that passed through the strait on Sept. 23 had followed those rules.This time, according to the Russian account promulgated by the Federal Security Service, three Ukrainian ships on the Black Sea side of the strait sent word only at the last minute that they planned to transit.Yes. The 12-mile bridge, which costs $7.5 billion, connects the Russian mainland to the Crimean Peninsula, the territory Russia seized by force from Ukraine in 2014.Worried about threats from Ukrainian extremists to sabotage the bridge, Russia accused the Ukrainian ships of executing dangerous maneuvers and closed the shipping lane for what it called security reasons.Russia claims that it ordered the ships to leave, leading to the confrontation.Ukraine denies that its two warships sought Russian permission to transit the strait in September, saying that it already had that right under the 2003 treaty. Since Ukraine does not recognize the 2014 annexation of Crimea, it maintains that the border between the two countries still dissects the Kerch Strait.Russia broadcast what it called confessions from a few Ukrainian sailors who said the episode had been a deliberate provocation by their side. Ukraine condemned the statements as coerced and an abuse of war prisoners.One Russian columnist speculated that despite the accusations from both sides, it was possible that the confrontation had spun out of control because of the local Russian commander\u2019s actions.\u201cRussia had plenty ways to stop the Ukranians without bringing the situation to a deadlock,\u201d wrote the columnist, Yulia Latynina, in the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. \u201cIt would be fine if it were a part of some major plan. But chances are high that all of this was done by some local general who just wanted to qualify for a promotion.\u201dTensions have been building since at least March, when Ukrainian border guards impounded a Russian fishing boat and kept its crew until October.Matters worsened in May, after the Kerch Bridge opened, when Russian border guards started inspecting foreign vessels navigating the Sea of Azov. Since then, 295 Ukrainian and other foreign ships have been stopped. About 7 percent of Ukrainian exports, mainly steel and grain, flow out of Mariupol and other ports on the Sea of Azov, so the inspections have hurt trade.More important, the Ukrainians felt that Russia, through the inspections and through the deployment of dozens of new patrol ships in the sea, was gradually constricting Ukrainian access and converting the waterway into a \u201cRussian lake.\u201dSo last September, Ukraine announced that it would create a naval base at the southeast port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, dragging two small vessels overland and sending in two creaking warships. (The Ukrainian fleet has basically been nonexistent since 70 percent of it was lost in 2014 when Russia seized Sevastopol, the Black Sea port on the Crimean Peninsula.)Having ceded the Crimean Peninsula without a fight, Ukraine seemed determined not to let the same happen to the Sea of Azov.Mr. Poroshenko justified the action because of what he called indications that Russia could seize other parts of Ukraine\u2019s territory, and citizens should be ready to resist.Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office did not respond to a request for clarification about the law, which was limited to the 10 provinces bordering areas where Russian troops are deployed as well as along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.Roman Marchenko, a lawyer in private practice in Ukraine, said the broad outlines included the ability of the military commanding officer in each of the 10 regions to requisition private property and vehicles, to mobilize citizens as soldiers, to evacuate population centers and to impose curfews.\u201cThe question is whether army officials will use these powers in reality,\u201d Mr. Marchenko said, noting that nobody knows how it will work because martial law has never been enforced since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u201cThey can do whatever they want and they do not need to justify anything about their actions to the public or the courts or anybody.\u201dPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other top Russian officials have suggested that Ukraine might exploit martial law to rev up the conflict. The Kremlin has accused Mr. Poroshenko of manufacturing the crisis to strengthen his weak prospects in a March presidential election.In a telephone call on Tuesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Putin expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d that Ukraine had placed its entire military on heightened alert, according to the presidential press service. It said Mr. Putin asked Germany to pressure Ukraine against \u201ctaking further ill-considered steps.\u201dPoliticians in Germany, Austria, Poland and Estonia raised the possibility of new European Union sanctions against Russia.Mr. Putin is due at the summit of G-20 leaders in Argentina, which is scheduled to begin on Friday. Mr. Peskov said the issue was not on the formal agenda, but it was sure to emerge in discussions among the leaders on the sidelines.Mr. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea proved wildly popular at home, and with his approval rating now sinking, he might benefit from a new confrontation with Ukraine.

{"Headline": "Show Us Your Warhol!", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARHOL\u2019S LEGACYAndy\u2019s portraits of the rich and famous are his biggest body of work. They also largely funded the last two decades of his life. So what was it like facing Warhol\u2019s camera?By the mid-1970s, the era of bohemian debauchery that once defined Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory \u2014 the artist\u2019s downtown Manhattan studio and offices \u2014 was over. It was now time to pay the ballooning bills \u2014 for film and video projects; for his magazine, Interview; for real estate purchases \u2014 even as sales of his own artwork were drying up.But all together they create a predigital Facebook, she added, \u201cmapping subcultures\u201d from socialites to rock stars. \u201cIt\u2019s their desire to be painted by Warhol, to receive his imprimatur, that brings it all together,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite different than having your portrait done by any of the great 19th-century painters.\u201dThe portraits certainly weren\u2019t seen that way at the time of their making. In November 1979, when the Whitney staged a show including 112 commissioned portraits, the media reception was largely brutal. \u201cWarhol\u2019s admirers,\u201d Robert Hughes of Time magazine wrote, \u201care given to claiming that Warhol has \u2018revived\u2019 the social portrait as a form. It would be nearer the truth to say he has zipped its corpse into a Halston, painted its eyelids and propped it in the back of a limo, where it moves but cannot speak.\u201dFirst came a photography session. A Polaroid shot of the subject was then blown up into a 40 x 40 image and silk-screened onto canvas, but only after Warhol had meticulously cut away any less-than-flattering wrinkles and double chins. Upon delivery of the finished portrait, the salesmanship began anew. \u201cIf someone ordered two panels, he would paint four, hoping they would then take them all. Sometimes when people saw how great four looked side by side, they would open their checkbooks a little more,\u201d Mr. Colacello recalled. By the early \u201980s, new commissions had soared. Warhol was painting about 50 a year, grossing nearly $5 million annually when adjusted for inflation.For generations who have come of age long after Warhol\u2019s death in 1987, grids of these portraits are often viewed as his signature work \u2014 their eye-popping colors and scattershot brushwork atop a repeating washed-out image serving as shorthand for not only the artist\u2019s overall style, but the very aura of fame itself. Even the art world establishment has come around: Museums worldwide now embrace them as essential examples of modern-day portraiture.So what was it like facing Warhol\u2019s camera? Here, his subjects discuss that process and living with their portraits in the decades since. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.Singer-songwriterYou were surprised by Andy\u2019s technology?What was your initial reaction to the finished portrait?There were four and it was hard to choose. Seeing them together in those different colors, I wanted all of them.Did you haggle over a bulk price?[Laughing] They didn\u2019t even try and offer me a discount. They knew I didn\u2019t have that kind of money!When you look at the single portrait you bought, what runs through your mind now?Gosh, I was cute! [Laughing]Elementary school student (then); Entertainment lawyer (now)You were just 10 years old when Warhol painted you. Even though he was a close friend of your father, that must have been a bit odd.He used to call every day for my dad: \u201cHey kiddo, is your pops home?\u201d My dad gave me the address of the Factory and some money, and I got in a taxi and went downtown. Thinking back, it\u2019s very strange to let a 10-year-old go downtown from the Upper West Side by herself. But my parents [John and Susan] were very young when they had me, so they were kids, too.How did the session go?I remember being taken into this tiny bathroom by an assistant. She pulled out this big, black makeup case with hundreds of brushes, sparkly eye shadow and blush. This was a dream! I\u2019d never worn makeup before. I felt so glamorous! She caked all of this white base foundation on me and put on this incredibly rich, red lipstick. So here I am thinking, I\u2019m going to look like a gorgeous model. And I look in the mirror and I look like a cartoon character!Did you complain?I was too shy to have said anything. Now I would! I\u2019ve grown into those lips. They\u2019re the same color he used on his Marilyn Monroe and Liz Taylor portraits. We had those prints in our home when I was a kid. To put those lips on me \u2014 those lips which exemplify such power and strength and sophistication \u2014 it was extraordinary. Looking at them made me feel like I was becoming a woman.Business manager for her late husband, the artist ArmanYour husband traded artwork with Warhol. Did you broach the notion of a Warhol portrait?Something you have to know about my wonderful husband: He didn\u2019t ask me my opinion. [Laughing] Arman liked to have me, as I say, hanging around. He had portraits of me by several artists. So one day he just told me I was meeting Andy \u2014 I certainly wasn\u2019t going to say no to that! But you can see in my portrait that I\u2019m a little intimidated.Your first Warhol portrait is one of the few where the subject is topless. Was that your idea?You can\u2019t imagine it was my idea! [Laughing] It was Andy\u2019s idea, he posed me. I was brought up Catholic, my generation was very prudish. My husband helped me to get out of that a little bit. We hung the portrait in our living room right away, and now I\u2019ve come to think of it as a work of art, not just \u2018me.\u2019 But my children\u2019s friends, especially their male friends, would turn their eyes away: [gasping] \u201cOh, Mrs. Arman\u2019s naked!\u201dArtistWho proposed to whom?It started with me asking him to pose. He suggested we do an exhibition of portraits of each other. Of course, his doing a portrait is about five minutes in front of the Big Shot Polaroid camera [laughing], I need about six months. I ended up moving into the Factory for a year or so.So Warhol got to watch you in progress.His big complaint was, \u201cOh, you\u2019re using too much pimple paint!\u201d He got very upset by that.Pimple paint?He put heavy makeup up on every morning. It must\u2019ve taken him two hours to get out of the house after covering up all his pimples and bad skin. He thought I was putting the pimples back in. Which of course I was! Whereas his portrait of me was completely glamorized and airbrushed. There is some legitimacy to that, though. He told me once that his favorite toys as a child were paper dolls. Well, if you look at those portraits of his, they\u2019re all paper dolls with cutout mouths and eyes. That\u2019s the way he saw things.Actress and singerWhat was the experience of being photographed by Warhol like?I was used to posing for photographers. But he said, \u201cSit in the corner and be yourself.\u201d Well, who am I? Tell me first so I do this right. It took like 10 minutes. But it worked!Did you see yourself in the final portrait?At the time, it looked too sophisticated to be me. I was a shy kid from Queens, my mother put me in the American Academy of Arts, next thing I know I\u2019m on Broadway at 8 years old. I looked too serene in the portrait, and I didn\u2019t feel that way at the time. I\u2019ve grown into it. Now I love it!Do you recall discussing with Warhol how many portraits you were going to buy: two, four, six?I never paid the bills back then. But I can tell you how much an exact copy of my portrait costs now: $1,000.Excuse me?I wanted to hang my portrait in Pia\u2019s Place, my cabaret here in Vegas. But the insurance cost is ridiculous! So I had Sotheby\u2019s make me an exact replica. Side by side, I can\u2019t tell the difference.Television producerYour commission was a bit more complex than most.I had a television series called \u201cThe Love Boat\u201d and I thought Andy would be fabulous as a guest star. The deal we finally made was complicated: I gave Andy a list of 20 names of possible guest stars and he had the right to pick 10 of the 20. If I delivered any of those 10 as our 1,000th guest star, he was committed to be on the show. And he would also do a portrait of that 1,000th guest star. And a double portrait of me, and a double portrait of my partner Aaron Spelling. But Candy [Aaron\u2019s wife] decided she wanted a portrait too. So he did that as well.Who was Andy\u2019s No. 1 pick to paint?Did the actual making of Warhol\u2019s \u201cLove Boat\u201d episode in 1985 go any smoother?ArtistYou studied Warhol in college. Was it strange to later find yourself trading your own artwork with him?I remember sitting in art history class back in Santa Barbara, hearing about the Factory. I just felt there\u2019s something like that waiting for me \u2014 I need to get out of California and go be in New York!And just a few years later you, your wife, Tereza, and your infant daughter, Zena, are all being photographed together at the Factory.Andy is taking Polaroids of us, and Jean-Michel [Basquiat] is there too. I\u2019m trying to be my most relaxed and cool. Meanwhile, Jean-Michel didn\u2019t like it if Andy gave me too much attention \u2014 he was very protective and very jealous. I just remember him glaring at me from right behind Andy\u2019s shoulder. Jean-Michel was good at intimidating you with a look.Your portrait has you in one panel with your baby, and your wife in the other panel, also with your baby.Yeah, Andy said he always did married couples in diptychs because they always get divorced. This way they don\u2019t have to fight over who gets the painting with the child in it. He was so matter-of-fact about it. I thought it was funny at the time.Where is the portrait now?The painting hung in our living room until we split up in 2001. We each took a painting with our child. Who got the family portrait was one less thing to fight over. [Chuckling] Andy was so brilliant.Advertisement"}

Heart disease, cancer, stroke, neurological conditions, diabetes \u2014 all increase radically with advancing years. And the older a person is, the more likely he or she is to have multiple chronic illnesses. Some scientists hope one day to treat all of them at once \u2014 by targeting aging itself.In animal studies over the last few decades, scientists have begun to understand the specific cellular and molecular processes that cause the deteriorations of old age.Healthy young people have few of these aging cells, but after age 60, they begin to accumulate, and their increasing quantity correlates with disabilities of old age.Could there be any remedy that removes these old cells while leaving young cells? Several are being tested. Some drugs already approved for other purposes are being tested as \u201csenolytics,\u201d as the drugs that kill old cells are now called. Dr. Nir Barzilai, a professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine, is planning a study of metformin, a drug that has been used for 60 years to treat diabetes and has been shown to be effective against several age-related diseases. If drugs can treat aging, is aging itself a disease? No, Dr. Barzilai said. \u201cNeither I nor the Food and Drug Administration is interested in calling aging a disease. Our study is to show that we can prevent a composite of age-related diseases \u2014 cardiovascular, cancer, cognitive \u2014 and ultimately affect mortality.\u201dAs people age, levels of N.A.D. decline to the point where it is undetectable in the blood of the elderly.David A. Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard, is working on methods of replenishing those levels. In studies of yeast, worms, flies and mice, \u201cthat replenishing rapidly reverses some aspects of aging,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now there are trials underway in humans.\u201dAnd a few we\u2019d rather not discuss(N.A.D. is already peddled in health food stores, but scientists like Dr. Barzilai say it\u2019s a bad idea to take a nutraceutical to extend life \u2014 or even an established medication like metformin \u2014 until the clinical data are in.) One widely published researcher in the field, S. Jay Olshansky, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that there is an upper limit to how long we can live \u2014 about 85 years.\u201cParts of the body, including the brain, are not designed for long-term use,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the consequences of pushing the limits of survival: the rise of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementias, joint and hip problems, loss of muscle mass.\u201d\u201cThese are not a consequence of failure, but of success,\u201d he added. Dr. Olshansky advocates extending \u201chealth span, not life span.\u201dWe will all die. No serious scientist believes in immortality. But we also are closer to assuring healthier old age than ever before.\u201cThere are dozens of companies in clinical trials, or planning them, tackling all the different causes of aging,\u201d Dr. Sinclair said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that there will be a few successes in the coming years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are photojournalists: A beautiful collection by Kael Alford depicts the environmental threats to Louisiana\u2019s coastal communities; another collection by Scott Dalton, a Houston-based photographer, tells the story of immigration, drug trafficking, and trade at the United States-Mexico border in Texas.A sense of home led William Christenberry in the 1960s to photograph ramshackle cabins and old stores with quaint, picturesque Coca-Cola signs in Hale County, Ala. It\u2019s where he grew up. He was picking up where the Depression-era photographer Walker Evans left off decades earlier, further commemorating this gorgeous speck of rural America. The strength of his work \u2014 along with William Eggleston\u2019s depictions of everyday life in the Mississippi Delta and Sally Mann\u2019s lyrical, romantic shots of Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 inspired legions of documentarians who, seemingly governed by the same nostalgic impulses, recycled those visions of the South.\u201cIn the epilogue of my book, I have a picture of a person taking a picture of a Sprott store,\u201d Mr. Matthews said, referring to someone who traveled to West Alabama to rephotograph a convenience store in Sprott that Walker Evans had documented in the 1930s.Images of the idyllic South reinforce notions of rural and small-town America, but they don\u2019t match the full realities of its contemporary culture. Alex Grabiec addressed the suburbanization of once-rural areas with stark, nondescript images whose aesthetics are the opposite of romantic. Jared Soares found and photographed a small yet thriving community of hip-hop artists in Roanoke, Va., historically known for its bluegrass. Susan Worsham composed beautiful images of beautiful strangers, like a soon-to-be-deployed Marine who reminded her of her deceased brother.\u201cAt the beginning of the 21st century, the identity of the American South and the definition of regionalism is in flux,\u201d Mr. McCabe wrote. The photographers who represent it are changing, too.New voices are sometimes better equipped to address the South\u2019s troubled history. In RaMell Ross\u2019s \u201cGiving Tree,\u201d a young girl\u2019s body is languidly draped over a thick tree branch. From the moment he arrived in Hale County, Mr. Ross, who is black, worked to understand how the historic South became the \u201cconception home of the black image\u201d and has contributed to \u201cthe way in which we understand what black struggle is, the origins of it,\u201d he said. Ross has quietly and whimsically integrated the slavery-stained landscape of the South into his work.\u201cIf you saw the \u2018Giving Tree\u2019 image as a white person, you won\u2019t necessarily think of a lynching, you might think of a swing or of something else,\u201d he said.But for a black person, Ross continued, \u201cObviously, it has different connotations.

{"Headline": "How Do You Get Students to Think Like Criminals?", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe skills needed for cybersecurity jobs aren\u2019t easy to learn in the classroom.Ms. Wolff is an assistant professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.As someone who teaches in a rapidly growing computing security program at the Rochester Institute of Technology, this is good news for me and my students. I think we are doing a good and responsible job of training our students, who will be snapped up by recruiters. But I\u2019ve watched as the field of cybersecurity has become formalized through a flurry of new degrees, certificates and curriculums, and I worry that some fundamental components of what make people really good at security \u2014 namely, the instincts to look at systems in unconventional ways and quickly identify possible ways to cause trouble \u2014 are being lost along the way.The idea of degree programs focused solely on cybersecurity is still pretty new. At R.I.T., the bachelor\u2019s degree in security was introduced in 2007, and the dedicated Computing Security department wasn\u2019t formed until 2012. That means we haven\u2019t had a lot of time to debug these programs, especially since, in academic settings, every significant curricular change typically requires several meetings followed by extensive paperwork and committee approval. The field is so new that nearly every cybersecurity professional over the age of 30 does not have a degree in cybersecurity \u2014 many of them don\u2019t even have degrees in computer science, and several don\u2019t have college degrees at all.The poster child for the unconventional path to a cybersecurity job is Kevin Mitnick, who was convicted of illegal computer hacking and spent five years in prison before establishing a career as a highly sought after security consultant.Some of these skills can be taught in the classroom, through checklists of where to look for possible weaknesses and tools that can be used to help conduct those assessments. But the most effective red teams, like the most effective attackers, find vulnerabilities that no one has ever thought of before \u2014 much less included on a course syllabus.Almost by definition, college classroom settings and the students who thrive in them are not a natural fit for the kinds of disruptive, rebellious and troublemaking instincts that lend themselves to finding new ways to compromise computers. It can be hard to reward those skills \u2014 much less teach them \u2014 in a college course where there are supposed to be clear expectations and learning objectives, well-defined grading rubrics and set schedules.There is plenty of useful and important material being taught in cybersecurity classes beside how to cheat, from programming and networks to cryptography, and my own area of economics and policy. But the students who graduate from our degree program in security often report that they got more out of their extracurricular security clubs and competitions than their coursework. That may not necessarily be bad, or even unique to cybersecurity (don\u2019t get me started on the topic of how much I learned writing for my college newspaper), but it does suggest that as we race forward trying to train millions more people in cybersecurity to fill all the looming vacant jobs, there may be real gaps in the skills we know how to teach. We should think carefully about the skills we need, about the rules and principles that we know how to teach and also about how to encourage students to break those rules and find ways around those principles.Josephine Wolff (@josephinecwolff) is an assistant professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the author of \u201cYou\u2019ll See This Message When It Is Too Late: The Legal and Economic Aftermath of Cybersecurity Breaches.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the California Wildfire Missing List, Name After Name After Name", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICO, Calif. \u2014 There\u2019s a desperate plea on the message board for Sheila Santos, who went missing after wildfires ripped through her home: \u201cCall your kids.\u201dThere are hundreds of other names posted outside the shelter for fire evacuees at a church in Chico, the nearest city to the front lines of the still-roaring fire. There\u2019s Rosemary Poushard, William Goulridge and Vernice Regan, all of whom remain on the official missing list.\u201cI\u2019ve seen grown men walk up to that board and just start to cry,\u201d said Tena Quackenbush, 51, a Red Cross volunteer from Black River Falls, Wis. \u201cThere\u2019s something about seeing all the names and the way these people might have been consumed by fire that just brings the tragedy home.\u201dThe Camp Fire, 75 percent contained as of Tuesday morning, has burned through more than 152,000 acres, killing at least 81 people to date. But the true scale of the human catastrophe will be clear only months down the line, once search crews finish turning through thousands of burned homes and businesses, some of which are now mere ash. Experts fear that the final number of fatalities could reach well into the hundreds and that the remains of some will never be found.\u201cI know it sounds horrible,\u201d said Sheriff Kory L. Honea of Butte County, whose office is leading the search, \u201cbut in some cases the remains that we are looking for have been reduced to bone fragments.\u201dFor now, 870 people are listed as missing by the sheriff\u2019s office, a shocking and fluctuating number that underscores the chaos sown by the blaze. The number peaked at more than 1,200 over the weekend and was revised as survivors were located.So many names remain.Dorothy Mack, 88, of Paradise.Paul Benton, 91, of Paradise.Robert Bauries of Magalia.Monika Caputi, 48, of Paradise.Families desperate for information have also flocked to unofficial lists and message boards like the one at the shelter at Neighborhood Church, which are kept updated through word of mouth among the hundreds of evacuees at various evacuation centers.The wait is excruciating, say those who have yet to hear from relatives or friends who were directly in the fire\u2019s path.Among those missing is Terry Poliquin, whose family has not heard from him since the fire came through Magalia, where he lived alone in a mobile home. Like many living on the margins in Magalia, Mr. Poliquin, 62, did not have a car and his health \u201cwas not great,\u201d according to his daughter, Alysha Martin.Ms. Martin reported him missing on Nov. 12, four days after the fire, but she still has no information about him even after speaking to sheriff\u2019s detectives on three occasions. As they wait for official news from county investigators, she and her siblings have done everything they can think of to find him on their own; they checked the Red Cross website, shelters, hospitals. They also reached out to friends on his Facebook profile, hoping someone had seen him.They are losing hope that he is alive, she said.\u201cHe would have contacted us,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least he would have tried. It\u2019s just not like him. I just want answers, and if he did pass away at least that would let me know what happened to him.\u201dThe official list of the missing was gleaned from thousands of emails and the anguished recordings of family members who called 911 during the confused hours when Paradise and neighboring towns were engulfed by fire. Sheriff Honea said the list includes every person declared missing; he stressed it was a raw, preliminary accounting that was being worked through methodically. With every opportunity he has repeated that he needs the public\u2019s cooperation to help whittle down the list, removing those who are safe.\u201cWe are looking in our own record system to see if we have other contacts for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking on their social media pages to try and see if they\u2019ve checked in somewhere; and we are actually going out to locations to see if there is some indication of whether they made it out.\u201dJori Green, 68 of Magalia.Norman Grimsey, 79, and Toni Grimsey, 75, of Paradise.Donald Hardin, 81, of Magalia.Sheriff Thomas D. Allman of Mendocino County, who lived through the wine country fires last year, said he expected the true human cost of the Camp Fire to continue growing in the weeks and months to come.\u201cI think we are going to have a lot of elderly people who were wiped off the face of the earth because they were sleeping and they never got awakened,\u201d Sheriff Allman said. The death toll, he predicted, would \u201cclearly go into the hundreds unfortunately.\u201dThe sheriff dispatched a team to Butte County that is charged with identifying potential homes that have remains. With around 13,000 homes destroyed, most of them incinerated, the search has been painstaking. Sheriff Allman, who has conferred regularly with Sheriff Honea, predicts the search will continue well into next year.\u201cWe are going to be finding people into the spring,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201dBut experts are also careful to note that experience suggests the number on the missing list does not necessarily correspond to the total number of fatalities.In the aftermath of last year\u2019s wildfires in Northern California\u2019s wine country, the list of the missing swelled. Sonoma County alone received reports of 2,269 people unaccounted for as distant relatives called from faraway states with vague stories that their family members may have been in the area. A team of dozens of detectives and probation officers pared down the list by using what Sgt. Spencer Crum of the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office called \u201cgood, old-fashioned detective\u2019s legwork.\u201d It took one to two months to close out the list of the missing, Sergeant Crum said. The death toll in Sonoma County was finalized at 24.Many people whose loved ones are still missing \u2014 particularly if they are elderly \u2014 have held on to hope they made it to safety but have been unable to call for various reasons, because they do not own a cellphone or lack familiarity with social media.In the shuffle to flee and find temporary shelter, many may not even realize they are on the county\u2019s missing person list, let alone unofficial ones.Lapedes Hofer, of Paradise.Margory Jennings, 90, of Paradise.Julie Jewel, 70, of Paradise.Phil Rieser, 70s, of Paradise.The many missing people mean distraught relatives are not sure whether they should mourn.Outside a shelter at East Avenue Church in Chico, Kenny Burton sat down in a barber\u2019s chair for a haircut. There were tears in his eyes as he spoke of his two missing brothers.Mr. Burton, 64, fled Magalia, a town of nearly 12,000 residents just north of Paradise, with nothing. He imagined his younger brother, Donald Wilt, 62, of Paradise, and elder brother, Paul Howard Burton of Magalia, \u201cthree or four years older,\u201d had fled, too. But he had no clue.\u201cI have no way to know,\u201d he said, tears flowing from his light blue eyes as Hector Santos, a volunteer from Danny\u2019s Barber Shop, clipped his sideburns. It was the best day for breathing since the fire. The sky bore hints of blue and the sooty smoke that had filled the air for 200 miles lifted. People were ditching their paper masks.Mr. Burton could think only of his brothers. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my brothers are camping out somewhere,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re wondering about me.\u201dKristin Aquino and her family were initially unable to account for her father and her uncle, whose Paradise homes were completely destroyed by the fire.She was grateful to find her father at a hospital after more than 24 hours of anxious waiting. Her father, Donald Anderson, 72, who uses a wheelchair, struggled to flee Paradise as he witnessed homes erupting in flames around him. He was picked up by a police officer as he rushed down the street. He checked into two different evacuation centers before he was registered online by the Red Cross at the Orchard Hospital in Gridley. He could not call his family because he does not have a cellphone and had no phone numbers memorized.\u201cPeople are spread out everywhere with no way to contact each other. The wait and worry is excruciating,\u201d said Ms. Aquino, 49, of San Diego. \u201cHe\u2019d likely still be missing if not for the Red Cross site.\u201dBut her uncle, Russell Anderson, 70, has yet to be found.As search crews continue inspecting burned ruins, more and more families are receiving the news that their loved ones did not outpace the fires.In the case of Sheila Santos, whose family was urging her to call her children, the authorities discovered remains that might be hers, her daughter, Tammie Konicki, said on Tuesday.Donna Ware\u2019s family waited in agony for a week before eventually learning on Friday that her remains were found at her home in Paradise. Her son, Steve Ware, had been unable to reach her on the day of the fire because of the speed with which it overtook the town, and he and his family were forced to flee the blaze without her.The following days of unanswered prayers were a horror, according to the family, as they tried to find Ms. Ware, who suffered from dementia.

{"Headline": "The Fight Against Malaria Has Reached a Standstill", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthDeaths from the disease plummeted from 2000 to 2013, but are now stuck at over 400,000 a year. Donor giving is flat, and some countries are not doing enough to protect their citizens.Without openly criticizing any particular country, officials made it clear that some are doing too little to protect their citizens. \u201cThe past year has seen lights and shadows,\u201d said Dr. Pedro L. Alonso, the W.H.O.\u2019s malaria program director.Pakistan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and India did well, he said. India had 3 million fewer cases in 2017 than in 2016, a 24 percent drop.By contrast, Nigeria, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, Indonesia, Burkina Faso and a few others are losing ground to the disease.Nigeria, which has a quarter of all the world\u2019s malaria cases, reported 1.3 million more last year than in 2016, the report said.Latin America sees only a few hundred malaria deaths each year, but they increased last year, especially in Venezuela, where the economy has collapsed.For the first time, China reported zero cases transmitted within its borders. Donor governments, Dr. Alonso said, must double what they now give if they hope to push new infection rates down fast enough to meet targets for 2030 set by the United Nations.But global contributions to the fight against malaria \u2014 and against AIDS and tuberculosis as well \u2014 have been essentially flat since the 2008 financial crisis. Of the roughly $3 billion a year spent to turn back malaria, the United States is by far the biggest contributor, giving almost 40 percent of all funding. That has not changed under the Trump administration.\u201cThere is bipartisan support in Congress, not specifically dependent on any administration,\u201d Dr. Alonso said.The chief vehicle for donations is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis; its next tri-annual fund-raising round will take place in October in Paris.But donors have complained that some countries have become too dependent and must spend more of their own money.Success, both doctors said, depends chiefly on strong political leadership in each country.Even though malaria cases in Nigeria have doubled since 2010, according to the report, it spends far less per capita on the disease than many other African countries.Asked why Nigeria did so poorly even though it is a major oil exporter, Dr. Alonso said he would not blame any individual country. Nigeria is a \u201chotbed of transmission,\u201d he said, with a decentralized government and a fast-growing population.Technical problems have not yet dragged down the modern campaign against malaria as they slowly destroyed the one that began in the 1950s. That drive fell apart when mosquitoes developed resistance to DDT and the parasites became immune to chloroquine, the miracle treatment rolled out after World War II. Although resistance to the modern miracle drug, artemisinin, has appeared, it is still largely confined to Southeast Asia.   Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe agency jettisons expert panels providing guidance on important health and environmental issues.Mr. Zarba was the staff director of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Environmental Protection Agency until February.These decisions were the latest assaults on science at an agency that depends on science to protect Americans\u2019 health, safety and quality of life.The disbanded panel on particulate pollution reported to the E.P.A.\u2019s seven-member Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which is responsible for advising the agency on overall air quality standards. Now, without the work of that panel, it is entirely likely that the advisory committee will lack the time and expertise to provide authoritative guidance on the regulation of this pollutant. The same can be said of ground-level ozone.Flawed processes, like eliminating the expertise critical for making informed regulatory decisions, rarely lead to good outcomes. I know, because for the last five years of my 38 years as a scientist at the E.P.A., I was the staff director of the Science Advisory Board, which independently reviews the science behind some of the E.P.A.\u2019s most consequential decisions and policies. The approach of those committees \u2014 transparent and balanced, with meetings that are open to the public to provide opportunities for public input \u2014 helped give the public confidence that it is being protected from harm, and industry the assurance that corrective actions are justified and reasonable. All of that is now in jeopardy as the agency purges scientists from its review panels and purposely disregards scientific research. I chose to retire from the E.P.A. in February, dismayed by the increasingly compromised science review process and the Trump administration\u2019s swing away from the agency\u2019s core commitments to public health and the environment.As I said, these are only the latest efforts at the E.P.A. to undermine science. The agency has barred scientists who received E.P.A. research grants from serving on its nearly two dozen scientific advisory committees because of some misplaced concern over conflicts. But it has had no problem appointing scientists to those panels who hold industry-supported research grants. From what I saw, that approach was replaced by a closed-door process in which the agency\u2019s political appointees chose advocates for particular positions instead of seeking out impartial scientific expertise to help determine policies. By doing this, the administration has subverted the role of science in the agency\u2019s approach on issues.This has fundamentally hobbled many years of legislative effort, by Republicans and Democrats alike, to protect human health and the environment. The cost will be borne by the American public.This attack on science and its connection to E.P.A. decision-making reminds me of the desperation of the tobacco industry when it began to be clear that tobacco was dangerous. The industry tried to discredit and marginalize the science by maintaining that the health-effects data was inconclusive. Truth won out, but it was a hard-fought battle. Will we look back at actions the E.P.A. is making today with the same regret and disbelief as we do with tobacco regulation?Independent, honest science is the backbone of environmental regulation. It also threatens people who want to hide the truth. Christopher S. Zarba was the staff director of the Scientific Advisory Board and director of the National Center for Environmental Research at the Environmental Protection Agency. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visions of a Tech Hub? Landing Amazon Is Just a Start", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amazon announced plans to build a second headquarters somewhere in North America, it set off a competition for a sort of new-economy golden ticket, a chance for one city to become, almost overnight, a magnet for the high-paying jobs and entrepreneurial spark that are hallmarks of urban success in the 21st century.Critics were just as quick to highlight potential downsides: soaring housing costs, clogged roads and strained public resources.A year later, Amazon appears poised to transform two communities, not just one. But the central question \u2014 will that transformation be for the good or the bad? \u2014 has not changed. Economists, urban planners and other experts say the answer could hinge on decisions in the coming months by the company and by the state and local officials who worked so hard to woo it.\u201cThis is not about a one-time deal,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is about whether Amazon and these winning communities are going to create a long-term partnership to minimize the negative impact of supersonic growth.\u201dAmazon may have made that job a bit easier. Splitting the project, known as HQ2, between two cities should ease the pressure on housing and infrastructure that critics have feared. And the company seems to have zeroed in on places able to handle an influx of workers.\u201cThose two markets were in the leading edge of rental slowdowns,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist. \u201cThere is definitely a lot more supply in those markets than there was in Seattle a decade ago.\u201dThe specter of Seattle has loomed over the HQ2 debate. Its economy has boomed since Amazon moved into the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2007. But many residents complain that growth has come at the cost of affordability and livability. Although Amazon has never said so explicitly, its tense relationship with its native city may have contributed to its decision to search for a second home.In New York and Virginia, Amazon has a chance for a fresh start. And those places have an opportunity to learn from Seattle\u2019s mistakes.\u201cWhen Amazon moved into its South Lake Union headquarters, no one knew that it was going to become the global phenomenon that it is today,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said. \u201cIn Seattle there was a lot of catch-up in housing development, catch-up in infrastructure.\u201dNew York and Virginia, by contrast, can start planning immediately to build housing, expand infrastructure and improve transit systems. If they do, Amazon could be the nudge that regions needed to address longstanding challenges, said Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\u201cThere is a way that something like this focuses the mind,\u201d Ms. Wartell said. \u201cAmazon or no Amazon, all of our major housing markets and communities that are thriving are dealing with the consequences of growth.\u201dThe key is ensuring that policies benefit all residents, not just highly paid tech workers that Amazon will employ directly, Ms. Wartell said. That means building housing for low- and middle-income families, not just luxury condominiums, and improving transit options in poorer neighborhoods.Critics are skeptical of that prospect. Lauren Jacobs, executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of local advocacy organizations, said Amazon should make specific promises to train and hire workers locally, rather than just bringing them in from out of town.\u201cMany of our neighbors are still struggling in this economy, and this could be an amazing transformational thing to have 25,000 jobs come to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to ensure we don\u2019t see another wave of mass displacement of working-class residents.\u201dTimothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives, said comments such as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s were concerning. He and other economists worry about a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d where state and local governments compete to offer ever-bigger subsidies.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to hand out cash, and it\u2019s especially easy to hand out cash if it\u2019s going to be the next governor\u2019s problem,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.But not all incentives are created equal, he noted. Efforts to streamline regulatory and permitting processes, for example, can make projects more attractive to companies without costing taxpayers much if anything. And investments in infrastructure or job training can reap benefits for the community even if they are initially promised as a way to help a specific company.\u201cI would be trying to leverage this into improvements that wouldn\u2019t just benefit Amazon but benefit you more broadly,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.New York and Washington, of course, are a far cry from the rural Southeast. And white-collar tech jobs at Amazon require different skills than the factory jobs created by Mercedes and BMW.But Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, pointed to parallels. Amazon and other technology companies employ not just hotshot graduates of Stanford and Caltech but also thousands of lower-level programmers, data analysts and other workers who have technical skills but not advanced degrees.Amazon\u2019s decision could change the pecking order among technology hubs, in which New York and Washington have lagged behind San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.\u201cI think it does set these cities up to be rivals to Silicon Valley a generation or two down the road,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt could be the catalyst.\u201dAmazon\u2019s arrival will also mean more demand for the pool of tech workers in New York and Washington. That worries some start-ups, who already compete with Google, Facebook and other giants that have set up offices there.But Sam Mandel, senior vice president at Betaworks, a company that develops and invests in start-ups, said Amazon would be a net benefit for the tech sector.\u201cThere will be more people leaving Amazon and wanting to do earlier stage start-ups than there will be people leaving start-ups to go work at Amazon,\u201d Mr. Mandel said.Erin Griffith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Law Enforcement Failed to See the Threat of White Nationalism. Now They Don\u2019t Know How to Stop It.", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "For two decades, domestic counterterrorism strategy has ignored the rising danger of far-right extremism. In the atmosphere of willful indifference, a virulent movement has grown and metastasized.Supported byBefore that August, Stout, a 24-year veteran of the Gainesville police force, had never heard of Richard Spencer and knew next to nothing about his self-declared alt-right movement, or of their \u201canti-fascist\u201d archnemesis known as Antifa. Then, on the Monday after deadly violence in Charlottesville, in which a protester was killed when a driver plowed his car into the crowd, Stout learned to his horror that Spencer was planning a speech at the University of Florida. He spent weeks frantically trying to get up to speed, scouring far-right and anti-fascist websites and videos, each click driving him further into despair. Aside from the few white nationalists who had been identified by the media or on Twitter, Stout had no clue who most of these people were, and neither, it seemed, did anyone else in law enforcement.One of those coming to Gainesville was William Fears, a 31-year-old from Houston. Fears, who online went by variations of the handle Antagonizer, was one of the most dedicated foot soldiers of the alt-right. Countless YouTube videos had captured his progress over the past year as he made his way from protest to protest across several states, flinging Nazi salutes, setting off smoke bombs and, from time to time, attacking people. Fears was also a felon. He had spent six years in prison for aggravated kidnapping in a case involving his ex-girlfriend, and now he had an active warrant for his arrest, after his new girlfriend accused him of assault less than two weeks earlier. On Oct. 18, the night before the event, Fears and a few others from Houston\u2019s white-nationalist scene got in Fears\u2019s silver Jeep Patriot for the 14-hour drive. Fears\u2019s friend Tyler TenBrink, who pleaded guilty to assault in 2014, posted video from their trip on his Facebook page. There were four men, two of them felons, and two nine-millimeter handguns. \u201cTexans always carry,\u201d Fears said later.Gainesville would be Spencer\u2019s first major public appearance since the violence of the Unite the Right rally two months before, and the city, a progressive enclave in the heart of deep-red north Florida, was on edge. Anticipating chaos, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency \u2014 prompting Spencer to tweet out an image of his head making its way across the Atlantic toward Florida: \u201cHurricane Spencer.\u201d A few days before the event, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement sent out a small, bound \u201cthreat book\u201d of about 20 or so figures, most of them openly affiliated with Spencer or with anti-fascist groups, which Stout knew from his own research meant they weren\u2019t the people to worry about. Anonymous online chatter on sites like 4chan, meanwhile, described armed right-wing militants coming to Gainesville to test Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law. Stout envisioned 20 white supremacists with long guns. We\u2019re screwed, he thought.By the morning of Oct. 19, a fortress of security, costing the University of Florida and police forces roughly half a million dollars, had been built around the western edge of the 2,000-acre campus and the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, where Spencer and his entourage arrived that afternoon. More than 1,100 state troopers and local cops stood on alert, with another 500 on standby. There were officers posted on rooftops. Police helicopters buzzed the skies. The Florida National Guard had been activated off-site, and a line of armored vehicles sat in reserve. Hundreds of journalists from around the United States and abroad were in attendance, anticipating another Charlottesville.But Will Fears told reporters he came to Gainesville to intimidate the protesters. \u201cIt\u2019s always been socially acceptable to punch a Nazi, to attack people if they have right-wing political leanings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to push back.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we\u2019re not to be taken lightly.\u201dThe Spencer speech turned out to be a bust, thanks to an audience so determined to drown him out that at one point they erupted in a chant of \u201cOrange! Blue! Orange! Blue!\u201d as if at a Gators football game. Afterward, the crowd left the auditorium and flooded back onto Hull Road, the long avenue leading toward the center of campus. Thousands of protesters surrounded the small group of Spencer acolytes. TenBrink, a sinewy young man wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, was particularly overwhelmed and jumped a barricade to escape the angry crowd. The police put him in handcuffs and escorted him into a parking garage. Then, for reasons that remain unclear, they uncuffed TenBrink and walked him out of the garage and toward the parking lot, and let him go. Neither TenBrink nor his friends were in the threat book.One of the protesters had come to Gainesville armed with a retractable baton. When the Texans began to harass them, he grabbed his baton and struck a window of the S.U.V. \u201cMy life and the lives of those around me was at risk,\u201d he told the police. Will Fears jumped out. \u201cI\u2019m about to beat this dude up with his own fricking expandable baton,\u201d he later recalled.Suddenly, witnesses said, a man later identified as TenBrink jumped from the vehicle holding a handgun. \u201cShoot them!\u201d the Texans were heard yelling. TenBrink pointed the gun at the protester.\u201cWe\u2019re actually seeing all the same phenomena of what was happening with groups like ISIS, same tactics, but no one talks about it because it\u2019s far-right extremism,\u201d says the national-security strategist P.\u2009W. Singer, a senior fellow at the New America think tank. During the first year of the Trump administration, Singer and a colleague met with a group of senior administration officials about building a counterterrorism strategy that encompassed a wider range of threats. \u201cThey only wanted to talk about Muslim extremism,\u201d he says. But even before the Trump administration, he says, \u201cwe willingly turned the other way on white supremacy because there were real political costs to talking about white supremacy.\u201dIn March 2018, a 20-year-old white evangelical Christian named Mark Anthony Conditt laid a series of homemade I.E.D.s around Austin, Tex., in largely minority communities. The bombs killed two African-Americans and injured at least four others over the course of several weeks, terrorizing the city, yet the local authorities preferred to describe Conditt, who committed suicide, as a \u201cvery challenged young man.\u201d Also last spring, another white man, 28-year-old Benjamin Morrow, blew himself up in his apartment in Beaver Dam, Wis., while apparently constructing a bomb. Federal investigators said Morrow\u2019s apartment doubled as a \u201chomemade explosives laboratory.\u201d There was a trove of white-supremacist literature in Morrow\u2019s home, according to the F.B.I. But local cops, citing Morrow\u2019s clean-cut demeanor and standout record as a quality-control manager at a local food-processing plant, made sure to note that just because he had this material didn\u2019t mean he was a white supremacist. \u201cHe could have been an individual that was doing research,\u201d the local police chief said.The report also calls out the Justice Department for its \u201cblind spot\u201d when it comes to domestic terrorism and hate crimes, which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein conceded earlier in the week. During a conference on Oct. 29, Rosenstein said that according to the latest F.B.I. crime report, \u201c88 percent of agencies that provide hate-crimes data to the F.B.I. reported zero hate crimes in 2016.\u201d The Justice Department was reviewing the accuracy of the reports, he noted. \u201cSimply because hate crimes are not reported does not mean they are not happening.\u201dIn 2016, the latest full year of data available from the F.B.I., more than 6,100 hate-crime incidents were reported, 4,270 of them crimes against people (as opposed to, say, defacing property). And yet only 27 federal hate-crime defendants were prosecuted that year. \u201cThe F.B.I. knows how many bank robberies there were last year,\u201d says Michael German, an author of the Brennan Center report and a former F.B.I. agent, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t know how many white supremacists attacked people, how many they injured or killed.\u201dMore concerning to German, though, is that law enforcement seems uninterested in policing the violent far right. During the first year after Donald Trump\u2019s election, protests and riots erupted across the country, often involving men with criminal histories who, by definition, were on the law-enforcement radar. During the so-called Battle of Berkeley in March 2017, for instance, a far-right agitator named Kyle Chapman became a hero to the alt-right after he reportedly pummeled an anti-fascist counterprotester with a billy club. Chapman was a 41-year-old who had two previous felony convictions. He proceeded to travel around the country, engaging in violence at other protests, now under the online moniker Based Stickman \u2014 a cheerful reference to the Berkeley attacks.Chapman was one of a number of known white supremacists to align with the Proud Boys, a nationalist men\u2019s movement founded in 2016 by the anti-immigrant \u201cWestern chauvinist\u201d Gavin McInnes, a founder of Vice Media. There was also the Rise Above Movement (RAM), an alt-right group composed largely of ex-cons, many with ties to Southern California\u2019s racist skinhead movement. Over the past two years, each group engaged in violent confrontations with their ideological enemies \u2014 a lengthy list including African-Americans, Jews, Muslims, nonwhite immigrants, members of the L.G.B.T. community and the progressive left \u2014 and generally escaped punishment. This changed to a degree over the past few weeks when, after a yearlong campaign by journalists at ProPublica and other media outlets, federal prosecutors filed charges against eight members of RAM, including two of its leaders. Similarly, after a pressure campaign on social media, the New York Police Department arrested and charged six members of the Proud Boys in connection with an assault after a speech by McInnes at a Republican club in Manhattan on Oct. 12. On his podcast, McInnes noted that he has \u201ca lot of support\u201d in the N.Y.P.D. (The police commissioner denies this.)In at least one instance, the police have in fact coordinated with far-right groups. In 2017, a law-enforcement official stationed at a rally in downtown Portland, Ore., turned to a member of a far-right militia group and asked for his assistance in cuffing a left-wing counterprotester, who had been tackled by a Proud Boy.\u201cThis is what public demonstration looks like in an era when white nationalism isn\u2019t on the fringes, but on the inside of the political mainstream,\u201d says Brian Levin, a former New York City police officer who now leads the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino. During the run-up to some of last year\u2019s major events in places like Charlottesville or Berkeley, he notes, \u201cthere was an unending stream of violent themed chatter and an almost choreographed exchange of web threats between antagonists across wide geographic expanses\u201d that earned barely a nod from law enforcement.During a congressional hearing in the wake of Charlottesville, Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I., told lawmakers last September that the bureau had \u201cabout 1,000\u201d open domestic-terror investigations, roughly the same number of investigations the bureau had open on ISIS. The bureau has not provided information on how many of those investigations pertained to white nationalists or other far-right extremists, as opposed to left-wing or \u201cblack-identity extremist\u201d groups, nor whether they are full-blown investigations, preliminary inquiries or \u201cassessments.\u201d The F.B.I. has also responded to criticism that it has failed to address hateful or threatening messages on social media. The F.B.I. said in a statement: \u201cThe F.B.I. does not and cannot police ideologies under the First Amendment.\u201d But looking at prosecutions, German says, \u201cit\u2019s clear that many of the people targeted for investigation for allegedly supporting the Islamic State were initially identified because of something they said online.\u201dThere are serious civil liberties concerns with any broad surveillance of social media, German says. What\u2019s also true, he notes, is that the volume of white-supremacist-related content is overwhelmingly high. \u201cThere are relatively few Americans voicing their support for ISIS online. But there are millions of racists, anti-Semites, Islamophobes, homophobes and xenophobes who engage in eliminationist rhetoric about the communities of people they fear and hate every day on social media and radio talk shows. Even if the F.B.I. wanted to monitor this hate speech, they wouldn\u2019t have the resources, or any way to distinguish between those who talk and those who act.\u201dLevin believes that the Justice Department could be more flexible in pursuing these groups without violating First Amendment concerns. Just as they do with ISIS supporters, law-enforcement agencies would be within their legal rights to monitor, analyze and share any of the publicly available intelligence on white supremacists or hate groups that suggests violent confrontations. \u201cThe problem is not that we rightly scrutinize violent Salafist extremism,\u201d Levin says, \u201cbut that we do so while materially ignoring domestic white nationalists or those on their fringes who also represent a violent threat.\u201dWhen we first spoke this August, Levin noted the continued ascendance of the far right, even after many of its members went underground after Charlottesville. \u201cThe rocket ship is still twirling,\u201d he said. Levin predicted that the next big wave of activity wouldn\u2019t be around mega-rallies but around what he calls \u201caggressive maneuvers\u201d by loners or small cells. A series of violent outbursts in a single week in October made his prediction seem prescient.In just seven days, a Florida man who lived out of a van plastered with stickers, including one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s face in cross hairs, is reported to have sent a series of pipe bombs to at least a dozen of Trump\u2019s critics. Two days after the first package appeared, a middle-aged white man, having tried unsuccessfully to break into a black church near Louisville, Ky., reportedly shot and killed two elderly African-Americans at a Kroger. \u201cWhites don\u2019t kill whites,\u201d the man reportedly told an armed white man who confronted him. Then, at week\u2019s end, a man who posted on Gab, the alt-right\u2019s preferred social-media site, about a \u201ckike infestation\u201d interrupted services at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and several handguns; he was charged with murdering 11 people and injuring several more, including police officers. The Anti-Defamation League believed it to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history.Law enforcement\u2019s inability to reckon with the far right is a problem that goes back generations in this country, and the roots of this current crisis can be traced back more than a decade. With violent political messaging emanating from the White House and echoed throughout the conservative media and social-media landscapes, Levin only expects more attacks. \u201cWhat we need to worry about is the guy who is riled up by this rhetoric and decides to go out and do something on his own,\u201d he told me in August. \u201cWe have people who are ticking time bombs.\u201dThe author of the report was a senior intelligence analyst named Daryl Johnson, who ran a small Homeland Security domestic-terrorism unit. Two years earlier, in January 2007, Johnson was sitting in his bland second-floor office when he received a call from a contact at the Capitol Police. A first-term Illinois senator named Barack Obama was planning to announce that he was running for president. \u201cCurious if you\u2019ve heard any threatening chatter,\u201d the officer said.This was the first time Johnson had heard of Obama, and he didn\u2019t know about any threats, but that didn\u2019t mean there wouldn\u2019t be any. Though white-extremist groups had been fairly quiet in the years since Sept. 11, Johnson saw this as a temporary lull. These people never truly went away, he thought; they just needed the right motivation to energize them.\u201cWhat do you think\u2019s going to happen when the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazis and other white supremacists get wind of this?\u201d the officer asked.Johnson didn\u2019t skip a beat: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the perfect recruiting and radicalization tool for white supremacy.\u201dAt 38, Johnson spoke with the earnestness of an Eagle Scout, which he was. He was also a registered Republican who grew up in a small Mormon community in rural Virginia where millennialism, or end-times theology, was a core concept. During the 1980s, when Johnson was still in high school, far-right separatists took to the Ozarks or to strongholds in rural Idaho, where they stockpiled food and weapons and conducted paramilitary training in preparation for the biblical \u201clast days.\u201d Some, like the Aryan Nations, whose members embraced the racist Christian Identity philosophy, spawned domestic terror cells like the Order, which waged a brutal campaign of bombings, armed robberies and murder, culminating with the June 1984 assassination of Alan Berg, the prominent Jewish radio talk-show host who frequently spoke of flushing out the latent anti-Semitism in Denver\u2019s conservative community.Years of law-enforcement investigation and infiltration of right-wing terror groups commenced, and by the early 1990s, many of the movement\u2019s most violent members were dead or in jail. But the government standoffs at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Tex., energized a new generation of separatists, Patriot militias \u2014 the forerunners of today\u2019s antigovernment militia groups \u2014 as well as individuals like Timothy McVeigh, who made his way through various antigovernment and racist ideologies and organizations under the radar of law enforcement, before the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.The deaths of 168 people, including 19 children, at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building brought the threat of domestic terrorism by white Americans into stark relief. In the aftermath, the F.B.I. added many more agents to work domestic terrorism cases, and Attorney General Janet Reno created a special task force to investigate domestic terrorism. But by the end of 2001, the dominant business of the F.B.I., as well as every other federal law enforcement body, was international terrorism. Years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the supposed threat posed by Al Qaeda and other Muslim groups continued to drive policy, notably at the Department of Homeland Security, which Johnson, who started his career in Army intelligence, joined in 2005. At the time, he later recalled, he was the only analyst exclusively working on non-Islamic domestic threats. By 2007, he had put together a small team of analysts who began to scour extremist websites and message boards. What they found alarmed them.The militant far right was enjoying a renaissance, thanks to the internet. Hundreds of militia recruitment and paramilitary training videos had sprung up on YouTube, along with promotions for weapons training and, to Johnson\u2019s horror, bomb-making manuals. Between October 2007 and March 2008, Johnson and his unit documented the formation of 45 new antigovernment militia groups, which he saw as highly significant given that before fall 2007, these sorts of groups had been on the decline. Some white-supremacist groups, seizing upon the anti-immigration rhetoric that was then fomenting, created violent video games aimed at exploiting public fear of \u201cillegals\u201d streaming over the border.By the spring of 2008, Obama\u2019s candidacy, just as Johnson predicted, had become a lightning rod for white supremacists and other hate groups. As the campaign moved into its final months, law-enforcement agencies intercepted at least two assassination plots against Obama. Other threats and racist posts flooded the internet, where Johnson\u2019s team noticed a sharp increase in membership on Stormfront, the first major white-nationalist website. The site added 32,000 new users within the first three months after Obama\u2019s inauguration, nearly double the number it added in 2008.Johnson and his team compiled their findings into a report, which they were still working on when Obama tapped Janet Napolitano, formerly the governor of Arizona, as the new secretary of Homeland Security. Napolitano \u201cgot it\u201d when it came to white supremacy, says Juliette Kayyem, who served as the department\u2019s assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs in 2009 and 2010. While serving as Arizona\u2019s attorney general, Napolitano coordinated the investigation of one of Timothy McVeigh\u2019s accomplices. Now, concerned that a reinvigorated white-supremacist movement could pose a threat to the country\u2019s first African-American president and to citizens, Napolitano began asking her intelligence analysts about a rise in lone-wolf \u201cright-wing extremism,\u201d a term commonly used in the counterterrorism world to refer to the radical beliefs of fringe players on the right of the political spectrum.In March 2009, Johnson says he and a few colleagues from the F.B.I. briefed Napolitano on their findings, theorizing that heightened stress because of the continuing financial crisis, coupled with the election of the first black president, created a \u201cunique driver\u201d for individual radicalization and antigovernment and white-supremacist recruitment. Military veterans, including those returning after multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, might be particularly susceptible candidates, they noted, a prediction based on a 2008 F.B.I. assessment that found 203 individuals with military experience who had joined white-supremacist groups since Sept. 11, 2001. It was a tiny number given the overall United States veteran population, which at the time was close to 24 million. It was also a small percentage of the thousands of white supremacists the F.B.I. estimated were active. But the \u201cprestige\u201d that those with military or tactical skills held within white-supremacist groups made their influence much greater, the F.B.I. argued.Johnson remembers Napolitano, sitting at the conference table, soberly flipping through the PowerPoint slides and thanking the analysts for the presentation. A few days later, the Department of Homeland Security released its report, \u201cRightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\u201d which was distributed across the government and local law-enforcement agencies.On April 11, 2009, four days after his report was released, Johnson was at home in West Virginia when a PDF of the document was posted on the website of the syndicated conservative radio host Roger Hedgecock. A link to the PDF was also posted on a blog maintained by the Oath Keepers, the antigovernment group composed of numerous law-enforcement officials. \u201cFORWARD THIS TO EVERY AMERICAN!\u201d read the post, which Johnson suspected had been written by a member of the law-enforcement community. \u201cYOU are now a dangerous terrorist according to the Obama administration.\u201dBy the next day, news of a \u201cchilling\u201d report from the department was making its way through far-right message boards and the blogosphere, where it was picked apart by conspiracy sites like Infowars, which deemed it evidence of a deep-state plot. More mainstream right-wing pundits like Michelle Malkin considered it, in Malkin\u2019s words, an \u201cObama D.H.S. hit job\u201d on conservatives. Some progressives also had concerns about the report\u2019s \u201cdangerously vague and speculative\u201d nature, as a Mother Jones correspondent, James Ridgeway, wrote, warning that \u201ccivil libertarians of all stripes\u201d should be nervous and raising the specter of government surveillance.From the perspective of many people inside the department, the report was \u201cexactly what the department is supposed to do, which is inform and educate our stakeholders about what we see as a threat,\u201d Kayyem says. \u201cThis was not a political document.\u201dCongressional Republicans, answering to a nascent Tea Party movement and the American Legion, soon took issue with the label \u201cright-wing extremism,\u201d which John Boehner, then minority leader of the House, charged was being used by the Department of Homeland Security \u201cto describe American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation.\u201d Boehner was particularly bothered by the report\u2019s mention of veterans. \u201cTo characterize men and women returning home after defending our country as potential terrorists is offensive and unacceptable,\u201d he said in a statement. Several G.O.P. lawmakers called for Napolitano\u2019s resignation, as well as that of Johnson, who, in their view, equated conservatives with terrorists.Johnson was appalled. \u201cI never anticipated such an aggressive, vile backlash,\u201d he told me recently. It was puzzling: Just a few months before his April 2009 report was published, the department released an assessment of the cyber threat posed by \u201cleft-wing extremists,\u201d like the Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front. Legislators, the media and the public at large \u2014 including progressives \u2014 had no objection to that terminology. But the political firestorm over \u201cright-wing extremism\u201d had caused such an uproar that the Department of Homeland Security ultimately avoided using ideological terminology like \u201cright-wing.\u201d A few weeks after the report was released, Napolitano formally apologized to veterans, and after intense pressure from veterans\u2019 groups, the department withdrew the report.Afterward, the administration tried to depoliticize the issue. Obama had been elected promising to improve relations with the Muslim world, though this soon provided an opening for conspiracy-minded Republicans like Representative Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman who once insinuated that Mohamed Elibiary, an adviser to Obama\u2019s national-security team, was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. During the Bush administration, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d had become almost synonymous with Islam. Now, as one former policy adviser recalls, \u201cthe Obama people were adamant that it couldn\u2019t just be about jihadis.\u201dThey adopted a new, less ideological lexicon. Terrorism became \u201cviolent extremism,\u201d which suggested behavior. The administration also came up with a new paradigm of \u201cideologically motivated violence\u201d that ostensibly could apply to any form of extremism, not just Islamic terrorism. The Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department would develop \u201ccountering violent extremism\u201d programs that focused on outreach and community engagement, not warrantless surveillance, though in practice they were still an effort to identify and root out jihadist elements from American Muslim communities, just as they had been during the Bush administration.At the same time, most of the work exclusively focused on domestic extremism stopped at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cI blame an entire political apparatus led by Republicans that made calling something \u2018right-wing extremism\u2019 a political statement,\u201d says Kayyem, who notes the paradox of G.O.P. leaders\u2019 attacking Democrats for refusing to use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic extremism.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019d say if you can\u2019t say it, you can\u2019t fight it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it cuts both ways. If you\u2019re not allowed to say that white supremacy is a form of radicalization, then how are you going to stop it?\u201dThe United States attorney from Western Arkansas, Conner Eldridge, was one of a number of Justice Department prosecutors who felt the department had given short shrift to domestic terrorism. Quietly, Eldridge began to network with United States attorneys from states with a history of white-supremacist activity. They pressed the Justice Department for more resources. \u201cOur thesis was, hey, let\u2019s focus on domestic terrorism at an equal level as we\u2019re focusing on international terrorism, because they\u2019re both terrorism,\u201d Eldridge told me recently. \u201cBut we consistently confronted, at every level, a sort of lack of attention to domestic terrorism. The day-to-day focus was on the next potential ISIS attack.\u201dBack in Washington, weeks would go by with the daily national threat briefings rarely if ever discussing possible domestic threats from the far right. At the F.B.I., counterterrorism agents candidly admitted that domestic terrorism was seen as a backwater and that the only path to advancement was through international terrorism cases. In a recent report on law enforcement\u2019s evaluation of Muslim versus right-wing extremism, a team of researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, noted that in 2008 and 2009 \u2014 the only years for which figures were made public \u2014 fewer than 350 of the F.B.I.\u2019s 2,000 counterterrorism agents were assigned to domestic terrorism.After a series of violent attacks by white supremacists, including on a Jewish community center and a nearby retirement home in Overland Park, Kan., Attorney General Eric Holder announced in 2014 that he was reconvening the Justice Department\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee. The group hadn\u2019t met in 13 years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same as it had been before, but it was something,\u201d says Eldridge, who was tapped to head the committee, which included representatives from about 15 law-enforcement agencies and five Justice Department divisions, including the F.B.I. and the U.S. Marshals. \u201cBut we had no budget, no staff, and we had no person whose sole job was to run the committee.\u201dThe ceaseless focus on ISIS and Al Qaeda filtered down to local law enforcement. The administration\u2019s much-touted \u201ccountering violent extremism\u201d agenda was directed at various threats. But \u201cthe language heavily focused on recruitment and radicalization by ISIS and Al Qaeda,\u201d recalls Nate Snyder, a counterterrorism adviser to the Obama administration at the Department of Homeland Security from 2009 through 2017. As early as 2010, he says, his office was receiving calls from police officers asking for help in many Southern and Midwestern states. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018Thanks for that stuff on Al Qaeda, but what I really need to know is how to handle the Hammerskin population in my jurisdiction,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says, referring to the white-supremacist skinhead group.In 2011, the White House described the threat of Al Qaeda and its affiliates as the \u201cpre-eminent security threat to our country.\u201d By 2013, a new threat had emerged: so-called homegrown violent extremists, or H.V.E.s, a category of people who, though born in the United States, were inspired by a nondomestic ideology to commit violence. H.V.E.s, who tended to be Muslim, were not to be mistaken for domestic terrorists, who by definition were not only Americans but also driven by a domestic ideology like white supremacy. And yet the two were often conflated, and therefore \u201chomegrowns\u201d were also perceived as domestic terrorists: the Tsarnaev brothers, responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013; the perpetrators of the San Bernardino massacre or the mass shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando. Dylann Roof, born in South Carolina, whose homegrown racism was nurtured on neo-Nazi websites like The Daily Stormer, was not, in this context, a domestic terrorist, nor were any of his beliefs seen as indicative of \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d His shooting spree in a church in Charleston, in which he killed nine African-Americans, was interpreted as something else. What drove him, authorities said, was hate. He was a murderer.This dichotomy plagued Representative Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who served as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee. For years, Thompson pressed both the administration and fellow members of Congress to be more outspoken on domestic terrorism. \u201cThe silence was almost deafening when it came to raising any of those issues in Congress,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the administration had this do-nothing approach. They kept telling us, well, we see that white supremacy is a problem, but there\u2019s no way we can get ourselves involved in this because they won\u2019t talk to us.\u201dIt was a curious response from an administration whose \u201cC.V.E.\u201d agenda supposedly addressed all types of ideologically motivated violence. \u201cI really suspect they did some polling and found out that there were certain things an African-American president couldn\u2019t talk about,\u201d one former adviser said. \u201cI think they didn\u2019t want to poke the bear.\u201dThis approach was most evident with Obama\u2019s second Homeland Security chief, Jeh Johnson, who came to the department in 2013, after a three-year sojourn as general counsel to the Defense Department, where he provided legal authority for the drone-strike program. During Johnson\u2019s tenure, Nate Snyder says, his office received calls from evangelical pastors worried about far-right recruitment in their congregations. There was also concern about reports of white supremacy in the military.Johnson, who told me that fear of another ISIS-style attack kept him up at night, held regular round tables with imams and other members of the Islamic community. He resisted the pressure from some members of his staff, and some in Congress, like Thompson, to make similar overtures to communities concerned about antigovernment or white-supremacist groups. He thought it would be absurd to hold round tables with sovereign citizens and white supremacists. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that would have been a very effective use of my time to try,\u201d he told me.Johnson never called Dylann Roof a domestic terrorist, a phrase commonly applied to Timothy McVeigh. \u201cIf there was ever an opportunity to define white extremists as domestic terrorists, Dylann Roof was it,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cBut people went back and forth, and it went down the same careful deliberation that happens with active shooters: Maybe it was a mental-health issue. Maybe he was \u2018disturbed.\u2019 Maybe he had a predisposition to violence.\u201dWhen I spoke to Johnson, he felt it was not his place to call Roof a terrorist. There isn\u2019t a crime of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d to charge someone with. \u201cThere is a certain type of violent extremism that is by nature more of a matter for law enforcement, and another that is about engaging communities at the local level,\u201d he said. But the country\u2019s chief law-enforcement official at the time, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, also didn\u2019t call Roof a terrorist \u2014 though she did note that his mass shooting, which she was prosecuting as a hate crime, seemed to meet the definition of terrorism. \u201cHate crimes are the original domestic terrorism,\u201d she said. James Comey, then director of the F.B.I., wasn\u2019t sure. Terrorism, he stated in June 2015, was \u201cmore of a political act,\u201d and he didn\u2019t see the Charleston shooting as political. Even after a racist manifesto Roof penned surfaced online stating his intent to \u201cprotect the white race\u201d by instigating a race war, Comey still wasn\u2019t sure it met the definition. \u201cI only operate in a legal framework,\u201d he told HuffPost.The refusal to name the attack as \u201cterrorism\u201d was, in some critics\u2019 eyes, a crucial misstep that would have far broader implications. \u201cI was very pleased when the Obama administration started and said, We\u2019re not going to use the phrase \u2018war on terror,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Erroll Southers, a former F.B.I. agent and now director of the Safe Communities Institute at the University of Southern California. \u201cI think the Obama people decided, O.K., we\u2019re not going to call it \u2018terrorism,\u2019 thinking it was a good thing. The problem was they didn\u2019t realize how much it emboldened the other side and gave them political cover.\u201dIn addition to Gaffney, whose biased and statistically flawed data on the \u201cMuslim threat\u201d became the premise for Trump\u2019s so-called Muslim ban, there were other ideological fellow travelers like Sebastian and Katharine Gorka, the husband-and-wife national-security team. Sebastian Gorka became a senior White House adviser, and Katharine Gorka became a senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security. During the transition, Sebastian Gorka predicted the demise of \u201cC.V.E.,\u201d which he suggested was a fuzzy, politically correct approach to a problem \u2014 terrorism \u2014 that needed a better fix. Shortly afterward, Katharine Gorka, who once criticized the Obama administration for \u201callowing Islamists to dictate national-security policy,\u201d made it clear, Nate Snyder recalls, that she didn\u2019t like the phrase \u201ccountering violent extremism.\u201d From now on, the mission would be focused on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d the White House\u2019s go-to phrase, which, as Sebastian Gorka later explained, was intended to \u201cjettison the political correctness of the last eight years.\u201dA surreal scene, replicated in nearly every department and agency, soon began to play out inside the Department of Homeland Security. George Selim, a longtime national-security expert in both the Bush and Obama administrations who headed the Office of Community Partnerships, which worked with local government and civic groups on C.V.E. efforts, noted that as the months passed, \u201cit was clear that there were fewer and fewer of the career civil servants at the table for critical policy decisions.\u201d Some political appointees seemed to have virtually no experience with the issues they had been tapped to advise on. Katharine Gorka, as her own LinkedIn biography notes, had never held a public-sector job before joining the department, nor did she seem to have any practical experience in national security, or law enforcement, or intelligence. Another new senior Homeland Security official, the retired Navy officer Frank Wuco, had made a career of lecturing to the military about the jihadi mind-set, often while role-playing as a member of the Taliban in a Pashtun hat and kaffiyeh. \u201cThat\u2019s who was trying to tell me he understands the threat,\u201d an official said dryly.By February 2017, after the Trump administration issued its first executive order trying to ban citizens of Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, several American Muslim groups decided to reject federal C.V.E. grant money they were awarded under the Obama administration out of concern over the new administration\u2019s framing of the issue. That March, the White House froze the $10 million the previous administration had allotted for the grants, pending review. While that review was underway, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. issued a joint intelligence bulletin, dated May 10, warning that white supremacists might pose \u201ca threat of lethal violence\u201d over the next year. The report, which some analysts said reflected a fraction of the actual numbers, said that white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 .\u2009.\u2009. more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201dAt the end of June, the Department of Homeland Security withheld grant money from several previously approved applicants whose focus was on studying extremists\u2019 online networks and helping both white supremacists and Muslim extremists leave their movements. Though the total budget for C.V.E. was minuscule given the department\u2019s overall grant budget, rejecting those programs nonetheless produced \u201ca real chilling effect,\u201d as one policy analyst recalls. Some researchers withdrew from plans to brief lawmakers on far-right extremism.In July 2017, Selim tendered his resignation. Not long afterward, a senior official on the interagency task force running C.V.E. efforts withdrew. More departures followed. The Department of Homeland Security renamed the Office of Community Partnerships the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships. At the department\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, analysts specifically looking at domestic terrorism and coordinating with local law enforcement were reassigned as public-affairs liaisons, Snyder says. \u201cSo no one is looking at the intelligence and connecting the dots, which is what the Department of Homeland Security was created to do.\u201dIn the lingo of the counterterrorism world, the department\u2019s responsibility is anything \u201cleft of boom,\u201d meaning all the pre-emptive steps that might prevent an attack, from securing the borders to synthesizing and sharing intelligence to working with community leaders and local law enforcement to help them better identify risks. Today, at least for the federal government, Snyder says \u201cleft of boom is dead.\u201dEarly in his life, Fears, searching for identity, cycled through a long list of ideologies. He was 14 on Sept. 11, 2001, old enough to absorb the patriotic fervor of that moment but too young to enlist. For a year or two, he was a Michael Moore-style populist, having been \u201cred-pilled on \u2018Bowling for Columbine.\u2019\u2009\u201d Then, having spent a great deal of his spare time stoned and watching YouTube, Fears embraced the Sept. 11 \u201ctruthers\u201d movement. As he spent more and more time on sites like Infowars, he was exposed to notions that the government, backed by the Illumi-nati, the globalists, the Freemasons \u2014 Jews, but not \u201cthe Jews\u201d as he would later come to see them \u2014 had blown up the towers, crashed the financial markets and plunged the country into economic crisis. This led to his next great obsession: the candidacy of the G.O.P. presidential hopeful Ron Paul, a libertarian who had amassed a large grass-roots following of what The New York Times then called \u201ciconoclastic white men.\u201dBut Fears eventually grew bored with Paul, just as he had grown bored with Michael Moore, and it was in this state of vague political disillusionment, and heavy drug use, that Fears kidnapped a former girlfriend in 2009 and stabbed her in the face, legs and neck before she managed to escape. In 2010, he was sentenced to seven years in prison.Fears doesn\u2019t like to talk much about his sojourn in the Texas state-prison system, though like many young men who went from the penitentiary to the far right, he was introduced to the basic tenets of white supremacy there. \u201cWhite guys got to stick together,\u201d he says, referring to an admitted friendship with members of the Texas branch of the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most notoriously brutal white-supremacist gangs in the country. But he dropped those friendships after prison, he insists. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the whole Nazi skinhead thing with tattoos on their face and beating up minorities for no reason,\u201d he says, implying that they represented an earlier generation: \u201cThey\u2019re like 1.0s.\u201dSix years later, Fears was paroled and emerged from prison drug-free but otherwise largely the same. He was still a conspiracy theorist, though he was less obsessed with the government, his friend John Canales noticed when they reconnected that summer. \u201cNow it was all about the Jews,\u201d Canales says. At home in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, Fears submerged himself in what to him was the new, hyperconnected world of the internet, where every YouTube video he watched algorithmically directed him to others with increasingly far-right political agendas. He was fascinated by men like Richard Spencer, who fashioned himself as the second coming of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. He was also intrigued by Donald Trump, the troubadour of a new generation of angry white men, the alt-right movement \u2014 white supremacy 2.0 \u2014 with its in-jokes and symbols that were mostly lost on U.S. law enforcement.In December 2016, less than six months after getting out of prison, Fears went to his first Richard Spencer event, on the campus of Texas A&M. More so-called free-speech events followed, where young white men in red MAGA hats and polo shirts descended upon college campuses or progressive enclaves in otherwise blood-red states: a clean-cut Trumpian army, marching in formation or hurling insults at activists who, outraged by their very presence, would try to fight them.Sometimes the police would intervene, or not. Fears, for one, always felt safe with the police in Texas, though he said \u201cthey work for ZOG\u201d \u2014 the so-called Zionist Occupied Government. \u201cThey\u2019ll take their paycheck over the country.\u201dCops would stand watch at events, sometimes on horseback, and while they might not have been ideologically aligned with the alt-right, they still tolerated them. Fears said the cops were far less forgiving of Antifa, a catchall term that has been used to describe dedicated anti-fascists and so-called anarchist extremists, as well as animal rights activists, immigration rights activists, members of the local Socialist movement, environmental protesters like those who had recently been blasted by water cannons and rubber bullets at Standing Rock, and Black Lives Matter supporters, whose protests have been met by dozens of cops in riot gear, as well as sometimes members of a paramilitary support unit. One Houston activist, who went to high school with Fears, recalls a rally where the police posed for pictures with members of the alt-right. \u201cVery buddy-buddy,\u201d he says.The same essential scenario played out across the country. At a rally in Sacramento in June 2016 organized by the white-supremacist Traditionalist Worker Party, a throng of counterprotesters showed up. \u201cThe police didn\u2019t step in really at all,\u201d a police observer and representative of the National Lawyers Guild later told The Sacramento Bee. \u201cThey basically just let people do what they wanted to do,\u201d the observer said. \u201cIn this case, someone made a decision just to let them fight it out.\u201d Ten people were hospitalized, at least five for stabbing wounds and other lacerations, most of them left-wing counterprotesters, some of whom were later charged with assault. Only one white supremacist was arrested, though court records originally acquired by The Guardian mentioned at least four T.W.P.-affiliated men who came armed with knives to the rally but were not charged. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at you as a victim,\u201d an investigator with the California Highway Patrol reportedly assured a member of the T.W.P. after the rally.One domestic-terrorism expert who conducts hate-crimes training for law enforcement was baffled by the pushback she received from police officers who didn\u2019t seem to view white-supremacist groups as a law-enforcement problem. \u201cThey\u2019d say things like, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you calling Black Lives Matter or Antifa a hate group?\u2019 The answer is, because they\u2019re not hate groups! But they didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201dIt was in this atmosphere that Fears made his progress through various protests. He traveled to Charlottesville with a backpack of dystopian gear: goggles, gloves and a helmet, though he disguised himself as a Trump supporter in a suit. It was war. It was also fun. By the summer of 2017, the media had begun to cover more far-right events, leading more people to show up in protest, which furthered the right\u2019s victimization narrative, which in turn led to more events and more violence, all of which was packaged into neat selling points for a movement whose actual real-life followers may have been far fewer than they appeared.A person\u2019s willingness to brawl was a point of pride. Some of the most ardent fighters, many of them felons, became celebrities in their own right, offered speaking slots at rallies, where their V.I.P. status earned them police protection. The Rise Above Movement, led in part by a gang member who had gone to prison for an attack, turned beat-downs into an art form, which they promoted on YouTube, drawing recruits. Nathan Damigo, a former Marine who was incarcerated for five years for armed robbery, used footage of his punching a young woman in the face during a Berkeley protest as a recruiting video for his white-nationalist organization, Identity Evropa. The Proud Boys went as far as to create an entire culture around gang-style rituals, including initiation beatings.On Facebook, various white men were stating their intention of going to Charlottesville for what they understood would be a huge gathering of the tribes, making plans of whom to meet up with and what to bring. Fears initially advised against carrying weapons, but he suggested keeping them close by. \u201cIt all comes down to police,\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cIf they leave us to fight for ourselves like in Berkeley, we know to get ready for bricks to start flying.\u201dIn private communications on the chat service Discord, posted online by the progressive watchdog Unicorn Riot, organizers of Unite the Right spent weeks discussing tactics. The F.B.I. itself was limited in its surveillance capacity (though many left-wing groups argued that this did not prevent the bureau from monitoring their activities), and in the absence of comprehensive federal scrutiny, right-wing activists trawled through left-wing websites, shared photos of leading anti-fascist and racial-justice activists and infiltrated real-life gatherings. In advance of the event, leaked chats documented potential attendees openly advising their comrades to take note of any threats of violence so they could share them with the police. Erroll Southers later remarked on the sophistication of advising their followers not to bring cellphones, and sharing information among small cells of affinity groups: \u201cFrom an intelligence perspective, it was very impressive.\u201dFrom a law-enforcement perspective, it was chaos. Rarely did a white-supremacist event draw more than 60 people before 2016; 100 was remarkable. But Charlottesville was another galaxy, both in the sheer number of marchers and their diversity. Southers notes, \u201cYou had factions of white nationalists, white supremacists, Klan members, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates \u2014 which was like having ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab and Boko Haram at the same rally. And they were all rallying together, shoulder to shoulder, while the police watched these people go toe to toe sort of like a modern-day \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 battle.\u201dLieutenant Stout learned of the shooting later that night, and while no one was hurt, his heart sank. In all his preparations, Stout hadn\u2019t considered that violence might occur outside the secure perimeter they had so carefully set up. That night, the Florida state police caught up with the Jeep on the highway and arrested the Texans. The city officials breathed a sigh of relief and lauded the day as a success.Will Fears spent more than 40 days in the Alachua County Jail on $1 million bail. Depending on whom he is talking with, he and his brother and TenBrink, who both remain in the Alachua County Jail, were the \u201ccelebrities\u201d of the jail, or maybe just Fears was. He portrayed his stay as fairly cushy, and one in which he was a very big deal, which of course he wasn\u2019t to the authorities who picked him up in December, after Texas ordered him extradited back to Houston to face charges in the supposed assault of his girlfriend last October. Along the way back to Texas, Fears tried to make conversation. \u201cI was on the news, you didn\u2019t see that?\u201d he remarked. When Fears arrived back in Houston, he spent two nights in the Harris County Jail, then appeared before a judge, who promptly released him on $5,000 bail.Fears returned home to Pasadena and resumed the same life he had always led. Apparently unconcerned about exposure, he had posted his cellphone number on social media. Earlier this year, I called him. We met at a Belgian cafe in a rapidly gentrifying part of Houston. When I arrived, Fears was sitting at an outside table, drinking an Arnold Palmer.Fears told me he had spent most of the past year celebrating the alt-right\u2019s covert domination of the news cycle. He seemed thrilled that Donald Trump tweeted about a so-called migrant caravan, which, like the supposed \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa, was mostly fiction. Yet it was effectively promoted by alt-right websites like The Daily Stormer and Breitbart, and now right-wing celebrities like Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson were talking about it. \u201cThis idea that the alt-right is falling apart and is going to go away, it\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cThe alt-right formulates all these ideas,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhat Tucker Carlson talks about, we talked about a year ago.\u201dIt was a few days after the massacre of 17 people in Parkland, Fla., and Fears had been considering the spate of school shootings in America. He repeated the rumor, widespread on 4chan and Gab, that the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was Jewish, and so were many of his victims. It\u2019s unclear if this is true. But if it were, it would make no sense to Fears, who, if he believes in anything, believes in the essentially tribal nature of all human beings. Jews, he said, \u201chave a biological need to look out for their own.\u201d He had spoken a bit about what he called the J.Q., or Jewish Question, as successive generations of anti-Semites have referred to the debate over how Western nations should handle the presence of Jews in their societies. \u201cI don\u2019t hate them for it, but I realize that their interests aren\u2019t the same as mine.\u201dFears\u2019s views aren\u2019t unique \u2014 roughly 22 million Americans call it \u201cacceptable\u201d to hold neo-Nazi or white-supremacist views, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken in the wake of Charlottesville in August 2017. Roughly the same number of people, about 10 percent of Americans, said they supported the \u201calt-right\u201d; about half of those polled said they were against it. Driving around Fears\u2019s neighborhood one day, I saw Confederate flags, and American flags, and sometimes a Blue Lives Matter flag, and the black-and-white \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag waving from shiny new trucks. I also saw row after row of McMansions, many of them with swimming pools. There were new S.U.V.s parked in the driveways, and boats: signs of money made and money spent. One former high school classmate of Fears\u2019s described the culture as \u201cwannabe redneck.\u201dFears says that unlike him, the bulk of the alt-right prefers to stay in the shadows. \u201cI see a lot of people and talk to a lot of people that people would pay a lot of money to find out who they are,\u201d he says. Some of them, he suggests, take part in his weekly Thursday-morning \u201cfight club,\u201d practicing mixed martial arts. Some have white-collar jobs or are veterans, groups that make up a large part of the movement.Fears was wearing a baseball cap adorned with a red, white and blue patch known as the \u201cwhomster\u201d flag. It\u2019s \u201ckind of a racist joke,\u201d he said, albeit one that most people won\u2019t get, as they probably have no clue what \u201cwhomster\u201d means (it\u2019s a common meme that refers to the supposed, if baseless, fact that African-Americans say \u201cwhomst\u201d a lot). The flag featured the Texas lone star against a backdrop of 14 red and white stripes, an allusion to a signature white supremacist slogan addressing their goal of preserving the white race. The star is centered on a large blue sonnerad, or black sun, an ancient symbol favored by white supremacists, who see it as less obvious than, say, a swastika. In recent years, even longtime neo-Nazi groups like the National Socialist Movement have rebranded by dropping the swastika for less \u201ctriggering\u201d symbols like sonnerads or runes. The meaning is the same.Fears has said that he was upset that his little brother, who in September pleaded guilty to accessory to attempted murder, got in so much trouble. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a white nationalist that much,\u201d he said during an interview with a right-wing podcast. \u201cHe\u2019s really only involved in anything as a result of being my little brother.\u201dIt was a bit like the little brother-big brother Boston bombing duo, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom Fears identifies with. He agreed to meet with me, he said, because I had written about them. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy for our generation, or the youth, the way society is now, to feel victimized. It\u2019s like with your back against the wall, you know what I mean?\u201dIn the Tsarnaevs\u2019 case, this led to terrorism, and for Dzhokhar, the surviving brother, it led to a stretch on death row. Fears, drinking his iced tea-lemonade concoction, considered this. \u201cMaybe he saw a lot of things in the world that bothered him and just didn\u2019t know how to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can sort of relate to that.\u201dFears munched on some bread. \u201cYou\u2019re Jewish, right?\u201d he said pleasantly.In fact, I am. And while I happened to be sitting across the table from an admitted fascist who admires Adolf Hitler and has advocated (he says trollishly) \u201cwhite Shariah,\u201d I didn\u2019t feel threatened by Will Fears. Like so many of the movement\u2019s vague anymen, he presented himself as polite, articulate and interested in cultural politics, and though his views are abhorrent, he stated them all so laconically you might forget that he actually believes in the concept of a white ethnostate. And that\u2019s the point: The genius of the new far right, if we could call it \u201cgenius,\u201d has been their steadfast determination to blend into the larger fabric of society to such an extent that perhaps the only way you might see them as a problem is if you actually want to see them at all.On Aug. 31 this year, his 25th anniversary on the force, Dan Stout retired from the Gainesville Police Department, in part because of the stress and fatigue he endured from the Spencer incident. \u201cThe level of resources and financial impact these types of events are now costing communities to prepare for and manage, it\u2019s just unsustainable,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much of our city do we literally turn into a quasi-police state to manage this?\u201d Stout\u2019s study of the alt-right and left-wing movements made him an \u201cexpert,\u201d at least in the eyes of federal and state law enforcement, who, he says, began to invite him to visit their jurisdictions to share what he had learned. \u201cThey were soaking it up like a sponge,\u201d he says. And yet, in reality he feels that they had collectively dodged a bullet \u2014 \u201cno pun intended,\u201d he says. \u201cJust another inch to the right or the left and we\u2019d have had a very bad situation.\u201dIn May, I called up the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office to ask why someone who had been in jail in Florida on $1 million bond had, upon extradition, been released on $5,000 bond. Joshua Phanco, a prosecutor who at the time was in charge of Fears\u2019s case, was alarmed by the call. He vaguely recalled that Fears had been in prison in Florida, but he wasn\u2019t aware that Fears had been charged with attempted murder, or that he had anything to do with white supremacy. \u201cThis is the first I\u2019m hearing this,\u201d he told me. (Fears\u2019s charge in Florida has since been dropped.)Phanco, who has since moved on to the district attorney\u2019s major-crimes division, spoke with me for two hours. He diagramed the byzantine system that is the Harris County criminal-justice system, one of the nation\u2019s largest, and a study in dysfunction. There is no central database, no way to share information among all the tiny police departments that feed into the clerk\u2019s office, which then divvies up crimes among 22 criminal courts, now scattered across the entire county. Basically, he said, unless someone tells him about a guy he\u2019s prosecuting, he has no clue.\u201cI mean, how come I didn\u2019t know what happened in Florida?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it my fault? Is it Florida\u2019s fault? How come there wasn\u2019t an officer in Houston watching this? How come he was on nobody\u2019s radar?\u201d Houston has an aggressive gang task force whose investigators have deep knowledge of everyone from the street-level drug dealers to the cartel bosses. \u201cIf a fairly high-up guy from MS-13 sneezes, I get a call at 10 p.m.,\u201d he said.If Fears were on someone\u2019s radar, Phanco doubted he would ever get off it. \u201cBut who\u2019s responsible for keeping track of these alt-right guys in Houston? Nobody. For me the question is, well, how come? If you want to look at these guys as terrorists \u2014 which I think it is when they\u2019re firing guns out of cars at protesters,\u201d he noted, \u201cthen the question remains: Who or what will prevent him from committing more crimes? And, from my chair, nobody,\u201d Phanco said. \u201cNobody\u2019s watching it, nobody\u2019s tracking it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s got me scared.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of the federal budget that is spent on counterterrorism. It is 15 percent of discretionary spending, not 16 percent of the overall federal budget. The article also misstated the number of additional participants in a meeting between P.W. Singer and senior Trump officials. It was Singer and one colleague who met with the officials. It was not Singer and several other analysts.Janet Reitman is a contributing writer for the magazine who is working on a book about the rise of the far right in post-9/11 America.

{"Headline": "What to Eat (Besides the Feast)", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive Weeknight DishesHi and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes, pre-Thanksgiving edition. I have dinner ideas for you for the week to come, whether you\u2019re traveling, waiting for a wave of family to come in, or just lying low.Here are five dishes for the week:Speaking of autumnal \u2014 it\u2019s fall on a sheet pan, perfect for this week. If you\u2019re pressed for time (or patience) you could skip the toasted fennel seeds, but they really do deepen the flavor of the dish. Serve with a green salad, or saut\u00e9ed kale or spinach._____The term \u201cslow-roasted\u201d is relative here \u2014 the fish still cooks in about 30 minutes, and it is utterly delicious and worth all the olive oil it bathes in. This recipe is easy enough to make anytime, but special enough to make for company. Double it if you need to, and serve with rice or farro and saut\u00e9ed green beans, chopping extra fresh herbs to scatter on top._____An excellent, appealing, veg-packed idea. Blanched broccoli and mint replace the basil in pesto, walnuts sub in for pine nuts, and lemon brightens it all. I don\u2019t think you need another vegetable, but roasted carrots would be good for a sweater-weather meal. This dish travels well and can be served at room temperature._____Another sheet-pan supper! I\u2019m guessing two isn\u2019t too many, though. (A friend told me she\u2019d love it if this newsletter consisted solely of sheet-pan recipes.) This recipe is written for two smaller pans, but you could definitely do it all on one big sheet pan: Put pork on one side, sprouts on the other. Remove the chops from the pan to rest and return the sprouts to the oven to finish cooking. Voila._____An omelet is a perfect dinner for one or two, and it\u2019s equally delicious to go high (fill with fancy cheese) or low (fill with American cheese). If you\u2019ve ever made a less-than-exquisite omelet, follow the excellent directions on this recipe and watch the video, too. Serve with salad greens and toast, extra butter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Fiji, a \u2018Reluctant Swimmer\u2019 Jumps In", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE 52 PLACES TRAVELERThere\u2019s a first time for everything. Our 52 Places columnist, who barely knows how to swim, tries her hand at scuba-diving and surfing in Fiji.I tried to remember my Fijian instructor\u2019s directive: \u201cThe most important thing is to breathe.\u201d Weighted down with an air tank and a belt of stones around my waist, I sank below the surface of the South Pacific on my first-ever attempt at scuba diving. My breathing was fine; my mind just couldn\u2019t compute that this was possible. I surfaced and ripped out the mouthpiece. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d I said.I grew up in landlocked New Mexico and qualify as a \u201creluctant swimmer,\u201d according to the YMCA where I took swimming lessons for the first time since childhood last year. Snorkeling comes easy to me \u2014 close to the surface, a constant source of air \u2014 but going deeper didn\u2019t cross my mind until I got a message from a friend who\u2019d spent his honeymoon on a dive boat in Fiji with his equally scuba-loving wife.Fiji\u2019s 333 islands and the warm ocean between them have some of the most colorful soft-coral reefs in the world, home to turtles, sharks and a gazillion twirling, neon fish. If my friends John and Heather had traveled across the world to see those underwater treasures, how could I miss out?When Joe pulled out a loaf of bread and the fish began to swarm around us, I was so fascinated I didn\u2019t notice that I\u2019d stopped reminding myself to breathe.So much of Fiji felt thrillingly, spectacularly unfamiliar. Unlike many tourist destinations on this 52 Places trip, the real Fiji never seemed far away. They\u2019d spent the morning before our drive hitchhiking to the market and back with their two children since, as Inia explained, it would take a Fijian at least 10 years of working hard to earn enough money to buy a car. Most people seemed to get around by bus, horse, hitchhiking or on foot.I was not ready, I said, half-joking, but I had already paid for an introductory lesson and we were on our way, so it seemed like this was happening.Koto is from the small island of Fulaga, so far south it\u2019s practically Tonga. There\u2019s no tourism there, only fishing; he\u2019d grown up in the water, but hadn\u2019t seen a surfboard until he made it to the big island eight years ago. That\u2019s also when he met his wife, Mary, who was in the van with us and took a nap while we surfed.An hour south of the city of Nadi, Koto turned onto a hilly dirt road, which led to beautiful Natadola Beach, where loose horses moseyed around. Our surfing spot would be in front of the Intercontinental Hotel, where the waves broke far from shore at high tide \u2014 gentle enough for a newbie like me.Koto wasn\u2019t much of a talker, which helped make for simple instructions. On shore, he ran through his four basic commands. \u201cOn your board,\u201d \u201cready,\u201d \u201cpaddle\u201d and \u201cstand up!\u201d I would start out on a super-buoyant, 10-foot board and, if all went well, would graduate to a nine-footer. And without much ado, we were in the water, Koto leading me through small waves that appeared utterly massive. I was freaking out, until I realized that the water was shallow enough for my feet to touch the bottom.For the first few waves, all I remember was staring straight ahead as I lay face down on the board. Koto held me still until the right wave came along, and suddenly he said, \u201cready!\u201d and \u201cstand up!\u201d And then I was flying toward the shore, knees bent, arms out, feet firmly planted like a champ. (Or at least I thought I was killing it, until a nice, real surfer who had been in the water with us joked, \u201cI could use a push like the ones you\u2019re getting.\u201d)Wave after tiny wave went fantastically, and then one didn\u2019t, and I fell off my giant board and was \u201ceating water,\u201d as I came to call it. Koto taught me to hold my breath from the second I knew I was falling until the time I surfaced. By the end of three hours with Koto, I had stood up more times than I could count. I loved the feeling of flying across the water, past kayakers and boogie boarders. I loved it when Koto high-fived me after a particularly good ride and told me, \u201cThat was your best wave. I didn\u2019t push you. You paddled it all by yourself.\u201dAs the sun set, Koto asked me if I wanted to go in. \u201cOne more wave,\u201d I told him. \u201cOr two, or three, or four.\u201dPrevious dispatches:Next dispatch: Gangwon, South KoreaAdvertisement"}

His body has not been found.Mr. Corral has vowed to bring justice to his family and lauded him as an \u201cexplorer who loved Mexico and its people.\u201dThe Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful drug-trafficking rings, is active in many parts of the country\u2019s north, exerting influence and control through violence, kidnapping and targeted killings.Mr. Braxton-Andrew, who was from Davidson, N.C., was an algebra and Spanish teacher and had backpacked extensively throughout Latin America.\u201cPatrick died doing what he loved \u2014 traveling and meeting people,\u201d the post read. \u201cJoin us in celebrating his life as he would want us to do. We will always remember Patrick and his joy for life.\u201dDuring the weeks of uncertainty over Mr. Braxton-Andrew\u2019s fate, his relatives shared constant updates of what little they had learned about his disappearance, interspersed with accounts of a man they say had a love for travel, sports and teaching.They wrote that Mr. Braxton-Andrew was last seen around 4 p.m. on Oct. 28 when he went for a walk from his hotel in Urique. He had been spotted walking near a ranch outside the town, and locals searched for him after learning that he was missing, with local police joining the effort three days later.As part of the social media campaign seeking information, supporters shared images of Mr. Braxton-Andrew with the hashtag#FindPat and its Spanish-language equivalent, #BuscaPato.The family also enlisted the help of Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, whose office was in touch with Mexican law enforcement officials.On Friday, Mr. Tillis said the work to find and repatriate the teacher\u2019s body would continue.Advertisement"}

I visited on a damp and dreary afternoon, and when I ducked out of the descending gray mist into the bright and tidy cafe, an aromatic cloud of sugar, cardamom, vanilla and bread immediately surrounded. Every gleaming white marble cafe table was filled with patrons chatting over small plates of enticing food and mugs of hot coffee \u2014 save for a single table in the corner. My husband and son slid onto a mint-hued banquette that spans half the length of the shop while I perched on a sleek, but comfortable, Danish modern chair. Not a single laptop was open. No one stared into a phone. No one was even shooting smartphone pictures of the otherwise Instagram-worthy pastry case.

{"Headline": "A Look Inside the Tactics of Definers, Facebook\u2019s Attack Dog", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a few days before Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, testified to Congress in September, Definers set its sights on a different target: the senators about to question Ms. Sandberg.In one document circulated to reporters, Definers tallied what software the 15 members of the Senate Intelligence Committee used to track visitors to their Senate websites. Another document detailed how much each senator spent on Facebook ads and how much they had received in campaign donations from Facebook or other big tech companies.Known in the political business as opposition research, the documents pushed out by Definers neatly provided reporters with the ammunition they would need to suggest the senators grilling Ms. Sandberg were hypocrites for criticizing Facebook.While senators are no strangers to opposition research \u2014 they use it all the time against political rivals \u2014 they take a dimmer view when it is used against them outside of election season. That is especially true when the research is being paid for and shoveled to reporters on behalf of a company that is saying it wants to work with lawmakers, not against them.And companies facing scrutiny in Washington usually avoid doing anything that could antagonize lawmakers.\u201cAt the same time that Facebook was publicly professing their desire to work with the committee to address these issues, they were paying a political opposition research firm to privately attempt to undermine that same committee\u2019s credibility,\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the panel, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning.\u201d\u201cI understand that a lot of D.C.-type firms might do this kind of work. When I learned about it I decided that we don\u2019t want to be doing it,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday during a call with reporters.Colin Reed, managing director of Definers, said in an email that his firm simply compiled public information and what Definers did was \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d for public affairs outfits. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising to reporters at The New York Times that a P.R. firm would be providing context for reporters ahead of a client\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill,\u201d he wrote.Facebook initially hired Definers to monitor news about the social network. It expanded its relationship with the firm in October 2017 when scrutiny of Facebook was increasing over how Russian agents had used the site to sow discord before the 2016 United States election.Definers began doing some general communications work, such as running conference calls for Facebook. It also undertook more covert efforts to spread the blame for the rise of the Russian disinformation, pointing fingers at other companies like Google.A key part of Definers\u2019 strategy was NTK Network, a website that appeared to be a run-of-the-mill news aggregator with a right-wing slant. In fact, many of NTK Network\u2019s stories were written by employees at Definers and America Rising, a sister firm, to criticize rivals of their clients, according to one former employee not allowed to speak about it publicly. The three outfits share some staff and offices in Arlington, Va.Before Ms. Sandberg\u2019s Senate testimony, Facebook lobbyists pushed lawmakers to refrain from questioning her about privacy, censorship and other issues, and to stick to election interference. The committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, was swayed and warned members to stick to the hearing\u2019s planned topic, The Times reported Wednesday.Facebook had also lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. Mr. Burr invited Larry Page, a Google co-founder, but he did not show up. Instead, Ms. Sandberg sat alongside an empty chair behind a placard for Google.In an email days before the hearing, a Definers employee pressed a Times reporter to write that Facebook was taking the senators\u2019 concerns seriously while Google was irresponsible for skipping the hearing.Like the documents on the senators, Definers distributed other memos that sought to lay out evidence for angles that it wanted reporters to pursue. The memos were typically based on public information like press clippings and social media posts.Definers urged reporters to explore the financial ties between Mr. Soros and Freedom From Facebook, a coalition of groups that had criticized the company. The idea was to persuade reporters that the coalition was not a sincere movement of like-minded groups but rather an orchestrated campaign by a rich, partisan opponent.A two-page document that Definers distributed about Freedom From Facebook noted that \u201cat least four of the groups in the coalition receive funding or are aligned with George Soros, who has publicly criticized Facebook.\u201d The four groups named in the document do appear to have received funding from Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations.A second, 12-page document sought to link Freedom From Facebook to Mr. Soros and to David Brock, a Democratic operative who is widely portrayed in conservative circles as a master of political dirty tricks. While pushing the connection to Mr. Soros, the document highlighted that protesters from Freedom From Facebook held up signs with images reminiscent of old, anti-Semitic propaganda.Definers said in a statement that the document was \u201centirely factual and based on public records.\u201dEddie Vale, a Freedom From Facebook spokesman, said the coalition\u2019s primary funder was the computer scientist David Magerman but he declined to disclose other funders. Mr. Vale said the coalition did not receive money from corporations. Open Society Foundations said it did not fund the coalition.Laura Silber, a spokeswoman for Open Society Foundations, said the philanthropy\u2019s president spoke with Ms. Sandberg on Thursday and requested that Facebook commission an independent review of the company\u2019s relationship with Definers, with results made public within three months.Jack Nicas reported from San Francisco, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington.

{"Headline": "Who Let the Dogs Out (at the Wedding)? Readers Respond", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe asked our readers to submit photos of their dogs, cats and even birds dressed in fancy wedding fashion. Here\u2019s what they shared.There was no doubt that my pets had to be included in my wedding. I am so obsessed with them. I walked down the aisle first so that I would be on the stage to watch Toby and Rooby go down. They were the main focus and the reason I chose my amazing venue. There was no negotiating. The dogs had to be a huge part of my wedding. They\u2019re my kids. Toby had a custom tuxedo made with gold buttons and velvet accents, which was modeled after the groom\u2019s. Rooby\u2019s dress was modeled after Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s outfit in the opening of \u201cSex and the City.\u201d She had a blush silk top with a tulle skirt. They were made by Danielle Pursell of SewDoggyStyle. They also had custom sunglasses made by Susan Howard of Hayleys Hats. Rooby also had a custom hair bow made by Breathe and Bark. Both wore custom garlands and leashes from Amaryllis Floral and Event Design on nude rope collars and leashes.Sarah Meashaw, Bethesda, Md.A day celebrating our love, would not have been the same without sharing it with our fur babies. Even though our wedding was canceled because of a hurricane, with less than 48 hours notice, we were able to pull through and have a smaller wedding. Our pups were able to stay with us through the entire reception. A family member made a dress for Zoe to match the dresses that my maid and matron of honor wore.Melody Emerson, High Point, N.C.He\u2019s our son. We couldn\u2019t imagine our special day without him participating. He truly stole the show, especially when he peed on the huppah at the end of his strut down the aisle. Our florist made Wayland a custom collar to match the rest of our florals. We even had to measure his neck so that it would fit just right. We wanted him to have something unique that you couldn\u2019t buy in a store.Chloe Zale, New YorkHe will always be our first son and the first pet each of us had. We bought him a harness tuxedo on Etsy. That way he could stand up at the altar. Danielle Rains-Walker, Austin, Tex.He is our child, our baby and he\u2019s been with me through everything. He adores his new permanent papa. He is wiser than the day is long. Our wedding was a Roaring \u201920s and Gatsby theme. We ordered his tuxedo and gold bow tie from Chewy.com, his top hat from Amazon and his ring-bearer pillow from eBay.Shae Steven Franklin, DenverBecause he is just as important to me, if not more, than the man I was marrying, Ernie wore a satin blue tuxedo with a velvet bow tie. It was a custom purchase on Etsy. Post ceremony, on the dance floor, Ernie loosened up and took off his jacket, sporting just his shirt underneath.Victoria Lam, Los AngelesThey are our family. My dachshund Lily had a message for all of us. She waited 10 years for us to finally get married. She wore a white linen and lace dress with a silk flower collar and matching leash. My Berner, Zoey, wore a silk flower collar with a matching leash, and she walked my husband down the aisle. Allison Black Goldberg, Union Pier, Mich.Stella is a part of our family, so there was never a question about her being a part of our wedding. One of Stella\u2019s friends from school has a mom who makes custom dog clothes, and I asked her if she could design a dress for Stella similar to my bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. We did a FaceTime fitting, and she told me how exactly I should pin it. I also included a flower from my dress, and the result was incredible, with unexpected surprises like a glitter top hat with tiny little flowers and a beautiful leash to match. Stella looked incredible.Devora Libin, New YorkWe moved to San Francisco from Hoboken, N.J., just two months after getting engaged. Upon moving, we knew we wanted to get a dog, and Bernie stole our hearts from the minute we met him. He quickly made the cross-country move for two East Coasters much easier and really is a part of our family. We couldn\u2019t imagine our wedding day without him. We got married in New Jersey overlooking our favorite city, New York, with our family and friends. Having Bernie be a part of our day allowed us to incorporate our new home of San Francisco, and we couldn\u2019t have pictured it any other way. Bernie\u2019s tuxedo was from a local San Francisco pet shop. As soon as we saw it, we knew it was the perfect black and white classic tuxedo to complement his human father and the rest of the bridal party.Elise Nest, San FranciscoBoth Bruno and Barkley are our family, and it was only fitting that they would be the ring boys for us. Their outfits were incredibly simple: a burgundy bow tie to match the ones that male members of the wedding party wore.Sophia Boccard, New YorkWoodrow was our first dog. He moved with us from the University of Michigan to Alaska, back to Cornell University, and again to Alaska. He was an enthusiastic member of our early sled dog teams, a hobby we have kept up for 37 years. At our wedding, the rabbi would not allow Woodrow into the sanctuary, but he was allowed to attend the reception in the temple's social hall. Woodrow's checkered vest and bow tie were very stylish for 1983.I can't imagine a wedding day without Nala being a part of it. I actually messaged my husband first on OkCupid, and the first thing he asked was what type of a dog I had. Little did he know, it was two weeks until Nala would come to live with me. She has been there since the beginning of our relationship and is an important part of our lives together. We bought Nala\u2019s suit off Etsy from Olivia's Doggie Designs. The suit was custom made for our pup. The color of her suit matches the groomsmen and her bow tie matched the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. We spent more time on the dog outfit than the actual wedding dress.Mandy Menaker and Eric Winer, New YorkWhile we knew that Baloo would undoubtedly steal the show at our wedding. We also knew that our wedding day would not be complete without him there. Baloo was a groomsman, and he fulfilled the role completely. He helped the groom loosen up and relax before the ceremony by taking him for a walk around the park, providing an easy conversation starter with guests that arrived early, and most importantly, stood right by his side throughout the ceremony. Of course, the bridesmaid that walked him down the aisle knew that all eyes would be on Baloo and not her, but she was willing to make that sacrifice because Baloo is our pride and joy, and firstborn child. In fact, in honor of Baloo, we chose to donate to a bulldog rescue organization, the Philly Bully Team, in lieu of providing traditional wedding favors. Baloo is a short, stocky, dense American bulldog. While his legs are no more than seven inches in length, his build is that of a large bulldog. We knew that his tuxedo for the wedding needed to be custom made. Sean did some research and found an Etsy shop that had experience with pet outfits for weddings. He took out the measuring tape, sized up Baloo's weird-shape torso, and provided the measurements over to the designer. The tuxedo, designed to match the groom, was flawless. Everything fit perfectly.Marissa Sudol and Sean Christie, PhiladelphiaSlim Jim started our family by joining our pack when she was a puppy. She showed us that love is an infinite, unconditional gift. Slim Jim wore a custom tutu inspired by joy and festivity. The tutu was handmade by our friend\u2019s young daughter, Jane Keenan.Lorelei Narvaja Gauthier and Daniel Michael Gauthier, PhiladelphiaA bridal party is supposed to be composed of your best friends, and Atticus is certainly a best friend to both of us. We call him our chaperone because he always likes to insert himself physically between the two of us and grumbles when we don't include him in hugs and kisses. Still, he's both friend and family to us and a huge part of our lives. We knew he had to be included in the wedding. But because being at the actual wedding would have been too exciting for Atticus, we went with a Build-a-Head cutout of his face from Buildahead.com. His cutout participated in photos and walked down the aisle on the arm of one of our bridesmaids.Madeleine Minton and Jaret Glazer, ChicagoTurtle is a big part of our lives, and since we had a destination wedding, she was coming with us. She was the most photogenic one of the group. Turtle is just donning her feathers. Her beautiful colors don\u2019t need any additional outfit!Jaime Altabet and Jeff Monheit, Forest Hills, N.Y.The boys are part of our family. Tasuki has been with me for 13 years and Bagel completed us when I moved back to the Bay Area to be with my future husband after a two-year stay in New Jersey. We could not imagine them not being a part of the biggest day of our lives. We looked at a lot of different options, but settled on these bow ties from Chewy.com. My husband liked the Chippendale look it gave them.Edward Lim and Luana Lim, South San Francisco, CalifBefore being with my husband, Bill, I\u2019d never had a dog of my own. After being together nine years, and despite his vow not to subject himself to the pain of losing a dog again, Bill arranged for me to get LuLou. She has truly been the most loving gift of which I could ever be the custodian/recipient. She was the only member of our wedding party because she symbolizes the generosity and sacrifice that love requires every day. She wore a Martha Stewart checkered dress, purchased at Ross for its appropriateness for a late-August outdoor wedding ceremony. We wanted it to reflect a feeling of casual fun.Honestly, having Combo in the wedding was never a question. It was an automatic detail that neither of us had to think about. Combo is a part of the family and the only logical place for her to be while we were getting married was at the ceremony. Combo was the star and \u201cbrand\u201d of our wedding. Our hashtag was #perfectcombo, because she is perfect, of course. And because we are a perfect couple and a perfect combo. Combo's leash was custom made at LaVilla Dog Works, a shop in the bride's hometown, Johnstown, N.Y. The leash's fabric was the same fabric that was used for the napkins at each place setting. Her collar was made by the bride with faux flowers.Marlaina Hunter and Dan Hunter, Poughkeepsie, N.Y.Cooper Brownstone McIsaac is a rescue dog, who as a four-month-old puppy was found abandoned just outside Paris. He was taken in by the Society for the Protection of Animals and arrived the very same day we did to our local shelter, seeking a home, as we were seeking a puppy. Cooper was an obvious choice for the Dog of Honor role at our wedding. Since his adoption in January 2018, he has proved to be a tremendously clever, playful and loving companion. He is at the very center of our days and lives. As Paris is quite dog friendly, he accompanies us on shopping excursions, long strolls through scenic Paris and often joins us when we go out to eat. He even sleeps between us in our bed each night. Our nickname for him is \u201csweetness and light.\u201d It was always obvious to us that we would include him in our wedding ceremony. We purchased Cooper's kilt on a trip to Edinburgh in May 2018, the day after we bought the groom's kilt. As the groom is Franco-Scottish, we thought doing a kilt wedding (and having a bag piper) would be a great way to pay homage to his roots. Catherine Victoria Olien and Florent John McIsaac, ParisCoco is a part of the family, so she naturally was a part of the wedding. The morning of the wedding, she hung out with the bridesmaids for hair and makeup. During the ceremony, she walked down the aisle with the flower girls. Later in the day, she mingled with friends and family. Our wedding was a traditional Indian ceremony, so fittingly Coco, like the rest of the wedding party, wore traditional Indian attire. Her outfit was designed in India to match the bridesmaids\u2019 saris. The dressmaker, Kiran of Bangalore, India, was a little surprised by the request for a dog-size sari, but did a wonderful job creating a custom piece for Coco. On her neck, Coco wore a peach garland to match the ones worn by her parents.Savina Aneja and Shravan Kandula, Winter Park, Fla.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows) and Instagram.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Woozy With Moderation", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado run for president as a centrist?Contributing Opinion Writer\u201cHow do I get from here to there?\u201d I asked a cop. I thought it was a reasonable question.\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he replied, summing up the Trump era in a single phrase.So I stood there, along with a score of other New Yorkers, waiting for Mr. Trump to pass. At last his motorcade appeared, and as it did, people on both sides of the street spontaneously raised their arms and flipped our chief executive the bird.Governor Hickenlooper, an optimistic, pro-business, pragmatic centrist, might seem, at first, like a long shot for the Democratic nomination. But then, in considering a post-Trump era, it is hard to imagine anything.He and I had been aspiring to a conversation for years now, as part of a tiny cohort of people (about 15 since 1970) who attended the same high school and the same college \u2014 the Haverford School, in Pennsylvania, and Wesleyan University, in Connecticut. Six years apart, we did not know each other when we were young. But as I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve sometimes wondered: To what extent are we \u2014 a brewery owner turned governor and an English teacher turned transgender activist \u2014 the result of the educations we received?We both arrived at Haverford feeling uncertain, self-conscious. We both left Wesleyan with a sense of purpose.Haverford helped, a little. It was getting to play sports, he said, that first gave him some confidence, even though his dyslexia made the classroom difficult. (This was the exact opposite of my own experience, where I loved learning Latin and German and reading Thomas Mann, but found sports in general, and the locker room in particular, an endless mortification.)Wesleyan helped, too. Like me, Mr. Hickenlooper majored in English. But it was a final semester course in geology that changed his life: \u201cI took six pages of notes, more notes than I had ever taken in any English class, and just became enraptured. That\u2019s when I really came alive.\u201d After graduation, he returned for an extra year as a special student. \u201cI took calculus and chemistry and physics \u2014 all that stuff I\u2019d never done before but I was really good at,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kind of discovered a new part of myself. And that was my road to self-confidence.\u201dThat road would lead to working for a petroleum company in Colorado, and after that, to opening a brewery in Denver. He became the city\u2019s mayor, and in 2011, the governor.It\u2019s been a long time since anyone spoke about \u201cthe politics of joy\u201d in America, a phrase once associated with Vice President Hubert Humphrey. But there\u2019s a gentle ebullience to Mr. Hickenlooper. \u201cThere\u2019s a word called topophilia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means love of place. Isn\u2019t that a form of joy, a sense of belonging? Isn\u2019t it one of the ingredients that creates a happy, fulfilled life \u2014 loving where you are? Well, part of that is knowing where you are, knowing the wonderfulness of your history.\u201dWhat\u2019s the ultimate goal? I asked. \u201cWe want to create joy, to a certain extent,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut quality of life starts with a good job.\u201dI took my leave of the governor and headed out into the New York morning, my head woozy with moderation. True, he hadn\u2019t left me with the same sense of wonder I\u2019d felt after being in a room for the first time with Barack Obama. But I was left with something else: a generousness of spirit, a sense of humor. Is that enough to carry John Hickenlooper all the way to the White House?It might be.As I headed west, I saw that the barricades erected for the passing of Donald Trump had been dismantled. Two hours earlier, I\u2019d stood there with New Yorkers, our progress impeded.But now President Trump was gone, and nothing barred the way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Memory From Out of the Blue ", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ&APeople sometimes experience random recollections during routine tasks such as housekeeping. Scientists call them \u201cmind-pops.\u201d The phenomenon was given a name, mind-popping, by one of the few researchers to study it, George Mandler, a pioneer in memory research who died in 2016.He and his colleagues found that such a memory usually occurred during a task that was relatively automatic, such as routine grooming or housekeeping, which left the mind free to wander. They speculated that the recall might involve what is called long-term priming, information related to the memory that was acquired days or even weeks earlier than the actual recollection. One study assessed the frequency of mind-pops in small samples of mentally healthy people and in patients with schizophrenia or clinical depression. The results suggested that mind-pops may be more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Questions for America\u2019s Ugliest Campaign", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Tennessee, two Senate candidates have spent enormous sums to replace Bob Corker. Mr. Cavendish is the former editor of The Nashville Scene.NASHVILLE \u2014 When Phil Bredesen announced his candidacy for the Senate last fall, it put a previously abandoned Southern state in play for Democrats. It also led to one of the ugliest, most expensive races in the 2018 midterms.The race pits Mr. Bredesen, a popular former governor, against United States Representative Marsha Blackburn, a favorite of the Tea Party and President Trump. With just days to go and Ms. Blackburn only a few points ahead, one of the most divisive races in Tennessee history will be determined by the answers to four questions.It is a way to nationalize a race that Mr. Bredesen would much prefer be about local issues, and above all about experience. In many ways, the Senate contest mirrors the state\u2019s Republican primary for governor that was fought this summer. Diane Black, another House Republican, chose to emphasize national issues as well, promoting her support of the president\u2019s tax cuts and efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border. She finished a distant third behind Bill Lee, the party\u2019s nominee, in part because Republican voters were turned off by her constant ads about immigration.Still, this isn\u2019t a race for governor, no matter how much Mr. Bredesen would like to make it about balanced budgets and rural internet access, two of his favorite issues. The winner may end up voting on a Supreme Court nominee, and Ms. Blackburn used the Brett Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 and a month of negative ads \u2014 to surge into an October lead in the polls. For weeks, she attacked Mr. Bredesen for not taking a position on the nomination, stoking fears among potential Republicans crossover voters that he would ensure a liberal court.When Mr. Bredesen finally issued a statement that he would have voted for Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 \u00e0 la West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, another conservative Democrat in a very red state \u2014 he faced an immediate backlash in his own party. As early voting began, some progressive voters have chosen to write in \u201cBelieve Women\u201d instead of Bredesen or Blackburn. In a close race, those votes may matter.How voter exhaustion breaks for either candidate is anyone\u2019s guess, but the role of outside Republican money has been a Democratic talking point, an attempt to counter Ms. Blackburn\u2019s strategy of nationalizing the race. If it works, and voters decide that Ms. Blackburn\u2019s outside money is somehow worse than Mr. Bredesen\u2019s, he might see a boost at the polls.One of the big reasons Ms. Blackburn has had trouble pulling away from Mr. Bredesen is his long-established reputation as a moderate and consensus builder; he was a popular mayor of Nashville, and then a popular governor, and many Republicans have voted for him in the past. The message he\u2019s pushed in ads has been simple and personal. He uses the phrase \u201cI\u2019m applying for the job,\u201d because he wants voters to look at qualifications more than ideology.In the South, however, conservative Democrats have found themselves without a home (or, increasingly, a job) as both main political parties have moved away from the center. Tennessee is no exception, and as the state has become increasingly urban, Mr. Bredesen\u2019s own party has become more progressive \u2014 while the suburbs have become more conservative. Nationally, Democrats have found a winning message in health care and fighting to preserve protections for pre-existing conditions. But Mr. Bredesen, a critic of Obamacare, has been reluctant to embrace its more popular provisions. It appears that many Tennesseans are ready to answer these questions.Steve Cavendish, a freelance journalist in Nashville, is the former editor of The Washington City Paper and The Nashville Scene.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Story of Threatin, a Most Puzzling Hoax Even for 2018", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rock band went on tour in the U.K. and nobody came. Then it got weird.In April, Jered Threatin began to hold auditions for a backing band. He chose three musicians and told them they would embark on an all-expenses paid European tour with his band, Threatin.But when the band went on, there were only three people in the audience.\u201cIt was only on show day when no customer list for the 291 customers was produced that we realized we\u2019d been duped,\u201d Ms. Lovelace said. \u201cThe show went ahead with only the supports, staff and crew in attendance. The bar made almost zero money, and it was all extremely bizarre. And empty, obviously.\u201dThe next few gigs were similarly barren. After a show at The Exchange in Bristol on Nov. 5, for which a promoter claimed to have sold 182 tickets, staff at the venue decided to investigate the band. After all, someone had paid more than $500 to book the venue.Then there was the question of his fan base. Many of Mr. Threatin's hundreds of Facebook friends were apparently from Brazil, and YouTube videos of his concerts never show the band and the crowds at the same time. Other videos from his channel, some of which have since been removed, included clips of interviews of him in which the questioner was not shown, and it seemed possible he was interviewing himself.Members of Mr. Threatin\u2019s touring band didn\u2019t find anything about their leader to be out of the ordinary at first. Dane Davis, the band\u2019s drummer, and Joe Prunera, its rhythm guitarist, both Las Vegas-based musicians, told similar stories in interviews with The New York Times. Both men found Mr. Threatin and the other members of the band easy to get along with, and they quickly bonded over music and games of blackjack and Uno. Mr. Davis said that the only unusual thing that happened before the tour that he could recall was that, two days before the band was to fly to England, they were told that the $300 they had been promised would have to cover their food. Also, when they were given an extremely strict tour itinerary with required curfews even on days when the band wasn\u2019t playing.\u201cWhen we met up later there was a confrontation about going and getting breakfast without letting them know,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cKelsey confronted us and she said, \u2018That can\u2019t happen again. If you guys do it again you\u2019re off the tour.\u2019\u201dMr. Davis, who described himself as conflict-averse, said that the Threatins told the musicians that they had needed official sponsorship to get into Europe. They were told that if they did not check in as a full band with the sponsors, their visas would be revoked.The same thing happened at venue after venue. \u201cAt no point do I think any of us thought, \u2018Oh he\u2019s faking all this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThe whole impression I had was that the management company and record label were smaller companies that were still trying to get him out there and gain traction. He said that he had hits in Europe, especially in Germany. So it was weird \u2014 but nothing where you could say like, \u2018Oh maybe everything\u2019s being faked or maybe he's lying about everything.\u2019 He played it off as being just as confused as we were.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t maintain being a part of a tour with people sort of associating me with Jered, as maybe being someone who\u2019s a part of the lies,\u201d Mr. Davis said.Mr. Prunera flew home to the United States. He could not afford the flight on his own; an aunt lent him the money. Mr. Davis stayed in Ireland where his older brother Sean lives. Both men denied knowing anything about Mr. Threatin\u2019s plans. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do anything like this to damage my career and damage other peoples careers as well,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am.\u201dMr. Carney, who Mr. Davis said remained with Mr. Threatin in Europe, did not respond to text messages.A publicist for Mr. Threatin who said her name was Charlotte Haynes responded to an email promising to arrange an interview with the musician. She requested that the interview be conducted by email and did not answer questions about his wife, how long she had represented him, or who her other clients were. The website for her company, Magnified PR, was one of the many sites housed under the Superlative Music site created for the artist\u2019s fake label.Ms. Lovelace, the promoter at the Underworld venue in London, said that theories have continued to circulate about the musician\u2019s motivations.\u201cI think he\u2019s just a rich kid who bought himself a tour so he could return to America with evidence of a U.K. tour, cleverly documented to not show the lack of audience, in a bid to get music industry interest at home in America,\u201d Ms. Lovelace said. \u201cSome people think this is some kind of genius level art project or social experiment. Some people think his mum booked the tour, and jokes have been cracked that maybe his parents are tied up in a basement in L.A. while he\u2019s swanned off with their credit card,\u201d she said. \u201cI still can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s genius or insanity \u2014 but it\u2019s probably a bit of both.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Latin American Democracy Withstand the Populist Assault? ", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe region\u2019s democratic systems have been tested by many authoritarian rulers throughout history. But lines of defense against its challengers often do their job. Mr. Corrales is a specialist in authoritarianism and populism in Latin America.AMHERST, Mass. \u2014 It is common to think of Latin America as the land of no hope for democracy. Since independence, the region has been ravaged by authoritarianism and populism. Brazil\u2019s new president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, an ex-military macho promising zero tolerance of everything he dislikes, evokes a \u201chere we go again\u201d feeling. Once again, illiberalism seems ascendant, to the detriment of democracy.But an alternative narrative is that Latin America is actually the land of democratic resilience. Always under attack, democracy does not always prevail, but it does not always die.In their efforts to stay alive in an inhospitable environment, Latin American democrats have produced survival tactics and innovations. Frequently, these creations have allowed democracy to triumph.Democracy has survived instead because Latin American societies have learned to bolster the line of defense against democracy\u2019s internal enemies. They\u2019ve done it through institutional innovation.First, Latin Americans have focused on institutions that regulate entry and exit mechanisms. At the entry level, the most important innovation has been the runoff rule.Another key lesson from Latin America is the importance of enhancing the autonomy of courts and social movements \u2014 important checks on illiberal presidents. Courts have the legal power to stop illiberal measures, and social movements can block them via resistance.Finally, some Latin American countries have taken to heart the very liberal principle that in a democracy, the winner shouldn\u2019t win that much, and the loser shouldn\u2019t lose that much. The most obvious example involves gender.None of these lines of defense against illiberalism is foolproof. Runoff elections fail to deliver moderation if extremist candidates do well in the first round, as happened in Brazil. And crime and corruption remain Latin America\u2019s foremost pollution, always choking democratic institutions and fueling demand for hard-liners like Mr. Bolsonaro.Mr. Bolsonaro is likely to exploit these vulnerabilities. Brazilian democrats should not relax \u2014 they will need to reinforce their lines of defense and invent new ones.Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College, is author of \u201cFixing Democracy: Why Constitutional Change Often Fails to Enhance Democracy in Latin America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Battle Against Ebola in Congo Pits Medical Hope Against Local Chaos", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthA vaccine and new treatments are on hand, but the outbreak is in an area rife with unpredictable gunfire, bandits and suspicion of outsiders.\u201cYes, it\u2019s stressful,\u201d said Anthony Bonhommeau, director of operational development for ALIMA, the Alliance for International Medical Action. \u201cYou work in an Ebola unit all day, then you go back to the hotel and hear gunfire at night. We make it possible for our people to see psychologists and to get a break after three weeks.\u201dThe violence has also cut short the work of veteran doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many of whom have extensive experience in Ebola epidemics. Two months ago, the State Department ordered all American government employees out of the region and confined them to the capital, Kinshasa, nearly 1,000 miles away. Privately, some of them have grumbled that this renders them ineffective and that the State Department suffers from what one termed \u201cPost-Benghazi Stress Syndrome,\u201d a reference to the 2012 Libya attack that killed an American ambassador and became a crisis for Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time.Thus far, no armed group has overtly targeted medical workers, but the risk of being caught in a cross fire is ever-present, even in cities. In more remote areas, workers risk being kidnapped and held for ransom.The traumatized population is a mix of local residents, 4 million internally displaced people and 500,000 refugees from other countries. They speak many languages and often distrust outsiders \u2014 including the national government and its army and police.Some residents refuse to believe that Ebola exists or dismiss it as a foreign plot to test new medicines on Africans. Many simply see it as a lesser threat than the constant ones: malaria, cholera, hunger and violence.To get people to cooperate even with fundamental epidemic-control measures like contact-tracing and vaccination, the medical teams have been offering food, mosquito nets or other goods, which are themselves hard to move over dirt roads and broken bridges.Mai Mai may be farmers by day and fighters by night, \u201cso when we go into a village to reach the population, we know the fighters may be there too,\u201d said Dr. Axelle Ronsse, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.On Nov. 16, what was believed to be an A.D.F. revenge attack hit the peacekeepers\u2019 compound in Beni, which sits between the Ebola emergency operations center and the Hotel Okapi, where U.N. staff, including World Health Organization doctors, reside. One mortar or rocket landed in the hotel grounds but did not explode.Americans were ordered out well before the recent major violence. In August, a convoy carrying doctors from the C.D.C. almost drove into a crossfire while on its way from the operations center to a peacekeepers\u2019 base near the airport.In a Nov. 14 background briefing, officials from five government agencies defended the evacuation, saying their highest priority is keeping American personnel safe.Hundreds of staff from the Congolese health ministry, the W.H.O. and medical charities like ALIMA and Doctors Without Borders are still in the area; a few Americans, working as private citizens, are among them.Each organization has its own curfew and travel limits. Some venture into the countryside only when escorted by the Congolese army or by U.N. peacekeepers.Others, like Doctors Without Borders, go without them, both because they don\u2019t like the image of medical care delivered at gunpoint and because the escorts themselves may draw fire, Dr. Ronsse said.Travel restrictions exacerbate another problem: transmission chains are going untraced. Ebola treatment units are seeing many patients with no connections to earlier cases and unusual numbers of babies and children.Doctors believe many of the sick are getting infected in private clinics or those run by herbal healers or faith healers. Patients seeking treatment for malaria, typhoid or even toothache end up lying next to an Ebola victim or getting an injection with a syringe previously used on one.And the settings where they got infected keep no records, so their contacts cannot be followed.Because of local distrust, people with Ebola often reach treatment units only when near death, too late for any treatment to save them. Nonetheless, virtually all get one of four experimental regimens. More than 36,000 health workers and contacts have been vaccinated. Distributing food has helped draw people in for tracing and vaccination, but that causes its own problems, one expert said: nearby villages that don\u2019t get food may be resentful, and the World Food Program cannot deliver more than once a week, while contact tracing normally requires daily visits.Local people can be hired to make daily checks, but it is hard to monitor by cellphone that they are doing it correctly. \u201cWe have to find a way to reach the population in areas we can\u2019t go,\u201d Dr. Ronsse said.Advertisement"}

Or, at least, cover him far less? He thrives on the attention. Withhold your coverage and starve him of oxygen.Liberals, frustrated by Trump and his dominance of the news cycle, often make this case to me.Why don\u2019t we in the media focus on other things, important policy issues, rather than on the last intemperate thing that Trump said or did?I understand the frustration, but I also know that what people are asking is, on the one hand, impossible and on the other hand, particularly in print, already happening, but not necessarily being elevated.There is no way for the media \u2014 define media however you will \u2014 to simply ignore a sitting president of the United States. That would not only be a dereliction of duty, it would also be folly.As for the policy machinations, those stories are often covered, but they are rarely splashy news because by their very nature they are technical and bureaucratic.There is always room for the news media to do better, to tweak and adjust its allocation of resources, its areas of coverage and its promotion of stories.But there is another side to the news equation: not those who deliver the news but those who consume it. The other side is you and I as readers, watchers, clickers, listeners, posters, likers and retweeters.On the consumption side, we have also become governed by the gravity of the moment, and are so outraged by the dishonesty, villainy, corruption and divisiveness that we appear to be attracted, to a large degree, to that which underscores and feeds our fury.But I also think that steadfast determination to resist and rebuke the improprieties of this administration doesn\u2019t mean that our lives have to be dominated by stress and negativity. That to me seems self-immolating.As was the case in late 2016, Trump is a more frequent topic of conversation for liberal Democrats than for other Democrats or among Republicans. Currently, 42 percent of liberal Democrats say Trump\u2019s presidency comes up in conversations very often; that is double the share of conservatives and moderates who say this.This column, ironically, only adds to this Trump-focused dialogue and illustrates the issue, but I digress.The same survey found that 63 percent of liberals say talking politics with people they disagree with is \u201cstressful and frustrating,\u201d compared with 51 percent of conservatives and moderates.Trump is dominating liberal discussion in a way that I think could be damaging to us in the long term.When you obsess about a problem, you have less energy and passion to pursue solutions. When you fret over every outrage, you elevate those outrages. Stories trend because consumers engage with them, clicking and sharing them, not because the news media dictates that they trend.I think it would be a solid and beneficial step for us all to simply come to the realizations: Trump is going to Trump. He\u2019s going to lie. He\u2019s going to wink at the racists and Nazis. He\u2019s going to demean women. He\u2019s going to embarrass this country. It\u2019s all going to happen.Nevertheless, we can take this stand unequivocally: It is all unacceptable and we stand in opposition to it. It is not normal and must never be met as such.But we must also focus on the future.There is an exciting new class of left-leaning legislators joining Congress who bring with them fresh blood and fresh ideas. Democrats will control the House, all of its committees and its legislative calendar.The underlying shifts in the electorate suggest President Trump may have to walk a precarious path to re-election in 2020, as several Midwestern states he won in 2016 threaten to slip away, and once-red states in the Southwest turn a purpler hue. The president\u2019s strategy of sowing racial division and stoking alarm about immigration failed to lift his party, and Democratic messaging about health care undercut the benefit Republicans hoped to gain from a strong economy.The 2020 presidential election promises a veritable smorgasbord of options on the left.Lastly, Robert Mueller is still on the job.Trumpism is a disease, and cursing it won\u2019t cure it. It has to be overwhelmed, and that can be done as the left began to do it this month: With diligence, policy-focused messaging, increased engagement and participation, and demand for decency.There is no easy way out of the Trump era, but there is a way forward, and it is not through hopeless pessimism.Remember that you can be thoroughly anti-Trump without being completely Trump-obsessed.Trump not only wants to control media coverage, he wants to control your attention. If he can\u2019t have your adoration, he\u2019ll settle for your anger. Either way, you are emotionally engaged with the egotist.Trump wants to grab you by the passion. Don\u2019t let him.Advertisement"}

In their place are more partisan products and aggregators, more niche publications, greater availability of unfiltered (and often inaccurate) news through social platforms \u2014 and more readers and viewers in more places than most of us could have imagined a generation ago.For foreign affairs, the networked world has also meant proliferation. There\u2019s an equalization that\u2019s happened across the nodes and cables, whereby power can be wielded by far more than \u201csuperpowers.\u201d Ideologies, motivations and methods of mayhem have multiplied.In many ways, it used to be simpler. During the Cold War, the world was mostly divided into two camps with ideologies and spheres of influence that were well known. Now, it can be hard to know where the biggest threats or opportunities come from or which ones deserve the most attention.For many people, all of this creates a sense of dislocation and anxiety. Even within national borders, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really shaping daily life as the world feels progressively harder to understand.At The New York Times, of course, we believe that part of our job is to help with that \u2014 for readers in Australia and everywhere. But we also rely on political leaders to frame goals and strategies for dealing with the forces that affect us all.This week, I got a taste of how Australia\u2019s leaders are managing.Both Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, and Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, gave speeches in Sydney on foreign policy.

I\u2019d hoped to hear a sophisticated argument and maybe a vision for what the world could learn from Australia, and what Australia could learn from the world.Instead, I heard status quo thinking and caution.Mr. Morrison, speaking at an Asia Society gathering hosted by Bloomberg, focused more on the benefits of trade and expanded military spending. He started out trying to emphasize values: \u201cWe are more than the sum of our deals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are better than that.\u201dThen he proceeded to talk mostly in transactional terms. The word \u201ctechnology\u201d did not appear once in his prepared remarks.\u201cForeign policy speeches tend to be cautious, as they are directed towards multiple audiences,\u201d said Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute. \u201cAustralian foreign policy speeches are doubly so, as our external conditions have conditioned our foreign policy in the direction of pragmatism.\u201dBut I still find myself left with a question: Do today\u2019s leaders, in Australia and elsewhere, really understand the effects of a networked world enough to grasp the role it\u2019s playing in both their own democracies and in foreign affairs? Are they doing enough deep thinking about this?This week, I saw no signs that they are.Now for our stories of the week, about this part of the world, about technology, and a few other things to smile and think about.______O.K., O.K., let\u2019s start with a little fun.A few other highlights:______Nellie Bowles, one of our most talented tech reporters (who will be in Australia next month for some reporting and writing), published three stories this week that look at how those who have built our digital world are now eagerly protecting their children from it.They were all among the week\u2019s most read stories among New York Times readers worldwide. You\u2019ll want to digest at least one:This week also featured a few stories about animals that will make you smile. Because, why not?If only we could say the same for politics.______Finally, a bit of commentary for you:RN will provide a unique Australian context for this series with its specialist presenters: \u201cScience Friction\u201d host Natasha Mitchell about the brain science of radicalization, and \u201cReligion & Ethics\u201d host Andrew West on the politics and religion of Islam in Australia, with Samina Yasmin, director of the Centre for Muslim States and Societies.The next episode can be heard on the radio on Saturday at 4 p.m.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Furor, Literary Group Withdraws Honor for \u2018Central Park Five\u2019 Prosecutor", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust two days after it came under fire for announcing an award for a novelist and former New York City prosecutor who oversaw the prosecution of the Central Park Five \u2014 teenage boys wrongly convicted of rape in 1989 \u2014 the organization behind the award withdrew it.Mystery Writers of America, which promotes mystery and detective fiction and presents the annual Edgar Awards, said Thursday that it would no longer honor Linda Fairstein, a best-selling crime author, with one of its \u201cGrand Master\u201d awards for literary achievement.The New York-based organization said in a statement that its board \u201cwas unaware\u201d of Ms. Fairstein\u2019s role in the infamous Central Park Five case until members raised concerns.\u201cAfter profound reflection, the Board has decided that M.W.A. cannot move forward with an award that lacks the support of such a large percentage of our members,\u201d the group said.The furor began on Tuesday when Mystery Writers of America announced that Ms. Fairstein would be one of two writers honored as Grand Masters at the organization\u2019s awards banquet next spring in New York. Ms. Fairstein is the author of 20 novels about a fictional Manhattan prosecutor, Alexandra Cooper, modeled on her own real-life past work as the chief of the sex-crimes unit of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.In June, the city released thousands of pages of internal law enforcement documents from the original Central Park Five investigation \u2014 some never previously made public \u2014 that reinforced the decision in 2002, based on DNA evidence, to overturn the convictions for all five defendants, who had confessed to the crime. In July, Ms. Fairstein wrote an op-ed in the New York Law Journal defending the prosecution. \u201cThe confessions were not coerced,\u201d she wrote.Another writer and Edgar Award winner, Attica Locke, in a series of tweets on Tuesday, urged the organization to honor someone else. \u201cShe is almost single-handedly responsible for the wrongful incarceration of the Central Park Five,\u201d wrote Ms. Locke, who also worked on filmmaker Ava DuVernay\u2019s upcoming Netflix docudrama on the case.Ms. Locke wrote that Ms. Fairstein \u201cnever apologized or recanted her insistence\u201d on the boys\u2019 guilt despite their subsequent exonerations. \u201cJust because she has a flourishing publishing career does not mean we should ignore her past \u2014 or her continued unwillingness to accept responsibility for ruining five innocent men\u2019s lives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI cannot support this decision.\u201dMs. Fairstein fired back at Ms. Locke on Twitter, defending her office\u2019s handling of the prosecution while also minimizing her own role in it. \u201cI was neither the prosecutor nor investigator in the case you mention,\u201d Ms. Fairstein wrote. \u201cI was certainly NOT the person who \u2018single-handedly spearheaded\u2019 the investigation,\u201d Ms. Fairstein wrote.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I have a civilized conversation, so I can refresh you with the facts?\u201d She wrote. \u201cThank you.\u201dOn Thursday, after Mystery Writers of America made its announcement, she thanked the organization for listening to her concerns.Ms. Fairstein, in a statement posted to Facebook on Thursday, she said she was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d with the group\u2019s decision and remained \u201cenormously proud\u201d of her work with the sex-crimes unit.\u201cI thank M.W.A. for the initial honor and for the joy it inspired, which can never be revoked, and I am happy to enthusiastically support the new Grand Master,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Fairstein could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, and a representative responded to a request for an interview on Thursday to the Facebook post.On Facebook, novelist Andrew Gross defended Ms. Fairstein on Wednesday as a worthy Edgar Award recipient: \u201cFor a person who has devoted her career to real-world situations that have advanced women\u2019s rights to be attacked and demonized by people whose toughest real-world decisions are how to define a gerund or what book to review is a sign that the inmates are truly running the asylum.\u201dIn an interview on Wednesday, Kellye Garrett, a novelist, said Mystery Writers of America should rescind the award if Ms. Fairstein did not volunteer to give it up. Ms. Garrett praised the organization but said its leaders should explain how they came to choose Ms. Fairstein in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret, her connection to the Central Park Five,\u201d she said.\u201cThey have work to do,\u201d Ms. Garrett said, \u201cespecially when it comes to inclusivity and embracing writers from marginalized communities.\u201dAt an anxious moment in the city\u2019s history, with violent crime near its peak, police in 1989 arrested five boys, all black and Hispanic and ages 14 to 16, for the rape and near-fatal beating of Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old white woman who was attacked as she jogged through Central Park after work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Long as Trump Is President, Blue Texas Could Actually Happen", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat was once a Democratic pipe dream is now a real possibility. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In some respects, Trump\u2019s problems in Texas are similar to the difficulties he faces nationally: college educated white women moving decisively to the left and the continued erosion of Republican support in fast-growing metropolitan counties.The biggest warning signal for Trump in once bright red Texas is the clear disenchantment with hard-right conservatives that a segment of Republican voters feel. These are the conservatives most closely tied to Trump in both substance and style. If Texas were to become a battleground state in 2020, the national political consequences would be hard to overestimate. Not only are its 38 Electoral College votes second in number only to California\u2019s 55, but for a Democratic presidential candidate, winning Texas would, in effect, neutralize such adverse developments as, say, combined losses in Ohio and Michigan or Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.In late October, Julie McCarty, the president of the NE Tarrant County Tea Party and a major power broker in North Texas, expressed confidence over the coming election.On Nov. 7, the day after the election, McCarty changed her tune. According to the Tribune, she wrote to her loyalists on the Tea Party mailing list:\u201cWe are rapidly becoming outnumbered. I don\u2019t know what tomorrow holds, but I don\u2019t like the pattern.\u201dIn Tarrant County, not only did Beto O\u2019Rourke beat Ted Cruz, a darling of the Tea Party movement, by a slim margin (312,477 to 308,608) but right-wing, down-ballot candidates were swept out of office.For example, Konni Burton, a state senator and a former vice president of the Tarrant Tea Party, lost to Beverly Powell, who had the backing of virtually every liberal advocacy group in the state. Matt Rinaldi, a state representative in neighboring Dallas County and a founder of the Texas Freedom Caucus, lost to Julie Johnson, who was endorsed by the LGBTQ Victory Fund and Planned Parenthood, while carrying a rating of zero from the N.R.A.Even more telling for 2020, voters showed a clear preference for more moderate Republicans running statewide than for red meat, Trump-style Republicans.Donald Trump made the most polarizing and dogmatic conservatives in Texas much more vulnerable, with a significant number of regular Republican voters strongly associating these candidates with Trump, and as a result either voting for their Democratic rival, not voting in that race, or casting a protest vote for the Libertarian.Less polarizing and less dogmatic conservative Republicans \u2014 Governor Greg Abbott, Glenn Hegar, the comptroller and George P. Bush, the land commissioner \u2014 won by margins (on average, 11.9 percent), that, according to Jones, \u201cdouble or triple that of the more polarizing and dogmatic conservative Republicans.\u201d Those farther to the extreme right \u2014 the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, the attorney general, Ken Paxton and Sid Miller, the agricultural commissioner, won by an average of 4.9 percent.Jones has strong views on the Trump effect in Texas: \u201cDonald Trump is without a question a major liability for Texas Republicans.\u201dTrump, according to Jones, repelskey GOP constituencies such as college educated Anglo women and Anglo millennials and post-millennials, while simultaneously providing Democrats with a banner around which to mobilize turnout, especially among Latinos and younger voters.What about the big question: is Texas becoming Democratic? Jones\u2019s answer:It is premature to say that Texas is turning blue, but whereas four years ago its hue was dark red, today it is light pink. As long as President Trump is in the White House, Republicans in Texas can look forward to much tougher battles from higher quality and better funded Democratic challengers than they faced prior to 2018, as well as being required to do something that most Republican candidates have not had to do for years in Texas; actually work up a sweat in the fall.Stein uses graphics compiled by The Texas Tribune to make his point. In each major county, partisan voting patterns show Republicans on a steady downward path.Republicans\u2019 margins of victory (and defeat) in three regions, in percentage points. The 2000-16 margins are for presidential and governor\u2019s races; 2018 margins are for the United States Senate race.Dallas-Fort Worth regionTARRANT COUNTY(INCLUDES FORT WORTH)COLLIN COUNTY(DALLAS SUBURBS)+50+40+30+20+10+6.20\u20130.6\u201900\u201904\u201908\u201912\u201916\u201918\u201900\u201904\u201908\u201912\u201916\u201918Austin regionHAYS COUNTY(AUSTIN SUBURBS)WILLIAMSON COUNTY(AUSTIN SUBURBS)+40+30+20+100\u20132.8\u201310\u201315.3\u201900\u201904\u201908\u201912\u201916\u201918\u201900\u201904\u201908\u201912\u201916\u201918Houston regionHARRIS COUNTY(INCLUDES HOUSTON)FORT BEND COUNTY(HOUSTON SUBURBS)+20+100\u201310\u201312\u201316.5\u201900\u201904\u201908\u201912\u201916\u201918\u201900\u201904\u201908\u201912\u201916\u201918Dallas-Fort Worth regionTARRANT COUNTY (INCLUDES FORT WORTH)COLLIN COUNTY (DALLAS SUBURBS)+50+40+30+20+10+6.20\u20130.6\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918Austin regionHAYS COUNTY (AUSTIN SUBURBS)WILLIAMSON COUNTY (AUSTIN SUBURBS)+40+30+20+100\u20132.8\u201310\u201315.3\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918Houston regionHARRIS COUNTY (INCLUDES HOUSTON)FORT BEND COUNTY (HOUSTON SUBURBS)+20+100\u201310\u201312\u201316.5\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918The New York Times | Analysis of Texas Secretary of State data and charts by Darla Cameron, Chris Essig and Alexa Ura/The Texas Tribunethe metro v. rest-of-state gap widened hugely in Texas, with the big cities going overwhelmingly Democratic while suburban counties outside Austin, Houston, and Dallas/Ft Worth moved toward the Democrats. But non-metro counties stayed very Republican with very high turnout, enabling Cruz to eke out a narrow win.That trend is likely to continue, Murray argued in an email:We had 8.3 million voters in 2018 (up from just 4.7 million in 2014). That should go over 10 million in 2020, giving statewide Democrats a good chance of carrying the state for president and winning the U.S. senate seat.Not only will Democrats be competitive in 2020 but the party has, in Murray\u2019s view, \u201ca 50 percent-plus chance of taking the Texas House of Representatives, with major implications for the 2021 redistricting process.\u201dTexas continues to change demographically, and, over time, the shifts should work to the advantage of Democrats.Over the same period, the black population grew modestly, from 12.0 to 12.7 percent; Asian-Americans from 3.1 to 5.0 percent and, most important, Hispanics, whose support Democrats are banking on, grew from 32.0 to 39.4 percent.Statewide, O\u2019Rourke lost to Cruz by 219,427 votes, or 2.6 percent out of 8.3 million votes cast.The migration of Texas\u2019s big urban counties from red and purple to blue means Texas is a two party state for the first time in almost 30 years. Demographic changes, tremendous energy from voters, and a surge of resources will keep Texas competitive for decades.Trump, Rottinghaus argued,was a net negative, driving a wedge between college educated, women, and independent voters. As long as Trump is on the ballot in fact or in spirit, Texas will be a competitive two party state.In the Nov. 7 Observer, Hooks wrote:Something happened this year that has not happened before \u2014 Republican-leaning voters studied specific down-ballot races and broke ranks. That\u2019s a terrible omen for Republicans, who spent the month before the election begging voters to vote straight-ticket R. Once voters get in the habit of splitting their ballot, they\u2019re more likely to do so in the future.Hooks reported a conversation he had with O\u2019Rourke last July in \u201ca crummy hotel bar\u201d in Lubbock, Tex. when O\u2019Rourke talked not only about winning, but alsoabout the effect he hoped his race would have on the people around him. He would go to places Democrats don\u2019t go, engage people in a politics that was collaborative, spontaneous and felt good, and hope that it gave them tools and encouragement to keep going after he was done. The success of that project was dependent on O\u2019Rourke doing well enough, and proving the haters wrong. He did. Only time will tell what the race left behind. But according to his own terms \u2014 and let\u2019s use a damn cuss here, in tribute to the man \u2014 it looks like he knocked it out of the \u2026 park.In the Atlantic, Hooks cautioned that it was too early in the process of partisan transition to suggest that Texas is on the verge of turning blue, but that the Nov. 6 results \u201cjust might be the beginning of the end\u201d of Republican dominance.Hooks compared O\u2019Rourke\u2019s losing bid to that of John Tower \u2014 one of the first Republicans to break the pre-1965 Democratic stranglehold on Texas \u2014 who lost in his first attempt to win a Texas Senate seat in 1960 but went on to win in a 1961 special election.Tower\u2019s victory demonstrated to Texas Republicans that their ambitions were not hopeless, \u201cthat the party could bide its time, be smart, and pick off races when it could,\u201d Hooks wrote. \u201cThat might just be \u2014 with a very strong emphasis on might \u2014 what happened to Texas Democrats in 2018.\u201dDespite his caution, Hooks appeared to be convinced that the 2018 election marked a turning point:Something very strange happened here this year. Like Tower\u2019s bid, the full payoff may not come for many years. But the state party now has what the Republican Party then needed more than anything else: A reason to start building in earnest. That\u2019s not much, doubtless. But it just might be enough.He acknowledged that he split his ticket \u201cmore than I ever have before\u201d and cited theinfectious enthusiasm (in the O\u2019Rourke campaign) which was brighter than what a lot of his opponents were offering.Trump, who campaigned extensively for Cruz, demonstrated \u201cborderline racism\u201d at times, Straus said. Some of Trump\u2019s \u201crhetoric is extremely divisive\u201d and It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s not unifying. It\u2019s not factual in many cases, and I think that\u2019s the wrong direction for the leader of any party.For her part, Julie McCarty, the Tea Party stalwart in North Texas, remains firm in her commitment. She wrote her supporters:I am called to fight for freedom and righteousness, and that is all I know to do. We continue to educate and push back as long as we have the chance \u2026 and we do still have the chance because even though we had some squeakers and some tough losses, TEXAS IS STILL A RED STATE.Straus was more considered in his assessment of Texas politics: \u201cThe Republican Party and the state of Texas are moving in opposite directions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Is Worth as Much as Apple. How Did That Happen?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.So what happened?There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201dIt is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Juul Suspends Selling Most E-Cigarette Flavors in Stores", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Facing mounting government pressure and a public backlash over an epidemic of teenage vaping, Juul Labs announced on Tuesday that it would suspend sales of most of its flavored e-cigarette pods in retail stores and would discontinue its social media promotions.The decision by the San Francisco-based company, which has more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market share in the United States, is the most significant sign of retrenchment by an industry that set out to offer devices to help smokers quit but now shoulders blame for a new public health problem: nicotine addiction among nonsmoking teens.Juul\u2019s announcement effectively undercut the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s plan to unveil a series of measures aimed at curbing teenage vaping. The agency is expected later this week to announce a ban on sales of flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations and strengthen the requirements for age verification of online sales of e-cigarettes.To prevent some users from reverting to menthol cigarettes, Juul said it would keep mint, tobacco and menthol flavors for its devices in retail stores.In recent months, the F.D.A. has mounted an increasingly aggressive campaign against the major manufacturers of vaping products that appeal to young people, focusing particularly on Juul. The company\u2019s sleek device (nicknamed the iPhone of e-cigarettes) resembles a flash drive and comes with flavor pods like cr\u00e8me and mango, leading public health officials to criticize the company and others for appearing to market directly to teenagers, who are especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction.E-cigarettes were originally developed to help smokers quit by giving them a way to satisfy their nicotine cravings without the tar and deadly carcinogens that come with burning tobacco.\u201cOur intent was never to have youth use Juul,\u201d said Kevin Burns, chief executive of Juul Labs in a statement emailed to reporters. \u201cBut intent is not enough. The numbers are what matter and the numbers tell us underage use of e-cigarettes is a problem.\u201dBut critics and public health advocates said the company had no choice, especially after the F.D.A. seized documents related to marketing strategies from the company\u2019s headquarters last month, and while some states were investigating whether its tactics were directly aimed at minors.Caroline Renzulli, a spokeswoman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called Juul\u2019s announcement too little too late. \u201cJuul\u2019s social media marketing fueled its popularity with kids,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that it has captured 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, Juul no longer needs to do social media marketing because its young customers are doing it for them.\u201dMaura Healey, the attorney general for Massachusetts, echoed that sentiment. \u201cUnfortunately, much of the damage has already been done,\u201d she said. \u201cOur investigation into Juul\u2019s practices, including if it was knowingly selling and marketing its products to young people, will continue.\u201dMore than three million middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes, according to preliminary, unpublished government data, with about one-third of them saying the flavors were a big factor in their choice.Mr. Burns, the Juul executive, said that as of Tuesday, the company would stop accepting retail orders for mango, fruit, cr\u00e8me and cucumber Juul pods. Those account for about 45 percent of retail sales for the $16 billion company, according to some estimates.Lower in the announcement, the company said it would renew sales of those products at retail outlets that invested in age-verification technology. A timetable for resuming those sales was not announced.Juul also said it would improve its online age-verification system to ensure buyers are 21 or older. By the end of the year, Mr. Burns said, Juul will add a real-time photo requirement to match a buyer\u2019s face against an uploaded government-issued ID. The company will also try to prevent bulk shipments to people who are distributing to minors, by restricting customers to two devices and 15 pod packages per month, and no more than 10 devices per year.In addition, Juul said it would shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts in the United States that promoted use of the flavored pods. According to its release, the company said it would ask the major social media companies, including Twitter and Snapchat, to help them \u201cpolice\u201d posts that promote the use of e-cigarettes or cigarettes by underage users.Dr. Gottlieb said earlier that officials had met with several e-cigarette and tobacco companies to discuss ways to reduce youth vaping after threatening to take e-cigarettes off the market if the companies could not curb teenage sales.R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, also submitted plans to the F.D.A. on Friday that backed the higher age limit.Michael Shannon, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, said it also agreed not to market products through social media influencers and would also require age-verification for access to the website where it sells the e-cigarette Vuse.The tobacco company stopped short of promising to take Vuse, which comes in berry and other flavors, out of retail stores, but Mr. Shannon said the company would enforce contractual penalties for retailers that sell tobacco products to youths. In addition, it plans to start a mystery shopping program to check compliance.On Tuesday, CNBC reported that Fontem Ventures, a unit of Imperial Tobacco Group, would raise the minimum age to buy pods on its website to 21. The company sells blu e-cigarettes, which come in various fruity flavors.Since it came on the market in 2015, Juul has become all but irresistible to teenagers, who had been drilled since preschool days on the perils of cigarette smoking. The name itself sounded like a mash-up of \u201cjewel\u201d and \u201ccool.\u201dUnlike the clunky older vapes, the compact device could readily evade detection from parents and teachers. It not only looked like a flash drive, it could be recharged in a computer\u2019s USB port. The flavors were both alluring and sophisticated. And it offered a way for teenagers to rebel and appear hip, seemingly without causing cancer.Schools around the country were caught unaware. The aerosol mist from Juul is nearly odorless and dissipates within seconds. Students began juuling as teachers\u2019 backs were turned. They filled school bathrooms for juuling breaks. And for all that school officials knew, students were just diligently recharging flash drives on laptops.Within 18 months of Juul\u2019s release, school officials began confiscating them and providing information sessions to parents. They had two paramount concerns: the increasing use of Juul and other vapes for marijuana and the amount of nicotine in Juul\u2019s pods. Nicotine, the naturally occurring chemical in tobacco, is the addictive element that binds smokers to cigarettes and vapers to Juul and other e-cigarettes. Teenagers, whose brains are still developing, need less exposure to nicotine than adults in order to become addicted.But perhaps most worrisome was a conclusion reached by the National Academies: that teenagers who use the devices may be at higher risk for cigarette smoking.In its announcement on Tuesday, Juul emphasized its product\u2019s use among adults as an alternative to cigarette smoking and said it would continue to post testimonials on YouTube of adults who had switched to Juul from traditional cigarettes.Later this week, the F.D.A. is expected to propose a ban on sales of flavored e-cigarettes, with a few exceptions; a pursuit of a ban on menthol cigarettes, which could take years to go into effect; and stricter controls of online sales to prohibit minors from accessing the products.Advertisement"}

With country music, line dancing, cowboy boots and American flags, it was a place where college students and recent graduates came together with those who left high school planning to join the military or law enforcement. The Borderline was so beloved that its regular customers wanted to work there, earning money to help pay for first cars or college tuition.This was the crowd that filled the Borderline on Nov. 7, when a gunman opened fire, killing 12 people.Many of those who died were young, in their 20s. There was a college freshman and a graduate who had received his degree in May. There was the bar\u2019s sunny cashier. And two friends who loved souping up old trucks for off-roading.Among the others were a longtime sheriff\u2019s deputy who had rushed into the crowded bar to help and a 22-year-old patron whose friends said he had tried to help others escape, yelling, \u201cEveryone, run!\u201dIf a thread binds the victims, it may have been their commitment to service. Several were active volunteers. One of the victims was a veteran, a 33-year-old who worked for an organization that helps veterans in their transitions to civilian life.Three women and nine men were killed. The youngest victim was 18; the oldest was 54.These are their stories.Mr. Adler\u2019s death was confirmed by his sister. Chris Curtis, an owner of Rivalry Roasters, said Mr. Adler had children and had been working at the bar to help pay the bills.Danny Evans, one of Mr. Adler\u2019s childhood best friends, said that although he had not spoken to Mr. Adler recently, he recalled that in high school, his friend \u201cwas the guy we all wanted to be: handsome, athletic and kind.\u201d\u201cWhen we were younger, I was an awkward kid,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cI got picked on.\u201d\u201cAnd Sean was my protector,\u201d he continued, choking back tears. \u201cHe stood up for me, and he showed me the kind of kindnesses I didn\u2019t get from other people. I needed that so badly at that time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so proud to have been his friend,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating that he\u2019s gone.\u201dMr. Dingman\u2019s younger brother, Aidan, posted a photo of the two of them on Instagram, and described rushing to the bar with his parents when they got word of the shooting.\u201cWe tried for hours and hours to get in touch with Blake and got no response,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt 12:00 this morning I was informed that my amazing brother was taken down by the shooter as well as his good friend Jake Dunham.

He liked spending time with his younger siblings and often went fishing with his father.\u201cI talked to him last night before he headed out the door,\u201d Jason Coffman said in the interview outside the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, where families had gathered to await information. \u201cFirst thing I said was, \u2018Please don\u2019t drink and drive.\u2019 The last thing I said was, \u2018Son, I love you.\u2019\u201dMembers of the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office said the death toll might have been higher if not for Sgt. Ronald Helus. As the shooting unfolded, Sergeant Helus ran inside.\u201cHe went in to save lives, to save other people,\u201d Sheriff Geoff Dean said. Before entering the bar, the sheriff said, Sergeant Helus had a conversation with his wife on the phone.Sgt.

We are heartbroken to learn of Mark\u2019s death.\u201dThe broad smile of Kristina Morisette, 20, was the first thing customers saw when they entered the Borderline. She worked as a cashier, near the door.\u201cHer sweet voice was so welcoming, and that was something Borderline customers loved,\u201d said Hannah Williams, 20, a regular at the country-themed bar and a friend of Ms. Morisette\u2019s since elementary school. \u201cPeople would always tell her it made their day to see her at the front desk. She would receive little gifts from customers.\u201dShe loved to draw and to cook, often preparing meals for friends. \u201cShe was the mom of the group,\u201d Ms. Williams said.Ms. Morisette was a passionate fan of country music and dancing, but she didn\u2019t plan on working at the Borderline forever. Shortly before she was killed, she had returned from a trip to Texas, where she had interviewed for an internship working to train police dogs. She admired law enforcement and the military, and loved to buy anything \u2014 hats, trinkets \u2014 adorned with the American flag.\u201cShe loved her country,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cEvery part of it.\u201dWhen a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas last year, Telemachus Orfanos somehow made it through.It was a brutal experience, his friends thought, never to be repeated.They were wrong.\u201cHe was killed last night at Borderline,\u201d Susan Orfanos, the mother of the 27-year-old, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe made it though Las Vegas, he came home. And he didn\u2019t come home last night, and the two words I want you to write are: gun control. Right now \u2014 so that no one else goes through this. Can you do that? Can you do that for me? Gun control.\u201dMs. Orfanos then hung up the phone.Noel Sparks had her hands in a little bit of everything at the church she grew up in with her family.She was an all-around creative, said Nancy Moravec, the former director of Christian life at the United Methodist Church of Westlake Village, where she met Ms. Sparks when she was a child.Over the years, Ms. Moravec said, she watched as Ms. Sparks got involved in just about every aspect of the church, from its youth program to the church camps she would later return to as a counselor. She sang in the choir, played the cello, made pottery and danced.\u201cShe was a beautiful dancer,\u201d Ms. Moravec recalled.The Rev. Walter C. Dilg Jr., the senior pastor of the church, confirmed in a telephone interview that Ms. Sparks died in the shooting. He said he had learned of her death from her parents, who are still members of the church.Ms. Moravec, 74, described Ms. Sparks as \u201cloving, kind and generous.\u201d Ms. Sparks, 21, had been a student at Moorpark College.\u201cIf you had children, you wanted Noel to be one of their friends,\u201d she said.Thomas Fuller, Julie Turkewitz, Matt Stevens, Jacey Fortin and Andrew R.

{"Headline": "Louisville and Muhammad Ali: A Rare Look at a Hometown Champ", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensA new book shows the unmatched trust and connection photographers at The Louisville Courier Journal had with their city\u2019s most famous son: Muhammad Ali.Muhammad Ali sat snoozing in a chair in his Los Angeles home after having fallen asleep watching television with a gaggle of children on the floor beside him.The image on the screen: Howard Cosell. Was Ali posing to punk his longtime foil? Another playful mug for the camera in a career full of them?\u201cNo, he was really sleeping,\u201d said Keith Williams, the Louisville Courier Journal photographer who had been invited that January 1980 afternoon to Ali\u2019s home for a feature on the champion in retirement. \u201cHe had been playing with the kids, and that show \u2018Wide World of Sports\u2019 came on and he fell asleep. When Cosell came on, I knew it was a picture.\u201dIt was not unusual for Mr. Williams or any of the other photographers at The Courier Journal to have such behind-the-scenes access to Ali. A proud son of Louisville, Ky., Ali always made sure, amid the sprawling pack of photographers trailing him, that his hometown newspaper was close.But what makes this collection stand out are its intimacy and simplicity: Ali reading a newspaper on his hotel bed; Ali tickling his young daughters; Ali surprising his mother with a new car; Ali jogging with his wife in the early-morning fog of his training grounds in Deer Lake, Pa. Wherever he went, the Louisville photographers were always close by.\u201cHe trusted them, I think, so he gave special access,\u201d said Pat McDonogh, a senior photographer at the paper whose social media postings of archival photographs spurred the book.C. Thomas Hardin, the paper\u2019s former director of photography and one of the photographers whose work is featured in the book, recalled Ali spotting him at events. \u201cHe would mouth the word \u2018Louisville\u2019 and I would shake my head yes,\u201d Mr. Hardin said.That close connection paid dividends: Mr. Hardin had unfettered access to Ali at his Deer Lake, Pa., training camp while training for his rematch with Leon Spinks in September 1978. One morning, through a window, he noticed Ali praying in his private mosque. He made the picture, quiet and reverent, but dared not enter his sacred space.\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody else went in besides him,\u201d Mr. Hardin said.Mr. Hardin favored seemingly simple moments that contrasted with Ali\u2019s bombastic personality. The picture he most admires captures Ali\u2019s cutman, Luis Sarria, in a close-up embracing Ali\u2019s face as he prepares him for a workout at the training camp. Ali, of course, adored his own looks \u2014 \u201cLook at that face. Twenty-four years of boxing, and I\u2019m still pretty\u201d \u2014 but it is the contrast of Sarria\u2019s weathered, firm hands clasping Ali in an almost tender moment that makes the image stand out.Bill Luster, whose photograph of Ali looking out from the ring during an exhibition match in Louisville in 1976 is on the cover, said he remembered Ali as \u201ca quiet and intense guy\u201d behind the scenes. \u201cHe is viewed as a loudmouth, but I never found him that way,\u201d he said.More like him, Mr. Luster said, were pensive moments even in the gym, sitting in a chair, hand on chin, waiting and listening, as he captured Ali before another exhibition match in Louisville in 1978.Still, Ali loved to play and kid around, in public and in private, and liked to be spontaneous. Mr. Williams remembers driving with Ali to a party in Los Angeles when they noticed a fight beginning on a street corner. Ali stopped the car and hopped out, approaching the gathering stunned to see the champion before them.\u201cYou guys want to fight, you\u2019re going to have to fight me,\u201d Ali told them as he began shadow boxing with all comers, breaking the tension and leaving a bunch of people with a story to tell.Whether it\u2019s of big moments or small, the photographers speak of the privilege of their time with Ali and the pride in adding to the historical record of one of the world\u2019s most famous people ever.But when it comes right down to it, as Mr. Hardin put it, the real pride was this:\u201cHe is our guy. He is Louisville\u2019s guy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Land of Quakes, Engineering a Future for a Church Made of Mud", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "High in the Andes Mountains, conservators are testing traditional methods for strengthening adobe buildings. Supported byThe Seismic Retrofitting Project, an initiative of the Los Angeles-based Getty Conservation Institute, is studying traditional practices for stabilizing structures in areas prone to earthquakes.Through a yearlong series of workshops in Ku\u00f1o Tambo that wrapped up in August, the Getty team worked with members of the Quechua-speaking village to implement low-cost and low-tech repairs that they hope could be standardized to make adobe structures safer and more resilient. If these techniques prove effective and affordable at the Church of Santiago Ap\u00f3stol and a few other sites, this approach could be used to strengthen buildings all over the world.Adobe mud bricks are one of the world\u2019s most commonly used building materials. An estimated 30 percent of the global population \u2014 from Africa to India, and even in parts of Europe \u2014 resides in earthen structures.That doesn\u2019t mean adobe will no longer be used, conservators say, or that existing structures shouldn\u2019t be adapted to make them safer.At Ku\u00f1o Tambo, conservators saw an opportunity to rigorously test traditional seismic retrofits and provide evidence of their effectiveness.If successful, the techniques could be rapidly applied to hundreds of similar buildings in this region alone.\u201cIt\u2019s very well known here in Peru that earthen construction can withstand earthquakes if they are properly built and maintained,\u201d Ms. Cancino said. \u201cBut there was no science behind it, no data.\u201dThat resulted in a plan to outfit the church with 11 new tie beams that span the building\u2019s width, a new collar beam below the roof\u2019s circumference and three L-shaped braces called keys inserted into each corner to tie the walls together, all from regionally sourced eucalyptus wood.Along with refreshed stone foundations, new adobe bricks, three new buttresses and a new A-frame roof, some parts of the church and the bell tower were also wrapped in a nylon-like mesh and then covered with mud plaster for extra support. The mural paintings have also been the subject of their own conservation process; many churches across the region host similar artworks.As the conservation was carried out at the church over the last year, the Getty team also ran a series of intensive training workshops at Ku\u00f1o Tambo to put this knowledge into the hands of the village\u2019s residents, as well as other Peruvian conservators and engineers.Speaking through a translator by telephone, a Ku\u00f1o Tambo resident, Raul C\u00e1rdenas, 57, said his entire village is eager to have the church back; villagers also plan to use restoration tricks from the project to better maintain their own adobe homes. For instance, one technique involves using the gel of a local species of cactus to make mud plaster more water-resistant.And five weddings are already planned to coincide with the bishop\u2019s visit to rededicate the church in early 2019.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mediator Columnist Returns to His Post", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderThe mad alchemists who are brewing our news these days couldn\u2019t have served up a better story for me. I began my career hustling gossip items for Page Six and went on to work at The Times covering media, the White House and money and politics in the post-Citizens United era. The story about Mr. Trump, The Enquirer and alleged hush payments to paramours was essentially a campaign finance story wrapped around a stripper\u2019s pole.And at times, especially during the sloggier weeks when we were hitting the brick walls that are inevitable in investigative reporting, it was painful to be missing all the media action.And I was mighty glad to start back last month. It couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, as the White House was taking its attacks on the press to a new awful place by moving from \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric to more concrete action, taking away the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press credential.In nearly 20 years of covering media off and on, I\u2019ve never seen people \u2014 especially Times readers \u2014 take such an interest in the minutiae of government-press relations. If there\u2019s one upside to the presidential attacks it\u2019s that they\u2019ve also caused at least some Americans to find a new appreciation for journalism. (I guess I\u2019m a glass-half-full kind of guy after all.)But I did emerge from the belly of that beast of the hush-money story with a bit more perspective about the way news works as it moves at the speed of social media in such polarized times.I saw that there was a large audience ready to lap unverified allegations up if they fed their own anger at the president.And, in reporting on The Enquirer\u2019s efforts on behalf of the president, I saw that media can work not just as a force for enlightenment and truth but also as a tool for political cover-ups; for the suppression of news.And I saw that in returning to the column, I\u2019m going to have my work cut out for me.

They were each invited to a large social gathering there by the same mutual friend.At the time, Mr. Groberg, who lived in nearby Bethesda, Md., was receiving treatment for his war injury at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he had undergone more than 30 surgeries over two years. He had not yet been retired by the Army.Ms. Zarin, who was living in Washington, was sitting outside on the patio and dropped her cellphone by accident at precisely the same time as Mr. Groberg walked past her. He picked up the phone and while handing it back thought to himself, \u201cOh man, she\u2019s hot.\u201dMs. Zarin was thinking much the same. \u201cI thought he was very handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI hoped to meet him when we went inside.\u201dAs it turned out, she never got the chance. When Mr. Groberg walked out the door to run an errand, Ms. Zarin thought he had gone home, and she soon departed, more than a bit disappointed.But the next day, Mr. Groberg called, explaining that he had returned, and when he didn\u2019t see her, asked their mutual friend for her number. Two days later, they went on a first date to a French restaurant in Washington.\u201cI found him to be very smart, very gregarious and at the same time, very warm,\u201d Ms. Zarin said.Mr. Groberg liked what he found as well. \u201cShe was beautiful and super sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was also very funny, and we had some great conversations.\u201dThey became an instant item, and were dating for 14 months when Mr. Groberg received a call from Washington telling him that he had been chosen as a Medal of Honor recipient.\u201cIt was a very emotional ceremony,\u201d said Mr. Groberg, who donated his medal to Fort Carson, where it remains on display.The couple were engaged in December 2016, and in 2017, they embarked on a U.S.O. tour to Afghanistan, Iraq, Abu Dhabi, Spain and Poland.Read more.

Ms. Weiland built a fire and cooked Hebrew National hot dogs on a stick, explaining they were her favorite food.\u201cAnd being a girl from Brooklyn, meeting someone with a fondness for Hebrew National, I knew she was someone special,\u201d Ms. Schumer said.The next morning they parked at the top of the caldera and hiked down to the lake.\u201cIt\u2019s stunning, it\u2019s huge, it\u2019s massive,\u201d Ms. Weiland said. \u201cThe water is so, so blue. Alison loves to swim, and she decided we had to go swimming.\u201dThey decided to jump into the lake \u2014 and further into the relationship.\u201cWe thought it would be a summer romance,\u201d said Ms. Weiland, who knew that Ms. Schumer would move back to New York that fall.Read more.

{"Headline": "Senate Latest, Brian Kemp and Alleged \u2018Hack,\u2019 Gun Mailer in Florida: 2 Days to Go", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Tip SheetWelcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.\u2022 Top officials on both sides agree that Republicans are likely to defeat Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who is roughly 10 points down in the polls.\u2022 But every other Senate Democrat is still seen as viable. That itself is rather extraordinary given that Democrats are defending 10 seats in states that President Trump carried.\u2022 A new poll on Saturday showed Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri tied with Josh Hawley, the Republican nominee; she was widely seen throughout October as the most vulnerable incumbent after Ms. Heitkamp. Mr. Trump is set to campaign for Mr. Hawley in Missouri on Monday night, joined by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh.Ms. McCaskill, campaigning Sunday outside a Walmart in Ferguson, Mo., suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies for Mr. Hawley might backfire with voters like the African-American shoppers she was greeting here.\u201cA lot of my constituents at this Walmart, they now identify Josh Hawley as Donald Trump. And that is not a positive thing for most of my constituents here,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, in other parts of the state it may be a very positive thing, so we will have to see how that all comes out in the wash.\u201d\u2022 Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, has a small lead in some public polls even as Republicans claim that their surveys have him trailing.\u2022 If Democrats manage to lose just the Heitkamp seat, they have a (remote) chance of winning the Senate. They would have to win three of these four Republican-held seats: Texas, Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee.What\u2019s less clear is which of the remaining two seats is more viable:So, yes, control of the Senate could be coming down to turnout.The office of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also the Republican nominee for governor, said Sunday that the authorities had opened an inquiry into the Democratic Party of Georgia after \u201ca failed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\u201d Mr. Kemp\u2019s office offered no evidence or details of the episode.Democratic leaders called the inquiry an abuse of power and political stunt by Mr. Kemp, given his dual role overseeing an election in which he is also running for the state\u2019s top job. Democrats said any claims of the party being involved in a hack were false.Mr. Kemp\u2019s office disclosed two days before an election in which polls show Mr. Kemp effectively tied with Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the first black woman elected governor anywhere in the United States. Ms. Abrams said Sunday that the hack inquiry was a desperate move on Mr. Kemp\u2019s part.Although Mr. Kemp\u2019s office raised the specter of wrongdoing by Democrats, word of the inquiry was certain to heighten fears that Mr. Kemp was seeking to tamper with the integrity of the election. Democrats have spent weeks calling on Mr. Kemp to resign his post, arguing that he could not independently oversee an election in which he is running.\u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\u201d Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kemp, said in a statement. \u201cWe can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\u201dRebecca DeHart, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party, said: \u201cThis is yet another example of abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State. To be very clear, Brian Kemp\u2019s scurrilous claims are 100 percent false, and this so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp\u2019s official office released a statement this morning.\u201cThis political stunt from Kemp just days before the election is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor.\u201dMr. Kemp\u2019s office said the F.B.I. was notified about the inquiry. Kevin Rowson, a spokesman for the F.B.I. office in Atlanta, declined to comment on Sunday.Mr. Kemp\u2019s dual status as candidate and regulator has been a subject of rancorous debate in Georgia, where allegations of voter suppression have repeatedly been litigated in the courts. As recently as Friday, a judge sided with Mr. Kemp\u2019s critics in one case.Mr. Kemp has broadly decried \u201cthis farce about voter suppression\u201d and said he had \u201cmade it easier to vote and harder to cheat in our state.\u201dBut Ms. Abrams, who made much of her reputation through her work to register new voters across Georgia, argued that voters had \u201cbeen purged, they\u2019ve been suppressed and they\u2019ve been scared.\u201dMr. Kemp is set to appear with President Trump at a campaign rally Sunday afternoon in Macon, Ga.Mike Bloomberg and George Soros want to take away Florida\u2019s guns, according to mailers arriving at homes there last week urging support for Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate for governor.The literature \u2014 claiming to be from the National Rifle Association\u2019s political arm \u2014 says Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the Democratic nominee who is locked in a tight race with Mr. DeSantis, \u201cshares the same radical anti-gun agenda as Michael Bloomberg and George Soros.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Soros favor gun control. And both have been targets of gun rights advocates in the past.Most recently, pro-gun conspiracy theorists circulated a meme suggesting that Mr. Soros funded and organized teenage survivors of the Parkland massacre who became gun control activists.Facebook ads posted by the N.R.A. this year called Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, a hypocrite for using an armed security detail while pushing gun control. Mr. Bloomberg formed the gun control organization Everytown for Gun Safety.\u2022 In a tweet this week, the N.R.A. took aim at the billionaires, along with Tom Steyer, a California megadonor to Democratic candidates. Mr. Soros and Mr. Steyer were among the targets who had pipe bombs sent to them by a fervent Trump supporter last month.\u201cAnother billionaire is pumping unlimited money into electing anti-gun lawmakers,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cNotorious anti-gunner George Soros joins anti-gun billionaires Steyer and Bloomberg. There is no end to how much they\u2019ll pay to push their elitist agenda on Americans.\u201dThe math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.On Saturday, after returning home briefly to tend to the situation, Mr. Gillum resumed campaigning and chose to confront the subject directly.\u201cIt only, for me, underscores what we have to do just three days from now,\u201d he said at a rally in West Palm Beach, \u201cwhen we send an unapologetic message to the N.R.A. that their time is up in the state of Florida.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Mr. Hawley, whose team did not comment, has been busy with a string of 11th-hour rallies featuring President Trump (the final one is Monday night), Vice President Mike Pence and Oliver North, the president of the N.R.A.\u2022 The president has two campaign rallies scheduled: 4 p.m. in Macon, Ga., with Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor; and 7 p.m. in Chattanooga, Tenn., with Ms. Blackburn.Danny Hakim and Stephanie Saul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When Cynthia Chung, 31, and Jeddy Hao, 32, found their one-bedroom apartment on Craigslist five years ago, it seemed like too good a deal.Rent was $1,050 a month, a few hundred less than everything else in the area, with no obvious defects to explain the discount. If anything, the apartment was nicer than others they had seen: It was well sized and well maintained, with large windows and a good layout.To Ms. Chung\u2019s surprise, he turned out to be right. Rent stabilization accounted for the lower-than-average rent. If there was any downside, it was that many of their friends lived elsewhere.But as they would soon discover, the prospect of a rent-stabilized apartment in a pleasant building is a powerful lure. They would not be alone for long.\u201cBack then, it was like, \u2018If you\u2019re in Flushing, you\u2019re hanging out with a bad crowd.\u2019 People were always getting into fights,\u201d said Mr. Hao, who grew up in Whitestone, N.Y. \u201cOur parents wouldn\u2019t even let us go here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not shiny and new like Long Island City, but it has its charms,\u201d Mr. Hao said. \u201cLike authentic Chinese food.\u201d\u201cSo much good food,\u201d Ms. Chung said. \u201cBuying food out is actually cheaper than cooking \u2014 most meals are, like, $6.

{"Headline": "Sigrid Johnson Was Black. A DNA Test Said She Wasn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "The surge in popularity of services like 23andMe and Ancestry means that more and more people are unearthing long-buried connections and surprises in their ancestry.Supported byThree years ago, when Sigrid E. Johnson was 62, she got a call from a researcher seeking volunteers for a study on DNA ancestry tests and ethnic identity. Johnson agreed to help. After all, she and the researcher, Anita Foeman, had been pals for half a century, ever since they attended the same elementary school in their integrated Philadelphia neighborhood, where they and other black children were mostly protected from the racism beyond its borders. Foeman, a professor of communication at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, asked Johnson to swab the inside of her cheek and share her thoughts about her ethnic and racial identity before and after the results came back.Johnson\u2019s father, a chauffeur who later became a superintendent at a housing project in North Philadelphia, had a golden-brown complexion. Her mother, who said her own father was a white Brit and her mother was half African-American and half Native American, was light-skinned. People sometimes mistook Johnson\u2019s mother for white, and when she applied for seamstress jobs at department stores in the 1920s and \u201930s, she chose not to correct them.Sigrid, who had light caramel skin, was their only child, and her parents, Martha and Frank Gilchrist, doted on her. In grade school, she prayed each night for an older brother, someone who would be fun to play with and would look after her, as her friends\u2019 brothers did with their siblings. When she wasn\u2019t busy with ballet and piano lessons, she caught lightning bugs and played dolls, hopscotch and jump rope with nearby friends. The neighborhood, West Mount Airy, was a tree-lined community, one of the first in the nation to integrate successfully. It was populated mostly by middle- and upper-class people, including many African-American professional men who had fair-skinned wives and children whose complexions matched their mothers\u2019.Johnson doesn\u2019t remember her parents talking much about race, except when her father made it clear that he expected her to marry a black man. But even without that explicit talk, she was immersed in the highs and lows of black life. Her cousin, a surgeon named William Gilchrist Anderson, lived in Albany, Ga., where he led a large coalition of activists in the early 1960s to desegregate public facilities. A friend and classmate of Ralph Abernathy, Anderson persuaded the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to participate in the city\u2019s demonstrations, which Johnson remembers she and her parents sometimes joined. During the family\u2019s trips to visit her cousin in Georgia, Johnson saw water fountains that said \u201cWhites Only.\u201d And she still remembers the night that a giant cross burned near her cousin\u2019s front yard and how he swept her and everyone else out of the house and put them all up in a hotel.As a young teenager, Johnson pestered her mother about what it was like to give birth to her \u2014 a query her mother always dodged. But when Johnson was 16, her mother broke down and said through tears that they adopted her when she was an infant. Her mother explained that Johnson\u2019s biological father was black and that her biological mother was a white Italian woman who said she couldn\u2019t keep the baby, who by then was 2 or 3 months old. The woman, who lived in South Philadelphia, had explained that she already had several children, all of whom were blond, and that her white husband didn\u2019t want another man\u2019s child raised in his home, not least of all one whose color so boldly announced that fact. Johnson\u2019s mother said the woman came to see the baby for about a year, until she asked the woman to stop visiting because she didn\u2019t want Sigrid to find out she was adopted. Johnson teared up as she recounted the conversation with her mother that took place 49 years ago. \u201cThe news \u2014 all of it \u2014 was crushing,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cTo this day, I honestly wish she had never told me. I wanted my mom to be my mom.\u201d Neither one ever broached the subject with the other again.So when Anita Foeman requested that she take a DNA test, Johnson figured it was no big deal: She was half African and half Italian. \u201cI knew what the results would show when they came back \u2014 that is, until the results actually came back.\u201dJohnson is one of many millions of people around the world who have placed a bit of saliva into a DNA kit, sent it off to a testing company, waited a good month for the results and then discovered the sometimes life-altering secrets hidden in those tiny drops. Virtually every cell in a human\u2019s body carries that person\u2019s whole unique blueprint \u2014 the double helix of DNA. The genes on chromosomes influence the traits of every living thing. Testing companies analyze hundreds of thousands of particular genetic sequences and use those snippets as clues to all sorts of information. Scientists have determined specific locations in the DNA code that provide hints about where your ancestors came from, because people from the same geographical place share certain genetic similarities. The tests can also reveal your biological relatives, and how closely you\u2019re related, by evaluating how much of your and their DNA patterns overlap. In addition, DNA analysis can identify some of the hereditary disorders you may be predisposed to or may pass on to your children.Rudimentary DNA testing has been around since the mid-20th century, but at-home genetic tests (aside from simple paternity tests) didn\u2019t show up until this century, after the Human Genome Project prompted biotechnological advances that made genetic sequencing much more affordable. Most of those early personal genomic tests focused on genealogy, a way to fill out the family tree, because determining familial connections is scientifically much more straightforward than determining a person\u2019s true ethnic lineage. But in 2007, as scientists linked more genes to diseases and traits, 23andMe pioneered a much broader kind of retail genomics, a $999 saliva test that promised to reveal genetic information from the novel to the profound. It included ancestry and information about medical and other genetic information, including consumers\u2019 risk for age-related macular degeneration, Parkinson\u2019s disease and Type 2 diabetes, as well genes that block the bitter taste in vegetables and influence weight gain.The following year, Time magazine named the company\u2019s retail DNA test the Invention of the Year, describing this moment as \u201cthe beginning of a personal-genomics revolution that will transform not only how we take care of ourselves but also what we mean by personal information. ... Not everything about how this information will be used is clear yet \u2014 23andMe has stirred up debate about issues ranging from how meaningful the results are to how to prevent genetic discrimination \u2014 but the curtain has been pulled back, and it can never be closed again.\u201dThose debates continue, but in the last year or so, sales of at-home genetic tests have risen meteorically. By April 2017, 23andMe had roughly two million customers, and this past January, just nine months later, it had more than five million. AncestryDNA\u2019s customer base doubled to about six million in 2017 alone and has since grown to more than 10 million. Add to that all the customers of MyHeritage, FamilyTreeDNA, Helix, National Geographic\u2019s DNA test and dozens of others. The most popular tests are those that promise to reveal test takers\u2019 ancestry and identify their relatives \u2014 and have the potential to upend our understanding of ourselves. Just imagine what you might find out: Your father is not your dad but actually your dad\u2019s best friend. Or your sister is really your half sister or isn\u2019t your biological sister at all. Or you\u2019re the child of a sperm donor and have 150 half siblings. These and endless other DNA surprises all raise the same question: Are we really who we think we are?Once Johnson found out she was adopted, the 16-year-old examined every passer-by in Philadelphia, wondering: \u201cAre you my relative?\u201d When it came time to choose a college, she opted for a school more than 500 miles away: a historically black university in Ohio called Wilberforce, named after a prominent 18th-century abolitionist. It was 1970, and on campus, talk of black power and black pride swirled around her. At first she felt self-conscious that she lacked the richly colored skin that was finally being celebrated in society, but her cousin\u2019s prominence in civil rights efforts gave her a certain confidence. While Johnson was at Wilberforce, she told no one that she was adopted and no one that she was half white. \u201cI was at an all-black school, so if anyone asked what I was, I just said, \u2018Black.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn college, Johnson\u2019s sense of herself as a black person intensified, immersed as she was in a cocooned world that celebrated the contributions and ambitions of the community. Most of Johnson\u2019s professors were black, as were virtually all the students. She was surrounded by people who exuded pride in their identity.All around her, classmates were sporting dashikis and other African garb, or the black beret and black leather jacket of the Black Panthers. Large Afros seemed ubiquitous, often with Afro picks decorated with a clenched black fist. Johnson stopped straightening her hair, which had required her to wrap her gentle curls around large rollers and sleep that way all night. By the early \u201970s, straightened hair was pass\u00e9 for black women, and Johnson did her best to keep up. \u201cI tried really hard to make a bush, an Afro, teasing it up and then putting bobby pins in to keep it up, but when it rained, my bush would just fall.\u201d She bought an Afro wig with hair that stood five inches high and wore it daily. \u201cNo one ever asked if it was a wig,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my best friends knew.\u201d Soon after, she quit wearing it.When Johnson was 22, she fell for a man she would later marry, but she never told him that she was half white or adopted. Her parents disapproved of how dark the man\u2019s skin was, because in their experience, lighter complexion meant higher status and more options. When the young couple\u2019s son was born in 1976, Johnson\u2019s parents were relieved that his coloring was more like their daughter\u2019s.Johnson and her husband split up two years later. That same year, Johnson went back to school to get her nursing degree. In 1985, she married another man, a physical therapist; by then, both her parents had died. She told her husband what she had never told anyone else besides her son and a few close friends: She was adopted. His response was kind and supportive. Years later, he happened upon a conversation on \u201cThe Phil Donahue Show\u201d about adoptees successfully requesting their original birth certificates from state officials. He called Johnson at work right away and encouraged her to request her birth certificate too. He gathered all the information she needed, and they sent it off together. When it arrived, she learned that her mother\u2019s name was Ann D\u2019Amico, so Johnson and her husband called D\u2019Amicos they found in the Philadelphia phone book. Some who answered said they knew no Ann D\u2019Amico. Others just hung up.Still, when Johnson took the DNA test in 2015 at age 62, she was certain about what it would find and was sorry she wouldn\u2019t be able to share the results with her husband, who had died years earlier. The results, which indicated a stunning level of precision, shocked Johnson. They said she was 45.306 percent Hispanic, 32.321 percent Middle Eastern, 13.714 percent European and 8.659 percent \u201cother,\u201d which included a mere 2.978 percent African.\u201cTwo percent African?! I thought, Well, who am I then? I knew that at my age, I shouldn\u2019t really care what people think, but I was embarrassed to show it to anyone besides my son and my cousin, who\u2019s like a sister to me. I was afraid people would think I was a fraud. I was so disappointed, and in my heart of hearts, I didn\u2019t believe it, because how could I not be black? I\u2019d lived black. I was black.\u201dWith the stupendous rise of DNA ancestry testing, academics have wondered how those genetic results affect people\u2019s core identity. Our sense of self, of course, is built on much more than just the ethnic tribe we belong to. We forge our identity from the social and cultural milieus we\u2019re raised in; the messages we get from parents, teachers and society about ourselves; the family lore and traditions passed down from generation to generation; and the experiences we have and hold dear. All of that is deeply woven into who we are.\u201cOur identity is what grounds us and gives our lives meaning,\u201d said David Brodzinsky, emeritus professor of developmental and clinical psychology at Rutgers University, whose work focuses on identity and adoption. \u201cThat identity can be a motivating force or a debilitating one, depending on how we define ourselves and internalize the feedback we get from others. We spend our lives searching for self, though we each do that in different ways and at different times. It\u2019s all about the desire to fill in empty spaces, to find connection, to know more about yourself.\u201dFor children cut off from their origins because of a closed adoption or an unknown sperm or egg donor, those answers are harder to get. And if a person\u2019s origin was a secret that they discover later in life, Brodzinsky said, they may feel that everything they knew about themselves and their roots was a lie. Even people who were raised by their biological parents can feel shaken when their DNA tests present results that don\u2019t fit with their understanding of who they are.Anita Foeman is one of the academics studying the effects of unexpected DNA results. Since 2006, she has tested roughly 3,000 people. Before her subjects receive their results, she asks them about their racial and ethnic identities, then follows up with them once the results are in. Her research subjects often conflate race and ethnicity \u2014 \u201cIf I\u2019m this color, my ancestors must be from this place.\u201d But ancestry tests look for genetic links to geographic regions, not to physical characteristics associated with race, like skin color, which is an unreliable indicator of ancestry. Foeman and researchers at other universities have found that people accept the results that suit their aspirations and often dismiss results that challenge their long-held core beliefs.\u201cWe seek out and cultivate identities to fill our need to belong, and it\u2019s through that lens of identity that we see and understand the world,\u201d said Jay Van Bavel, a psychology professor at New York University who researches how group identities, values and beliefs shape the mind and brain. \u201cSo when you get information that challenges your identity, many people tune it out, just like we do with headlines and news stories when they counter our politics and belief system.\u201dWhen white test takers see results that indicate they have African ancestry, some, especially young people, welcome their newfound multicultural heritage, even when the percentage is small, which raises an interesting question: How much ancestry is enough to give someone the authority to claim that identity? Research also shows that some whites whose reports indicate African lineage conclude that it\u2019s irrelevant, and still others, no matter their race or ethnicity, disbelieve results they didn\u2019t expect. For example, many blacks and whites whose families have long claimed that some of their forebears were Native American dismiss DNA reports that say otherwise. And Asians, like whites, often rebuff results that indicate that their heritage isn\u2019t pure. Some people take that to extremes: White nationalists who use DNA tests to prove their racial purity adamantly reject any non-European results. A professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and another researcher studied comments on the online white-supremacist forum Stormfront. They found that some posters who had taken DNA tests and were upset with their results argued that they were \u201crigged\u201d to \u201cspread multiculturalism\u201d or that the non-European findings were merely \u201cnoise DNA.\u201d Many African-Americans, meanwhile, upon seeing how much of their lineage is European, are not necessarily surprised or doubtful about the results, but they feel gut-punched by the bald reminder that even their genes carry slavery\u2019s legacy. Underlying all these reactions is the question of identity: What do these results mean about who I am? How do these results fit with the stories I\u2019ve long clung to that connected my past, my present and my future?Ever since Johnson received her disorienting DNA results, she wondered if her saliva sample might have been accidentally mislabeled or she had been sent someone else\u2019s results. But it turns out that the company that analyzed her DNA focuses on forensic genetics and legal paternity tests, which evaluate only a few segments of DNA, not the hundreds of thousands used by most ancestry-testing companies. (Foeman used this company for a minority of her research.) So this summer, when The New York Times offered to buy Johnson ancestry tests from more mainstream companies, AncestryDNA and 23andMe, she eagerly agreed.Their tests determine ethnicity by analyzing segments of customers\u2019 DNA that give clues to their ancient geographic origins. Five hundred to 1,000 years ago, before large-scale transcontinental migration, people who lived in the same region had similar genetics. Scientists have been able to identify distinct patterns of genetic variation among people whose ancestors hail from the same lands, which is easiest to do with populations that were geographically isolated, like Finns and Filipinos, or were insular, like Ashkenazi Jews. Ideally, ancestry-testing companies would compare customers\u2019 DNA to that of people from premigration days. But given that impossibility, the companies use an imperfect proxy: people alive today who have a deep family tree in a particular geographic area, and sometimes a paper trail to prove it. Those people\u2019s DNA becomes the company\u2019s reference data set for that geographic area. When a segment of your DNA closely matches the data for that location, the company assigns you that ancestry. The more segments on your genome that match that genetic pattern, the larger your estimated percentage will be for that ancestry.The larger the reference data set for any particular corner of the world, the better the resolution will be: suggesting that your ancestors aren\u2019t, say, just from Europe but from Northwestern Europe, or more specifically from Ireland and Scotland. Each testing company builds its own reference data set, drawn primarily from its own customers, and each company also creates its own algorithm for assigning heritage. In other words, customers\u2019 results are based on inferences and are merely an estimate, often a very rough one \u2014 something many test takers don\u2019t realize and testing companies play down.Still, Johnson, now 65, hoped the new tests would conclude that her genes aligned with who she believed herself to be. In early August, with the kits in hand, she walked around her apartment, trying to work up enough saliva to fill the little collection tubes. Afterward, Johnson was both eager for quick results and hesitant about what they might say. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if the results are the same as they were before, I am still a black woman.\u201dWeeks later, her AncestryDNA report was posted. It marked more than a third of her ancestry as \u201clow confidence,\u201d meaning it couldn\u2019t establish its ethnicity because her DNA didn\u2019t sufficiently match the company\u2019s reference data sets. She was disappointed. It\u2019s a common experience for customers with non-European ancestry, because Africa and Asia are underrepresented in many companies\u2019 data sets, in part because most of their customers \u2014 the building blocks of their reference set \u2014 are of European descent. Many companies are trying to remedy that by seeking DNA from people in regions underrepresented in the data set.The rest of Johnson\u2019s ethnicity, AncestryDNA said, broke down this way: 21 percent Europe South (but no percentage from Italy), 11 percent Caucasus, 10 percent Benin/Togo, 9 percent Mali, 8 percent Ivory Coast/Ghana and 6 percent Europe West. As Johnson heard the results, she teared up. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved to see the African part, that I really am a black woman.\u201d (Neither AncestryDNA nor 23andMe includes a \u201cHispanic\u201d category, because they, like most companies that search for heritage, focus on ancestry before Europeans and Africans ever arrived at what\u2019s now called the Americas.)I wondered how certain AncestryDNA was about Johnson\u2019s percentages, which wasn\u2019t readily apparent on the site. I called customer service and asked several representatives where on the website I could find the company\u2019s confidence level. One said that any percentage not marked \u201clow confidence\u201d was 100 percent certain. Another said each percentage was 99 percent certain. When I asked that representative to check with a supervisor, she did, then returned to tell me that the company\u2019s certainty was 99.7 percent. Those answers were confusing, because behind each of Johnson\u2019s percentages was a range from which each ancestry point was drawn. For example, when we clicked on Johnson\u2019s Benin/Togo segment, which had been assigned 10 percent of her ancestry, the site showed that the percentage of her DNA from those nations could be as low as zero and as high as 21. In fact, every one of her African links showed a range that started with zero, while her Europe South\u2019s percent had a range of 9 to 33. Even the customer-service representative agreed that it was hard to fathom that the company could be so certain about the percentage when the range behind it ran to zero, which it did in four of the six geographic findings on Johnson\u2019s report. Johnson and I asked if someone higher up could call us with better answers; the representative amiably said she would put in our request and assured us that the call would come within a few hours. None ever did.AncestryDNA\u2019s chief scientific officer, Catherine Ball, later told me that the company doesn\u2019t provide a confidence level for each percentage on its personalized report for users, but it is 95 percent certain that the range behind each percentage is accurate. In other words, AncestryDNA was 95 percent confident that 9 to 33 percent of Johnson\u2019s ancestry was from Europe South, that 4 to 16 percent was from Caucasus and that 0 to 58 percent was from Africa. And because that \u201ccertainty\u201d is based on the reference data set and the algorithm the company uses, even that certitude evaporates if the data set or algorithm changes. \u201cThere is no ground truth here,\u201d Ball said, \u201cno \u2018I guarantee that you are 22.674 percent Italian!\u2019 These are all just statistical estimates. Every statistic has a lot of science and math behind it, and a lot of imperfection and room for improvement too.\u201dIn September, AncestryDNA updated its reference databases and changed its algorithm, and overnight, Johnson\u2019s ancestry report was completely different. Although all of her African percentages still showed that the figures could be as low as zero, this time, instead of being identified as 27 percent African, she was now 45 percent African, primarily from Cameroon, Congo and the Southern Bantu Peoples. And though the previous version showed no percentage or range for Italy, the new version said she was 49 percent Italian, with a range of just 48 to 51 percent. And that 95 percent certainty about ancestry from Caucasus? Gone. Caucasus doesn\u2019t even show up on the updated report.Johnson\u2019s 23andMe results, on the other hand, said that she was 43.4 percent sub-Saharan African, 36.9 percent European (just over half of which was Italian), 12.8 percent Western Asian, 2.7 percent East Asian and Native American and 1.8 percent a combination of Western Asian and North African. The rest was unassigned. The company does not provide ranges, but it does give a confidence level for its result.The ancestry-composition report from 23andMe, with each figure to the tenth of a percent, suggests a high level of precision, but the default conclusions are remarkably speculative; they\u2019re only at the 50 percent confidence level, meaning that the ancestry composition you see on your report is as likely to be not true as true. If you dig down enough \u2014 I couldn\u2019t figure out how, so I called for instructions \u2014 you can increase the confidence level to 90 percent (meaning your geographic assignments are 90 percent likely to reflect your true ancestry, based on the company\u2019s data set and algorithm), though the figures locked at the top of the main page remain at 50 percent. At the 90 percent confidence level, 38 percent of Johnson\u2019s ancestry was unassigned (compared with 2 percent at the 50 percent level). Her Italian ancestry dropped to 7.9 percent, from the 19.6 percent Italian that showed on her main page, and the specificity of her African heritage disappeared.I asked Scott Hadly, a 23andMe spokesman, why the default is set at the 50 percent level, given that it\u2019s so uncertain. \u201cPeople want really specific information, down to which county in England they\u2019re from. We would rather be more general in the results, than to give specific results that may not be accurate. So we try to give results that are interesting to them, which they can use to explore, to see if it tells them something informative. We\u2019re not necessarily telling them, \u2018This is what you are.\u2019 We\u2019re saying, \u2018This is what the DNA says.\u2019\u2009\u201dAnd yet, in a matter of weeks, Johnson\u2019s African roots had bounced from 27 percent to 45 percent African \u2014 and her Italian roots had been reported as 0 percent, 49 percent and 20 percent. Through it all, of course, Johnson\u2019s true ancestry, whatever it actually is, never changed.Ethnicity is not the only area in which personal genomic testing companies have been criticized for insufficient transparency; public-health and consumer advocates have raised serious concerns about how companies use the avalanche of genetic data they\u2019ve collected from their customers. The data haul is a potential gold mine for biotech firms, insurance companies, marketers, data brokers, law enforcement and, most of all, pharmaceutical companies. Drug companies have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into at-home-DNA-test companies worldwide, banking on all that genetic data, linked to vast crowdsourcing on individuals\u2019 physical and psychological disorders, to slash the time and cost of developing new treatments and drugs, including ones tailored to an individual\u2019s unique genetic makeup. Scientists have already made incredible progress, building on the advances by the Human Genome Project. Data from 23andMe customers has revealed spots on the genome that are linked to depression, Parkinson\u2019s, lupus, inflammatory-bowel disease, allergies and some cancers, prompting Fast Company to name the business the second Most Innovative Health Company this year.But critics say the business model that led to that heap of data is worrisome, putting at risk the privacy of the most precise identifier a person has \u2014 a concern that intensified after studies showed that it\u2019s possible to reidentify individuals from anonymized genetic databases. In July, hackles were raised again when the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline invested $300 million in 23andMe and gained exclusive rights to its customers\u2019 data. Much of the jump in DNA-test sales this past year or two has been a result of deeply discounted prices (they now cost about $99) and aggressive marketing, as companies try to lure evermore people to give up their personal genetic code. Last year on Black Friday, 23andMe\u2019s discounted test was one of Amazon\u2019s five best sellers; that same weekend, AncestryDNA reportedly sold a whopping 1.5 million kits. In 2017, in a consumer guide to DNA ancestry testing, the Council for Responsible Genetics wrote, \u201cThese come-ons promise more than they can deliver, ignoring problems with accuracy while obscuring a business model in which customers pay for the privilege of giving away valuable information to venture capitalists who expect it will make them very, very rich.\u201dIn the last few years, just a few miles away from Sigrid Johnson, another woman\u2019s origin story was unfolding. Her name is June Smith. Like Johnson, Smith had no idea as a child that the parents who were raising her weren\u2019t the ones who created her. Smith\u2019s neighbors knew that the 6-day-old baby who had suddenly appeared in the Smith house wasn\u2019t born to the Smiths, and they also understood that fact was meant to remain private. So for years, neighbors knew more about Smith\u2019s origins than she herself did. In their solidly black neighborhood in South Philadelphia, Smith stood out. Her skin was lighter than most, and her hair was wavy and long, \u201clike a white girl\u2019s,\u201d she said. Though she had some good friends, she was bullied by others. \u201cAutomatically, I was a target, because darker people thought that a lighter-colored person is more privileged,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t black enough.\u201dLike Johnson, Smith learned startling news about herself when she was 16, when a neighborhood friend let slip that Smith\u2019s parents weren\u2019t her \u201creal\u201d parents. Smith marched inside to interrogate her mother, who chided her for asking such crazy questions. Eventually her parents confessed. They described a white Italian woman who handed over her 6-day-old infant after explaining that the father was black and adding: \u201cI can\u2019t take that baby home. If I do, they\u2019ll kill her.\u201d Smith told me: \u201cI never knew if my mom added that last part, but I know she never wanted me to know that woman, so she may have said it to deter me. Then again, it was part of that era. Either way, I grew up with a lot of animosity toward that white woman, the idea that she didn\u2019t want me just because I was black.\u201dSmith\u2019s mother showed June her original birth certificate. It said she was Gail Moser. The news shook Smith\u2019s understanding of who she was. The search for identity that\u2019s so central to adolescence took on extra urgency. For starters, she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine a white woman gave birth to me.\u201d So Smith did what she could to reconcile the two versions of her life. Her high school was predominantly white and disproportionately Italian-American, so \u201cI began hanging out with white kids and started acting and dressing like a punk rocker, because I thought that\u2019s what white kids did. I went through a total change. I told the white kids I was half Italian. I actually felt they were more accepting of me than my black peers were.\u201dSmith never denied she was black, but she didn\u2019t embrace it either, once she found out she was half white. It wasn\u2019t until she was in her 30s, as her self-esteem solidified, that she welcomed back her black identity. \u201cI saw how society treated people of color, and I thought, You know, black people raised me. And so I became more conscious that, culturally, that\u2019s who I am.\u201d Had her birth mother raised her, she said, \u201cI\u2019d probably consider myself white, because I would have grown up in that Italian home. I would have grown up with Italian ways, Italian foods, Italian whatever. But because of how I was raised, African-American, this is who I am. And I accept that, and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201dAlthough her cultural identity was clear by then, she still yearned to know about her biological family. She wrote and self-published her autobiography in 2014. The last line says, \u201cI am the product of someone, but the reflection of no one.\u201dAncestryDNA and 23andMe give their users the option to have their DNA profile uploaded to see if any genetic relatives pop up. Johnson did so, curious but expecting little. AncestryDNA promptly revealed two women whose DNA indicated that they were \u201cclose family,\u201d which Johnson thought meant they were her first cousins. She reached out to them. One never responded. The other was June Smith.In late August, Johnson and Smith connected by phone. After introducing themselves, Smith asked Johnson if she was adopted. Johnson said yes. Smith asked, \u201cWas your biological mother Ann D\u2019Amico?\u201d Johnson was startled that this stranger would know such a thing. Smith then asked what her birth name was. When Johnson said, \u201cJoan Moser,\u201d Smith started to cry. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for Joan Moser \u2014 for you \u2014 all these years.\u201dEach knew she wasn\u2019t really a child of Eric Moser, D\u2019Amico\u2019s white husband, despite his name being on their birth certificates. These babies had black fathers, presumably two different men, given that Johnson and Smith\u2019s DNA results indicate that they are half siblings, not full ones.Smith told Johnson that she discovered her first Moser connection in 2015: a half sister named Nancy Moser, who told her that D\u2019Amico had six white children, all of whom D\u2019Amico raised. Moser said that their parents had died, and that on D\u2019Amico\u2019s deathbed, their mother conceded that she had \u201cother children\u201d and added, \u201cI wonder if they made it. ... \u201dSmith had been swiftly enfolded into the Moser family, a comforting but also confusing experience. The siblings had told her she wasn\u2019t the only biracial child. They told her that three years before Smith\u2019s birth \u2014 when at least some of D\u2019Amico\u2019s children were already in grade school \u2014 D\u2019Amico gave birth to a baby she named Joan. After two or three months, according to Moser lore, someone told D\u2019Amico\u2019s white husband that Joan, whose skin was darker than her siblings\u2019, couldn\u2019t be his child: She was black, so she had to go.Smith described how welcoming the Moser siblings had been and how the eldest told her she thought Smith might have a twin sister, though she has never shown up on Smith\u2019s AncestryDNA page. But a few years back, AncestryDNA linked Smith to a niece whose deceased father, Thomas, was another biracial child of Ann D\u2019Amico. The Mosers welcomed his family too.After Smith and Johnson talked, Smith alerted the Moser siblings that Joan Moser was alive and well. Johnson was flooded with warm texts, phone calls and Facebook messages from the Moser family. \u201cAll at once,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI got: \u2018I\u2019m your brother!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m your sister!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m your cousin!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m your sister\u2019s daughter!\u2019\u2009\u201d Though they were total strangers, they embraced her as they had Smith, writing: \u201cHi honey. I\u2019m one of your sisters. ... Love you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to know you\u2019re in our family now.\u201d And \u201cI accept you no matter what color you are and I can\u2019t wait to meet you. Just remember you are accepted into our family because you are family, and we love you.\u201d When Johnson saw a photo of Thomas, she was stunned by how much he looked like her son, Ron. That family resemblance made the connection all the more real.\u201cIt all hit me real hard,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cI cried and boohooed like a baby.\u201d She went from being an only child to a woman with a slew of siblings, nieces and nephews. After two days packed with catching up on 65 years of family, Johnson stopped answering calls and reading texts. Overwhelmed, she went to church to calm her soul and express her gratitude. And then she dove right back in with her new-old clan.Since then, she still sometimes feels dizzy as she tries to replace a long-familiar identity with a welcome but much more complicated one. She marvels that for all those decades as a \u201csingle child,\u201d she had siblings galore, living only a few miles away, and she never knew it. One of them even looked like her and had been told the same lie about her origins, and then the same gut-wrenching truth. Smith so deeply understood Johnson\u2019s experience, because she had lived it herself, as a sister would. A real sister. Finally. Those realities were far more mind-bending than any of the ancestry findings, with their wildly different percentages and ephemeral certainties.Johnson and Smith talk two or three times every day. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck on each other,\u201d Johnson said.She sighed. \u201cYou turn 65, take a DNA test and find out your whole life is a lot different than you ever thought it was.\u201dAll source photographs by Jessica Tang for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "M.L.B. Extends TV Deal With Fox Sports Through 2028", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven in the age of streaming and cord-cutting, live sports still carry a big price tag for broadcasters.On Thursday, Major League Baseball and Fox Sports announced they had extended their national television rights agreement. The terms were not disclosed, but two people with direct knowledge of the deal said it was for seven years, through the 2028 season, and $5.1 billion.Fox has been a national M.L.B. television rights holder since 1996 and became an exclusive national broadcaster four years later. Each year, Fox airs Saturday regular season games, the All-Star Game, and several playoff series, including the World Series. The company also broadcasts games in Spanish on Fox Deportes.The new deal calls for Fox to expand its digital baseball programming and to increase the number of regular season and postseason games broadcast starting in 2022.The new television deal was part of a flurry of announcements from the M.L.B. owners\u2019 meetings in Atlanta. M.L.B. and the players\u2019 union also said they had reached an agreement to relax rules governing the footwear worn by players during games.In response to players\u2019 calls for more leeway in expressing themselves on the diamond, the majority of each shoe will no longer be required to be the team\u2019s designated primary color. Instead, players can wear shoes with the following, in any proportion: black, white, and gray; any colors on the players\u2019 uniform; and any additional colors set by their team.\u201cPlayers welcome the expanded opportunity to express themselves and engage with fans through innovative design,\u201d Tony Clark, the executive director of the players\u2019 union, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to seeing their creativity and individuality on the field in 2019.\u201d\u201cWe believe that this agreement strikes the appropriate balance between the shared goal of permitting players to express their individuality while maintaining reasonable restrictions on shoe colors and designs,\u201d M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.In addition to the content deals, M.L.B. owners voted to give Manfred, 60, a five-year extension, through the 2024 season.Manfred was elected commissioner in August 2014 and officially replaced Bud Selig that following January. Under Manfred, the league has posted record profits, enacted pace of play measures, focused on youth and international growth, and negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement with the players\u2019 union that went into effect in 2017.Before becoming commissioner, Manfred was M.L.B.\u2019s chief operating officer with experience in labor relations and strengthening baseball\u2019s drug testing program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Attacks Ukrainian Ships and International Law", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA provocation that could tighten Russia\u2019s illegal hold on Crimea.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The Kremlin can shout all it wants about a provocation, about an attempt by the Ukrainian president to create a political diversion or about anything else, but none of that changes the fact that Russia had no legal justification for firing on three Ukrainian boats and seizing them.Yet ever since Mr. Putin opened a new bridge over the Kerch Strait in May, Russia has moved steadily to impose its control over the strait and the Azov Sea. The Kremlin has moved several gunboats into the shallow sea and has begun stopping and inspecting cargo vessels headed for the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, creating long delays and causing large losses to shipping companies and the ports.By limiting the period to one month, Mr. Poroshenko lifted the greatest worry, that he would postpone national elections in March, which he is almost certain to lose. But the notion of imposing controls on selective regions was more likely to exacerbate regional frictions while not doing much for Ukrainian defenses. It\u2019s important that Mr. Poroshenko and his Western supporters ensure that the clampdown is not used to harass citizens who speak Russian and who are clustered in the affected regions, or give the impression that he is using the crisis for political advantage. Political turmoil is not a victory that Russia should be allowed to claim.Above all, Russia cannot be allowed to get away with this continued bullying of Ukraine. By steadily tightening its hold on Crimea, it is gambling that the West will not have the stomach or stamina to impose ever more punishment or provide more military support for Ukraine. But a direct attack on Ukrainian ships cannot go unpunished. Strong condemnations will not do.The United States and its Western allies can impose stronger economic sanctions, bar their ships from entering Russian ports in the Black or Azov Seas or increase military support for Ukraine. These actions all carry risk, but so does doing nothing.Advertisement"}

We should leave some mysteries alone.Only a fool would try to place limits on the reach of science, which fumbles upward by trial and doubt.To be clear, I\u2019m all in favor of reaching for whichever stars \u2014 so to speak \u2014 might be calling to you. But at the risk of sounding incurious or unscientific, there are some questions that I\u2019m not sure I want answered.It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want them solved. No, I worry that I might be disappointed by the Big Reveal, in the way old horror movies were scarier when you never saw the monster.Jim Peebles, the famed cosmologist at Princeton University, once told me that if someone offered him a tablet of stone that held all the answers to the mysteries of the universe \u2014 how old it is, where it\u2019s going \u2014 he would throw it away.The fun, he said, is in the attempt to find out. So here are some stone tablets that I would throw away.I don\u2019t really want to know what\u2019s in a black hole: The end of time? Another universe? All your bad dreams? My lost socks? I\u2019d hate for any of those intriguing possibilities to be eliminated.Nor do I want to know what evolution has in store for us. If I knew how it was expected to go, and I tried to intervene, I probably would screw it up. I\u2019m not as smart or as innovative as nature, randomly shuffling the genetic deck.The fate of the universe? I feel the same way about it as I feel about the future of the stock market: Entrusted with too much knowledge, I will make grave errors.Oh, and I certainly don\u2019t trust science to tell me what to eat. I\u2019ve already made peace with my dietary vices. I wouldn\u2019t want, or trust, some expert to ruin the terms of the ongoing and relatively successful deal I\u2019ve made with my body.I will persist in believing chocolate and wine are healthy indulgences. I don\u2019t need to know how many calories are in a Frappuccino, nor what\u2019s in my burger, which was once one of the true pleasures of life.I don\u2019t want to know what my cat is thinking before he pounces on my foot while I\u2019m trying to do tai chi.

{"Headline": "Uber and Lyft Announce Rewards Programs ", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe car-hailing services, battling for riders, will now offer customers points that can add up to free trips and other perks. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Uber Rewards.Membership is free. Similar to tiers in an airline loyalty program, Uber Rewards has four tiers: Blue, Gold, Platinum and Diamond. At the program\u2019s launch, the level at which riders are enrolled is determined by a point system based on how much money they have spent on Uber rides and Uber Eats, the company\u2019s food delivery offshoot, over the past six months. If it\u2019s less than 500 points, they will be enrolled at the Blue level. Customers who\u2019ve spent between 500 and 2,499 points become Gold members; 2,500 to 7,499 points equals Platinum; while 7,500 and above earns Diamond status.They will earn one point for every dollar spent on Uber, Uber Eats and UberPool, a shared car ride service. It\u2019s two points per dollar spent on the company\u2019s more expensive solo ride options \u2014 Uber X, UberXL, UberSelect and UberWAV, which uses wheelchair accessible vehicles. A dollar spent on Uber\u2019s most luxurious car options, UberBlack and UberBlack SUV, earns three points.Uber users will get a $5 credit for every 500 points they earn, no matter their membership level. They can use this credit for Uber rides or on Uber Eats.Once they have reached Gold status, they can cancel and rebook an Uber ride within 15 minutes and get a refund of the cancellation fee. They will also get priority support through the app from ride sharing and Eats agents. \u201cWhile it\u2019s hard to quantify by how much, Gold members will get a faster response than nonmembers or those with Blue status,\u201d said Manik Gupta, the company\u2019s vice president of product management.Platinum members also get protected against surge pricing on one ride of their choosing. If there\u2019s bad weather, for example, and rides are in high demand, or a rider is traveling during a peak time when traffic is heavy, they won\u2019t pay the surge price fare. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay the standard rate for what that ride would cost outside of the surge period,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. Platinum members also get priority pickup at airports.Top tier Diamond members get dedicated 24-hour phone support from the company\u2019s most experienced agents and occasional free upgrades to premium rides \u2014 say, to an UberBlack when they have reserved UberX. At this level, they can also opt to use the app\u2019s UberX Diamond feature, which gives access to top-rated drivers. And, they will pay no delivery fee on three Uber Eats orders every six months (this fee ranges between $3 and $10, depending on the city).Uber Rewards will roll out to other cities domestically over the next several months and will eventually be offered worldwide.Customers in the nine cities can join through Uber\u2019s app \u2014 there is an icon for the program under the \u201cMenu\u201d tab.By booking rides, of course. Beyond the Blue status, which all members can get, riders can keep their current status level for six months. If during that time period they don\u2019t spend enough, they can drop down the tiers. For example, a Gold member would need to earn 500 to 2,499 points over six months to maintain that level for the following six months.Lyft Rewards will launch in December, but the company did not reveal many details. Lyft riders will earn points for every dollar they spend and can earn rewards like discounts on future rides and upgrades to more expensive cars. According to a company news release, the program will be available \u201cto select riders in various cities.\"That program will join Lyft\u2019s Business Rewards program earlier this year, which gives customers who use the service for business a $5 credit on their personal accounts after they book five rides that cost $10 or more through a business account.Lyft also has partnerships with Delta and JetBlue: customers can earn a mile with Delta for every dollar they spend on Lyft and earn bonus miles for airport rides. With JetBlue\u2019s partnership, customers earn 30 miles toward the airline\u2019s loyalty program, TrueBlue, for each airport ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Economy and the Trump Rump", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy we went from regional divide to political chasm.Opinion ColumnistBut not everyone was in the running. From the beginning, Amazon specified that it would put the new facility only in a Democratic congressional district.Over the past generation, America\u2019s regions have experienced a profound economic divergence. Rich metropolitan areas have gotten even richer, attracting ever more of the nation\u2019s fastest growing industries. Meanwhile, small towns and rural areas have been bypassed, forming a sort of economic rump left behind by the knowledge economy.Amazon\u2019s headquarters criteria perfectly illustrate the forces behind that divergence. Businesses in the new economy want access to large pools of highly educated workers, which can be found only in big, rich metropolitan areas. And the location decisions of companies like Amazon draw even more high-skill workers to those areas.In other words, there\u2019s a cumulative, self-reinforcing process at work that is, in effect, dividing America into two economies. And this economic division is reflected in political division.In 2016, of course, the parts of America that are being left behind voted heavily for Donald Trump. News organizations responded with many, many, many profiles of rural Trump supporters sitting in diners.But this was, it turns out, fighting the last war. Trumpism turned America\u2019s lagging regions solid red, but the backlash against Trumpism has turned its growing regions solid blue. Some of the reporters interviewing guys in diners should have been talking to college-educated women in places like California\u2019s Orange County, a former ultraconservative stronghold that, come January, will be represented in Congress entirely by Democrats.Why have lagging regions turned right while successful regions turned left? It doesn\u2019t seem to be about economic self-interest. True, Trump promised to bring back traditional jobs in manufacturing and coal mining \u2014 but that promise was never credible. And the orthodox Republican policy agenda of cutting taxes and shrinking social programs, which is basically what Trump is following in practice, actually hurts lagging regions, which depend a lot on things like food stamps and disability payments, much more than it hurts successful areas.Can this chasm be bridged? Honestly, I doubt it.But restoring these regions\u2019 dynamism is much harder, because it means swimming against a powerful economic tide.So the bitter division we see in America \u2014 the ugliness infecting our politics \u2014 may have deep economic roots, and there may be no practical way to make it go away.America, then, is a divided nation, and is likely to stay that way for a while. But the better angels of our nature can still prevail.An earlier version of this column misstated the title of a new book analyzing the 2016 election.

{"Headline": "\u2018Entering Burn Area\u2019: Yosemite After the Fire ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "America\u2019s national parks are increasingly bearing the burden of climate change, as rising temperatures and new weather patterns create mega blazes. A report from the burn zone. Supported byA megafire is a fire that consumes more than 100,000 acres. A few months ago, in an area near Yosemite National Park, the Ferguson fire raged through the Sierra Nevada mountains, burning 86,000 acres of forest before jumping Highway 41 into the park and scorching another 11,000 acres within its boundaries \u2014 not technically a megafire, but just shy of it. A friend of mine went camping in Yosemite a few weeks after the park reopened. During the day, she and her husband and children passed controlled burns and set up camp amid the stunning autumn colors of Tuolumne Meadows. She awoke in the middle of the night to strangely warm, high winds whipping her family\u2019s tent, and felt something she hadn\u2019t felt before: fear.\u201cIs this what it is to camp in California in the 21st century?\u201d she asked me.In early October, I went to experience the tactile reality of Yosemite after the fires for myself.In the face of this holy beauty, your jadedness falls away. You look and look, and look some more. You find you cannot look enough. Wait another quiet moment or two, and you see that this cliff is, in fact, a place of pilgrimage. You see people from all over the world; you listen to them speak a dozen different languages; you watch them gently touch a gnarled tree, a wall of granite. Something like grace remains.This is where my friend Lynsay and I began our day hike on the sun-dappled Panorama Trail toward Nevada Fall, a round-trip, 10.5-mile hike that would take us a little over five hours to complete. We chose this trail for its larger, longer view on what fire means to a place like Yosemite \u2014 not just the most recent fire, but the constant, successive waves of fire that play a vital role in shaping and maintaining the health of a forest.The drive up the switchbacked, 16-mile road leading to the Glacier Point trailhead, off Highway 41 out of the more-visited Yosemite Valley, is itself a kind of reverse visual timeline of the park\u2019s recent fire history. As we hitched up our day packs and headed down the first mile of the Panorama Trail on foot, we admired the fall palette of cinnamon, rust, citron and lime. Newly attuned to the little clues that the forest offers, we saw evidence of other, older fires almost immediately. Tree trunks were blistered and split from intense heat \u2014 the mottled pattern reminiscent of Dutch crunch bread \u2014 but there they were, still standing, with a lush carpet of verdant shrubs and other undergrowth filling in around their feet.Tuolumne MeadowsCaliforniaYosemite National Park120Yosemite ValleyHalf DomeEl CapitanLiberty CapGlacier PointNevada FallMono Meadow140Illilouette CreekExtent ofFergusonWildfireMariposaGroveNEV.SacramentoArea of detailFish CampSan Francisco41CALIFORNIA10 milesBy The New York TimesAfter crossing a wooden bridge over Illilouette Creek and a steep climb \u2014 700 feet in elevation over 1.5 miles \u2014 to an exposed ridgeline, we descended again, and the microclimate shifted to upper montane forest: cooler, shadier and greener, with red fir, pine and juniper trees, some of them furry with electric-green moss. We began to see the patchwork way that fire ideally works in a big forest \u2014 different areas burn at different times, using up available fuels. In effect, this helps contain flames when subsequent fires do come through, giving older burned areas time to recover. Think of a farmer rotating crops.A mile before the 594-foot Nevada Fall, we began to hear the audible rush of water, and glimpsed Half Dome and Liberty Cap through the canopy. Here, too, were fire scars. As scars do on our own bodies, these tell a story of destruction, and renewal.\u201cThe Ferguson fire, from where it started and moved toward the park, it was slow moving. When it actually entered the park, a lot of areas had had previously prescribed fires, so it didn\u2019t burn as hot, and it wasn\u2019t as devastating as it could have been,\u201d Mr. Gediman said. \u201cThat\u2019s ultimately what we want.\u201dAt the completion of the day\u2019s hike, after our return to Glacier Point, Lynsay and I drove back to Highway 41 and headed south toward Fish Camp. By now, we\u2019d seen plenty of fire traces around the park \u2014 in the burn piles in the valley, in the signs saying \u201cEntering Burn Area, Watch Out For Rock Fall.\u201d But this is where we would see the most dramatic views of all: vast tracts of blackened forest on the downhill side of 41, remnants of red fire retardant still lingering on trees on the uphill side, the road having served as a fire break for embattled firefighters struggling to contain the flames below.We pulled over at one turnoff and walked down into the woods for a closer examination. Rustling leaves, felled trees, the faint scent of smoke, the burned and broken remains of a curious glass bottle stamped with the word \u201cCONTENTS.\u201d And, in the middle of this devastation, bright little shoots sprouting up, doing what grass does \u2014 grow, of course, cheerfully and obliviously.The grove\u2019s restoration \u2014 as well as the current fire management plan for Yosemite \u2014 was designed in consultation with affiliated American Indian tribes and Native American groups. In the centuries long before European visitors arrived, native populations in Yosemite Valley used controlled burning and other tools to manage the living landscape on which they depended.It\u2019s an intriguing, romantic bit of poetry, more literary conceit than literal fact. But it got me thinking about our complex and emotional human relationship with the wilderness.Taken in 1903, it is a quintessential image of the two men at Glacier Point during a three-day wilderness trip into Yosemite. The first night, they camped at Mariposa Grove.\u201cNo temple made with human hands can compete with Yosemite,\u201d wrote Muir. His advocacy is what led to the creation of this national park in 1890.Roosevelt himself said this in a 1915 appreciation of Muir: \u201cHe was a great factor in influencing the thought of California and the thought of the entire country so as to secure the preservation of those great natural phenomena \u2014 wonderful canyons, giant trees, slopes of flower-spangled hillsides.\u201dThe truth is that the Yosemite Valley of today is not the same place it was a century ago. One hundred years from now, because of increased warming trends, it may well be unrecognizable. After all, the way we use the park is changing, too. My friend Sarah told me recently about something called the firefall, a massive bonfire of burning logs shoveled off Glacier Point\u2019s ledge into the inky nighttime darkness, a stupendously popular tradition that began in 1872. Her family has been in California for generations, and she grew up backpacking in Yosemite. She recalls her dad\u2019s tales of the nightly spectacle with wonder and skepticism. Real fire! Shoveled off a cliff into the wilderness! What would Smokey Bear say? We Google \u201cYosemite\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d and \u201ccliff,\u201d and, in short order, we find ourselves exclaiming over a blurry archival video from the 1960s.It is astounding to think that they did this and the whole place didn\u2019t go up in flames. The National Park Service finally banned the practice in 1968, and a few years later, people noticed that a waterfall on the eastern side of El Capitan created the same fiery effect for a few weeks in February, when the winter light hit the font of melting snowpack just right. The fame of this illusory firefall has since eclipsed that of the old one, but I can\u2019t stop thinking of the original firefall \u2014 the one made out of real fire.Here\u2019s another definition of firefall, this time from Merriam-Webster: \u201ca tree whose fall is caused by the partial destruction of its roots in a ground fire.\u201d The one hits uncomfortably close to home. Attitudes toward fire and fire dangers are evolving, but we are still cavalier in our own ways. As we build lives deeper and deeper into every corner of the wild, we are increasingly vulnerable to fire\u2019s fiercely destructive power, the way it behaves in ways we don\u2019t completely understand. It is a given that fire management in these places will become ever more challenging, with a human cost.For now, nature continues to endure. What did we see, post-fire? That resilience and rebirth can still be found. In the tiny green ferns shyly unfurling in the enriched earth. In the naturalization ceremony held at Glacier Point for 43 of the country\u2019s newest citizens, just a month after the park reopened. In the multiagency crews working diligently to clear remaining fire hazards, and to seed and shore up eroding hillsides. In the rangers welcoming returning visitors, in the full campgrounds, in the climbers walking along the trails in the glorious late-afternoon light, their carabiners clinking a musical accompaniment on the approach to the great walls of granite.Bonnie Tsui is a writer based in Berkeley, Calif. Her next book, \u201cWhy We Swim,\u201d will be published by Algonquin Books in March 2020.An earlier version of this article misstated how much of Yosemite National Park was closed because of the Ferguson fire. Much of the park was closed, not all of it.Advertisement"}

Some scientists simply assumed that under that cold mass there was nothing more than a \u201cfrozen tectonic block,\u201d a somewhat homogeneous mass that distinguished it from the mixed up geologies of other continents.GOCE\u2019s eye revealed that East Antarctica is a jigsaw puzzle of at least three geological titans named cratonic provinces. Cratons (from the Greek \u201ckratos,\u201d meaning \u201cstrength\u201d) are stable rocky cores of continents that survived hundreds of millions of years of destructive action by Earth\u2019s plate tectonics.One craton has geological similarities with some of Australia\u2019s bedrock, while another resembles part of India\u2019s. The third is an amalgamation of pieces of old seafloors.The pieces may have been assembled as far back as 1 billion years ago, when the supercontinent Rodinia was built, or as recently as 500 million years ago, when another supercontinent, Gondwana, came together. Either way, what has been found beneath Antarctica is part of what\u2019s left after Gondwana\u2019s dissolution, around 160 million years ago.That\u2019s where the European Space Agency\u2019s GOCE (pronounced GO-chay) enters the story.

Imagine that your son is watching his favorite video gamer live-stream an eSports game, and the streamer begins to shout obscenities. Disruptive behavior like this has become routine in video games. The system that guides the appropriateness of content on these platforms is obsolete, and children who play video games are exposed to inappropriate and abusive behavior. To fix this, and make video games safe for children, we need a new content rating system for the eSports era. eSports platforms and video games are plagued by trolls. As eSports are rising to the same worldwide standing as athletics, and gamers are treated as athletes, the level of sportsmanship within video games is lagging far behind. In the League of Legends, I can form a virtual team with players around the world in less than five minutes and play against millions of others. As soon as the match starts, someone types a message in the chatbox. \u201cFeel like trolling,\u201d the anonymous person says, and everyone else on the team knows what\u2019s coming next. Soon, the troll who was supposed to be your teammate kills himself in the game and types obscenities \u2014 misspelled to avoid text filters \u2014 which flash across the screen. There\u2019s nothing that my teammates or I can do about the troll. I tell the anonymous troll that I\u2019ll report him. \u201cLOL!\u201d he says. I start another game, only to be trolled again. The regulations and ratings systems now in place are not doing enough to stop the trolls. If an Elmo character shouts the F-word or kills his teammates in a game, it doesn\u2019t affect the game\u2019s rating, as provided by the industry\u2019s self-regulating organization, the Entertainment Software Rating Board. The E.S.R.B. reviews how violent and sexual game content is, but not how toxic the gamers are becoming in the games. The Federal Trade Commission says on its website that \u201cyou may be able to block the player, or notify a game\u2019s publisher or online service.\u201d While I\u2019ve blocked and reported hundreds of trolls to the video game companies, I\u2019ve never heard back.Even though this problem is widespread and many of the trolls live outside the United States, the F.T.C. and the rating board can take steps to make video game communities less toxic. First, they need to clearly define what is and is not acceptable in video games and streaming sites. Video games should be rated based on the amount of trolling that happens, and streaming sites should be rated just as video games are. Streaming channels should be dynamically filtered based on the user. Children under a certain age should not be able to see videos that use explicit language or sexual visuals.Second, the F.T.C. should run extensive tests on video games and streaming sites to understand the toxicity and trolling of gaming communities.

Warm and unapologetically herself, she was wise and funny, and she could take a joke just as happily as she could dish it out. \u201cYou cook your broccoli like it was brisket,\u201d I remember mocking her once after noticing the pot simmering away for a good 45 minutes. \u201cYoti,\u201d she retorted at once, using her nickname for me with a blend of great affection and snappy humor, that way she had of putting across a serious point not so seriously. \u201cYou mind your own business, young man, and don\u2019t you go around messing with my Christmas. Or else, I\u2019ll have to get out my wooden spoon and chase you round the house.\u201dI loved Greta, and I miss her. I miss her for her dinner table \u2014 be it Christmas, or any other family gathering \u2014 with four types of meat and at least six carbs and vegetables. Many of these were wonderfully delicious, despite my banter. My understanding of the power of lots and lots of butter to lift a mash of carrots and parsnips to heavenly realms I owe to her. In the meat department, maybe less so. Greta was able to describe a piece of cooked meat as \u201clovely and dry\u201d without a wee bit of irony. Her vegetable soup, on the other hand, was everything you want a soup to be: simple, wholesome and good.Regardless of what she placed on the table, though, what I learned from Greta was a particular way of celebrating with family and loved ones, her unique gift for just being there. The food at the center of the table \u2014 always important, no doubt, and the subject of long conversations \u2014\u00a0was almost secondary. It was about bringing us around that table, chatting, reminiscing and laughing. Laughing a lot. Laughing all the time, really.Greta is actually probably laughing her head off right now, seeing what I have here for a family gathering: a side of salmon, seasoned with seaweed, ginger and Thai basil, served with a salad of roasted sunchokes, radishes and green onions. A far cry from her beloved overcooked turkey. There are also potatoes, which she would naturally appreciate, and lots of butter, which she would welcome even more, but the rest Greta would classify as my \u201cfunny food.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of Aging Just Might Be in Margaritaville", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "At the Jimmy Buffett-branded community, a hint at how an increasingly long-lived species might choose to spend its extra decades.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in a 55-plus community,\u201d Ruth Kelly, 61, a former real estate agent and Matt\u2019s wife, said the following September. The three of us were sitting at a table in the dining room of the home the Kellys had secured on Cool Breeze Drive, a single-family unit with the L-shaped lanai that Ruth had had her eye on. \u201cBeing in real estate, I didn\u2019t think I would do what we did, wait in line for 11 hours. I always told my customers: \u2018Never buy in Phase 1. Never buy sight-unseen.\u2019 I did all of that. But I never once had doubt. Not once did I feel that way. It was meant to be, I really believe that.\u201dOutside, under an endless blue sky, a parade of trucks bore the trappings of former homes from as far away as Hawaii, Canada and El Salvador to sorbet-colored dwellings with emerald green lawns. At the entrance to the gated enclave, past a \u201cBarkaritaville\u201d dog park, beeping excavators moved dirt around what would soon be a town-square for concerts and dancing, surrounded by a state-of-the-art workout center, a restaurant and a walk-in pool with cabanas and a bar. It was impossible to stand on their cement foundations \u2014 which I had, in fact, done that morning \u2014 and not see a frontier settlement being carved into an expanse of subtropical wetland. The real frontier here, though, was not the surrounding wilderness but a hitherto uncolonized stretch of time: the multiple decades that more and more Americans can expect to live in better and better health after they retire. What will these pioneers do? Who will they become? And how will that, in turn, alter the course of human history?To be sure, Margaritaville is not representative of how most of us will spend our retirement years. Fewer than 14 percent of Americans 75 and older occupy some form of senior housing today. Three-quarters of those over 50 say they would prefer not to move at all. And untold numbers of seniors who might need or want to enter an age-restricted or assisted-living community won\u2019t be able to afford to do so; 30 percent of those 65 and older have an annual income below $23,000, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The least-expensive homes in Margaritaville are more than 10 times that, before the monthly association fee of roughly $200 \u2014 and those sums don\u2019t include meals or care. (For statewide comparison, a private room in a skilled-nursing facility has a median cost of $9,000 per month, and in an assisted-living residence, $3,500 per month, according to LeadingAge Florida, an association of elder-care organizations. Continuing-care communities that guarantee all levels of lifetime care on-site have charges that range from $2,500 to $5,400 per month, plus substantial entry fees.)Like all pioneer settlements, however, Margaritaville is not just a place but an idea \u2014 an imagined utopia, in this case inspired by a Jimmy Buffett song\u2019s reference to a frozen cocktail. Historically, such extreme aspirational-lifestyle experiments have had an outsize influence on our cultural imagination: It would be hard to call Jamestown, one cradle of our democracy, a practical project; same goes for the squalid boomtowns of the Gold Rush, which helped define the American dream. What intrigued me about Margaritaville was the specificity of its promise \u2014 a retirement based on music Buffett has described as \u201cdrunken Caribbean rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d \u2014 and the fact that it is still under construction. I could actually meet the early colonists as they went about pursuing their vision.Gaining access to Margaritaville as a reporter had not been easy; several feet away, politely pretending not to listen to my conversation with the Kellys, was a Margaritaville brand ambassador and two public relations specialists for Minto Communities, the developer (Latitude Margaritaville is their collaboration). My visit had been approved at the highest corporate levels and my subjects preselected and scheduled in 30-minute time slots. All brands cultivate their image, but building communities for seniors typically requires a special degree of staging. \u201cArchitects are basically set designers,\u201d David Dillard, the president of D2 Architecture, a senior-housing firm, told me. \u201cWe fight to diminish any icons of this being a senior place. We literally hide things. Inside the community \u2014 this is part of our struggle \u2014 you don\u2019t want to see your future.\u201dOr at least not the part that includes inevitable death, possibly preceded by mental or bodily deterioration. The problem is that in order to avoid considering those eventualities, we tend to avert our collective gaze from the future altogether \u2014 and in doing so, risk missing our opportunity to stage a more enjoyable and meaningful one. Consequently, our concept of senior housing is often dystopic: a quarantining of those who can no longer care for themselves and are of no \u201cuse\u201d to society. To purchase a home in Margaritaville, on the other hand, is to aggressively reimagine the aging process as a ticket to an island paradise, which may prove to be willfully na\u00efve or ingeniously farsighted \u2014 or both.A similar demographic shift is underway around the globe, and no one seems to have a solid plan for addressing it. \u201cIt really comes down to two questions: Where are we going to live, and who is going to take care of us?\u201d says Andrew Carle, founding director of the program in senior-housing administration at George Mason University. \u201cThe rapidly aging worldwide population will affect us more than global warming, I think. It\u2019s the seminal event of the 21st century.\u201d As Carle and many others see it, there are only two possible answers, which will need to be deployed in tandem to avoid a social and economic collapse: first, develop technology that will help seniors live independently longer, and second, persuade them to congregate so that they can be cared for more effectively, by humans or robots or both. The latter will be a more difficult sell than it was for those in the \u201csilent generation,\u201d who have been loath to complain as long as they feel reasonably safe and comfortable. Baby boomers came of age in the consumer culture of the 1950s and are comparison shoppers who expect to have agency and choice. \u201cWe\u2019re the same generation that invented 14 flavors of Coca-Cola,\u201d Carle says. \u201cSo we want more flavors. We\u2019ve blown up the portfolio of every product we\u2019ve touched.\u201dIn addition to senior communities organized around faith, military service and civic fraternities, there are now retirement cruise ships being planned for the superwealthy and floating condos for presale that will go up and down the Mississippi. The Villages, outside Orlando, has 52 golf courses and a new enrichment program that offers courses ranging from scuba diving to current affairs. Increasingly developers are partnering with schools like Duke and the University of Florida; Arizona State University recently broke ground on a 20-story senior-living facility it calls \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dorm.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of experimentation with models,\u201d Bob Kramer, the founder of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no model that\u2019s really caught on yet.\u201d (A proposed nudist community has fallen through.) But existing facilities have been notoriously slow to innovate. \u201cChange things!\u201d David Dillard says. \u201cSenior housing are sluggards in that respect.\u201dWhat needs remodeling can be depressingly obvious: Cafeterias and set mealtimes are out; multiple restaurants, from fine dining to deli takeout, are in. But the bigger question is whether redesigning the physical environment where seniors live can redefine the way we experience aging itself. Biologically speaking, we know very little about what aging is or how it works. It isn\u2019t fatal, technically, but in developed countries it is the greatest risk factor for cancer, dementia and heart disease. It is a universal experience across the animal kingdom, one that unfolds uniquely in each individual. And while we think of other life phases as having a particular purpose \u2014 childhood is about growing and learning; adulthood is about procreating and producing \u2014 we have not defined old age as clearly. (In fact, apart from humans, only a few species of cetacean live beyond menopause.) \u201cWe have no shared collective articulation for what later life is for, what the value of living longer is, except not dying,\u201d says Elana Buch, an anthropologist at the University of Iowa who studies aging and labor inequality in the U.S. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any conversations about what the point of it is, so we reproduce it from other parts of life \u2014 doing things you didn\u2019t get to do before.\u201dThere\u2019s only so much that polling can tell us about how older people envision their coming decades. In a recent survey, the AARP found that, when it comes to growing old, people 55 and older looked most forward to having free time for family, friends and activities they enjoy; they most feared dementia and losing independence. What older people value in a place to live is much the same as it is for people in other life stages: well-maintained streets and sidewalks, safe parks. All of which seems to suggest a desire to stay connected to their current community \u2014 but says little about what their changing role within that community might be.\u201cI\u2019m Jimmy Buffett,\u201d Jimmy Buffett said.\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d said Al\u2019s wife, Fran, who assumed this was a practical joke.Despite being the second household to arrive in Latitude Margaritaville, the Murdocks, like many residents, are not Parrotheads, as superfans of Buffett\u2019s music are known. And yet, as the performer\u2019s appearance at their door illustrated, the man and his brand are embedded in the fiber of the place, from the Miami Beach scent floating through the models to the Margaritaville\u00ae Key West\u2122 Frozen Concoction Makers\u00ae that the sales team sets up in every finished home. In fact, Buffett, 71, bought a Bimini model (two beds, 2.5 baths) and was ostensibly calling on his new neighbors (P.R. team in tow). More than anything, I was curious how residents who were not connoisseurs of Buffett\u2019s music had decided to embrace \u2014 quite possibly for the rest of their lives \u2014 such a particular atmosphere. \u201cWe had to downsize,\u201d Fran said. \u201cDidn\u2019t know if it would need to be assisted living. Because I\u2019m 92. People were saying that\u2019s what I need. We looked at some of the places, and you\u2019d see people playing bingo and we thought, That\u2019s not what we want to do.\u201d They happened to drive by the Margaritaville sales center and stopped in on a whim; a greeter showed them around. \u201cWell, he had a sales pitch that you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Fran went on. \u201cAnd the next thing we know, Al\u2019s in line at 3 a.m. waiting to get us a model.\u201dAl added, \u201cWe wanted to meet more people. In most subdivisions, you know the names of people on both sides and maybe across the street. We know people all over the block and where they came from and the jobs they had. There\u2019s a feeling of neighborhood that I haven\u2019t experienced since I was a kid.\u201dMore than half of Americans \u2014 young people more so than older people, in fact \u2014 report feeling that \u201cno one knows them well,\u201d a recent Cigna survey suggests. But for baby boomers, according to a new report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, the problem of social isolation has become alarming, thanks to the generation\u2019s inclination to \u201cage in place,\u201d especially in the suburbs. \u201cIn these low-density areas, it\u2019s harder to meet your neighbors by accident, by walking in the neighborhood or bumping into them at a coffee shop,\u201d Jennifer Molinsky, the study\u2019s lead author, told me. And the evidence that social ties improve health for older people is significant: A recent study by the AARP Public Policy Institute and Harvard and Stanford Universities estimated that isolation among older adults costs Medicare an additional $6.7 billion a year.All the residents I met shared Al\u2019s desire for a \u201cfeeling of neighborhood\u201d their previous homes lacked. Lana Byer, 71, moved in in April. \u201cEveryone looks out for everyone else,\u201d Byer said. \u201cThat was missing in the place I was living. Frankly, it\u2019s exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s so much better. It\u2019s a joy to get up in the morning.\u201d Byer had owned a court-reporting firm in Pittsburgh and is divorced. In other communities, she felt excluded by married couples, but that has not happened here. \u201cThere were places I\u2019ve lived where, if my daughter didn\u2019t call me, no one would know I was alive,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, they know I\u2019m alive. It\u2019s like living at a resort.\u201d That morning, she\u2019d come from a nutrition group. Later, on her way to paint wine glasses, she planned to stop by happy hour.I wondered if there was a chance that the feeling of being on a perpetual vacation would get old after a while? \u201cOnly if you do,\u201d she said.Byer is far from the only single woman in Margaritaville. Rhonda Harvey, 62, lost her husband in an accident on Interstate 4 last year. Afterward, her mother, Ethel, 85, moved in. \u201cI had 12 acres,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cNow there\u2019s almost 12 feet between here and the next house.\u201d Harvey works as the chief operating officer of a behavioral health care agency with nearly 900 employees. Ethel, who is home alone during the day, feels safer with a guardhouse and nearby neighbors. Both are from Kentucky, where one of Harvey\u2019s daughters still lives. \u201cIn some ways I think you could say the community that\u2019s intentional here is reminiscent of small towns there where that\u2019s just the way it was,\u201d she said.Harvey\u2019s career requires her to understand basic human needs. \u201cIn social work, there are three things for good mental health,\u201d she told me. \u201cSomething to do, something to love, something to hope for.\u201d Harvey plainly had the first two: she worked full time; she loved her family. But what did she hope for?\u201cThis community fully developing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing we all hope for.\u201d\u201cAl bought his autobiography,\u201d Fran said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s getting all this information.\u201dOn the surface, the state of mind Buffett advertises seems purposefully mindless: grab a drink, kick back, relax. But Al read the invitation differently. By way of explanation he gave me two poems he\u2019d written about \u201clatitude\u201d as freedom from expectation and opportunity for change; \u201cparadise\u201d was simply \u201cwhere neighbors help their neighbors/And their differences forgot.\u201dFor all their paradisal appeal, islands are also isolated. Many researchers and designers I spoke with described a future in which seniors will want to be more integrated with other age groups, not less, and the challenge will be making senior-housing communities, which exclude younger people to create an inclusive place for older people, more porous.\u201cI go to so many zoning meetings where people will say on the public record, \u2018I don\u2019t want seniors in the center of my community,\u2019\u2009\u201d Max Winters, a planner and designer at Perkins Eastman, said. Winters is in his late 20s; the co-leader of the firm\u2019s senior-housing group, Dan Cinelli, is in his mid-60s. They are encouraging their clients to share square footage with companies like day spas, restaurants and coffee shops that appeal to a wider audience. The physical spaces could be adjusted to accommodate seniors \u2014 the lighting tweaked to reduce glare on thicker glasses, the acoustics tuned for the hard of hearing \u2014 while remaining inviting to millennials, too. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more adult children wanting to visit their parents in those settings,\u201d Cinelli said. \u201cWhereas 20 years ago, it was, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll come get you and take you to a nice restaurant.\u2019 Kids and grandkids want to come because it\u2019s got a good vibe.\u201dTechnology, meanwhile, is poised to shift how and where care is delivered. At some point, automated cars will let people who are no longer able to drive remain mobile longer. Nicole Werner, an industrial and systems engineer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is preparing to pilot a social platform that would help people caring for a relative at home to organize assistance from a network of friends and relatives without having to ask for it. The software would learn routines and assign tasks automatically. \u201cIf you live in a city and you\u2019re rich, it\u2019s easy,\u201d Werner, who plans to test the platform with people living with dementia in low-income rural and urban households, told me. \u201cDisadvantaged groups have community. You can harness the people around you.\u201dStill, it will be hard to change how we value old age without changing how we value the labor needed to support it \u2014 which, right now, is being done primarily by immigrant women and women of color for starkly low pay. \u201cThe challenge is we\u2019ve mostly managed longer life spans by inventing low-wage jobs to support older adults, and that\u2019s already failing,\u201d Elana Buch, the anthropologist, says. A partial solution could be personal robots, which at most are a decade away from being able to assist older adults with tasks as delicate and varied as using the bathroom and making tea, says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Integrated Innovation Institute. \u201cThe beauty of A.I. is it\u2019s affordable by all,\u201d he says. Robots, though, are likely to reveal the degree to which we\u2019ve taken for granted the emotional connection human caregivers provide \u2014 and force us to put a price tag on it.Retailers, too, remain largely unprepared to tap this rapidly expanding market of older adults. The AgeLab at M.I.T. estimates that just 5 to 10 percent of advertising dollars are spent to reach people over 50. \u201cWe never speak of \u2018fun\u2019 with the older consumer,\u201d Joe Coughlin, the lab\u2019s director, says. \u201cBut retirement is a third of adult life.\u201dIn seeking to understand the desires, not just needs, of older consumers, Latitude Margaritaville seems ahead of the curve. In 2010, Minto, the developer, purchased the remaining buildable land in Sun City Center, Fla., one of the nation\u2019s first age-restricted retirement communities. \u201cThere were residents that had been there for 20-plus years. There are 17,000 households there,\u201d William Bullock, Minto\u2019s Latitude Margaritaville Division president, told me. \u201cIt gave us insight into where the market was headed.\u201d Once the companies announced the Latitude Margaritaville partnership, their database of interested buyers exploded to 150,000, whom they could target with digital surveys, rather than convening a handful of seniors for a focus group behind a two-way mirror. Bullock said: \u201cWe got as granular as asking, \u2018How many concerts do you want a week? Five by the pool and six by the community green.\u2019\u2009\u201d As Stuart Schultz, director of residential community relations for the Daytona site, put it, \u201cOur aim is to give them exactly what they want.\u201dBut the paradox persists: No one wants to see themselves as old, because of the stigma attached to aging, so products and communities are designed to disguise or ignore the real struggles that accompany aging, thereby reinforcing the idea that those struggles are aberrant or shameful. The residents of Margaritaville often compared their living experience to college, to the amusement of their children. But were they pretending to be young, or refusing to conform to ageist notions about who gets to enjoy what? \u201cHoney, we don\u2019t sit around and drink mint tea,\u201d Byer told her daughter, \u201cWe go to each other\u2019s homes, we dance, we bring hors d\u2019oeuvres.\u201dThe challenge will most likely be keeping these activities accessible to residents who become less mobile. \u201cNo one wants to die and no one wants to believe they won\u2019t be able to do the things they do now,\u201d Cinelli told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re in senior living and you see somebody who needs help being fed, you want them to go somewhere more appropriate. Seeing someone I used to play cards with needing help, that is fundamentally disturbing.\u201cHow do you create a world where everyone knows how to deal with a person with dementia?\u201d he went on. \u201cIf a waitstaff knew you had dementia, they don\u2019t hand you a menu. They say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got some great salmon and it has that sauce you like.\u2019 Rather than handing you a menu, and your spouse says, \u2018He can\u2019t read a menu,\u2019 and that embarrasses you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a feedback loop,\u201d Winters added. \u201cWe\u2019re not comfortable with aging because we\u2019ve relegated it to these other places. As more places do it, it does get integrated into our cultural consciousness in a way. I think it\u2019s going to transform the whole thing.\u201dThe mystery deepened as the residents themselves opened their doors to personalized interiors that bore no resemblance to the showrooms. Lana Byer favored cherry wood and floral upholstery; Karen Goodwin and her 55-year-old husband, Norm, had modular furniture and purple walls. Fran Murdock, despite her intention to downsize, couldn\u2019t part with her curio cabinets, which held among other treasures a childhood tea set with Mickey and Minnie painted on it.As we spoke in their living rooms and at their kitchen tables, they were frank about watching their own parents, grandparents and even children struggle with poor health as they got older. But until that happened to them, they said, they wanted to have fun \u2014 more than anything, that\u2019s what Margaritaville represented.When I pressed them to explain what \u201cfun\u201d meant, however, nearly all of them told me about a tiki hut that the Latitude sales team stands beneath from 9 to 5, handing out maps and bottled water; after a protracted negotiation, they had secured its use one night a week for a potluck. \u201cIt\u2019s B.Y.O.B.,\u201d Fran said. \u201cEvery time we go we meet someone new.\u201d While their carefully curated stage set was being finished, they had essentially gone rogue.In \u201cThe Death and Life of Great American Cities,\u201d Jane Jacobs dismisses planned urban utopias of the 19th century as \u201cvery nice\u201d \u2014 if \u201cyou were docile and had no plans of your own.\u201d Instead of designing to some imagined ideal, or to statistics, she writes, planners and citizens ought to study small, existing successes \u2014 a popular tiki hut, say \u2014 to understand what is \u201cmost vital\u201d to a place and its people, and build around that.In trying to imagine how today\u2019s residents might feel about Margaritaville in 20 or 30 years, I kept returning to the tiki hut, where everyone was welcome: What created that feeling, and could it last? I asked Bill and Kelley Sarantis, both 55, who live across the street from the Murdocks, why they thought the residents got along so well, when the country felt so divided outside. Did Margaritaville attract a particular type of person, or did the atmosphere of the place change those who settled there?It wasn\u2019t always harmonious, Bill said. There were people on the neighborhood Facebook page who complained \u2014 about the lack of a nearby Costco, or a scratch in their granite countertop. \u201cAnd people have said, \u2018Maybe this is not the community for you.\u2019\u201cYou focus on the lifestyle of living here, which I think is pretty incredible,\u201d he went on. \u201cSometimes in the morning I have to pinch myself. We\u2019re in a place where people all over the country are waiting in line to come. When you get older, you think about your mortality a little more than when you were younger. And I think that helps people here say, \u2018We\u2019re along for the ride, we\u2019re here to share our love and experiences.\u2019 \u201dI put Rhonda Harvey\u2019s question to them: What did they hope for? \u201cI hope not to be bored,\u201d Kelley said.\u201cNot to be alone,\u201d Bill added. So far, both wishes had come true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Beginning of the End for Poland\u2019s Populists?", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years in power, the Law and Justice party lost big in recent mayoral elections. Mr. Sierakowski is the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Warsaw and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy.WARSAW \u2014 Last weekend a coalition of opposition parties in Poland solidified the results of a stunning mayoral election season: In several major cities, including Warsaw, the opposition defeated the ruling Law and Justice party, a populist, anti-immigrant party led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s party remains in control, for now, and it has touted its tightened hold on many of the country\u2019s rural districts. But in all but the smallest cities, it is in free-fall. Even the prime minister\u2019s sister, Anna Morawiecka, who ran for mayor of the provincial town of Oborniki Slaskie, lost to an opposition candidate who defeated her with 70 percent of the vote. In total, of the 107 cities where voters choose \u201cpresidents\u201d \u2014 more or less the country\u2019s largest cities \u2014 Law and Justice won just six, and small ones at that. Although Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s Law and Justice party obtained the highest level of support \u2014 34 percent \u2014 in the elections to Poland\u2019s 16 provincial assemblies, the second-place Citizens\u2019 Coalition was only seven points behind, at 28 percent. The third- and fourth-strongest showings were also by opposition parties \u2014 the Polish People\u2019s Party, with 13 percent, and the Democratic Left Alliance, with 6.6 percent. The results show that Law and Justice can count on only roughly a third of the vote in Poland. If next year\u2019s parliamentary election were held today, the party would be pushed out of power. Whether it can come back over the next 12 months depends on how well the opposition can take advantage of the situation.In recent years Law and Justice has taken a series of antidemocratic moves to solidify its hold on power, and it was counting on a victory in these local elections to establish complete control over Poland. That is why the ruling party threw all its efforts into the campaign. Publicly supported news media, which has been completely subordinated to Law and Justice, brutally attacked the opposition throughout the campaign. It especially targeted the agrarian Polish People\u2019s Party, calling for its \u201celimination from the political scene.\u201d This attack on the Polish People\u2019s Party proved to be a grave political error. It precludes the possibility of cooperation between the two parties \u2014 effectively depriving Mr. Kaczynski of his only potential coalition partner and uniting the opposition.The entire ministerial cabinet was out on the campaign trail. The candidates promised new metro lines, or new residential developments, seemingly from thin air. Law and Justice also issued threats, even suggesting that Warsaw, the capital, would be cut off from subsidies from the national government if the city failed to elect the ruling party\u2019s candidate for mayor. At the end it resorted to the strategy that had proved successful in Hungary: raising the specter of a flood of refugees who would rape, attack and plunder Poland. But this backfired as well, boosting turnout for opposition candidates.Indeed, the opposition owes its strong showing to an exceptionally mobilized electorate. There were long lines outside of polling places for the first time since 1989. Voter turnout broke the post-1989 record, reaching 55 percent (as opposed to 47 percent four years ago).Law and Justice committed several fundamental errors. It turns out that even populism can be overdone. The ruling party\u2019s propaganda evolved into ostentatious lies. To add insult to injury, Zbigniew Ziobro, the minister of justice, ordered the Constitutional Tribunal to examine the constitutionality of European Union agreements, which many voters saw as a first step toward a potential \u201cPolexit.\u201d That might be a move from the populist playbook, but it\u2019s a mistake: Support for European integration in Poland exceeds 80 percent, the highest in Europe. It was also a mistake to designate Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki as the leader of the campaign. A former banker, he proved ineffective in connecting to voters in villages and small towns. It is difficult to overstate the ramifications of these recent elections, and Law and Justice\u2019s failure to win them. The opposition has had its first success in three years, demonstrating that it knows how to win, and now has wind in its sails.The opposition\u2019s greatest problem, until now, has been its lack of popular leaders. But these elections have given the coalition a group of rising stars. The new mayors of Warsaw and Lodz, Rafal Trzaskowski and Hanna Zdanowska, will become engines of the opposition. Even the leader of the Civic Platform party, Grzegorz Schetyna, who had been accused of lacking charisma, has demonstrated his electoral effectiveness. Law and Justice, meanwhile, lost or significantly undermined several of its leaders. Prime Minister Morawiecki appears most compromised, and it\u2019s unclear who will lead the party\u2019s political effort between now and the next vote. Moreover, the electoral calendar is highly favorable to the opposition. The elections to the European Parliament, in May 2019, will be a de facto plebiscite on the European Union. Given the E.U.\u2019s popularity, the opposition can expect to defeat Law and Justice, assuming it can present a united front. A win in those elections will give the opposition even more momentum as Poland heads toward the parliamentary elections in the fall, followed by the presidential election in 2020.Opposition politicians would like to see Donald Tusk, a former prime minister and a co-founder of Civil Platform, as their presidential candidate. He might agree \u2014 Mr. Tusk, who serves as the president of the European Council, has already announced that upon his return to Poland he \u201cdoes not intend to merely observe politics in the media.\u201dThe opposition, largely composed of liberal and center-left groups, has already succeeded in neutralizing the two issues that had given Law and Justice so much power over the past decade: boosting expensive social programs and stoking the fear of refugees. After the mayoral elections, it seems voters no longer find these issues compelling. Socialism and nationalism can lose to liberalism.The European Union has been watching the Polish elections carefully, and it is likely to throw even more support behind the pro-Europe opposition. With its large population and geographically central location, Poland is a kind of swing state that can turn the tide across Eastern Europe. If populism is defeated in Poland, maybe it can be defeated elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tiniest Ape Ever Discovered Hints at the Rise of the Monkeys", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe newly identified extinct primate weighed slightly less than an average house cat.A tiny fossilized molar found nestled in the sweltering shrub land of Kenya\u2019s Tugen Hills belonged to what may be the smallest species of ape yet discovered, according to a new study. The newly identified extinct species, Simiolus minutus, weighed only about 8 pounds, or slightly less than an average house cat.Dwarfed by today\u2019s gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans, the miniature ape was possibly a casualty of natural selection, unable to compete with colobine monkeys that dined on the same leaves in trees some 12.5 million years ago.If this were a movie, it would have to be renamed \u201cThe Rise of the Planet of the Monkeys.\u201dWhen Dr. Rossie found the molar, he and Dr. Hill realized that it looked similar to two teeth in a museum that had been collected in the 1970s and 1980s. Though they only had three teeth, Dr. Rossie said the teeth were different enough from anything else described that the pair knew they had a new species.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like finding a single crashed Martian spacecraft out in the Arizona desert,\u201d said Dr. Rossie. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to find 12 to know what that means.\u201dThe molar measured about 0.15 inches across. From the teeth, Dr. Rossie was able to extrapolate the size of the new ape\u2019s jaw and body size, which were smaller than any living or known extinct species. The smallest living ape is the gibbon which weighs between 10 and 30 pounds.\u201cNow we have a clear piece of the puzzle,\u201d said Dr. Rossie.Dr. Rossie said the finding, which took 14 years to publish, was a bittersweet tribute to his co-author and Ph.D adviser, Dr. Hill, who had developed leukemia and died in September 2015.\u201cTo be honest, there was a sense in which we didn\u2019t try very hard to finish it because working on it was a recurring reason to get together,\u201d said Dr. Rossie.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to complete the last thing that I\u2019ll ever do with him,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at the same time, it gives me a great sense of pride to have done this with him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Tuesday, the American people delivered a less dramatic verdict about the significance of the occasion.In a word: meh.Are you interested in seeing Donald Trump voted out of office in two years? I hope so \u2014 which is why you should think hard about that \u201cmeh.\u201d This week\u2019s elections were, at most, a very modest rebuke of a president reviled by many of his opponents, this columnist included, as an unprecedented danger to the health of liberal democracy at home and abroad. The American people don\u2019t entirely agree.We might consider listening to them a bit more \u2014 and to ourselves somewhat less.It also underscores that while \u201cthe Resistance\u201d is good at generating lots of votes, it hasn\u2019t figured out how to turn the votes into seats. Liberals are free to bellyache all they want that they have repeatedly won the overall popular vote for the presidency and Congress while still losing elections, and that the system is therefore \u201crigged.\u201dBut that\u2019s the system in which everyone\u2019s playing \u2014 and one they had no trouble winning in until just a few years ago. To complain about it makes them sound like whiners in a manner reminiscent of Trump in 2016, when he thought he was going to lose. It\u2019s also a reminder that, in politics, intensity is not strategy. You have to be able to convert.The Resistance didn\u2019t convert.It didn\u2019t convert when Chuck Schumer chose to make Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court the decisive political test of the year. It didn\u2019t convert when it turned his initial confirmation hearing into a circus. It didn\u2019t convert when media liberals repeatedly violated ordinary journalistic standards by reporting the uncorroborated accusations against Kavanaugh that followed Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s.I mean the rest of the Trump despisers, the people who detest not only the man but also contemn his voters (and constantly let them know it); the ones who heard the words \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d and said to themselves: Bingo. They measure their moral worth not through an effort at understanding but by the intensity of their disdain. They are \u2014 so they think \u2014 always right, yet often surprised by events.To repeat: I\u2019d hate to see that happen. I want Trump, and Trumpism, to lose. But if the Resistance party doesn\u2019t find a way to become a shrewder, humbler opposition party, that\u2019s not going to happen. The day Democrats take charge in the House would be a good opportunity to stop manning imaginary barricades, and start building real bridges to the other America.This article has been updated to reflect current numbers.

{"Headline": "Is There a Role for Tawny Port in the Digital Age?", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolFortified wines are not easy to sell nowadays. Far fewer people drink them than in their heyday, and that goes particularly for port.Both sherry and Madeira, the other two leading fortified wines, have had some semblance of a revival. But port? Not so much.I rarely drink it, maybe once a year, far less than sherry or Madeira. One reason is port\u2019s lack of versatility. It\u2019s very sweet, which makes it primarily an after-dinner drink, a category that likewise has seen much better days.Nonetheless, port remains one of the great wines, and for that reason alone it\u2019s worth investigating.This month we will examine tawny ports, which, unlike vintage ports, are ready to drink immediately. Vintage ports are bottled after two years in wood and generally must age for decades. They are produced only in years deemed exceptional, and are more expensive.Tawny port, by contrast, is made from a blend of vintages and aged for years in wood before it is released. This prolonged wood aging also gives it its tawny color.The best tawny ports are bottled with age statements \u2014 10, 20, 30 or 40 years \u2014 indicating how long they have rested in barrels. Inexpensive tawnys are aged fewer years and sometimes are simply a blend of white and ruby ports.The idea is to examine both the genre and the effects of aging, with an effort to eliminate the variables that might surface when tasting ports from multiple producers. My picks should be widely available, but if you find other producers, don\u2019t hesitate to drink those instead. The 20-year-old is not cheap, but my guess is that it will go the furthest in conveying the potential pleasures of port.These ports are not something to serve with a meal in front of the television. Their sweetness and high alcohol (20 percent) consign them to small servings, often after a meal or occasionally for an aperitif. Blue cheese is a classic with port. Or try a glass chilled as an aperitif, especially the unaged tawny.Ordinary wine glasses are fine for port, and unless you plan it as an aperitif, serve it cool, approximating cellar temperature, about 55 to 60 degrees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sherrod Brown: Rumpled, Unvarnished and Just Maybe a Candidate for President", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 One after another, the Democratic candidates in Ohio fell.But there was Senator Sherrod Brown celebrating his re-election last Tuesday night at a hotel ballroom before a crowd of anxious revelers.\u201cLet our country \u2014 let our nation\u2019s citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country \u2014 let them all cast their eyes towards the heartland,\u201d Mr. Brown said from the stage, dispelling the sense of disappointment that had begun to descend.Then, his gravelly voice rasping out a crescendo, he made it clear where he thought his party could forge its path to success: his triumphant campaign, he said, was the \u201cblueprint for America for 2020.\u201d The revelers roared.If his victory speech seemed to double as a calling card for a possible presidential run, there was good reason. Not only had Mr. Brown won his third term in this crucial battleground that President Trump claimed by eight points, he was the only major Democrat to win a statewide seat in Ohio.Almost immediately, some Democrats began to wonder if Mr. Brown possessed the secret to retaking a state that seemed to be steadily slipping from their grasp.A week later \u2014 after insisting for years that a run for president was far off his radar \u2014 Mr. Brown has begun wondering aloud if he should have the world\u2019s most important job after all.Since the election, Mr. Brown said in a telephone interview this week, he and his wife, the journalist Connie Schultz, have \u201cbeen overwhelmed by the number of people that have come forward and said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to run. You have the right message. You come from the right state.\u2019\u201dSo is he running?\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about it,\u201d he said.Rumpled and unvarnished \u2014 with a fondness for sweatshirts, less so for ties \u2014 Mr. Brown would in some ways seem uniquely positioned in a party hoping to win back the Midwestern states that flipped to Mr. Trump. Throughout his political career, he has championed populist platitudes like the \u201cdignity of work\u201d that have resonated with working-class voters in all corners of Ohio while also supporting liberal social causes like women\u2019s reproductive rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.Though he disagrees with Mr. Trump on nearly every policy issue, he is aligned with him on trade, opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement long before the president made that a central part of his own campaign.\u201cDemocrats win the White House when we have a new, fresh face who\u2019s inspiring and talking a lot about the future,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party\u2019s progressive wing.\u201cHe\u2019s a traditional Democrat,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I think in the post-Bernie era, it seems that Democratic voters want more than that.\u201dStill, some Democrats view Mr. Brown, 66, as perhaps their best option for putting Ohio and other Midwestern swing states in play: a viable, and younger, alternative to better-known potential candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Even if Ohio has become irreversibly red, some believe Mr. Brown would have a good shot at victory in other rust belt states that Mr. Trump carried, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. (Mr. Brown dislikes the term \u201crust belt\u201d and is known to send gently worded, handwritten letters to reporters if they use it.)Steve Elmendorf, a Washington political strategist and longtime Hillary Clinton supporter, said Mr. Brown would have to outshine higher-wattage candidates in the primaries, but that he has the kind of political bona fides that could appeal to a broad swath of voters.\u201cHaving that combination of authenticity, the ability to talk to working people, and the progressive credentials make him a very attractive candidate,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown first ran for public office \u2014 a seat in the Ohio legislature \u2014 after graduating from Yale in 1974. He spent days when he was not in session hanging out at union halls, which he said helped shape his views about workers.Elected to the House of Representatives in 1992, Mr. Brown quickly established himself as one of the more liberal members of his party. One of his first votes in Congress was against Nafta, cementing his reputation as an unapologetic opponent of free trade deals. In 1996, he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton would sign into law. He later voted against the Iraq war.As a senator, he has been a blunt critic of Wall Street banks and a passionate defender of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI don\u2019t buy the left or right,\u201d Mr. Brown said. He said he thought politicians could be progressive on social issues and still win in Ohio, \u201cbut you have to be authentic about whom you fight for and what you fight against. That\u2019s just who I am.\u201dThere are, of course, many other Democrats considering campaigns. But perhaps no other potential candidate had as grueling an election as Mr. Brown. Neither Senator Kamala Harris of California nor Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were up for re-election this year, using their time instead to crisscross the country supporting other candidates. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts barely had to campaign in her bid for a second term.One exception is Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic darling who waged a fierce, ultimately unsuccessful challenge in Texas for the Senate seat held by Ted Cruz. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has not mentioned running for president, but his charisma and fund-raising prowess have captured the imagination of some in his party.In the interview, Mr. Brown said he had received a groundswell of support from \u201ca pretty good cross section of Democrats,\u201d including party leaders, elected officials and activists. He declined to provide specifics.But he emphasized that any presidential preparations have been preliminary at best.\u201cI\u2019m not looking to hire people,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a planned trip to Iowa or New Hampshire.\u201d (He then quipped that he was not sure he could find a flight anyway \u201cbecause so many people running for president are flying to Iowa or New Hampshire.\u201d)\u201cWe are considering this because so many are urging us to,\u201d she wrote on Facebook this week, along with a link to an article by The Columbus Dispatch, which reported Mr. Brown\u2019s deliberations on Monday. \u201cYour thoughts are welcome.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s bruising re-election battle made it difficult for him to establish the kind of presidential campaign infrastructure that others may already have, according to a Democratic strategist briefed on his campaign.At the same time, he still has his Senate campaign staff on the payroll, affording him a cadre of operatives who could spring back into action.And while Mr. Brown was strongly considered as a possible running mate to Hillary Clinton in 2016, he has made few attempts to project himself on the national stage. Come primary season, many possible rivals would have far greater name recognition, which could hinder his ability to draw media attention and raise money.\u201cI expect to see a number of people running as if this is the Kentucky Derby with 17 stalls to fill,\u201d said Jerry Austin, a longtime Ohio political consultant who ran the Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cWould Sherrod benefit from a debate with 16 or 17 people? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if anyone benefits from that.\u201dBut across Ohio, affection for their senator runs deep. Voters recall how he has long stood up for union workers. Party officials praise his ability to connect with everyday Ohioans.\u201cHe comes back,\u201d Joe Mudra, the chair of the Richland County Democratic Party, said before an event last month in Mansfield, a former manufacturing city that is also Mr. Brown\u2019s hometown. Mr. Mudra fondly recalled playing pickup baseball in an apartment courtyard with Mr. Brown when they were young. Many in Mansfield still remember Mr. Brown\u2019s mother, a civil rights-supporting teacher, and father, a doctor.But if Mr. Brown appears to have mastered Ohio, he has indicated that he wants the Democratic Party to have a nominee who can defeat Mr. Trump. Above all, Mr. Brown said, he believes that nominee should be somebody with a \u201chistory of fighting for workers\u201d and \u201ca history of speaking to the heartland.\u201dSomebody, it seemed, like him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s P.R. Firm Brought Political Trickery to Tech", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Tim Miller, a longtime Republican political operative, moved to the Bay Area last year to set up a public relations shop, he brought with him tradecraft more typical of Washington than Silicon Valley.He was well versed in opposition research \u2014 the pursuit of damaging intelligence about a political enemy. He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy.Mr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech\u2019s biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive.Definers quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller\u2019s work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements.While working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the Trump administration.The campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley\u2019s already brass-knuckled approach to public relations.\u201cThis type of dirty P.R.? It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s definitely on the upswing,\u201d said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations representative for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. \u201cThe idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.\u201dDefiners\u2019s strategy played to a target\u2019s pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones.Definers employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled \u201cApple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators\u201d that detailed how Apple\u2019s activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times.Qualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment.The feuds among the tech industry\u2019s giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors.A campaign by Microsoft, referred to as \u201cScroogled,\u201d highlighted what it called Google\u2019s privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people\u2019s emails, a charge the internet company denied.Matt Rhoades, Definers\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the firm\u2019s work \u201cis absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.\u201dJuul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters.The ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work.And the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers.To promote clients and attack its clients\u2019 enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook.Definers and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as \u201ca master of opposition research\u201d in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK.Mr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times\u2019s report last week. \u201cWe do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,\u201d they wrote in a blog post.But Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled \u201cDigital Platform Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cDefiners manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times.This year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook.

{"Headline": "What Was Paul Manafort Thinking?", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s no good explanation for why he lied to Mueller. Mr. Litman is a former United States attorney and deputy assistant attorney general.Two months ago, he struck a plea deal with Robert Mueller, the special counsel \u2014 he pleaded guilty but agreed to provide full and truthful information in exchange for a more lenient sentence. But according to a filing by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team on Monday, Mr. Manafort lied to them repeatedly, and after multiple warnings. He is now in a far worse position than if he had never elected to cooperate, or if he had followed through on his agreement.What was he thinking? All of the available explanations for Mr. Manafort\u2019s self-destructive path seem highly implausible, at best. So which hypothesis is the least implausible?But when the time came for Mr. Manafort to turn over his cards at the first trial, he was out of aces and was convicted on multiple charges that most likely equated to a life sentence. Then, just before the second trial was set to start, he suddenly folded and agreed to terms with Mr. Mueller.Now we learn that his cooperation was squirrelly and incomplete, a series of prevarications that obviously infuriated the prosecutors, who gave him one final 10-day chance to play it straight. But he did not heed the warning and now is unlikely to ever leave prison absent a pardon from President Trump. Which leads us to:Did the president secretly promise to rescue Mr. Manafort, so long as he resisted Mr. Mueller? That would make sense of his otherwise confounding conduct. But the chain of implausibilities is long. The prospect of a pardon was always in the mix, including when Mr. Manafort made his initial decision to cooperate. For it to suffice to change his mind now, it would have to have become all the more certain. But that would entail some communication, from the president, through two intermediaries (one in the Trump camp and one in the Manafort camp) and on to Mr. Manafort in prison, where all his conversations are monitored.The perils for all those participants in such a crass scheme would be enormous. If discovered, it would mean assured conviction for witness tampering and, if any of the intermediaries was a lawyer, disbarment. For the president, it most likely would trigger impeachment, and even conviction in the Senate could not be counted out. Finally, for Mr. Manafort, it would require a measure of Mr. Trump\u2019s good faith that nobody acquainted with the president\u2019s track record could comfortably have. And it would still not shield him from near-certain prosecution for related state crimes.Some commentators have suggested that Mr. Manafort\u2019s lifetime of shady dealings with the Russian government have left him more afraid of life on the outside, where he could be vulnerable to a poison needle anytime, than of the safe confines of a federal prison. This scenario was always out of the most imaginative Le Carr\u00e9 novel, and it is the sheer unlikelihood of the other alternatives, combined with Mr. Manafort\u2019s intransigence, that makes it a contender at all. The problem with it at this point is that there\u2019s no reason to think that any of the cloak-and-dagger circumstances would have changed. If Mr. Manafort most feared the spy\u2019s comeuppance, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to cooperate, and earn a much reduced sentence, in the first place. So that hypothesis doesn\u2019t help explain Mr. Manafort\u2019s decision to double-cross Mr. Mueller.Perhaps Mr. Manafort, who has enjoyed a lifelong reputation as a swashbuckling big-time gambler, is simply a lousy poker player. He blinked when the pot got too big and opted to fold, forfeiting what he\u2019d already spent. But then some combination of unsettled resolve and a lifetime of lying as an M.O. made him hope that he could eat his cake and have it too \u2014 that he could lie his way out of the situation. This is not exactly irrational, but it is colossally stupid, particularly when playing across the table from Mr. Mueller and not knowing the cards the special counsel was holding.Those cards will now be revealed as a consequence of Mr. Manafort\u2019s dithering. He will proceed directly to sentencing, in connection with which Mr. Mueller will provide the court with detailed proof of Mr. Manafort\u2019s lies during the aborted cooperation period. As for the formerly high-flying Mr. Manafort, he has nothing left to wager with. He is, permanently, a luckless wretch, out of options and tapped out. He has become a gambler\u2019s worst nightmare.Advertisement"}

But some in China aren\u2019t buying that.Instagram may be blocked in China, but it can still make waves there. Dolce & Gabbana, the Italian luxury brand, found that out on Wednesday with stunning swiftness. It abruptly canceled a Shanghai fashion show it had been planning to hold that night as waves of online Chinese users accused Stefano Gabbana, one of the two designers of the fashion line, of being racist. They pointed to private Instagram messages from Mr. Gabbana\u2019s account that the recipient posted publicly.Zhang Ziyi, the Chinese actress best known in the West for the film \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d took the brand to task online. Two dozen models said they would pull out of the show.Dolce & Gabbana said its account and the account of Mr. Gabbana had been hacked and disavowed the messages. \u201cWe are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts,\u201d Dolce & Gabbana said on its Instagram account. \u201cWe have nothing but respect for China and the people of China.\u201dOn his account, Mr. Gabbana posted an image of the offensive comments with the words \u201cNot Me\u201d superimposed in big red letters.\u201cI love China and the Chinese culture,\u201d Mr. Gabbana said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened.\u201dThat makes it potentially dangerous territory for someone like Mr. Gabbana, who is famous for picking online feuds and in the past has used his Instagram account to make barbed attacks. He has clashed with Elton John after the fashion designer criticized in vitro fertilization, leading the pop star to create a hashtag, #boycottdolcegabbana, in response.Mr. Gabbana has called the singer Selena Gomez \u201cugly\u201d and hit back at critics of a sneaker with the phrase \u201cI\u2019m thin & gorgeous\u201d written on the side, posting, \u201cDarling, you prefer to be fat and full of cholesterol??? I think u have a problem.\u201d Most of the posts with offending comments have since been taken down.The fashion blogger Bryan Yambao, who blogs under the name BryanBoy and has over 600,000 Instagram followers, expressed skepticism about the brand\u2019s claim that it was hacked \u2014 a sentiment echoed widely online. \u201cI am having a hard time believing the notion that both social media accounts were hacked, especially when Mr. Gabbana has a proven track record of trolling everyone under the sun, from celebrities like Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez to influencers like Chiara Ferragni, both on public feed posts or on comments,\u201d he said in a message on Wednesday. Dolce & Gabbana has been the subject of boycotts so often that the company makes T-shirts inviting people to \u201c#Boycott Dolce & Gabbana,\u201d with a red heart. It is listed for $295 on the company\u2019s website. The latest online flap began with a Dolce & Gabbana ad for the Shanghai show that it posted on Instagram. It features a young Chinese woman in a glittery red dress and dangling jewelry trying to eat a cannoli with chopsticks. Traditional Chinese-sounding music plays in the background. As she flirts with the camera, a male narrator asks, \u201cIs it too huge for you?\u201dThe ad was meant to play on Italian and Chinese cultural differences. In a previous ad, the woman tried to use chopsticks to eat a pizza. But Chinese viewers who saw the cannoli ad \u2014 some overseas and some using special software to circumvent Chinese censors \u2014 found it crass and patronizing. They put screenshots online in China, where they quickly found an audience.In another message, Mr. Gabbana appeared to imply that Chinese people ate dog meat.Dolce & Gabbana said its legal offices were investigating the incidents. \u201cWhat happened today was very unfortunate not only for us, but also for all the people who worked day and night to bring this event to life,\u201d the designers said in a statement, referring to the fashion show.The controversy could be especially damaging for the fashion brand because it has made using Instagram stars in its runway shows a tent pole of its strategy to court millennials.In China, some internet users were unimpressed with the company\u2019s apology.\u201cDo you think Chinese people are three-year-olds?\u201d an Instagram user, Elainee_Hu, wrote in a comment that was liked 691 times. \u201cWe don\u2019t need your apology.

The hashtags #DGgreatshowcanceled, #DGdesigner and #DGofficial response were trending on the website.

{"Headline": "Rapper Is Jailed for 12 Days in Russia as a Culture War Spreads", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A provincial court has sentenced one of Russia\u2019s most high-profile rappers to 12 days in jail in the latest culture war skirmish about what constitutes acceptable entertainment.The court in the southern city of Krasnodar on Thursday sentenced the rapper, Dmitri Kuznetsov, 25, known as Husky, on charges of hooliganism and of refusing to take a medical test, Russian news outlets reported. His offense? Climbing atop a car after one of his concerts was canceled without explanation and treating his disappointed fans to about 30 seconds of his music.The sentence is the latest in a series of confrontations pitting rappers against law enforcement, local officials or vigilante groups who have pushed to shut down a musical genre that the authorities say promotes drug use, suicide and other social ills.It comes amid a campaign by President Vladimir V. Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church to promote family values, with ambitious officials or groups often pushing initiatives they apparently hope will attract the Kremlin\u2019s attention.Mr. Petrov wrote that the lyrics \u201cabound\u201d with \u201cobscene language, extremist turns of phrase and elicit enmity among citizens,\u201d which lead to brawls and other illegal activity.Mr. Kuznetsov\u2019s lawyer, Aleksei Avanesyan, echoed the common criticism that some officials were looking more to impress the Kremlin than to address real problems. \u201cIt is easy \u2014 you don\u2019t have to think about roads and hospitals, you can score points with simple bans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way they do it here is ban it first and then see what happens.\u201dIn the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, a vigilante group calling itself Anti-Dealer said it had worked with the police, the district attorney and the Culture Ministry to shut down the Friendzone concerts. \u201cIt is a crime against the nation to sing about drugs, same-sex love and perversion,\u201d the group said in a statement on its page on Vkontakte, a Russian version of Facebook. It called on other Russian cities to evict the group.The legal proceedings against Mr. Kuznetsov were widely criticized.Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia\u2019s leading opposition figure \u2014 whose recent protests have attracted a young demographic akin to Mr. Kuznetsov\u2019s fan base \u2014 said that the government needed to be confronted over any attempt to limit free speech.Speaking on his YouTube talk show, Mr. Navalny said that the Russian state sought to silence everyone, wanting all Russians to behave like orderly schoolchildren. The lyrics Mr. Kuznetsov had recited on the car were from a song that was not so much about taking drugs as about the conditions that lead to it, he noted, saying, \u201cThis song is about poor people who use drugs because of their poor life; they are miserable and everything is awful.\u201d\u201cGet out of my face you ghouls,\u201d he wrote.In court, Mr. Kuznetsov said that he had been forced into the position of addressing his fans in the street because they had not been allowed into the concert hall and that he had felt responsible for the canceled event.Two of his other concerts were canceled in a similarly abrupt, unexplained manner, he told the court. \u201cWe did not get any official documents or official reasons for that.\u201d The jail time could cause the rapper, who was in the middle of a 15-city tour, to miss six more concerts.The music of Mr. Kuznetsov, born in eastern Siberia, sometimes has a political edge. One song from 2011, \u201cOctober 7,\u201d which happens to be Mr. Putin\u2019s birthday, details a sumptuous feast served to a king while ordinary people endure poverty. Many view his newer songs as political just for discussing the frustrations of daily Russian life. Yet as a journalism student, Mr. Kuznetsov reportedly worked for state-controlled news media from the separatist areas of Ukraine and expressed sympathy for some of its leaders.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Instagram: @nytmacfarquharSophia Kishkovsky and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow, and Alex Marshall from London.Advertisement"}

Ms. Valencia was always inviting relatives who had recently immigrated from the Philippines to stay; Chad said that at one point there were nine people living in the family\u2019s two-bedroom apartment.Most importantly, Ms. Valencia \u2014 who is from Pampanga, often hailed as the culinary capital of the Philippines \u2014 cooked a large, hearty breakfast, a meal that has special significance in Filipino culture, the brothers said, because of that country\u2019s rich agricultural past, when farmworkers ate substantial meals in the morning to get through the day.Chad, 33, and Chase, 34, remember waking up on weekends when they were teenagers to the smell of garlic and the sound of fried eggs popping on the stove. \u201cChase! Chad! Dad!\u201d Ms. Valencia would yell. \u201cMangan tana!\u201d (Kapampangan for \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d) They\u2019d sit down to longaniza, a type of sweet sausage; silog, or garlic rice with eggs; fried eggs; and pan de sal, a sweet yeasted roll.\u201cFilipino food became part of our DNA,\u201d Chad said. \u201cWe crave it.\u201dBut long before Lasa, one of the brothers\u2019 first experiences of how Filipino cuisine could mingle with their American setting was Thanksgiving \u2014 and the morning after, when the two would make a hybrid Filipino-American breakfast out of leftovers.The Valencia family Thanksgiving takes place at a different relative\u2019s house in California each year, with more than 20 people. The spread incorporates a few traditional Thanksgiving dishes \u2014 honey-roasted ham, turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing \u2014 into a typical Filipino holiday meal: sopas (a creamy chicken soup), rice and pan de sal. The brothers\u2019 favorite addition is asado, a salty, sour, complex dish of pork shoulder slowly cooked in tomato sauce, garlic, bay leaf and calamansi, a small citrus fruit native to the Philippines.After dinner, most of the guests sleep over, mainly so that they can partake in the brothers\u2019 morning feast: breakfast sandwiches stuffed with leftover asado (or turkey, or ham), and silog topped with turkey and gravy.\u201cAt first it was just Chad, throwing an egg into the leftover meat, making sandwiches, and finishing them in the oven,\u201d Chase said. \u201cAnd then we were all like, \u2018This is dope.\u2019\u201dEvery family member has developed a specific preference. Chase mixes the asado and its accompanying sauce into the eggs, like a scramble, to become the base of the sandwich. Chad crowns his with a fried egg, and then pops the yolk to let it seep into the top of the roll.As with the breakfast sandwiches, there are no hard-and-fast rules for the silog, except when it comes to the egg. \u201cIt has to be a little runny,\u201d so the yolk can saturate the grains of rice, Chase said. \u201cNo over medium or over hard. That ain\u2019t Filipino.\u201dThe morning after Thanksgiving in the Valencia household is always chaotic. No one sits at the table, or wakes at the same time. The sandwiches are made in waves, along with a huge batch of silog. The brothers usually devour theirs at the stove, bits of egg and sauce spilling onto the kitchen floor.\u201cWe were so scattered and stressed out,\u201d Chad said of the dinner, mainly because he and his brother wanted to impress their mother.What she really missed, though, was the morning-after breakfast. Because Thanksgiving was at the restaurant, everyone went home after dinner and the brothers didn\u2019t get the chance to make their sandwiches and silog. But they are hosting at Lasa again this year and are determined to restart the tradition.Perhaps they could split the family members between their homes, they wondered aloud, or everyone could just return to the restaurant in the morning.Or as Chad suggested, with complete sincerity, \u201cMaybe everyone has to just sleep over here at Lasa!\u201dAn earlier version of this article and an accompanying picture caption omitted an ingredient in silog. The garlic rice dish contains eggs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Journalist\u2019s Expulsion Casts Shadow on Hong Kong\u2019s Future", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Hong Kong decided in late July to invite an obscure political activist to speak at the elegant 19th-century building that is its home, there was a vague sense among its board that the move might upset some people.\u201cI would say it is the biggest mistake the Hong Kong government has ever made,\u201d said Fu Hualing, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, of the decision to expel Victor Mallet, the Asia news editor of The Financial Times. \u201cIt has a huge impact. I don\u2019t know whether it was intended or not, but it has been felt everywhere.\u201dThe controversy has also focused global attention on the cause of Hong Kong independence, which the authorities badly want to suppress, and on the divided allegiances of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders, who are supposed to serve the city and defend its special status but owe their jobs to the Communist government in Beijing.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has dismissed as \u201cpure speculation\u201d what almost everyone in Hong Kong has concluded \u2014 that Mr. Mallet\u2019s forced departure was an act of retaliation signaling a new limit on political speech. Yet, she has offered no other explanation.\u201cI am responsible to the Hong Kong S.A.R. and the people,\u201d she said, referring to the city\u2019s status as a special administrative region. \u201cI am also accountable to the central people\u2019s government.\u201dMost people in Hong Kong had never heard of Mr. Chan or his Hong Kong National Party when the government proposed outlawing the group. \u201cThe only reason we initially thought of inviting this 28-year-old interior designer was actually that he was in the news,\u201d Florence de Changy, the French journalist who is the president of the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club, wrote in its magazine.With its restaurants, bar and meeting rooms, the club has been a fixture amid Hong Kong\u2019s skyscrapers since the colonial era. Though most members are now lawyers, bankers and other professionals, journalists run the organization and host events featuring speakers from a variety of backgrounds.Days after Mr. Chan\u2019s talk was announced, two officials from the Chinese Foreign Ministry visited the club and met with Mr. Mallet, who was acting as president because Ms. de Changy was out of town. They objected to the event and told him they wanted it canceled.In more than a dozen posts in the following days, he criticized the club\u2019s leaders and urged scrutiny of what he called a \u201cspecial deal\u201d that allowed the club to rent its building from the government at discounted rates.Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and former cabinet minister, said that was unlikely. But she acknowledged Mr. Leung \u201cmight feel he should have served on, and his career was truncated.\u201d Under such circumstances, she said, \u201cit\u2019s hard for him to refrain from commenting.\u201dMs. Ip added that most establishment politicians in Hong Kong shared Mr. Leung\u2019s view of the club\u2019s invitation. \u201cTaken together, that could have an impact on our government\u2019s decision,\u201d she said.But Ms. Lam publicly contradicted her predecessor by saying the club paid market rent. And while she criticized the decision to host Mr. Chan as \u201ccompletely unsuitable,\u201d she declined to endorse Mr. Leung\u2019s demand that the speech be canceled.On Aug. 14, with protesters outside the club, the event went ahead. \u201cThe nature of China is oppression,\u201d Mr. Chan declared.Then, in the first week of October, the government rejected a routine request to renew Mr. Mallet\u2019s work visa. The decision stirred fears because Hong Kong had never expelled a journalist before \u2014 and because the move came straight from Beijing\u2019s playbook.In recent years, local media outlets have come under some pressure to censor themselves, but foreign news organizations using Hong Kong as a regional hub \u2014 including The Financial Times, The New York Times and CNN \u2014 have largely been immune. Mr. Mallet\u2019s expulsion, however, could change that.\u201cThey have moved the goal posts,\u201d said Zoher Abdoolcarim, the former Asia editor for Time International.The decision has also cast a shadow over Hong Kong\u2019s future as a capital of international finance and commerce, with some in the business community saying privately that it could tip the balance for companies already being wooed to relocate to Singapore.None of the big banks and law firms in Hong Kong have spoken out about the expulsion. The silence can be attributed in part to hope that new pressure on foreign journalists will not affect foreign companies. But there is also reluctance to say anything that may put business in China at risk.\u201cWithout a free press, capital markets cannot properly function, and business and trade cannot be reliably conducted,\u201d she said.The Financial Times is appealing the visa decision. That could compel the government to provide an explanation, said Robert Tibbo, an immigration and human rights lawyer.He noted that President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines recently visited Hong Kong despite accusations that he has led a campaign of extrajudicial killings. \u201cAre they using the same considerations for Mr. Mallet?\u201d Mr. Tibbo asked.Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, made his concerns about Hong Kong independence clear during a visit to the city last year, when he warned that challenging the authority of the central government was \u201cabsolutely impermissible.\u201dManagement of Hong Kong affairs is usually handled by another member of the Politburo, but Mr. Xi seems to have taken the lead in setting policy, as he has on most major issues in China.Tian Feilong, executive director of a research institute on Hong Kong policy in Beijing, said the territory must be more humble and accept that it is like other local governments in China.\u201cIn the \u2018new era\u2019 of China,\u201d he said, referring to one of Mr. Xi\u2019s slogans, \u201cHong Kong must follow the main strategy of China.\u201d He added, \u201cThis requires Hong Kong to change its original proud attitude.\u201dSupport for Hong Kong independence was largely unheard of a few years ago. Newspapers that backed or were controlled by Beijing were the first to use the phrase frequently, deploying it as an epithet to attack the pro-democracy opposition, said Ying-ho Kwong, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Hong Kong studying local politics.Students have been posting signs backing independence on university campuses, where polls show support is much higher.Last month, after Hong Kong Polytechnic University covered up a few pro-independence posters and stickers, three students staged a hunger strike and more than 2,000 others signed a statement of protest. Two days later, the university allowed students to regain control of the space where the posters were hung, known as the Democracy Wall.\u201cFreedom of expression is one of the things that has always separated Hong Kong from China,\u201d said Lam Wing-hang, 21, president of the student union and one of the hunger strikers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Hong Kong become just another mainland city.\u201dJavier C.

You gonna vote for that?\u201dICE does seem to have a bad culture, but it is not the K.K.K. At the same time, I don\u2019t think the Democratic Party is just for open borders. Alas, though, I\u2019m also not sure what exactly is the party\u2019s standard on immigration \u2014 and questions like Harris\u2019s leave it open to demonization.Since Republicans have completely caved to Trump\u2019s craven exploitation of immigration as a wedge issue, the country, as usual, needs the Democrats to be the adults and put forward a realistic, comprehensive approach to immigration, which now requires two parts.They have been the renewable energy source of the American dream \u2014 and our secret advantage over China.This is how we got to where we are today: During the 19th and 20th centuries, the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation-states. And the 50 years after World War II were a great time to be a weak little nation-state.All of that switched in the early 21st century: Climate-driven extreme weather \u2014 floods, droughts, heat and cold \u2014 on top of man-made deforestation began to hammer many countries, especially their small-scale farmers. This happened right as developing-world populations exploded. Africa went from 140 million in 1900 to one billion in 2010 to a projected 2.5 billion by 2050.Meanwhile, the internet has enabled citizens to easily compare their living standards with those in Paris or Phoenix \u2014 and find a human trafficker to take them there. Also, China joined the W.T.O., dominating low-wage industries, and the end of the Cold War meant no superpower wanted to touch your country, because all it would win was a bill.Together, they\u2019re creating vast zones of disorder, and many people want to get out of them into any zone of order, particularly America or Europe, triggering nationalist-populist backlashes.But not only. I was in Argentina last month and am in Peru now; in both countries I found people worried about the refugee flows from Venezuela. Peru has taken in 600,000, and it\u2019s beginning to stir resentment here among lower socio-economic classes. The story added, \u201cThe UN \u2014 whose migration agency has warned that the continent faces a refugee \u2018crisis moment\u2019 similar to that seen in the Mediterranean in 2015 \u2014 is setting up a special team to co-ordinate the regional response. \u2026 More than half a million Venezuelans have crossed into Ecuador this year alone and more than a million have entered Colombia in the past 15 months.\u201dThere are now more climate refugees, economic migrants searching for work and political refugees just searching for order than at any point since World War II, nearly 70 million people according to the International Rescue Committee, and 135 million more in need of humanitarian aid.And this has to be a global project, with the U.S., Europe, India, Korea, China, Russia, Japan all contributing. Otherwise the world of order is going to be increasingly challenged by refugees from the world of disorder, and all rational discussions of immigration will go out the window.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time for Angela Merkel to Leave", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe German chancellor has done an admirable job over her 13 years in office. But her stoic pragmatism is out of step with the times.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.BERLIN \u2014 What a springtime for Germany\u2019s conservatives this fall has been. The Christian Democratic Union, the leading center-right party, should be suffering: After months of infighting with other conservatives, followed by steep losses in state elections, its leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel, announced that she was stepping down from her post as the party\u2019s longtime chairwoman. Instead, it is enjoying an internal revival. Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision has set off a race to replace her \u2014 three contenders will vie to head the party at a conference in Hamburg on Dec. 8. And for once, the race is about more than power, politics and personalities \u2014 it is about ideas.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ms. Merkel, has a slight lead in the polls. But she is being strongly opposed by Jens Spahn, a younger stalwart conservative who believes that the party has moved too far to the center, and Friedrich Merz, who wants the party to embrace more of a free-market platform. The energy generated by the race has made Ms. Merkel\u2019s situation clear. Though she won re-election last year, it is getting harder to imagine her staying in the chancellorship until 2021. She has done Germany a lot of service in her 13 years as the country\u2019s leader. Her final act of service should be to step down as chancellor in the next few months.For over a year now, German conservatives have been coming to grips with the intellectual dead end into which Ms. Merkel led them, and the country. Seemingly stalwart during times of calm, Ms. Merkel has shown a depressing lack of talent to speak convincingly to her people at a time when Germans are increasingly at odds with each other. The refugee crisis, the rise of the far right, growing inequality \u2014 on the most pressing issues of the last five years, Ms. Merkel has been complacent.Once a great manager of problems caused by others, Ms. Merkel has failed to show the same capacity for solving problems arising from her own decisions. Perhaps, years ago, she might have. But while the radical right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany grew stronger, even outflanking Ms. Merkel\u2019s party in her home state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the chancellor\u2019s erstwhile best quality \u2014 stoicism \u2014 has flipped into its unhealthy cousin: leadership fatigue.If the chancellor had invested similar energy into the handling of the refugee crisis after 2015 as she had put into the handling of the euro crisis seven years before, Germany certainly would not have ended up as the polarized society it is today. When it came to addressing domestic issues, hers was a populism of silence.The latest example of this public diplomacy laziness was the way Ms. Merkel dealt with the events this summer in the eastern city of Chemnitz. In late August, a 35-year-old local man was stabbed to death by an asylum seeker. The event sparked protests by right-wing extremists and rioting. A Jewish-owned restaurant was attacked, and police later arrested members of a suspected right-wing terrorist cell with possible links to the events.Yet Ms. Merkel waited almost three months before she paid a visit to Chemnitz. When she finally decided to meet locals last week, one citizen summed up her comments by comparing them to way the last leader of communist East Germany, Erich Honecker, had spoken to the people: \u201cJust blah blah.\u201dMs. Merkel similarly stumbled over her government\u2019s decision to endorse the United Nations Global Compact for Migration, which calls on signatories to help migrants integrate into their societies while also improving conditions in the migrants\u2019 home countries. It is a defensible position, but also one that, Ms. Merkel\u2019s advisers said, could easily be twisted and exploited by populists (and one that even some Christian Democrats disagreed with). Rather than using the position as an opportunity to rally her party and the country, Ms. Merkel did next to nothing to explain her agreement to the document. Predictably, the Alternative for Germany Party ignited a fiery debate in the German Parliament on the issue, leaving members of Ms. Merkel\u2019s party to struggle, leaderless.Why does Ms. Merkel fail to see that unusual times need unusually good rhetoric? Why does she not offer decisive leadership when voters turn to radicals, who offer easy answers? One reason might be that the chancellor has become a victim of an unusually broad popularity; for almost a decade, she was hailed worldwide as the de facto leader of Europe. At home, she enjoyed a cozy relationship with the two groups who should normally be holding her to account, the press and the center-left Social Democrats, who have spent most of her term as the junior partner in a coalition with the Christian Democrats.During the euro crisis, then later during the Ukraine conflict and the refugee crisis, almost all the important media outlets cheered Ms. Merkel. While the applause was mostly justified in substance, it was unhealthy for the structures of democracy. It left the impression that the establishment, whether in media or politics, thought alike, an impression that over time strengthened the political fringe. As more and more Germans vented their discontent on social networks, as the country got louder and louder, the chancellor kept her voice low \u2014 furthering the notion that she just shrugged at critics.It\u2019s a common secret in Berlin that Ms. Merkel felt obligated to stand for another term in the last year\u2019s general elections. Had it not been for the election of Donald Trump and the growing threat to multilateralism, she might have preferred to stand down sooner. Noble as her motives might have been, a sense of duty is not a sufficient motivation to run a country. Others in her party \u2014 first and foremost Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, whom Ms. Merkel would certainly prefer as her successor \u2014 have the passion, the prudence and the talent for communication the country needs know. Ms. Merkel can feel safe leaving the ship.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "OpinionA recently disabled New York City photographer gets an education in the discrimination that people like him must face. Supported byI\u2019m a documentary photographer who was raised in California and now lives in New York, and I sometimes feel I\u2019ve already lived two lives \u2014 but not because of the changes in geography I\u2019ve experienced. A little more than two years ago, when I was 23, I suffered a spinal cord injury while cliff diving on the Yuba River in Northern California. In a matter of seconds, I became disabled. I was mostly paralyzed from the waist down, and began using a wheelchair. The doctors could not guarantee that I would walk again, but I persevered. A year later, I had regained some ability to move. I did not regain feeling in the lower half of my body, but I could walk again.That was when I moved to New York to attend school. The layout of the city pushed me to walk even more. I walked so much that the skin on one of my heels wore completely away (I still lacked the feeling to realize I had injured myself), and the doctor ordered me back to the wheelchair until my foot healed.I decided I would make the best of it by shooting photographs that would show people what New York looks like from a wheelchair. It started as a fun project, but it quickly evolved into something more when I began to notice how people treated me when I was in the chair.Many people out on the streets would automatically assume I was homeless, or that I was about to ask for money. Some would turn away from me; some would gawk. While some people showed me consideration and kindness, many did not. I found that when you are in a wheelchair in public, there\u2019s rarely a middle ground. There\u2019s never normalized space in that moment, or more generally, in society. I wanted to capture those moments in these photographs.One of my first days back in the chair, I decided to roll down Houston Street to meet a friend for coffee. It was a beautiful fall day. Autumn has always been my favorite time of the year; I feel the happiest then. I wanted to check the time on my phone, but it was out of power, so I rolled up to a young, well-dressed couple, a man and a woman, on the corner of Houston and Second Avenue. Looking up, I made eye contact with the man. His expression suddenly changed. He grasped the woman by the arm and moved away from me, muttering, \u201cSorry, we don\u2019t have any money.\u201dI grabbed my wheels and brought myself to a halt. In that moment I didn\u2019t notice the trees with their yellow and red leaves. I didn\u2019t notice the crisp air or the small white clouds in the blue sky or the colorful murals on the buildings. I noticed my cold hands. I noticed that my head hurt. I noticed nerve pain pulsing through my legs.On the platform during rush hours, packed trains roll into the station, while dozens of riders crowd in front of the doors, waiting to cram themselves into a car. I am often unable to force my wheelchair into the mass of standing people. On many days, I wait for two or three trains before finding one that has space for me in the car. Once I\u2019m inside people surround me from all angles. My view consists of elbows, buttocks, feet and hands clutching phones. Faces are mostly out of sight. Sometimes it feels as though my previous life was a dream. I can barely remember what it was like to be able-bodied. The outline remains, but the details are missing.

{"Headline": "Russians Meddling in the Midterms? Here\u2019s the Data", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey haven\u2019t stopped trying to influence our elections. Indeed, they may be busier than ever.Mr. Morgan and Mr. Fox run a cybersecurity company.Since the 2016 United States presidential election, which Russian operatives influenced through a coordinated campaign of disinformation on social media, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to address the problem. Thousands of \u201csock puppet\u201d personas with hundreds of thousands of followers have been taken down on Facebook, for example, and cannot easily be rebuilt. Twitter has reduced the risk that propaganda is spread through automated accounts, or bots.Such efforts may be helping. The consensus among researchers monitoring the 2018 midterm elections is that there has been less of the specific sort of interference the Russians engaged in two years ago, when they attempted to aggravate social tensions in the United States and foster distrust of our democratic institutions.But an analysis by Kris Shaffer, a senior analyst for our cybersecurity company, suggests that while these measures may have rendered some of the Russian tactics of 2016 less effective, they haven\u2019t fully stopped Russian influence operations. In many instances, they seem to have merely caused Russia to shift or develop new tactics.Indeed, our company is currently detecting more overall activity in real time from continuing Russian online influence operations targeting the midterm elections than has been disclosed by social media platforms or detected by researchers during the same period before the election in 2016.In the past month, our researchers have collected more than 26 million social media posts concerning the 2018 midterms. This data set includes a large portion of all relevant content on Twitter as well as a smaller targeted sample of all relevant content on Facebook.We have also identified more than 400 websites that our analysis indicates are likely to be Russian propaganda outlets aimed at American audiences. More than 100 of these websites we have confirmed as under the direction of the Russian government or we believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence.In the month of October alone, we tracked 110,000 social media posts that referenced a United States midterm candidate, topic or hashtag and contained a link to one of these websites. More than 10,000 of these posts contained a link to one of the websites we have either confirmed as Russian-directed or believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence.The top three websites linked to these social media posts are the site of RT, Russia\u2019s state-financed international cable network (5,275 links); The Duran, a right-wing news and opinion site (1,328 links); and Sputnik, a news and commentary site run by the Russian government (1,148 links).We have also identified 1,451 social media posts aimed specifically at midterm voters from social media accounts assessed with high confidence as belonging directly to Russian influence operations. These posts are largely focused on the geopolitics of the Middle East, the Saudi-assassinated journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh.Last month, the most-shared article of known Russian origin for the month on Twitter was an article from The Duran purporting to show how groups financed by the billionaire Democratic fund-raiser George Soros \u201cplotted with Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to eliminate conservative \u2018right wing propaganda.\u2019\u201dThe Russia-linked social media accounts were active during the Kavanaugh hearings, drawing attention to sexual and domestic abuse allegations against various 2018 Democratic candidates and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. They have been amplifying anti-immigrant sentiment, including conspiracy theories about the caravan of migrants in Central America, and have promoted the idea that the mail-bomb campaign of the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc Jr. was a Democratic plot.Because of the numerous changes since 2016 in social media platforms and propaganda-detection practices, a straight \u201capple to apples\u201d comparison of 2016 and the current election cycle is not possible. And no analysis of the social media landscape is ever complete because no one has access to all the data.But any significant detectable quantity of Americans who are unwittingly sharing Russian propaganda on their social networks is cause for concern. And based on activity that our analysis attributes to Russian government efforts, we estimate that at least hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of United States citizens have engaged with the content of Russian propaganda online. The consensus among academic researchers and Russia experts in the intelligence community is that Russia does not take a timeout from information battles. It considers itself to be in a constant state of information warfare. Its online influence operations are inexpensive and effective, and afford Russia an asymmetric advantage given the freedoms of expression afforded to Western democracies.We are heartened by the seriousness with which many social media platforms and government agencies are treating this situation. But while progress has been made since 2016, we must remain vigilant in the face of confirmed Russian efforts to undermine our democracy.Jonathon Morgan is the chief executive and Ryan Fox is the chief operating officer of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company that monitors disinformation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The President\u2019s Congressional Lap Dogs", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHouse and Senate Republicans are using their investigatory powers to wreck the reputations of anyone who asks tough questions about the Trump campaign and Russia.Mr. Fritsch is a founder of the research firm Fusion GPS.Since the founding of the Republic, Congress has acted as a check on overreach by presidents and their administrations. But history will judge the current Congress as remarkable for its aggressive protection of President Trump.The Republicans who lead key House and Senate committees have used their subpoena powers to harass administration critics, undermine the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collaboration with Russia in 2016 and help the president\u2019s lawyers create an alternative narrative.In so doing, they have perverted Congress\u2019 traditional role as a guarantor of law enforcement that is independent from White House interference.Congress owes much of its investigatory might to a 1927 Supreme Court decision in the Teapot Dome bribery scandal. President Warren Harding\u2019s interior secretary was caught leasing government oil reserves in return for bribes. Attorney General Harry Daugherty, however, refused to investigate the crimes. Congress wanted to know whether Daugherty\u2019s brother and the Ohio bank he ran had documents that shed light on the illicit payments. But Daugherty\u2019s brother refused to testify.The current Congress, and the House Judiciary Committee in particular, has flipped that power on its head, using its authority to conduct hostile interrogations of Justice Department prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who were simply doing their jobs and following evidence where it led them in the Russia inquiry. The Republicans have also demanded to know why the Justice Department has refused to comply with President Trump\u2019s demands to shut down the investigation \u2014 an inquiry that has secured multiple indictments and guilty pleas.We have nothing to hide. But we will not be drawn into a rigged game based on a playbook borrowed from the McCarthy era.During that dark chapter of American history, Senator Joseph McCarthy abused the awesome powers won during Teapot Dome to smear hundreds of American servicemen, civil servants and ordinary citizens through secret proceedings, selective leaks and crass bullying. He also branded those who invoked their constitutional rights not to testify as \u201cFifth Amendment Communists.\u201d These disgraceful tactics ended in McCarthy\u2019s own disgrace after he was censured by the Senate in 1954.Republicans have used this practice to wreck reputations and careers. They have gratuitously exposed the private lives of dedicated civil servants. They have deprived Americans of some of the nation\u2019s most dogged, experienced crime fighters, falsely accusing whistle-blowers of criminal wrongdoing and mocking their invocation of constitutional rights.In other words, a sworn officer of the court reported a possible crime in progress to another sworn officer of the court, knowing full well that to do so falsely is a crime. But Republicans assert that his information should be rejected merely because that former Justice Department official had gone to work for Democrats. The work of my firm must be similarly poisoned, committee Republicans seem to think, because we too worked for Democrats. (Conveniently, they ignore the fact that we began our work on Mr. Trump for a Republican client.)No Americans should be compelled to participate in efforts to falsely implicate themselves, the national security professionals protecting our country, or ordinary citizens practicing their First Amendment rights. We hope the next Congress puts country before party and focuses on the real villain of 2016: the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin.Peter Fritsch is a founder, with Glenn Simpson, of the research firm Fusion GPS.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Menial Tasks, Slurs and Swastikas: Many Black Workers at Tesla Say They Faced Racism", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "African-American workers have reported threats, humiliation and barriers to promotion at the plant. The automaker says there is no pattern of bias.Supported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 Owen Diaz had seen swastikas in the bathrooms at Tesla\u2019s electric-car plant, and he had tried to ignore racist taunts around the factory.\u201cYou hear, \u2018Hey, boy, come here,\u2019 \u2018N-i-g-g-e-r,\u2019 you know, all this,\u201d said Mr. Diaz, who is African-American. Then, a few hours into his shift running the elevators, he noticed a drawing on a bale of cardboard. It had an oversize mouth, big eyes and a bone stuck in the patch of hair scribbled over a long face, with \u201cBooo\u201d written underneath.On that winter night in the factory, when, he said, a supervisor admitted drawing the figure as a joke, Mr. Diaz had had enough. He typed a complaint to a Tesla manager on his phone. \u201cRacist effigy & drawing\u201d was the subject.\u201cWhen you really just look at it, you ask yourself at some point, \u2018Where is my line?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Diaz, 50, who worked at the factory as a contractor for 11 months before he quit in May 2016.It is a line that others say they reached, too.Interviews, internal communications and sworn legal statements filed by more than two dozen current or former Tesla employees and contractors describe a wide range of concerns among some African-American workers at the factory in Fremont, including threats by co-workers, demeaning assignments and barriers to advancement. Three lawsuits by former workers accusing Tesla of failing to curb racial discrimination and harassment have been filed since early last year, including one by Mr. Diaz awaiting trial.Tesla rejects the workplace portrait painted in the complaints as inaccurate, saying there is no evidence to support \u201ca pattern of discrimination and harassment.\u201d It is not the only automaker to face allegations of racism in recent years, and it acknowledges that \u201cin a company the size of a small city, there will at times be claims of bad behavior,\u201d real or false. But it said there was no indication that the factory had an unusual rate of complaints.\u201cWe strive to provide a respectful work environment for all employees and do our best to prevent bad conduct,\u201d the company said. African-American employees at various levels of authority, made available by Tesla, said their own experiences had been positive.Crystal Spates, a production manager overseeing 500 people building the Model 3, said racial slurs were not tolerated at the factory. \u201cI have never heard, myself, anyone use that terminology,\u201d said Ms. Spates, 30, who is African-American and joined Tesla two years ago.Mr. Diaz, like Tesla itself, likened the plant to a small city \u2014 one in which experiences can vary, he said. \u201cYou know, you can have something that happens in one part of the city that doesn\u2019t happen in another part,\u201d he said. But when his son encountered racial slurs and caricatures in a different part of the factory, Mr. Diaz concluded that the issue was not an isolated one.One suit accusing Tesla of racial discrimination and harassment, filed last November in California Superior Court, seeks class-action status. The lawyers involved \u2014 Lawrence A. Organ and Bryan Schwartz, whose practices focus on workplace rights \u2014 say they have identified dozens of potential plaintiffs. Each lawyer has won multimillion-dollar judgments in other harassment or discrimination cases against major employers. Tesla is seeking to move the case into arbitration, which would require workers to bring individual lawsuits rather than a joint claim.The state\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing says it has issued 10 \u201cright to sue\u201d letters \u2014 a precondition for a discrimination lawsuit \u2014 to employees complaining of racial bias at the Fremont plant. Dozens of other complaints against Tesla are pending, but the agency would not say how many involved race.In an email to employees last year, which the company later released in response to one of the lawsuits, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, warned against \u201cbeing a huge jerk\u201d to members of \u201ca historically less represented group.\u201d At the same time, he wrote, \u201cif someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology.\u201dBut by many accounts, the issues at the Tesla factory go beyond the need for a thick skin.In any case, some African-American workers who expected to help build a future for the company and themselves, like Teshawna Stewart, say the reality proved to be a slap in the face.Before starting at Tesla last year, Ms. Stewart, 25, sorted and packed orders at a nearby Amazon warehouse.The job she landed installing taillights at the Tesla factory paid several dollars an hour more. But she discovered a downside when she was assigned to \u201cthe brick,\u201d the production area for Model 3 sedans.During several weeks when the Model 3 production line was not yet operating, Ms. Stewart said, she was frequently assigned to menial tasks, while workers of other races did work like sorting components.In a sworn statement for a lawsuit, she said that when she had complained about \u201cAfrican-American employees being required to get down on our hands and knees and scrub the floor,\u201d a human resources representative told her that she was \u201cmaking up stories.\u201dTesla said Ms. Stewart \u201cdid not raise these types of claims during her employment.\u201d Ms. Spates, the production manager, said assembly workers were expected to handle other tasks if production was interrupted, but \u201cnothing in terms of \u2018get on your hands and knees.\u2019\u201d She does not recall working with Ms. Stewart.In May, Ms. Stewart was fired for \u201cjob abandonment,\u201d she said, after her team was assigned to a job in San Francisco for the day to help prepare cars for shipment to China. Tesla said she had been fired because she failed to return to the factory and had been given written warnings about her attendance. She said she had returned with the other workers, who were not African-American, and was the only one fired.Like Ms. Stewart, Nigel Jones arrived at Tesla with high hopes. He was fresh out of the Army when he started as a temporary battery technician at Tesla in September 2015. Mr. Jones, now 26, quickly found the kind of rapid professional mobility often out of reach without a college degree. In about 22 months, he went from being an $18-an-hour contractor to making $85,000 a year as a mobile-equipment supervisor.Then, on a busy afternoon in January during the ramp-up of Model 3 production, Mr. Jones said, he stopped to help two other African-American workers set up a water cart. A new manager questioned the group, and after Mr. Jones assured him that he had everything \u201cunder control,\u201d the manager turned and muttered a vulgar racial epithet within 10 feet of the group, Mr. Jones recalled. His recollection was affirmed by a current employee who said he had witnessed it; he asked not to be identified.Though he tried to \u201clet that go,\u201d Mr. Jones soon put a post on Facebook about growing tired of \u201csubtle racial discrimination\u201d at work. His mother said Mr. Jones had also told her about the incident two to three weeks later, shortly before he was fired.Tesla said Mr. Jones had been \u201creprimanded numerous times for attendance and safety violations\u201d and given a \u201cfinal written warning\u201d before being fired for attendance problems.Mr. Jones denied having had attendance problems, attributing that account to the manager with whom he tangled. He looks back with regret that the prospect of a bright future didn\u2019t pan out.\u201cTesla, it is a cool company,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cYou sit there and you\u2019re like, \u2018This can\u2019t be happening here.\u2019\u201dDeWitt Lambert, an African-American electrician, was not quite 40 when he left home in Mobile, Ala., in 2012 and drove to California in search of a job. Tesla hired him in June 2015 as a production associate, mostly installing seatbelts.Soon, he said, he encountered co-workers mocking his Southern drawl. He started to wear headphones to drown them out, but when the occasional taunts turned to frequent racial slurs, he said, they were hard to ignore.The company granted his request to change stations, but his tormentors started lingering near his new spot, he told officials, and he worried that they \u201care going to do something to me.\u201dBetween June 2016 and February 2017, Mr. Lambert sent at least a dozen text messages, emails, photos and videos to human resources, copies show.The evidence sent by Mr. Lambert included a 58-second cellphone video, punctuated by repeated racial slurs, in which an unidentified narrator walking the factory floor says it\u2019s \u201cDeWitt\u2019s\u201d phone and threatens to \u201ccut you up \u2026 so everybody can have a piece of you, nigger.\u201d He said it had been recorded by co-workers who took his phone and meant it as a threat.Feeling that he had a potential civil rights claim, he consulted a lawyer about legal options, and filed a complaint with the state fair-employment agency.Tesla\u2019s general counsel, Todd Maron, wrote in March 2017 with an offer to settle.\u201cWe are willing to pay Mr. Lambert $100,000, but only if we are to resolve this matter before there is media attention,\u201d Mr. Maron wrote in an email provided by Mr. Lambert\u2019s lawyer.Attached was a four-page document outlining information the company had collected to undermine Mr. Lambert\u2019s claims. \u201cOur C.E.O., Elon Musk, has reviewed this case personally and notwithstanding everything that\u2019s in the attached document, he is sorry that this case did not get escalated much sooner and he agrees that change is needed,\u201d the email stated.Mr. Lambert, who declined the settlement offer in favor of a chance to take the claim to trial and argue for higher damages, was put on paid administrative leave.In June, after Tesla succeeded in moving the case to arbitration, Mr. Lambert received a letter terminating his employment, saying the company had discovered acts \u201cinconsistent with Tesla\u2019s values.\u201d Tesla said Mr. Lambert himself had been involved in \u201cinstigating use of the \u2018N-word.\u2019\u201d He conceded that he had used the epithet at times, but only with other African-Americans.After Tesla moved to bring the case to a close, an arbitrator issued a preliminary ruling saying it merited fuller consideration.\u201cI feel like everything was taken away from me,\u201d said Mr. Lambert, who is living at his mother\u2019s house back in Alabama. \u201cI got everything snatched from up under me since I complained about it.\u201dWithin about 90 days after starting at Tesla as a contract production associate, he became a full-time employee and saw his pay steadily climb from $17 to $21 an hour.Mr. Jones (no relation to Nigel Jones) said he had then started to notice that black workers weren\u2019t being promoted. In one case, he said, a manufacturing official told him that \u201cpeople like you\u201d didn\u2019t move up to lead positions. He also reported that he had heard a supervisor say of black employees that \u201cthere\u2019s too many of them in there, they are not Tesla material,\u201d and that he had been at a meeting where a supervisor, gesturing toward African-American workers, remarked that \u201cmonkeys work outside.\u201dTesla said there was no record of a formal complaint from Mr. Jones about racial insults.The company also denied that there was any inequity in its career development practices. \u201cYou do a great job, you make your way here,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of diversity and inclusion, Felicia Mayo, who is African-American. After a year at the company, she was recently made a vice president.Clarence Johnson, who came to Tesla four and a half years ago as a forklift driver and now tests equipment on a safety team \u2014 his second promotion \u2014 said his experience reflected opportunity.While he said he could not speak for others, he added, \u201cI\u2019m an African-American male, and I didn\u2019t have any of those roadblocks.\u201dLike Ms. Spates, he said supervisors would not tolerate racial slurs \u2014 though he said the use of a racial epithet \u201cwhere it\u2019s two people referring to one another as friends\u201d was common.For Mr. Jones, the route was not up but out. He said his children and a psychologist he had started seeing persuaded him to go back to truck driving.\u201cEverybody has a breaking point,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to breathe now.\u201dIf Nummi represented the auto industry\u2019s past, Owen Diaz was sure that Tesla was the future.But that was before the racist effigy on the cardboard bale, and the slurs and offensive graffiti that came earlier. He said he had ultimately found the environment so degrading that he struggled to get out of bed for work.As for the graffiti, Tesla said that Mr. Diaz brought \u201ca single drawing to the attention of his supervisor\u201d and that it \u201cwas promptly and thoroughly investigated.\u201d It said a contractor involved had been given a warning and suspended without pay.Despite what he said he had experienced, Mr. Diaz was eager to give his youngest son, Demetric, a chance at the company\u2019s pay and stock options. So he recruited him as a fellow contractor in 2015, working in a different production area.The first weeks were fine for Demetric, now 23. But he started to notice incidents that disturbed him.\u201cI started telling him like, \u2018Hey, well, I seen this, Dad,\u201d Demetric said. \u201cWhen I was in the bathroom,\u201d he said, he saw vulgar graffiti that included a racial slur.The younger Mr. Diaz complained to his staffing firm and then to a Tesla supervisor about racial abuse, protesting that the supervisor was \u201ccalling me an N-word every day,\u201d according to a lawsuit. The suit says that within days, he was given a written warning of misconduct and was shortly out of a job. Tesla said he had been let go after repeated warnings about failing to wear protective clothing.His father hung on for a few more months. Then he quit.Advertisement"}

You are ruining Wyoming.Last week, the Jackson Hole Travel & Tourism Board asked visitors to stop geotagging photographs on social media in an effort to protect the state\u2019s pristine forests and remote lakes. Explaining the campaign, Brian Modena, a tourism-board member, suggested the landscape was under threat from visitors drawn by the beautiful vistas on Instagram.\u201cWe want people to have a real connection to nature,\u201d Mr. Modena said, \u201cnot just a page with a pin on it.\u201dNow, conservationists are concerned that photographers who geotag their precise locations are putting fragile ecosystems and wild animals at risk. As a defense, they are asking tourists to stop.A spokeswoman for Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, declined to comment or make executives available.But Dana Watts, the executive director of Leave No Trace, said: \u201cThere are a lot of reasons why people want to showcase where they have been. Bragging rights. It\u2019s an unusual place.\u201d But, she said, \u201cWe just want people to stop and think before they share a location.\u201d\u201cWhile tagging can seem innocent,\u201d she added, \u201cit can lead to significant impact.\u201dOf particular concern, she said, are Instagram influencers hired by brands to promote a particular place or product.Ms. Watson, an influencer with more than 63,100 followers on Instagram, tagged her location in posts on her account in exchange for the hotel paying for her visit.\u201cI definitely think it is cool to bring awareness to the area,\u201d she said in an interview.She said she would not have known about Jenny Lake if not for Instagram. \u201cI was in awe of it,\u201d Ms. Turner said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine them getting mad.\u201dA representative for the Four Seasons said the hotel promotes responsible tagging. And, to be clear, Mr. Modena and the tourism board are not asking people to stop taking photographs altogether. Tourism in Yellowstone and the Grand Teton national parks drive the local economy.Some people wonder, though, whether asking people not to geotag will have much impact in the long run.That information attracts the curious, she said. And often watering holes are lit up at night when rhinos and other animals come to drink. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a geotag to work out where these rhinos are,\u201d she said.That said. there are exceptions. \u201cThe Kunene Region of Namibia, a vast area that is not formally protected, has an important population of black rhinos that could be vulnerable to poaching,\u201d Ms. Dean said. Her organization supports Save the Rhino Trust in Namibia, which asks people not to publish rhino sightings or document vehicle tracks.Mr. Modena, the Jackson Hole tourism board member, said it could take years for behavior to change because smartphones are not going away. \u201cWe want to start a responsible conversation now about social media and conservation,\u201d he said. \u201cSelfishly, there are hikes I\u2019ve seen that are beautiful that I am not going to name.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Questions have been swirling over what happened and whether the events have a future in the country; the festival organizers did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Xie noted that the Chinese government is notoriously suspicious of popular subcultures, and that electronic music festivals would naturally raise red flags because they attract large crowds.\u201cThey banned hip-hop,\u201d he said, referring to recent efforts by Chinese officials to suppress references to the genre on television. \u201cI guess E.D.M. is the next thing they\u2019re monitoring now, especially when music festivals involve thousands and thousands of people gathering together.\u201dThe festival organizers said in a statement on Monday that Quest had been shut down on Friday morning by local officials who blocked access to the site and shut off its electricity supply.\u201cIt is incredibly saddening and confusing that the move to block Quest from running was delayed until the final hour, as this left so many of the amazing festival staff, the wonderful volunteers and suppliers and many guests stranded on the roadside, or stuck inside the camp,\u201d they wrote on Facebook.A Quest Festival organizer declined to comment on the cancellation or the government\u2019s rationale, saying only that \u201cworking in Vietnam can be very challenging.\u201d\u201cHuman beings,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cWhen they want to blame, they\u2019re just gonna blame.\u201dMs. Lazarus said that in Britain, the regulatory \u201cgoal posts\u201d covering security, policing or sound restrictions at festivals can shift at the last minute.

And now, they want to direct the nation\u2019s talent and tech acumen toward an even loftier end: building an innovation-driven economy, one that produces world-leading companies.Not long ago, Chinese tech firms were best known for copying Silicon Valley.GoogleBaiduYouTubeYoukuInstagramDouyinUberDidiBut the flow of inspiration now runs both ways. American social media executives look to Tencent and ByteDance for the latest tricks for keeping users glued to their phones.Tencent\u2019s WeChat app, an all-in-one hub for socializing, playing games, paying bills, booking train tickets and more, paved the way for the increasingly feature-stuffed chat apps made by Facebook and Apple. Facebook recently took a page from TikTok, a Chinese service that is a sensation among Western tweens, by releasing its own highly similar app for creating goofy short videos.If people in the West didn\u2019t see this coming, it was because they mistook China\u2019s authoritarianism for hostility toward technology.But in some ways Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to break up giants like Facebook and the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.In China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don\u2019t undermine the state.So titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.Beyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally. Thanks to weak intellectual property protections, they can rip one another off with abandon \u2014 not great for rewarding innovation, but O.K. for consumers, who get lots of choices.And the money just keeps flowing in.$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China105\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918In another advantage, old-school industries like media, finance and health care have been dominated by lumbering state-run giants. That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease.With their mobile payment platforms, the two giants have built sprawling ecosystems in which vast amounts of commercial activity now take place. Little remains of daily life that has not been transformed. Shopping. Getting a loan. Renting a bike. Even going to the doctor.This level of clout hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by China\u2019s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people\u2019s lives.To keep tech in its place, the government is demanding stakes in companies and influence over management. Regulators have reprimanded online platforms for hosting content they deem distasteful \u2014 too raunchy, too flirty, too creepy or just too weird.That\u2019s why the best way for tech companies to thrive in China is to make themselves useful to the state. Nearly everyone in China uses WeChat, making the social network a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do. SenseTime, whose facial recognition technology powers those fun filters in video apps, also sells software to law enforcement.The risk for these companies is that the government demands more, sucking away resources that could be better spent chasing innovations or breaking into new markets.In China, says Lance Noble of the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the government\u2019s support \u201ccan be a blessing and a curse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Knowledge, Ignorance and Climate Change", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StonePhilosophers have been talking about skepticism for a long time. Some of those insights can shed light on our public discourse regarding climate change.No matter how smart or educated you are, what you don\u2019t know far surpasses anything you may know. Socrates taught us the virtue of recognizing our limitations. Wisdom, he said, requires possessing a type of humility manifested in an awareness of one\u2019s own ignorance. Since then, the value of being aware of our ignorance has been a recurring theme in Western thought: Ren\u00e9 Descartes said it\u2019s necessary to doubt all things to build a solid foundation for science; and Ludwig Wittgenstein, reflecting on the limits of language, said that \u201cthe difficulty in philosophy is to say no more than we know.\u201d Sometimes, when it appears that someone is expressing doubt, what he is really doing is recommending a course of action. For example, if I tell you that I don\u2019t know whether there is milk in the fridge, I\u2019m not exhibiting philosophical wisdom \u2014 I\u2019m simply recommending that you check the fridge before you go shopping. From this perspective, what Trump is doing is telling us that governmental decisions should not assume that global warming is caused by humans. To understand how it\u2019s possible to doubt something despite evidence to the contrary, try some thought experiments. Suppose you observe a shopper at the convenience store buying a lottery ticket. You are aware that the probability that he will lose the lottery is astronomically high, typically above 99.99 percent, but it\u2019s hard to get yourself to sincerely say you know this person will lose the lottery. Now imagine your doctor screens you for a disease, and the test comes out negative. But consider the possibility that this result is one of those rare \u201cfalse negative\u201d cases. Do you really know the result of this particular test is not a false negative? When presented with these thought experiments, some philosophy students conclude that what these examples show is that knowledge requires full-blown certainty. In these skeptical pressure cases, the evidence is overwhelming, but not 100 percent. It\u2019s an attractive idea, but it doesn\u2019t sit well with the fact that we ordinarily say we know lots of things with much lower probability. For example, I know I will be grading student papers this weekend. Although the chance of this happening is high, it is not anything close to 100 percent, since there is always the chance I\u2019ll get sick, or that something more important will come up. In fact, the chance of getting sick and not grading is much higher than the chance of winning the lottery. So how could it be that I know I will be grading and not know that the shopper at the convenience store will lose the lottery?Philosophers have been studying skeptical pressure intensely for the past 50 years. Although there is no consensus about how it arises, a promising idea defended by the philosopher David Lewis is that skeptical pressure cases often involve focusing on the possibility of error. Once we start worrying and ruminating about this possibility, no matter how far-fetched, something in our brains causes us to doubt. The philosopher Jennifer Nagel aptly calls this type of effect \u201cepistemic anxiety.\u201dThe standard response by climate skeptics is a lot like our reaction to skeptical pressure cases. Climate skeptics understand that 97 percent of scientists disagree with them, but they focus on the very tiny fraction of holdouts. As in the lottery case, this focus might be enough to sustain their skepticism. We have seen this pattern before. Anti-vaccine proponents, for example, aware that medical professionals disagree with their position, focus on any bit of fringe research that might say otherwise.Skeptical allure can be gripping. Piling on more evidence does not typically shake you out of it, just as making it even more probable that you will lose the lottery does not all of a sudden make you feel like you know your ticket is a loser.One way to counter the effects of skepticism is to stop talking about \u201cknowledge\u201d and switch to talking about probabilities. Instead of saying that you don\u2019t know some claim, try to estimate the probability that it is true. As hedge fund managers, economists, policy researchers, doctors and bookmakers have long been aware, the way to make decisions while managing risk is through probabilities. Once we switch to this perspective, claims to \u201cnot know,\u201d like those made by Trump, lose their force and we are pushed to think more carefully about the existing data and engage in cost-benefit analyses.Socrates was correct that awareness of one\u2019s ignorance is virtuous, but philosophers have subsequently uncovered many pitfalls associated with claims of ignorance. An appreciation of these issues can help elevate public discourse on important topics, including the future of our planet.N. \u00c1ngel Pinillos is a professor of philosophy in the School of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies at Arizona State University.

{"Headline": "How Can We Unleash the Immune System? ", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 THINGS We\u2019d Really like to knowAlthough immunotherapy can work wonders for cancer, it does not help everyone, side effects can be fierce, and costs are high. But the field is young.Cancer has an insidious talent for evading the natural defenses that should destroy it. What if we could find ways to help the immune system fight back? It has begun to happen. The growing field of immunotherapy is profoundly changing cancer treatment and has rescued many people with advanced malignancies that not long ago would have been a death sentence.Immunotherapy accounts for much of the progress. Still, it does not help everyone, side effects can be ferocious, and so can the expense.Overall, immunotherapy works in fewer than half of patients \u2014 but it can bring remissions that last years.Is this as good as it gets? Probably not. The field is still young, hundreds of clinical trials are underway and basic researchers are trying to find ways to fine-tune the treatments they have already developed, as well as find new ones.But scientists are also trying to open a whole new avenue of immunotherapy, one that focuses not on T-cells, but on another part of the immune system, a white blood cell called a macrophage.Macrophages gobble up and destroy microbes and other foreign substances, but cancer cells can evade capture by flipping an \u201coff\u201d switch on the macrophage. The malignant cells carry a protein that researchers call a \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal, which shuts down the macrophages.The cancer shrank in 11 patients, and disappeared completely in eight. Side effects were minor, especially compared to those from other forms of immunotherapy, the study authors said.They caution that the research is early and needs to be validated. But other researchers are exploring the same approach in different cancers, including multiple myeloma.\u201cThe concept, if it holds true, is really quite profound,\u201d said Dr. Alexander M. Lesokhin, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who is doing similar research but was not involved in the recent study. \u201cIt could be pretty extraordinary.\u201dFor one of the patients in the study, the results were pretty extraordinary. Michael Stornetta, 71, has had a disease called follicular lymphoma for about five years, and several different treatments had failed to control it. He entered the study about a year ago at Stanford University, one of 10 centers involved.\u201cThe lab rats, I consider myself one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to know I\u2019m able to do this and hopefully this drug becomes very successful in treating other types of cancer, including the kind I have. I feel like I\u2019m kind of giving something back to humanity.\u201dAt the start of the trial, 10 to 15 spots lit up on his PET scan, indicating cancer.Now, he said: \u201cWhen I look at the new scan, they\u2019re gone, except for one tiny spot, and they don\u2019t think it\u2019s cancerous, maybe just a residue of dead cancer.\u201d He is still being treated, and will probably continue it for a total of two years.\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever be able to say I\u2019m 100 percent cancer free, but I know the results are certainly pointing in that direction. Whether it comes back or not, who knows? I\u2019m gratified to know it\u2019s where it is right now.\u201dAnd a few we\u2019d rather not discussSimilar studies are examining other diseases. At M.D. Anderson, one is even testing two checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy in people with acute myeloid leukemia.Researchers are testing the CAR-T treatments in other blood cancers and trying to expand their uses and their power by programming them to attack a broader range of targets on cells. So far, they have not worked against so-called solid tumors like breast or colon cancer, but scientists haven\u2019t given up yet.Advertisement"}

Democrats lost 18-29 year olds in rural areas by 17 points in 2016, and that shifted to +8 this year, a 25-point shift.\u201d Among rural voters 30 to 44, support for Republicans fell from 31 points in 2016 to 13 points in 2018. Even keeping in mind that these numbers were produced by a Democratic firm, they signal unwelcome news for Trump.In the Midwest, according to Morris, \u201cDemocratic candidates for the U.S. Senate beat Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance in rural areas.\u201d Morris contends that \u201cObama-Trump voters could be coming home to roost.\u201dWe also saw much of the Midwest disproportionately shift left compared to 2016. This maps onto opinion trends I\u2019ve been studying as part of the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group: Midwestern Democrats are joining their coastal peers in attitudes on immigration and race and it\u2019s pulling them leftward.Ekins provided data showing that from 2012 to 2018, 24 percent of voters in the Midwest \u201cbecame more likely to say illegal immigrants make a \u2018contribution\u2019, \u201d compared to seven percent who \u201cbecame more likely to say illegal immigrants are a \u2018drain\u2019. \u201dThe outcome of the 2018 midterm elections does not predict results in the 2020 presidential election, but it does signal geographic strengths and vulnerabilities going forward.In contrast, after suffering the loss of Republican control of the House, Trump has shown little inclination to alter the direction of his administration. Perhaps he is banking on the fact that some of the voting trends on Nov. 6 were favorable to Republicans.Take Ohio, which has 18 Electoral College votes. The question there is whether this pivotal swing state has in fact turned red or at least a dark shade of pink.Dan Sewell and Julie Carr Smyth, reporters for The Associated Press, made the case immediately after the election that Ohio is moving in a red direction:Ohio Democrats can\u2019t worry right now about how to turn Ohio blue. First, they have to figure out how to get it back to purple in a state where President Donald Trump is a force for Republicans. Republicans on Tuesday again swept the races for governor and four other state offices. That\u2019s the third-straight election they\u2019ve done that, and notably this year, all five of the offices were open.David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, told Sewell and Smyth that the results were \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d Pepper declared that \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump also inspired his supporters in rural areas to show up.\u201dIn statewide contests in Ohio, including for president, in a balanced political environment, the G.O.P. enjoys a 3 to 5 percent advantage from the outset.Asher said the state has undergone amini-realignment in which the rural areas (both western Ohio and Appalachia) have become even more Republican, and the Democrats gains in some of the urban counties do not compensate for this.The bottom line, however, Asher argues, is that Democrats should not write off Ohio:It\u2019s still close enough to be competitive and yield a Democratic victory. But Ohio will be more difficult to carry than Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. So I would focus first on those states.It remains a battleground state despite Trump\u2019s success in 2016 and the Republican sweep of state executive offices in 2018. Sherrod Brown led the top races with 53 percent and Democrats won 47 percent of House votes.Because of those results, Beck contended that Ohio \u201cshould be competitive in 2020 and Ohio remains a big Electoral College prize.\u201dBeck summed up his view as \u201cPink at best, hardly red.\u201dThe outcome of the November election did demonstrate that Colorado is on the verge of becoming a blue state, if it is not there already. Arizona, in turn, has shifted from a red state to a competitive state. Both Texas and Georgia are steadily moving in that direction, albeit slowly.The Nov. 6 election revealed that Arizona, a rapidly growing state with 11 Electoral College votes, has moved from red to purple.In addition to capturing statewide offices they haven\u2019t held in decades \u2014 U.S. senator, Arizona secretary of state and superintendent of public instruction \u2014 Democrats increased their numbers enough in the state\u2019s House of Representatives to become (kind of) relevant.There are strong regional consequences if these developments continue \u2014 with an emphasis on the if.The Democratic Party now has the potential \u2014 by no means guaranteed \u2014 to turn five of the six states in the southwest corner of the country (the exception is Utah) into a power base rivaling the party\u2019s bastion in the Northeast.With Democrats winning the popular vote by 8 points, an R+2 result in Texas still means the state is 10 points to the right of the national average. Democrats could win Texas only if they win the rest of the country in a blowout.Ruffini also voiced caution in predicting Democratic success in other states:Aside from the usual suspects, I think Arizona may get added to the list (of competitive states) after 2018. Because of changing demographics.Oppenheimer said he remains stumped by one key state: \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to read Florida after 2018.\u201dFlorida is often seen as a 50-50 state, but in a good climate for Democrats the state still elected Republicans for governor and Senator, suggesting that perhaps it leans a bit more Republican than might be assumed.Schaffner, however, sees conditions in Arizona, Texas and Georgia as favorable to Democrats:Democrats have long expected that demographic change in the southwest will make them increasingly competitive in those states and I think 2018 shows this continuing trend, particularly in a place like Arizona. Texas and Georgia are two states that swung pretty strongly in the Democratic direction in 2016 (despite Trump\u2019s victory) and 2018 seems to confirm that these states are becoming more competitive.Schaffner cautioned, however, that \u201cGeorgia and Texas aren\u2019t exactly tossup states in 2020, but I do think that they have to be considered at least somewhat competitive.\u201dDemocrats won statewide in Arizona, and nearly won statewide in Georgia and Texas. As a result, we have to consider these three as battleground states in 2020.Drutman also argues that it would be a mistake for Democrats to write off either Ohio or Iowa:Democrats won statewide in Ohio, and won three congressional districts in Iowa, and nearly won the governor\u2019s race in Iowa, too. In 2016, it looked like those states were drifting away from Democrats, but in 2020, Ohio and Iowa still have to be considered battleground states, too.Innumerable events will unfold before November 2020.One of the most important unknowns is the quality of the Democratic presidential nominee. Over the last half century, the party has chosen some lemons and some exceptionally talented politicians.Upscale, college-educated white Democrats now make up more than a quarter, 26 percent, of the Democratic electorate. These voters have interests that are not the same as \u2014 and sometimes are in conflict with \u2014 those of a majority of the party\u2019s 41 percent minority voters, as well as with the party\u2019s non-college white voters (who still make up 33 percent of the Democratic electorate).Favorable trends in the electorate notwithstanding, the path to the Democratic nomination has become a minefield, in which victory for one group drives defections by another.President Trump, assuming that he is the 2020 Republican nominee, is certain to detonate as many of these mines as he can. That is one of his talents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could Asian-Americans Turn Orange County Blue?", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAngered by Republican anti-immigrant policies, Asian-Americans may turn the tide for Democrats in several tight House races in Southern California.Mr. Nguyen is a contributing opinion writer who lives in Los Angeles.The mall was the heart of the Little Saigon in Orange County. By 1988, Little Saigon was already firmly established, with multitudes of Vietnamese shops, restaurants and businesses lining Bolsa Avenue. This community was populated with Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese refugees who had fled the end of the war. It was deeply anti-Communist. Orange County as a whole was also anti-Communist and quite conservative, but it was also very white at the time. The arrival of so many refugees from Vietnam in the 1970s and 1980s was not welcomed by everyone in Westminster and Orange County.For the Republican Party, the late-20th-century alignment of anti-Communism with conservative economic and social values appealed to many Asian immigrants and refugees, including my parents. But that alignment has fallen apart. My 84-year-old father is still anti-Communist, but has a dim view of Donald Trump. He\u2019s not alone. Mr. Trump won only 18 percent of the Asian-American vote and 32 percent of the Vietnamese-American vote. Even many Asian-American Republicans are finding it hard to remain supportive of the party because of its opposition not only to refugees and undocumented immigrants, but to many documented immigrants as well.While it might be difficult for him to do that, many Republicans are pushing to sharply restrict family reunification in favor of so-called merit-based immigration. Forget for the moment that a \u201cmerit\u201d-based policy would have kept out many white immigrants of earlier generations, as well as recent Asian immigrants. Family reunification has brought many Asian immigrants into this country and helped to make Asian-Americans the fastest growing minority population. If the Republican Party vastly restricts family reunification, it could be dead to an overwhelming majority of Asian-American voters.The idea of Orange County, and even Little Saigon, becoming enthusiastically or even reluctantly Democratic appeals to me, who only travels to Orange County for the great Vietnamese food \u2014 the best outside of Vietnam, just as the county is home to the largest Vietnamese population outside of the homeland. But if the Democratic Party assumes that demographics equal political fate, it may be in for disappointment. This is because the Asian-American community is diverse in so many ways, including in its political beliefs and passions.In Orange County, one of the largest mobilizations of Asian-American voters happened in opposition to a county attempt to house homeless people in each of the county\u2019s cities. Asian-Americans in tonier places like Irvine were vocal in rejecting the county plan. The Vietnamese-American leadership of Westminster went against California\u2019s sanctuary state status. Nationally, the issue of affirmative action in college admissions, particularly in the Ivy League, has fractured the Asian-American community. While most Asian-Americans support affirmative action, many Chinese-Americans do not, and they have been vigorous in their opposition.Today, once again, the Republican Party is fumbling another opportunity to appeal to Asian-Americans who are willing to align themselves with whiteness. And that\u2019s because its coded racial appeals to Asian-Americans on middle-class issues like education, clean streets and safe neighborhoods are being drowned out by its coded racial appeals to whites on immigration. This is ironic because, from the vantage point of Little Saigon and many other parts of Orange County where Asian-Americans and Latinos have built thriving communities, it is immigration that has kept the region economically vibrant, culturally colorful and gastronomically interesting. Cutting back harshly on immigration, which the Republican Party says will help America, will only hurt it instead \u2014 and reduce the already waning appeal of the Republican Party to Asian-Americans.Viet Thanh Nguyen, a contributing opinion writer, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Refugees,\u201d and the editor of \u201cThe Displaced: Refugee Writers on Refugee Lives.\u201d He teaches English at the University of Southern California.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described an aspect of a proposed federal regulation under which immigrants could be denied green cards for using public benefits. The proposed \"public charge\" regulation does not list tax credits for buying health insurance through the Affordable Care Act as a disqualifying public benefit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Newest Jim Crow", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecent criminal justice reforms contain the seeds of a frightening system of \u201ce-carceration.\u201dOpinion Columnist This progress is unquestionably good news, but there are warning signs blinking brightly. Many of the current reform efforts contain the seeds of the next generation of racial and social control, a system of \u201ce-carceration\u201d that may prove more dangerous and more difficult to challenge than the one we hope to leave behind.Under new policies in California, New Jersey, New York and beyond, \u201crisk assessment\u201d algorithms recommend to judges whether a person who\u2019s been arrested should be released. These advanced mathematical models \u2014 or \u201cweapons of math destruction\u201d as data scientist Cathy O\u2019Neil calls them \u2014 appear colorblind on the surface but they are based on factors that are not only highly correlated with race and class, but are also significantly influenced by pervasive bias in the criminal justice system.As O\u2019Neil explains, \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to believe that computers will be neutral and objective, but algorithms are nothing more than opinions embedded in mathematics.\u201dEven if you\u2019re lucky enough to be set \u201cfree\u201d from a brick-and-mortar jail thanks to a computer algorithm, an expensive monitoring device likely will be shackled to your ankle \u2014 a GPS tracking device provided by a private company that may charge you around $300 per month, an involuntary leasing fee. Your permitted zones of movement may make it difficult or impossible to get or keep a job, attend school, care for your kids or visit family members. You\u2019re effectively sentenced to an open-air digital prison, one that may not extend beyond your house, your block or your neighborhood. One false step (or one malfunction of the GPS tracking device) will bring cops to your front door, your workplace, or wherever they find you and snatch you right back to jail.Many reformers rightly point out that an ankle bracelet is preferable to a prison cell. Yet I find it difficult to call this progress. As I see it, digital prisons are to mass incarceration what Jim Crow was to slavery.Some insist that e-carceration is \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d But where are we going with this? A growing number of scholars and activists predict that \u201ce-gentrification\u201d is where we\u2019re headed as entire communities become trapped in digital prisons that keep them locked out of neighborhoods where jobs and opportunity can be found.If that scenario sounds far-fetched, keep in mind that mass incarceration itself was unimaginable just 40 years ago and that it was born partly out of well-intentioned reforms \u2014 chief among them mandatory sentencing laws that liberal proponents predicted would reduce racial disparities in sentencing. While those laws may have looked good on paper, they were passed within a political climate that was overwhelmingly hostile and punitive toward poor people and people of color, resulting in a prison-building boom, an increase in racial and class disparities in sentencing, and a quintupling of the incarcerated population.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Editing Babies? We Need to Learn a Lot More First", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn experiment in China to alter the genomes of embryos in vitro, then implant them in the mother, is a step too far.Dr. Topol is a professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute.This is not to say that medicine won\u2019t someday employ gene-editing technologies in similar ways. But that time has not arrived. There are still too many risks, too many unknowns, about tinkering with our heritable genetic blueprints.In recent years genome editing has been appropriately heralded as the most important advance of biotechnology of our generation, and most likely the past century. Known as Crispr, this technique, and related DNA editing tools, enable their users to cut and paste discrete letters of the genome. This ability has markedly advanced science, shedding new light on the complex human genome with its billions of A, C, T and G letters that are the architecture of who we are.Already, many clinical trials using this technology are underway involving patients with rare diseases like hemophilia, thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The difference between these efforts and what reportedly happened in China is that these genome editing trials involve cells from the patient\u2019s body. The manipulations are not transmissible to the next generation.These trials are in their early stages, and we don\u2019t yet have results to show whether this type of editing is safe or provides effective treatment. But whatever happens, the consequences are confined to a patient who has consented to the experimental treatment.In the Chinese study, led by He Jiankui, a physicist, not a medical doctor, on the faculty of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, the targeted gene was CCR5, which helps enable H.I.V. to enter cells. While preventing this intrusion might sound like an advance in the fight against AIDS, it is completely unnecessary and may even carry the hazard of increasing the subject\u2019s susceptibility to other types of infection, such as influenza and West Nile fever. Previous genome editing studies have shown it is possible to disable the CCR5 gene in adults without working at the embryo level.So the experiment was needless. It had no scientific basis and must be considered unethical when balanced against the known and unknown risks.The predominant risks are the potential impacts of the editing on other letters of the genome, which could induce diseases. We don\u2019t have the assurance yet that Crispr provides laserlike precision in editing \u2014 for example, certain important genes for suppressing cancer are particularly susceptible to unintended editing. The way we assess this risk is to sequence the genome before and after editing, to see whether changes were made in genes other than the target gene.But our ability to discern these changes is still rudimentary, and it is entirely likely that we will miss something. The fact that we may not have seen unintended mutations brought about by editing is by no means proof of their absence.Even beyond the actual editing, this episode appears to have been marked by breaches of scientific conduct. One issue is informed consent. It is unclear whether the parents were told that there were simple ways to protect the embryos from disease that might have been transmitted by the H.I.V.-infected father. If they had known that, why would they consent to this risky procedure?Moreover, no report by the researchers has been produced for the biomedical community to review. Through a journalist reporting about this, I had the opportunity to see some of the data, and there\u2019s little question that Dr. He at least attempted to edit the genomes of the embryos. But no sequencing data has been presented or independently assessed.Nor has data been released to show whether the targeted gene was functionally disabled, which would require cell experiments. Science demands such transparency, but all we have is a YouTube video by the researcher, who makes the bold claim that \u201cthe gene surgery was safe.\u201dDr. He\u2019s university has disavowed knowledge or support of the research and said an inquiry is underway. It said his \u201cconduct in utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to edit human embryos has seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct.\u201dIt is difficult to envision a foolproof way to rein in such rogue efforts, notwithstanding the international consensus that we are still nowhere near ready for genome-edited babies. Scientists like Dr. He should be castigated by their institutions and the biomedical community, as he was, and perhaps that will discourage this sort of unethical research. Governments should also condemn these practices and impose significant penalties, like pulling research funding and making these scientists ineligible for more.We don\u2019t know whether the intended human genome editing was achieved in the twins and have no idea whether it will prove to be safe if it was accomplished.But we can conclude that this was a misguided, reckless use of powerful gene-altering tools to create edited human beings. We should not proceed down this road until we know far more about the consequences of what we are doing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imagining the Ideal Trump Rally", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo one expects much, but we deserve something slightly less terrible.Opinion ColumnistDonald Trump is holding 10 rallies over five days before the midterm elections. How bad do you think it\u2019s going to be?We really need a rest. The country\u2019s been through a terrible streak of terrorism \u2014 the pipe bombs followed by the mass shooting in Pittsburgh. And generally, the president has been worse than useless. His rhetorical high point probably came when he went to the synagogue where 11 people were murdered and didn\u2019t say anything.Hours after the synagogue shooting, Trump was already back at a rally, before his howling supporters in Illinois. To be fair, he began by speaking about \u201cthe hateful poison of anti-Semitism\u201d and the need \u201cto renew the bonds of love and loyalty that hold us all together as Americans.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d cried the audience on cue.\u201cI had a feeling you might say that,\u201d the leader of the free world said happily.But seriously, we have to let this leader-in-a-crisis part go. You can be driven to distraction by only a couple of different things on any given night.The worst thing about the rallies is that Trump keeps coming back to immigration, even though recent events have made it crystal clear that this is poisoning the nation. (\u201cWe\u2019re getting prepared for the caravan folks, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d)He\u2019s now adding a plug for his new plan to toss out the part of the Constitution that says if you\u2019re born here, you\u2019re a citizen \u2014 an idea that has even Paul Ryan reeling. (\u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to bring it up. I said we have to bring it up.\u201d)We know now that both the alleged pipe bomb-maker and the synagogue shooting suspect were obsessed with immigrants. Immigrant-bashing is what Trump thinks is the key to winning the midterms. It\u2019s also the place where Trump becomes an abettor in the right-wing, white nationalist turmoil that\u2019s torturing the country.It\u2019s insane to expect him to lift up the nation. But is it too much to ask that he just avoid the violence-inducing themes in his repertoire?For instance, he loves to remind his fans that he won the election, and that\u2019s a safe topic. Maybe he could devote half an hour of every rally to his theory that it\u2019s harder to win electoral votes than the popular vote. Plus crowd estimates \u2014 he could spend some time claiming that 47 percent of the entire population of Fort Wayne, Ind., was standing outside the door, in terrible weather, just to watch him on closed-circuit television.We\u2019re better off if he talks about the mysterious promise of a 10 percent tax cut known to no one in Washington but Donald Trump. And the Space Force! (\u201cSo important. That\u2019s where it\u2019s at.\u201d)What else could he say that isn\u2019t dangerous? Well \u2014 he could talk about the things the Republican majority did over the last two years. O.K., that definitely wouldn\u2019t fill up an hour.Then there\u2019s the Republican candidates \u2014 Trump\u2019s already spending more time actually talking about them in recent appearances. Earlier in the season they were lucky if they got to walk across the stage, but now they\u2019re getting quality time. And he\u2019s praising them off a teleprompter, which is definitely a help for the politicians in question.But you\u2019ll miss the off-the-cuff paeans like the one he gave the other night to a congressman from Illinois. (\u201cAnd frankly the Future Farmers, I could have done that one. But this is a rally for Mike Bost and frankly this one maybe I could have except I don\u2019t want to change our life for somebody that\u2019s sick and evil.\u201d)And if all else fails, instead of just announcing, as he always does, that \u201cthis is the greatest political movement in the history of our country,\u201d he could claim it\u2019s the greatest in the history of the planet. And compare himself to Thucydides or Winston Churchill or Pope John Paul II.Honestly, it\u2019d be such a relief.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lawyer Accused of Using Fake Facebook Pages to Sway Elections in Staten Island", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe political scandal is on a much smaller scale than Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 presidential election, but Staten Island has its own fake news controversy.The case involves two primary election campaigns, a few fake Facebook pages and an eccentric, bow-tie-wearing lawyer named Richard A. Luthmann.A fixture in Staten Island, Mr. Luthmann, who once asked a judge to let him settle a lawsuit with a duel, was accused in a criminal indictment unsealed on Thursday of creating fake Facebook pages and Twitter accounts to influence local elections.He was arraigned on Thursday on multiple charges of falsifying business records and identity theft. He also faces charges of stalking, criminal impersonation, falsifying a report to law enforcement and two election law violations. He faces up to four years in prison on the top count.Eric Nelson, a special prosecutor appointed in 2016 to handle the matter, said on Friday that Mr. Luthmann had impersonated three local politicians on social media: the Staten Island district attorney, a Republican candidate for the State Assembly and a Democratic city councilwoman.Mr. Luthmann, 39, created phony pages for these individuals, Mr. Nelson said, and then used them to disseminate false information. \u201cThese positions were put out that were contrary to their positions, and it did harm to their reputations,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.Some of this misinformation was posted during two primary campaigns, leading to the election law charges, Mr. Nelson said.The first involved Janine Materna, who challenged Assemblyman Ron Castorina Jr., in a Republican primary in September 2016.Mr. Luthmann launched a fake page for Ms. Materna that falsely represented her views, Mr. Nelson said. One post, for instance, called for more housing projects. Another was titled \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d and showed Ms. Materna with former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., which hurt Ms. Materna in the conservative district. (One Facebook commenter told Ms. Materna that she\u2019d lost a vote.)The stalking charge against Mr. Luthmann was also related to Ms. Materna\u2019s fake profile, Mr. Nelson said. Some of the information posted there, including a report that she parked in a disabled parking space, led to personal attacks and threats against her, the prosecutor said.A year later, Mr. Luthmann created another fake social media account for City Councilwoman Debi Rose, a Democrat representing the island\u2019s northern neighborhoods, Mr. Nelson said. At the time, Ms. Rose was facing a primary-election challenge from Kamillah Hanks, a community organizer. That page, among other things, said Ms. Rose \u201cwelcomes\u201d a welfare hotel for drug addicts and criminals.Mr. Luthmann is currently in jail awaiting trial in an unrelated federal fraud case, in which he is accused of a string of bizarre crimes. When asked last year, he would neither confirm nor deny that he had created the false Facebook pages, but he said that there would be nothing wrong if he had. \u201cIt\u2019s what is called a dirty trick,\u201d Mr. Luthmann said.Mr. Luthmann\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Sorrentino, said on Friday that neither he nor his client have had a chance to fully review the charges. But Mr. Sorrentino added that he did not believe that New York law made it illegal to do some of the things that prosecutors have accused Mr. Luthmann of doing.\u201cIf you look at the indictment, my client is alleged to have falsified the business records of Twitter and Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe that as a third party user of those sites, he can do that.\u201dLast December, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Luthmann of working with two reputed mobsters and a blind man to pack shipping containers with \u201ccheap filler,\u201d which they then fraudulently sold as scrap metal to local businesses. Then, prosecutors said, he turned on one of his partners and had him held at gunpoint to collect a $7,000 debt.Federal prosecutors have also said that Mr. Luthmann once tried to pay one of his partners in that scheme, who had alleged Mafia ties, to murder a top official in Staten Island\u2019s Democratic Party and to \u201cbeat up\u201d a second official.According to court papers, Mr. Luthmann also tried to pay a stripper $10,000 to claim that she had been raped in 2015 by the Staten Island district attorney, Michael E. McMahon, when he was running for the office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whitaker May Be a Bad Choice, but He\u2019s a Legal One", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s designation of the acting attorney general is constitutional, so long as it is temporary.Mr. Vladeck is a professor of law at the University of Texas. AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 President Trump\u2019s selection of Matthew Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general has provoked alarm across the political spectrum, and for good reason. But as troubling as Mr. Whitaker may turn out to be for the rule of law, Mr. Trump was acting within the scope of his constitutional authority. The move was legal, so long as it is temporary, which the law defines as up to 210 days. Although it is easy to see why this argument is so alluring, it\u2019s ultimately unconvincing as a matter of both constitutional text and structure. Let\u2019s unpack it.That the president can name temporary department heads without Senate confirmation is more than just a legal fine point; in many settings, it can be important to the effective functioning of government. A contrary rule could cause major headaches for a new president confronted with vacancies across the senior levels of government. Moreover, it could empower a Senate that is hostile to the president or to particular federal agencies to suffocate those entities by refusing to confirm anyone to run them. Of course, that\u2019s not the situation the president faced after asking for the resignation of Mr. Sessions. The Justice Department currently includes in its leadership a number of Senate-confirmed inferior officers, and if the pool is expanded to the entire federal government, the president would have hundreds of Senate-confirmed men and women from whom to choose. But there\u2019s no textual basis in the Constitution for concluding that the president should have to name one of those officers first or that an inferior officer not confirmed by the Senate should only be allowed to exercise the duties of a principal officer when no Senate-confirmed inferior officers are available to do so. Such requirements may well be wise as a matter of policy, but it should be for Congress, not the courts, to impose them.Advertisement"}

Mr. Newman is a professor in the School of Foreign Service and Government Department at Georgetown University.On Nov. 4, the United States is set to escalate sanctions against Iran as part of its decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. These sanctions include financial messaging, so the Trump administration could press for Swift, a private cooperative based in Brussels, to disconnect Iranian banks from its network. Swift is like a global post office for banks, providing a secure messaging system for the vast majority of international transactions, so disconnecting Iran would isolate it almost completely from the global financial system and would have drastic and immediate consequences for the Iranian economy.If the Trump administration goes ahead with this plan, it will have serious consequences for the United States as well. It will undermine America\u2019s influence over the international financial architecture and diminish its power over allies and adversaries alike. These baby steps may falter, but they provide a glimpse of what the world would look like if Europe became a competitive global financial power. One of the promises of globalization was that it would promote peace and stability by creating international economic networks that make countries more dependent on one another. Instead, America has weaponized this interdependence, twisting Swift and the dollar clearing system to strangle its adversaries. Other powers could do the same, or even undermine the United States by building alternative global networks.That is why the United States needs European cooperation with its approach to pressuring Iran. The European Union is the one power that could credibly test America\u2019s dominance. The E.U. may not have an army, but it does have economic might. And it can use that power to harm American companies and, if pushed far enough, fragment the international financial system.Sanctioning Swift would be a mistake for the United States. If the European Union can no longer rely on the United States, it will move to further develop its own payment channels. This would take years, but the end result could isolate the United States. Other countries \u2014 not just those in Europe \u2014 may prefer to be part of a European-led financial network, one that is backed by a publicly stated commitment to the rule of law, rather than a global financial system dominated by an increasingly unpredictable America. European politicians have long looked with envy at the power of the United States dollar. They now have an opening to position the euro as a viable competitor.The Trump administration hates being constrained by its allies. What it does not realize is that American economic power depends on the assent of other countries to be part of a financial system led by the United States. Push them too far, and American authority and influence could be permanently undermined.Henry J. Farrell is a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.

The synagogue, a crime scene.Ms. Weiss is a writer and editor in the Opinion section.PITTSBURGH \u2014 I want to tell you what it is like when your neighborhood becomes the scene of a mass murder.The first thing you should know is that when your phone pings with a text from your youngest sister saying, \u201cThere is a shooter at tree of life,\u201d your brain will insist that it is not true, that it is a hoax.But your fingers will write back immediately, unthinking: \u201cis dad there.\u201dYour mouth will turn to cotton while you wait for your mom to confirm that your father, who goes to one of Squirrel Hill\u2019s synagogues every Shabbat morning, was not in the building.Then another of your sisters will send a link to the police scanner and you will listen as the calls come in from the scene. You hear an officer report that the shooter declared he wants to \u201ckill all the Jews.\u201d He has hit officers. \u201cShots fired. Shots fired. Shots fired.\u201dYou will cancel all your plans and book a flight home. Before you are even on the plane you will start to hear rumors \u2014 a couple has been killed, a doctor. You will wonder which families in your neighborhood will be shattered.The numbness will break only when you find out that Cecil Rosenthal \u2014 the intellectually disabled, gentle giant of a man your mother has known since grade school \u2014 was murdered along with his brother, David. You will picture him as a proud usher standing in the entrance to services, and you will wonder if he greeted the killer, too. And you will weep.When an anti-Semitic murderer mows down Jews in the synagogue where you became a bat mitzvah, you might find yourself in the sanctuary again. But instead of family and friends, the sanctuary is host to a crew of volunteers \u2014 the chevra kadisha \u2014 who will spend the week cleaning up every drop of blood because, according to Jewish tradition, each part of the body must be sanctified in death and so buried.Daniel Wasserman, the rabbi of a local Orthodox synagogue who also runs a burial society, will be there, but so will an F.B.I. agent named Nicholas Boshears. You\u2019ll look at the ark, which contains the Torah that you read from at 13, and you\u2019ll think back to your terrible haircut and wonder why you were obsessed with wearing a suit rather than a dress and the fog of your memory will be sliced by the words \u201cBecause of the ballistics involved \u2026.\u201dSuddenly you will notice that people from the F.B.I. dressed in white coveralls are venturing to the part of the building that is now called \u201cthe crime scene.\u201d The place where there are hundreds of shell casings. The place where there are rivers of blood that are beginning to dry.You will watch as the rabbi hugs the man from the F.B.I. and you will see that the FB.I. agent is crying and notice that you are crying, too.When a terrorist comes to your hometown, you might sit, days later, with Rabbi Wasserman as he tells you that \u201cunless someone is a soldier in a war zone, I defy anyone to tell me they\u2019ve seen what I just saw.\u201d He will tell you that he saw Bernice and Sylvan Simon, who were married in that synagogue, dead in each other\u2019s arms. He will tell you that he saw a piece of a person\u2019s skull and that he knew who it was because he recognized their hair.And when you ask how he\u2019s feeling, he will tell you that he can\u2019t answer that yet. That he has to wait to break down until after he has helped bury the remaining dead.When your hometown becomes the site of a mass murder, familiar places will look like photo negatives.The Jewish Community Center where you went to preschool and swim team will become a mourning tent where your best friend\u2019s mother, a social worker, is volunteering her counseling services along with dozens of others.The basketball court where you were the worst player on every team will become an overflow room where young and old, black and white, are crowded onto bleachers watching a live stream of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz\u2019s funeral.When a terrorist comes to your town, you should be prepared for the copycats. You might wake up a few days after the attack to your mother shouting: \u201cGet up. Someone has a gun in Casey\u2019s school.\u201dLater your sister will tell you that the kids all followed the safety protocol during what thankfully turned out to be a false alarm. This includes fashioning \u201cweapons\u201d to throw at a man with an automatic weapon. A boy with a broken leg held up his crutch. Another had a peanut butter jar. Another wielded a bottle of Purell. Your sister will tell you that she was crouched by her desk, choking back tears while whispering to the kids that they were doing such a good job. If you are lucky, when a terrorist comes to your town, you will bear witness to some of this country\u2019s better angels.Better angels like the father who walked down the block outside of Tree of Life as he calmly explained to his young son: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to tell people that they are coming to invade our country. And it\u2019s just not true.\u201dBetter angels like Wasi Mohamed, the young executive director of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, who stood up and said if what you need is \u201cpeople outside your next service protecting you, let us know. We\u2019ll be there.\u201d He said that in making this offer he was only repaying a favor: \u201cThat was the same offer made to me by this community after this election happened that was so negative and the spike in hate crimes against Muslims.\u201dBetter angels like the sisters Alisa Fall and Melanie Weisbord, who spent Sunday night doing shmira \u2014 guarding the body of one of the victims so that, in keeping with Jewish custom, the person would never be alone.Better angels like Brett Keisel, the Pittsburgh Steeler who helped carry the coffin of David Rosenthal.Better angels like Nina Butler, who delivered quarts of homemade chicken soup to a SWAT officer who took seven bullets and was healing from his wounds in the hospital.Better angels like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who watched his congregants be executed and then found a way to represent his community to the world with dignity.Better angels like Michael Sampson, who showed up with a giant Israeli flag, his wife, Leslie, and his two kids to join the protest. His 11-year-old son, Jordan, will tell you: \u201cWe\u2019re here because hate came to what should be a safe space. And it should not be tolerated.\u201dBetter angels like the Rev. Eric Manning of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., who knows what it is like to go through such a massacre and who showed up to speak on Friday at the funeral of Rose Mallinger.But you will also wonder quietly to yourself if these better angels will be enough to stop the threats against communities like yours from multiplying.What happened in my neighborhood might seem like a nightmare or an illness \u2014 something to be endured until, in time, it passes. That\u2019s how it has seemed to me. But to those who have spent their lives in places like Karachi or Aleppo, the things Pittsburgh Jews take for granted \u2014 our freedom from violence and fear \u2014 are nothing more than pipe dreams.When your hometown in Western Pennsylvania becomes the scene of mass murder, you know that the distance separating their reality from ours can be made tissue thin.Advertisement"}

Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, said the deal would bring his state\u2019s businesses \u201cone step closer to unlocking the trade and investment opportunities of China\u2019s ambitious Belt and Road initiative.\u201dCritics, however, have characterized Mr. Andrews as na\u00efve for failing to understand how China has used the initiative to deepen its global influence by promising to help construct grand infrastructure projects. Others have said Mr. Andrews cut a deal with China for politically opportunistic reasons: His state government goes to the polls in less than two weeks.Whatever his motivations, the deal sets a precedent for China to sidestep national leaders in Canberra and court states individually.\u201cI think this is a big part of Beijing\u2019s agenda, to say to other states and territories that being the last to sign up will be bad,\u201d said Michael Shoebridge, director of the defense and strategy program at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \u201cThat would be consistent with Beijing\u2019s approach with other negotiations internationally.\u201d It remains unclear exactly what the deal in Victoria will cover, but the Belt and Road projects in other countries have tended to be large in scale.But the money often comes with strings attached.Chinese government-controlled lenders offer sizable amounts of money through loans or financial guarantees to build airports, seaports, highways, rail lines and power plants. Pakistan has accepted billions of dollars in loans from China in recent years for infrastructure projects, the terms of which remain largely undisclosed. China has pledged a total of more than $60 billion to Pakistan in the form of loans and investments for roads, ports, power plants and industrial parks.Australia has long had to balance its economic relationship with China against its strategic security alliance with the United States. Ever since John Howard was prime minister more than a decade ago, Canberra has tried to keep both powers happy.\u201cHoward famously argued that Australia didn\u2019t have to choose between its economic relations with China and the alliance with the United States,\u201d said Michael Clarke, an associate professor at the National Security College at Australian National University.\u201cClearly, both of those assumptions no longer hold with President Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 approach and China\u2019s assertiveness under President Xi Jinping,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. The federal government, Mr. Clarke said, needs to clarify its position on whether Australian states are allowed to receive funding for Belt and Road projects.Canberra may object to Victoria\u2019s decision to sign on to the initiative, but the federal government has also signed a memorandum of understanding with China, which it, too, has kept largely under wraps.\u201cIt says something about the culture of government and its distrust toward public transparency that both the federal and state governments chose not to disclose their MOUs,\u201d said Euan Graham, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, a think tank. \u201cAnd there is a broader point here about how the government conducts its business.\u201d\u201cWhat the government needs to focus on is what\u2019s good policy,\u201d he said. \u201cGood policy toward China means a joined-up approach, and anything that allows those divides to be exposed is going to result in bad policy outcomes that China can at the very least rhetorically cash in on.\u201d Advertisement"}

The Lakers game was on the television, and if revelers weren\u2019t line dancing they were playing pool. Then all of a sudden, into \u201cCollege Country Night!\u201d at the Borderline Bar & Grill stepped a man with a gun.\u201cI remember looking back at one point to make sure he wasn\u2019t behind me,\u201d said Sarah DeSon, a 19-year-old college student.And as they raced for safety, many of them thought: not again.Just last year, they had fled the same chaos \u2014 gunshots, bodies falling \u2014 in Las Vegas, at a country music festival where 58 people were killed in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The Borderline, a popular hangout for country music fans, had become a place of solace for dozens of survivors of the Vegas massacre to come together for music, for healing and for remembering \u2014 \u201cto celebrate life,\u201d in the words of one.And now, at least some of them belong to a group that seems uniquely American: survivors of two mass shootings.\u201cThis is the second time in about a year and a month that this has happened,\u201d Nicholas Champion, a fitness trainer from Southern California who posted a group photo on Facebook of Vegas survivors gathering at the Borderline in April, said in a television interview. \u201cI was at the Las Vegas Route 91 mass shooting as well as probably 50 or 60 others who were in the building at the same time as me tonight.\u201dWhen a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas last year, Telemachus Orfanos somehow survived.On Wednesday night, though, he didn\u2019t.\u201cHe was killed last night at Borderline,\u201d his mother, Susan Orfanos, said, speaking rapidly into the telephone. \u201cHe made it through Las Vegas, he came home. And he didn\u2019t come home last night, and the two words I want you to write are: Gun control. Right now \u2014 so that no one else goes through this. Can you do that? Can you do that for me? Gun control.\u201dMs. Orfanos then hung up the telephone.The shooting inside the bar, a favorite local hangout for 25 years that hosted line-dancing lessons and allowed students in starting at 18, and where on Wednesday night several college women were celebrating their 21st birthdays, began around 11 p.m. Witnesses described sudden chaos. Among the estimated 130 to 180 people at the bar were five off-duty police officers, enjoying the night like the other partyers. As patrons dove for cover, the sounds of glass shattering and gunshots rang out in the cavernous bar. The gunman prowled the emptying dance floor, shooting the wounded as they lay on the ground.Teylor Whittler, a young woman inside the bar, saw the gunman quickly reload and fire again. \u201cHe knew what he was doing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had perfect form.\u201dThe attack is only the latest in a wave of mass shootings that have plagued the country this year. A man opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue late last month, killing 11 people in an attack that officials said was motivated by anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant rage.As the day wore on, a handful of victims were identified. Among them were Sgt. Ron Helus, a sheriff\u2019s deputy only a year or so from retirement; Alaina Housely, an 18-year-old freshman at Pepperdine who loved soccer and planned to major in English literature; and Cody Coffman, 22, a baseball umpire who planned to join the army.Mr. Coffman\u2019s father\u2019s saw his son just before he left for the bar Wednesday evening. \u201cThe first thing I said to him was please don\u2019t drink and drive,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe last thing I said was, son, I love you.\u201dWith mass shootings a fixture of life in this nation, Americans in large gatherings \u2014 at churches, concerts, public squares \u2014 have become accustomed to thinking through the possibilities, eyeing exit routes and weighing escape options, should the horrific happen.\u201cUnfortunately, our young people or people at nightclubs have learned this may happen and they think about that,\u201d said Geoff Dean, the Ventura County sheriff, whose last day on the job before retirement was scheduled for Friday. \u201cFortunately it probably saved a lot of lives that they fled the scene so rapidly.\u201dAuthorities said as many as 22 people had been injured and taken to the hospital.One college student, Nellie Wong, was at the bar celebrating her 21st birthday. Ms. Wong was trapped in the club until the police arrived, and described the whole thing as a blur.\u201cShe\u2019s alive, though,\u201d said Ms. Whittler, standing with Ms. Wong outside the bar. \u201cShe\u2019s alive for her 21st birthday.\u201dBrendan Kelly, 22, was among those who survived both the Vegas massacre and the shooting at the Borderline. \u201cIt\u2019s your worst nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201dThe news sent convulsions through the community of Las Vegas shooting survivors who have come to call themselves the Route 91 Family, posting constantly on private Facebook groups and getting together for what they call \u201cmeet-greets.\u201dBorderline is one of several places that the survivors use for these gatherings, which are meant to heal the trauma of the October 2017 shooting.Janie Scott, 42, a Las Vegas survivor who runs a Facebook page for others, said that 47 people who made it out of that shooting had posted on her page that they were at Borderline last night.She\u2019d spoken with 10 of them today.\u201cThey\u2019re just broken,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot of: Why is this our new norm? Why is this our new norm? It shouldn\u2019t be. At all.\u201dLater in the day, she wrote again: \u201cIn the middle of this confusion and heartbreak, I just want to take a minute to say that Borderline is our place. Our parents came here, our friends work here, we celebrate our happy moments and drown out our worst here. We\u2019re coming back from this stronger than ever.\u201dChris Weber, 26, on Thursday considered himself lucky, twice. Last night he was on his way to the Borderline from a country music concert in Los Angeles to meet friends, when they got a call about the shooting. They rushed to the scene, standing outside the police perimeter awaiting word on the fate of their friends. And last year he planned to attend the Vegas festival, but backed out at the last minute.\u201cSomeone is looking over me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for the people who got out last night, someone was looking over them too.\u201dMany of the people he knew from the Borderline were casual acquaintances, familiar faces they saw each week, drinking beer and dancing and listening to music, even if he didn\u2019t know their names.\u201cNow as I look back I wish I could say I was better friends with them,\u201d he said.He said he knew many people who were present at both shootings. \u201cNo one should have to go through a shooting, let alone twice,\u201d he said.Michael Millar, 25, an accountant from Thousand Oaks, grew up hanging out at the Borderline, but was not there Wednesday night, unlike many of his friends. He said that for those from Thousand Oaks it is a point of pride to not be from Los Angeles, 40 miles to the east \u2014 he said residents love their 805 area code and country music is a big thing.On Thursday Mr. Millar was speaking to a friend who survived both mass shootings. He said that just like in Vegas, when he heard the first shots he thought they were firecrackers. But this time, at the Borderline, a learned response kicked in.He told Mr. Millar, \u201cI learned from Vegas not to think twice, but to just get out.\u201dJose A.

{"Headline": "6 Types of Misinformation to Beware Of on Election Day. (And What to Do if You Spot Them.)", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBe careful of rumors and hoaxes about the voting and polling places. Here are some tips for spotting and avoiding false information. False stories, misleading ads and suspicious mailers are an unfortunate feature of most modern political campaigns.But there is another type of misinformation to worry about on Tuesday: the type that strikes on Election Day, requiring voters to wade through rumors, hoaxes and misleading information on their way to the polls.Here, so you know what to look out for on Tuesday, we break down six of the most common types of Election Day misinformation, as well as some tips at the end for spotting and avoiding it.In 2016, several false rumors cropped up around behavior at polling stations.If you are on a campaign or party committee\u2019s voter list, you may receive legitimate text messages on Tuesday encouraging you to vote, offering you a ride to the polls, or telling you where your polling place is. But beware any text messages that tell you that voting hours or locations have changed, that new forms of voter ID are required, or that your voter registration is not valid.Voters across Indiana who filed absentee ballots last month have been receiving text messages purporting to be from President Trump \u2014 and claiming their votes have not been registered. The texts included a link to a Republican National Committee website that asks users to enter their names, addresses and phone numbers and then provides information about their polling locations. \u201cThis is President Trump,\u201d read one message received by a voter in Elkhart County, Ind., who had voted by absentee ballot. \u201cYour early vote has NOT been RECORDED on Indiana\u2019s roster.\u201dReports of broken, rigged or technically compromised voting machines are common on Election Day. You may even see videos of malfunctioning voting machines going viral on social media. Unless you have rock-solid evidence that the claims are true, it\u2019s usually best to be skeptical.The best thing to do, in any case, is to take extra precautions. In states that issue a paper record of electronically submitted votes, check the paper record to make sure that your choices are accurately reflected. And in the five states that provide no paper trail of votes \u2014 Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, New Jersey and Delaware \u2014 double- or triple-check your choices before submitting them. If you believe your voting machine is malfunctioning, notify a poll worker.Still, it\u2019s likely that someone will try to mislead voters through manipulated photos or videos on Election Day, so it\u2019s best to be prepared to give extra scrutiny to everything you see.During the 2016 election, Mr. Trump claimed without evidence that widespread voter fraud would occur. After he won the presidency but lost the popular vote, he claimed, again without proof, that millions of undocumented immigrants had cast ballots.These hoaxes are often meant to undermine an election\u2019s integrity and delegitimize the winners. Unless you witness indisputable evidence of voter fraud, it\u2019s best to ignore these claims.Your job on Tuesday is not to debunk misinformation, it\u2019s to vote! Still, there are things you can do to quickly check the authenticity of any information you find.Natasha Singer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Disgusted, she quickly rejected it.\u201cI felt like I had been punched in the gut,\u201d Ms. Odorisio, 31, a Brooklyn-based actress and singer, said Wednesday. She said it was not the first time something like that had happened to her, adding, \u201cIt was extremely violating.\u201dKathe Hannauer, 58, had a similar experience last month, as she traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan on a crowded train during the evening rush.When an image of male genitalia suddenly appeared on her screen, she said she felt more surprised than flustered. \u201cIt was kind of like, \u2018At my age?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNo one has harassed me in the longest time.\u201dBut she worried about what would happen if a young girl was sent such a photograph, so she quickly wrote about the incident on Facebook to warn her friends to turn their AirDrop feature off when they are in public.The two women were victims of what has become known as cyber flashing, a growing trend of technology-enabled sexual harassment. It has become so common that two lawmakers introduced a City Council bill on Wednesday to explicitly make it a crime, punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to a year in jail.One of the first news reports of cyber flashing was in London in 2015, when a female commuter told the British Transport Police that she had received lewd photos on her phone via AirDrop as she traveled to work. Since then, people in New York, Toronto and other cities have written articles, tweeted and posted on Facebook and Instagram about how explicit pictures have showed up on their phones, often while on crowded public transportation.Because AirDrop allows people to send images anonymously, there is no way for a commuter to know who in a busy train car might have sent it. And unlike traditional public lewdness crimes, the sender might not know who exactly within 30 feet is receiving the picture, because the feature identifies nearby phones only by the phone\u2019s nickname.\u201cIn the old days, you had to have a long trench coat and good running shoes,\u201d said Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island who is co-sponsoring the anti-flashing bill. \u201cTechnology has made it significantly easier to be a creep.\u201dSome people interpret the images as a harmless prank. About a month ago, Michael May, a medical resident in Manhattan, said he was on the A train when a stranger sent him a photo of a completely nude man covering his genitals with a glowing light saber.\u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d Mr. May, 26, said. He looked up from his iPhone to try to determine who had sent it, but everyone around him was staring intently at their phones.Donovan J. Richards, a Democratic councilman from Queens and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the legislation was intended as a bipartisan effort to raise awareness \u2014 and to remove the sense of impunity that may embolden those sending the images.\u201cKeep your pic in your pants,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf you do it, the message we are sending is that the repercussion is a fine or jail time.\u201dAirDrop, which first debuted in 2011, is specific to iPhones and other Apple products. It uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate over a short range to other devices, like other iPhones. More recently, some Android-enabled devices have had access to a similar feature called AirDroid.What makes Apple\u2019s feature particularly vulnerable to cyber flashing is that it automatically shows the recipient a preview of the image, then asks the user to accept or decline it. The only way to block the image is to set the AirDrop feature only for use between phone contacts (which is the default setting from Apple) or to turn it off completely.It is already a misdemeanor in New York State to harass someone by telephone, mail or other forms of written communication. But that law does not explicitly address the issue of visual images.The bill introduced on Wednesday would add language to the city code that would make it \u201cunlawful for a person, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, to send by electronic device an unsolicited intimate image.\u201dDanielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland and the author of a book on hate crimes in cyberspace, said that clarification could be helpful. New York may be the first municipality to consider a specific law targeting the practice, she said.\u201cThis is unwanted electronic harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like we have telephone harassment laws that have been upheld by federal and state courts, it is absolutely possible to regulate this.\u201dMs. Citron said there were no statistics tracking the prevalence of cyber flashing, adding the entire field of electronic harassment is \u201cwoefully understudied.\u201dSgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, did not address the issue of cyber flashing directly, but said in a statement, \u201c Any complaints made in regard to aggravated harassment will be recorded and fully investigated.\u201dMr. Richards said that Apple and other tech companies should share the responsibility for warning users about the potential misuse, and modify the feature to be safer. \u201cThe onus can\u2019t just be on the Police Department,\u201d he said.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.For now, protection mostly consists of past victims warning others to look out. Ms. Odorisio was so upset by the explicit image she received that she posted a censored version of it on Instagram, with her own text over it: \u201cTo those who say \u2014 aw, come on, that doesn\u2019t happen \u2026\u201dUnder the image it read: \u201cNot asking for it.\u201dThere are two ways to restrict the AirDrop feature on an iPhone.In the main settings app, select \u201cGeneral,\u201d and then \u201cAirDrop.\u201d Then select either \u201cReceiving Off\u201d or \u201cContacts Only.\u201d The \u201cEveryone\u201d setting is when sexual harassers can send you photos.Alternately, swiping up from any screen will bring up the control center. Pushing down on the Bluetooth icon will open another menu, in which there is an AirDrop icon. Tap that, and the options for \u201cReceiving Off,\u201d \u201cContacts Only\u201d and \u201cEveryone\u201d appear.Advertisement"}

But she found resistance internally to her efforts.\u201cShe was trying to figure out: \u2018How do I politic this?

Recruiters from Facebook and Alphabet set up booths (free sunglasses from Facebook; $200 in credit to the Google Cloud platform from Alphabet).In the auditorium, the head of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator and investment firm, gave opening remarks, recommending that young people avoid jobs in big tech.\u201cYou get to program your life on a totally different scale,\u201d said Michael Seibel, who leads Y Combinator. \u201cThe worst thing that can happen to you is you get a job at Google.\u201d He called those jobs \u201c$100,000-a-year welfare\u201d \u2014 meaning, he said, that workers can get tethered to the paycheck and avoid taking risks.The event then segued to a word from the sponsor, Microsoft.

I like to call it tremendous opportunity.\u201dThen students flooded into the stadium, which was filled with long tables of computers where they would stay and compete. In the middle of the scrum, three friends joked around. Caleb Thomas, 21, was gently made fun of because he had accepted an internship at Facebook.\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.\u201cThese are the realities of how the business works,\u201d said Samuel Resendez, 20, a computer science student at the University of Southern California.It turned out Mr. Resendez had interned at Facebook in the summer.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Almost 2019. Do You Know Where Your Photos Are?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the age of image abundance, purges are a way of life.In 2005, Yahoo acquired Flickr, the popular photo site. It already had a photo site, Yahoo! Photos, which was created in March 2000. But don\u2019t worry, the company said:\u00a0The two could happily coexist.In 2007, Yahoo announced it would discontinue that first photo service, and that users should move their photos to Flickr, which now required a Yahoo account to use. In 2013, the company announced that Flickr users would have a terabyte of space \u2014 for most people, an effectively unlimited amount \u2014 to store images for free. (\u201cWe want all your photos,\u201d said Adam Cahan, a Yahoo executive at the time.) By then, digital cameras were ubiquitous and smartphones had gone mainstream. People were producing more photos than ever, but it still wasn\u2019t clear where they were supposed to end up.This news came with a new default storage limit: 1,000 photos. Users could begin paying or take the rest elsewhere. A digital photo first uploaded to Yahoo at the turn of the century, in other words, when most people online were still dialing in to get there, and not once again rescued this year, may finally meet its demise. It would have had a better run than most. And here it is, almost 2019. Do you know where your photos are? Most of us don\u2019t, at least not exactly, or in terms that we fully understand. Holding on to pictures was, for most of the history of photography, a matter of material decay and physical storage. Are these prints fading, and how fast? Are they organized by year or by subject? Do I know where they are? To the people who took them, they were deeply valuable; to anyone else, mostly worthless. Their peculiar sort of pricelessness made archivists of regular people. The problem of what to do with ballooning digital photo collections, on the other hand, is perhaps the great unsolved tech support question of the last 30 years. In retrospect, well-intentioned guidance reads like a manual for the obliteration of memory. Hard drives die unpredictably. If you could produce a Zip drive in 2018, it would likely regurgitate whatever you fed it. CDs and DVDs rot, it turns out. The first services that beckoned us to what was not yet widely known as the cloud set the tone for what was to come. At the turn of the century a site called Zing promised, in a first, \u201cfree unlimited online storage\u201d for photos. By the end of 2001, its home page had been replaced with an apology letter. But online photo collections kept growing \u2014 where else would we go? Newer, more credible services hustled for users. Storage practices didn\u2019t get revised, they accumulated: Photos lived on old discs and drives, moving from site to site, cloud to cloud, from Photobucket to Flickr to Facebook and back, or maybe just waiting on ever-larger SD cards. (Those die, too.)\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve come across with my clients is not necessarily \u2018How do I store them?\u2019 but \u2018How do I move them to the newest application?\u2019\u201d said Kaitlyn Ackron, a 17-year-old student in Rio Rancho, N.M., who provides tech support for seniors through an organization called Teeniors. They worry about accidentally deleting photos from their phones, said Ms. Ackron, who shows them the \u201cRecently Deleted\u201d folder. They\u2019re alarmed when they can\u2019t see old images on a new computer. (The storage device is no longer compatible.) \u201cThere have been quite a few people frustrated with that kind of stuff,\u201d said Yannick Hutchinson, a 23-year-old student who also works with Teeniors. New and subtler forms of online storage, working in the backgrounds of our smartphones, cause particular anxiety. \u201cThe storage is not on their phone, but out there on this supposed cloud,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Well, where is it?\u2019\u201dNow, again, with services like iCloud, the tech industry is promising us all the space we need. This time, however, it has barely felt the need to pitch us. Photo glut is a common condition. These days, smartphone makers don\u2019t need to pitch; they tend to just make us aware of what\u2019s already happening automatically. If you use an iPhone, every picture can be uploaded to Apple\u2019s servers, until you run out of free space, at which point you\u2019ll either need to start deleting things or rent some more, from Apple.Google promises unlimited free \u201cstorage,\u201d sure: \u201csafe, secure, and always with you.\u201d But some of its other promises, the ones we haven\u2019t heard before, are strikingly of their time: \u201cNever worry about running out of space on your phone again.\u201dIt is a gentler approach than \u201cwe want all your photos.\u201d And this most modern solution quickly diverts our attention away from the old question \u2014\u00a0where will my photos end up? \u2014\u00a0to the newer ones attendant with photography as it exists today. People take pictures to remember things, for the benefit of others, or to record something beautiful or notable, but also according to the constant demands of social media, of keeping friends and family updated in real time, and of simply communicating on the phone. The various images we record, and those compelled from us, are something apart from a photo collection. Apple proactively processes a phone\u2019s images into categories, some of which wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the side of a shoe box, or the cover of a photo album: around dates or places; of particular people, who Apple identifies automatically with facial recognition. Sometimes Apple reminds you of a birthday party, and presents you with a moving video. Other times, as it did to a friend, it shows you a slide show of photos you took of a stereo to post it on Craigslist. Remember that day? Google\u2019s approach is more assertive. From your raw imagery, it will automatically edit together a sequence of your child\u2019s development. It will do the same for your dog, whose face it can also recognize. You can search your photos for almost anything: cars, sunsets or \u201cscreenshots containing text.\u201d Its album and videos and searches double as assurances: You may never organize your photos yourself, but we have some ideas; you may not remember taking them in the first place, but they still exist. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent like Flickr,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cTech companies are still selling a lot of very neophyte people a lot of problematic lies about things that matter a lot to them.\u201d Besides, even Flickr offered more than storage. It was a social network with a framework for sorting and tagging and categorizing and discussing photography. You can now export that data alongside your photos if you want, but this archive of metadata has few uses and fewer places to go. The prospect of removing your photos and videos from a service like Google Photo, which provides not just space but also the only interface through which your personal imagery makes any sense, is worse than daunting. Ms. Ackron\u2019s advice for seniors remains practical. \u201cYou always need to keep an eye on where you\u2019re storing your photos, to make sure things aren\u2019t going out of date,\u201d she tells them, describing the process as \u201ctedious\u201d but necessary. \u201cTechnology isn\u2019t slowing down.\u201dThey have advice, too. \u201cI just keep all my pictures on my phone,\u201d Ms. Ackron said. \u201cClients talk about how they kept scrapbooks and photo boxes and photo albums, and about how physically holding the pictures themselves is a different experience.\u201d Now, she said, she prints some favorites of her own. Beneath the roar of digital acceleration, there is still some shuffling of paper. A 2018 analysis by f/22 Consulting, a photo industry firm, noted that a printing business in turmoil has managed to siphon growth from America\u2019s bulging camera rolls. Traditional prints \u2014\u00a0shoe box fodder\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are growing again. But not as fast customized mementos and books, including some generated by tech giants using facial recognition and other artificial intelligence. It\u2019s not a solution, but it may be an escape. My own wedding was just over two years ago, photographed and recorded in a variety of ways. To the extent it existed on social media, it\u2019s in fragments. We have countless photos sitting in folders, and on various drives; some of our guests shared photos with us, others didn\u2019t, and we didn\u2019t bother most of them about it. Google has a cache, which it is tirelessly analyzing for clues and content. For a record of a single weekend, this nebulous digital archive is surprisingly unapproachable. And it has already begun its decay.There does exist a version of events, however, rendered in a coherent way, in the manner of photographs recorded for posterity \u2014\u00a0a pair of photo books printed for our parents, who requested a way to show photos that didn\u2019t involve their phones. If history is any guide, our best chance at having something to look back at when we\u2019re old won\u2019t come from the next Google, or whatever comes after that. It\u2019s that these books will survive all of it, and find their way back to us.Advertisement"}

That finding was redacted from a public version of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to just take the word of Facebook \u2014 or any major corporation \u2014 that they\u2019re safeguarding our personal information.\u201dIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cWe take the F.T.C. consent order incredibly seriously and have for years submitted to extensive assessments of our systems.\u201d She added, \u201cWe remain strongly committed to the consent order and to protecting people\u2019s information.\u201dFacebook, like other companies under F.T.C. consent decree, largely dictates the scope of each assessment. In two subsequent assessments, Facebook\u2019s October letter suggests, the company was graded on a seemingly less stringent policy with data partners. On those two, Facebook had to show that its partners had agreed to its data use policies.A Wyden aide who reviewed the unredacted assessments said they contained no evidence that Facebook had ever addressed the original problem. The Facebook spokeswoman did not directly address the 2013 test failure, or the company\u2019s apparent decision to change the test in question.Because the United States has no general consumer privacy law, F.T.C. consent decrees have emerged as the federal government\u2019s chief means of regulating privacy practices at Facebook, Google and other companies that amass huge amounts of personal data about people who use their products. In letters and congressional testimony, F.T.C. officials have pointed to the decrees as evidence of robust consumer privacy protection in the United States.A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledged in a statement that Facebook defines the privacy procedures, known as \u201ccontrols,\u201d that are tested during the assessments.\u201cChanges to controls may occur as platforms evolve, such that a control tested in one period may not be identical in a subsequent period,\u201d the spokesman said.The October letter to Senator Ron Wyden details Facebook\u2019s oversight of its partnerships with device makers.While the assessment reports were publicly released by the F.T.C. in June, they included significant redactions, which Facebook and PricewaterhouseCoopers said were necessary to protect trade secrets.Mr. Wyden, whose staff had viewed the full assessments, said at the hearing that he found parts of the unredacted reports \u201cvery troubling\u201d and pressed Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, to release them in their entirety.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based consumer rights group that helped obtain the 2011 consent decree, is currently suing the agency for release of the full assessments, arguing that the public cannot otherwise judge how effectively the F.T.C. is policing privacy violations.\u201cWhat is clear is that the F.T.C. has failed to enforce the consent order,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the privacy rights group. \u201cAnd this has come at enormous cost to American consumers.\u201dThe F.T.C. declined to comment.Facebook\u2019s compliance with the consent decree is the subject of a new F.T.C. investigation opened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.In the letter last month, Facebook\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Kevin Martin, noted that the assessors\u2019 findings had not caused Facebook to fail PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s overall evaluation: The assessors concluded that Facebook was operating \u201cwith sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance\u201d that it was protecting its users\u2019 privacy.It remains unclear whether Facebook has ever scrutinized how its partner companies handled personal data. A spokeswoman declined to provide any examples of the company\u2019s doing so.A BlackBerry official, who declined to discuss details of the companies\u2019 data-sharing agreement, said BlackBerry did not think that Facebook had ever audited its data use, but noted that BlackBerry\u2019s business model relies on protecting users\u2019 personal information.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Needs Amazon as Much as Amazon Needs Us", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street has dominated New York\u2019s economy for too long. Amazon\u2019s HQ2 is a huge opportunity to diversify.Mr. Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.For decades, experts have called for the diversification of the New York City economy. In the wake of postwar deindustrialization, our reliance on Wall Street and the financial industry in general had by the 1990s left our city disproportionately vulnerable to swings in the financial markets. We have experienced significant downturns that today feel like distant memories but could certainly return. I know this from my own experience as director of planning for Manhattan after Sept. 11. In those heady dark days, few spoke about gentrification or the supposedly ominous specter of new companies entering New York City. To the contrary, many worried that no one would build so much as a Quonset hut in this city again. Darker still were the memories of my older colleagues in city government, who helped rescue us from the nose-dive of the late 1970s, when New York City lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and crime ravaged our most vulnerable neighborhoods.It is for these reasons that we should welcome Amazon, but with a few caveats: To become true New Yorkers, the people at Amazon must abide by our implicit social compact, which is that New York City strives to be a place of opportunity for all. Amazon, the city and the state must build an \u201cinfrastructure of opportunity\u201d that creates both physical and social mobility for all New Yorkers, and they must do so with fiscal responsibility. While opinions differ regarding the incentive package offered Amazon, a few things are clear: Amazon obtained incentives available to any forward-looking large company seeking to relocate here. Second, government officials involved are confident that the deal will yield between $12 billion and $27 billion of direct economic benefit, which is many multiples of the incentives offered; and third, the incentives are part of the city and state\u2019s established budget to lure companies here \u2014 not money that would otherwise go to subways and schools. Beyond these incentives, government investments should be focused on significant improvements to the physical mobility of western Queens, including a reimagined subway, streetcar, bus, bike, scooter and ferry network. The agreement does establish an Infrastructure Fund using targeted tax revenue, but the details, time frame and scope for the improvements are murky and should be clarified. Amazon must participate as well \u2014 let\u2019s press those logistics experts less about a helipad and more about how they hope to transport thousands of workers to one of the most congested parts of our city. First steps have been made, along with commitments to make Amazon\u2019s new waterfront home accessible to the public in accordance with the Long Island City waterfront design guidelines. More significant is the potential to create a new paradigm for social mobility. We lost this along with our manufacturing base and never regained it by relying on Wall Street. Unsung treasures like LaGuardia Community College, Queensbridge Houses and the public schools and cultural institutions of Queens shouldn\u2019t be thrown the crumbs of this project. Amazon is proposing to locate in the most ethnically diverse county in the United States and near the nation\u2019s largest public housing project \u2014 the company\u2019s work force and campus must reflect the diversity around them. The current agreement with Amazon, which calls for $15 million to fund work force development and three years of direct engagement with Queensbridge Houses, is a good first step. More should be done, including a longer-term goal of 50 percent of all employees drawn from the borough. This is an enormous opportunity for Amazon to differentiate itself from its competitors by proving that it can help bridge what has become a gaping American class divide. Amazon will continue to be criticized about the way it held this competition, even though New Yorkers have long advocated more business growth outside of Manhattan. (Queens has a population similar to Chicago\u2019s but nowhere near the economic output.) Amazon will be criticized for its impacts on small retailers, although it arguably hurts big-box stores far more than mom-and-pops, which sell through Amazon. It will be criticized for being one of the world\u2019s richest companies, by both the left and the right. This isn\u2019t about one company. It is about fulfilling our collective dream of New York as a city of opportunity for millions of strivers of all colors, genders and creeds. Our new socioeconomic ladder appears to be digital, and we should embrace it, if \u2014 and only if \u2014 its creators have the tenacity and temerity to embrace us.Vishaan Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.Advertisement"}

I understand that in Florida people are planning recount parties that involve sitting around and drinking until January.How would you say the whole process worked? Well, it would be nice if every American had a right to vote that didn\u2019t involve standing in line in the rain for three hours.Also, we\u2019ve learned that voting for third-party candidates is a bad idea. It\u2019s sort of sad. Voters like to register dissatisfaction with their real options by checking off an attractive-sounding name. Like Green, or Libertarian, or Paper-Trained Puppies.All right, there isn\u2019t a Puppy party at this very moment, but it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201cA third party will always be a spoiler one way or the other,\u201d said Sean Wilentz, an expert on American political history at Princeton. In the end, Wilentz said, people who vote for a third party often wind up helping the candidate they\u2019d least like to see win.Take the Senate race in Arizona. On election night, it looked as if Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat with a history of supporting environmental causes, might lose because the Green Party siphoned off about 2 percent of the vote.A few days before the election the Green candidate, whose name happened to be Angela Green, actually announced she was supporting Sinema. But I think I speak for all Americans when I say that dropping out of a statewide race after the ballots have been printed and a lot of folks have already voted is not a good political strategy.It looks now as if Sinema may have squeaked out a win, although we\u2019ll have to wait until after recount party season to be sure. The Green Party says it had nothing to do with Angela Green being on the ballot, for reasons way too complicated to discuss over a weekend. Either way, nobody forced Arizona voters to decide that, in a critical and hard-fought battle for a major office, they\u2019d ignore the actual contestants and just go for Green/Green.Same story in Florida, scene of a very intense and hard-fought gubernatorial election between two guys from the opposite ends of the political spectrum. Yet a number of voters felt it was a good plan to go for other options \u2014 like a 34-year-old independent with a campaign war chest of $7,000 who nevertheless got 14,474 votes.Stay tuned. We won\u2019t know for sure about anything in Florida for a while, and probably a very messy recount or two or three.Pop Quiz: Why do they keep having election crises in Florida?A) The ghost of Ponce de Leon haunts the polling places.B) Floridians just like to watch people count stuff.C) Too much distraction from Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s shiny head.D) None of the above.I know you liked C, but the answer is none of the above. Florida\u2019s biggest problem is close elections. We almost never have these crises in New York because we have very few actual competitions. Believe me, if Kirsten Gillibrand had not gotten two-thirds of the vote in our Senate race, you would have a lot more complaining about the way damp ballots in New York City jammed the election machines.Why didn\u2019t anybody think of this before? \u201cWell, it\u2019s been used in Australia for 100 years,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a nonpartisan think tank.\u201cThey\u2019re not alike, but they\u2019re both terrible,\u201d he said at the time.Now this is the problem, people. Even if both candidates in a major election seem terrible, deep in your heart you know one is more terrible than the other. Refuse to acknowledge that, and you\u2019re skipping down the path toward Donald Trump.Two years ago, many Americans thought Trump was a lunatic and Hillary Clinton was a depressing rehash of everything that was uninspiring about the Democratic Party. In Michigan, 51,463 of them showed their disapproval by voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump won Michigan\u2019s 16 electoral votes by 10,704. Same basic story in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.The moral is that there are worse things than voting for the lesser of two evils. We wake up to him every morning.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that we \u201cshould\u201d get off Facebook.My students and I often study utilitarianism, the moral theory that asks us to measure pleasures and pains in seeking to promote the greatest good for the greatest number. From this perspective, Facebook is a scourge.The pleasures \u201cnormal\u201d Facebook use provides \u2014 keeping up with friends, baby pictures \u2014 are balanced out by the pains it engenders \u2014 weakened in-person social ties, depression.

Under prevailing international human rights norms, knowingly continuing to allow the vitriol to be posted turns Facebook into a \u201ccontributor\u201d to the heinous acts themselves.Facebook should now align its policies and practices with prevailing international human rights norms. If Facebook fails to do so, then the question in the headline will have answered itself. To the Editor:It is childish to turn what is nothing more than a tool or instrument into a scapegoat for our own moral failings. Almost as childish is the idea that it took Russian trolls to disrupt our elections, disseminate propaganda and promote hate. We were doing all of that just fine by ourselves. Ours has become an age of Puritan hysteria in which we suppress speech in the name of stamping out hate. Or worse, where we insist that Facebook (for its own survival) becomes the arbiter of what speech we the people get to hear and what we don\u2019t hear.To the Editor:I frequently see the complaint that participation in platforms like Facebook creates narcissistic behavior and encourages a self-centered society. It is true that people display themselves, their products, their likes and dislikes, loves and hates. People expose themselves in ways that can happen nowhere else.So what? Isn\u2019t it more narcissistic to believe that dropping out of Facebook is some kind of substantial statement about yourself? Facebook is just a mirror of the world we live in. Parts of it are like the fun house mirror at a carnival. If you don\u2019t like what you see in the distortions, take a close look at what you are putting in front of the mirror.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "St. Michael\u2019s, a Toronto All-Boys School, Is Rocked by Accusations of Sexual Assaults", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 St. Michael\u2019s College School had long been known in Toronto as a beacon of tradition, Catholic faith and elite hockey \u2014 until last week.One hazing video emerged online. Then another \u2014 this one capturing a young student being pinned down by schoolmates in a locker room and sexually assaulted with a broom handle.The videos and arrests have rocked the institution, prompting the resignations of both its president and principal, and torn a rift between students\u2019 parents and the school\u2019s deeply knit alumni, many of whom identify themselves as St. Michael\u2019s Men long after graduating, wearing their pride like their antique leather football jackets.Some say the videos have exposed a strain of toxic masculinity sewn into the all-male Catholic school reminiscent of the debate in the United States that sprang up around the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Others say this is not the school they knew and loved, which instilled in them the motto of the centuries-old order of Basilian priests: \u201cTeach me goodness, discipline and knowledge.\u201dAcross Canada, the front-page story has spurred calls for a deeper discussion \u2014 once again \u2014 about how Canadians are raising their boys.\u201cInstitutions like St. Mike\u2019s are hotbeds of power exploitation,\u201d said Jean-Paul B\u00e9dard, an elite ultramarathoner who has become a vocal advocate for victims since publicly disclosing a few years ago that he was sexually assaulted as a child. \u201cIt\u2019s a stratified tension-filled atmosphere of high school, amplified by sports.\u201dMr. B\u00e9dard played football at St. Michael\u2019s for two years in high school and was put through a \u201csexual hazing,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he predicted. \u201cIf I experienced it over 35 years ago, there has been a lot of other people who have gone through this.\u201dThe school, which includes grades seven through 12, was built by the Basilian order of Catholic priests from France in 1852, 15 years before Canada became a country. The priests believed athleticism was an essential part of education and by the early 1900s had developed a hockey program that became a training team for the National Hockey League.Together with an elite football program, the champion hockey team was seen as a defensive shield for the Catholic boys, growing up in a predominantly Protestant city, Mr. Colle said.While most private Catholic schools in the province have become public and opened their doors to women, St. Michael\u2019s stuck to tradition, raising its tuition rates, which now run around $15,000 (about 20,000 Canadian dollars) and pouring money into its sports programs.\u201cThis is not what our community is about,\u201d he added.Three days later, he handed in his resignation.St. Michael\u2019s, which has expelled eight students and suspended one other, has received two threats, including one about a bomb, and had police officers patrolling its halls. The names of those involved in the assaults have been shielded by the courts.It has opened a phone line for students to report assaults, is hiring a social worker and announced that it will form an independent committee to examine the institution\u2019s culture.Many parents and alumni come from generations of graduates and identity with the school as akin to family. Some consider the reported episodes outliers, and blame the media for its coverage.But as shock and defensiveness subside into sorrow, some have begun to demand a deeper soul-searching into how such demoralizing and abusive actions could become so normalized that boys would share them on social media.Long before the culture study begins, theories have emerged, pointing to Catholic denigration of homosexuality, the competitive machoism of sports, and whether the school\u2019s tradition of hiring alumni \u2014 long a point of pride \u2014 was part of the problem.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how hot the soup is when you are in the pan,\u201d Mr. B\u00e9dard said. \u201cThat is why we need outsiders to get in.\u201dMario Calla graduated from the school in 1970, and went on to run Costi Immigrant Services, a large nonprofit that helps new immigrants and refugees settle.\u201cThere are good questions that need to be asked,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are questions around \u2018do we need all-boys schools?\u2019 \u201dSpeaking out from Beijing, a recent graduate and class president, Liam Mather, demanded that the school work to explicitly expand the definition of manhood.He also pointed to a hypersexualized view of women that was \u201cmostly unchallenged by the school,\u201d an issue that he said he had been reflecting on since watching Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testify against Justice Kavanaugh.\u201cI was troubled by the media\u2019s portrayal of Kavanaugh\u2019s high school, an all-boys Catholic private school, where gross sexism was ingrained into the student body,\u201d wrote Mr. Mather, 23. \u201cIt haunted me because Kavanaugh\u2019s school reminded me of St. Mike\u2019s.\u201dHis trial was a public spectacle, leading to a national debate about toxic masculinity, self-reproach among women and the inadequacy of the legal system to resolve deeply rooted cultural problems. Long before #metoo hit Twitter, #beenrapedneverreported was crowding the internet in Canada.In response to the reported assaults, St. Michael\u2019s has canceled all group and team activities and its public performances for the rest of the year. Officials have reached out to its alumni network \u2014 more than 8,000 members strong, with branches as far as Dubai and Australia \u2014 seeking those with expertise in \u201cantibullying, bystander education and responsible digital citizenship\u201d to volunteer for workshops with students.Since the assaults were reported, Christine Nielsen says students at the school, including her son, have been called rapists in public and attacked online.\u201cThese kids are terrorized, they are being shamed and blamed,\u201d said Ms. Nielsen, who lost her composure with a reporter after attending a parents\u2019 meeting last week. A video clip of their encounter went viral on Twitter, where she was widely disparaged.Meanwhile, Toronto braces for more reports of assaults to be announced by the police.\u201cThere are so many things messed up in this,\u201d said Joe Mihevc, an departing city councilor who graduated from St. Michael\u2019s in 1972, and has a Ph.D. in theology. \u201cHow do you bring healing to this one?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Blankfein was still defending the firm he now chairs.\u201cI would say that we\u2019re pretty compliant,\u201d he said late Thursday afternoon at the DealBook conference in Manhattan. He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.On Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M. Solomon succeeded Mr. Blankfein as C.E.O. Mr. Blankfein, 64, has stayed on as senior chairman of the board through the end of this year. Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.On Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D. Cohn could have ever succeeded him as C.E.O., he was equivocal.\u201cI think his leaving coincided with a new administration,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t done him the favor of telling him when I was leaving at that point.\u201dAs to whether he would have done anything differently to help Goldman weather the financial crisis, he said more proactive public relations would have helped burnish the firm\u2019s image.\u201cOur mantra was our clients should have the exposure, not us. We\u2019re in the background,\u201d he said of the firm\u2019s approach to publicity in the pre-crisis years. \u201cThat hurt us a lot.\u201d\u2014 Kate KellyMaking a rare public appearanceThursday at the DealBook conference, the 47-year-old executive discussed the family\u2019s latest round of deal making and what it could mean for the family\u2019s other assets. In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.The sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201dThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.Fox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.Lachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone. It\u2019s to the coasts. But also everywhere in-between.\u201dHe cited figures that showed more Fox viewers are tuned to its sober news segments than the fiery opinion hours. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d he said.\u2014 Edmund LeePadma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement.But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one\u2019s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn\u2019t be driven by a man\u2019s being good at a certain job.It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience. The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.While Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.When asked if he was suggesting that social media should be regulated, Mr. Spiegel said only that there was much to learn from how Americans have thought about the responsibility of broadcasters in the past. The challenge, though, is identifying what, exactly, broadcasting is, he said.\u201cWe understand what one-on-one communication is, but let\u2019s say your Uncle Joe, for example, has some very extreme, maybe not so accurate, views on the world and he wants to reach 500 people. Is that OK? If he wants to reach 50,000 people, is that OK? If he wants to reach 100,000, is that OK? Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201dSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.The chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.As the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.That conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said that the company plans to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles in 2019, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market.\u201cWe\u2019re on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,\u201d Ms. Barra said, adding that the company had a strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, Ms. Barra said.She did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company has been testing in San Francisco.Autonomous vehicles rely on what Ms. Barra described as \u201ca suite of sensors,\u201d including radar, cameras and a technology known as lidar. G.M. is focused on advancements to lidar, which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds, she said.\u201cWe do believe in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced at the conference today that the company will be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year.\u201d That would be an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201dCost cutting will help. But Ms. Dubuc characterized the forthcoming changes as a way to become more efficient. \u201cWhen you have expansion everywhere, you\u2019re obviously going to have duplication everywhere too,\u201d she said.Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994 and has traded on its irreverent, brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, Vice now includes an advertising agency, a TV network, a film-production business and programs on HBO.Vice founder Shane Smith responded to the article by pledging a series of changes, including pay equity and reaching gender parity within the work force. In a statement, he said, \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201dMs. Dubuc praised Mr. Smith for his response.\u201cShane did a powerful thing and that was to take seriously the changes that needed to happen at Vice,\u201d she said, later adding that her being named aschief executive was an important signal for the company to send.\u201cI could have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d she said.\u2014 Edmund LeeFor someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.\u201cThese things are not black or white,\u201d he said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in New York.BlackRock has $6.5 trillion under management, giving it great influence over many of the world\u2019s top public companies. In a conversation that ranged from tariffs to bitcoin, Mr. Fink returned repeatedly to ideas about corporate accountability.\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny either,\u201d Mr. Fink said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dOther executives \u2014 including Mr. Dimon, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber \u2014 also dropped out of the event. Despite his refusal to attend what he called a \u201cvery public showcase\u201d of the kingdom\u2019s strengths, Mr. Fink said that BlackRock would continue to conduct business in Saudi Arabia, adding that he \u201cnever believed that decision would cost us all the business.\u201dBut he stressed that his attention to social responsibility is not a passing fad.\u201cI certainly never did this to be in vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re being asked.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuSteve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, concluded his presentation on Thursday with the results of a poll he recently helped run: 61 percent of the people surveyed cared about using researched facts to help form their opinions on policy, beating the 54 percent who said their values shaped their opinions.For Mr. Ballmer, that is central to a project he has been working on since he retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014 and has poured millions of dollars into: USAFacts, a nonpartisan database of federal, state and local government revenue and spending.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of four years trying to understand where government gets its revenue, where it spends its revenue,\u201d Mr. Ballmer told the audience on Thursday.In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr. Ballmer ran through some highlights of the types of data his website provides, hitting on hot-button issues in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Ballmer has called USAFacts \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual financial filings that companies make. In charts, Mr. Ballmer showed how he believes USAFacts can help Americans filter the increasingly convoluted noise.On immigration, for example, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States rose from about 10.5 million to 12.1 million in recent years, according to USAFacts\u2019 analysis of government data. The number of border agents has risen sharply from about 4,000 to 19,000 over the same period, while border apprehensions have decreased from roughly 1.7 million to 300,000, Mr. Ballmer said.The numbers raise natural questions, Mr. Ballmer said. Why are there more border agents today, fewer apprehensions, but more undocumented immigrants?\u2014 Mihir ZaveriDavid Gelles, Corner Office columnist at The New York Times, presented the findings of a DealBook conference task force on diversity in the workplace, characterizing it as a \u201creally lively discussion\u201d that could have gone on for hours. Nonetheless, \u201cwe made a remarkable amount of progress in an hour,\u201d he said.Among the conclusions of the report:\u2022 Aspirational goals are in general a good thing, but they\u2019re not enough, said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. Companies also need to be transparent in how they\u2019re achieving those goals. In addition, there can\u2019t be separate business and diversity scorecards \u2013 diversity needs to be part of the business.\u2022 Legislation and federal policies need to play a role. John Hope Bryant, founder and chief executive of Operation HOPE spoke about the need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships, and when the effort is especially aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get a double credit for that double reach,\u201d he said.\u2022 Companies have to realize diversity is a long-term goal, and it has to be baked into its culture. \u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it,\u201d it won\u2019t work, said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase. And everyone has to join the conversation, she said.\u2014Alina TugendRebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of New York Times, described the conversations of a DealBook conference task force, intended to establish guidelines on how to ethically implement A.I., as one of the \u201chighest level discussions she has ever seen\u201d about the technology.Among the conclusions of the panel:\u2022 Companies should take care to scrutinize their machine learning initiatives (and algorithms in general) for biases that may be passed on from their creators, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. These technologies should be developed with greater consideration for the public interest.\u2022 In New York City, when considering artificial intelligence in transportation, companies should be transparent with the data they use in order to ensure the technologies are a benefit to society, said Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer of the New York City Department of Transportation.\u2014 Mihir ZaveriA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the people shown.

{"Headline": "Apple Will Stop Revealing How Many iPhones It Sells. That\u2019s a Bad Sign.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has giant revenues, profit margins that are the envy of corporations everywhere and a stock market value of $1 trillion.Despite those obvious strengths, Apple told investors on Thursday that it would stop reporting numbers central to understanding the performance of its biggest business: selling iPhones.The company said it would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter. Without this data, investors will not be able to track the average selling price of iPhones, a crucial number for assessing whether consumers are balking at paying up for Apple\u2019s higher-priced phones.The decision, along with Apple\u2019s disappointing forecast for this quarter\u2019s sales, helped drive the company\u2019s stock price down more than 7 percent on Friday, a move that weighed on the wider stock market.Apple\u2019s move to cut back its disclosures also should serve as a jolt for all investors.For much of the year, investors seemed to ignore the warning signs hanging over large technology companies and pushed their stocks higher. Their plunge last month \u2014 Netflix\u2019s stock is down 26 percent from its high, and Amazon is off 19 percent \u2014 has most likely made investors more aware of the problems these companies face in their core businesses.But Apple\u2019s decision to make its iPhone sales less transparent may underscore the seriousness of these challenges. \u201cAn abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter,\u201d Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst for Nomura, wrote in a research note.Sales of iPhones have stalled in recent years. As a result, Apple has raised prices to bolster its iPhone revenue. The average selling price of an iPhone was $793 in the three months through September, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. Without the tally of phones sold, calculating the average selling price won\u2019t be possible, and outsiders will find it harder to gauge consumers\u2019 sensitivity to the price of iPhones. \u201cWe believe unit volumes and A.S.P.\u2019s are reflective of the loyalty and satisfaction consumers have in their devices,\u201d Mr. Kvaal wrote in his note, referring to average selling prices.Selling iPhones at a premium price to a relatively small portion of the global smartphone market has been at the heart of Apple\u2019s strategy. With less data, investors will probably find it harder to tell whether this approach remains successful.Other big technology companies have removed data from their regular financial reports. And some simply do not disclose figures that would be helpful in determining trends in their business. Twitter, for instance, does not provide the overall number of daily average users, a number that Facebook gives out.Facebook does not disclose Instagram\u2019s revenue, a number that would help investors understand the attraction of each platform to advertisers.Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, on Thursday contended that removing the data would not affect investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s performance. Over the last three years, he said, there was no correlation between price and the number of phones sold. And Apple said it would disclose new information, including the cost of sales for its two main businesses, called products (selling items like iPhones) and services (for instance, subscriptions to Apple music).But the new information may not make up for what\u2019s being taken away. Sales of iPhones accounted for nearly three-fifths of the company\u2019s revenue in its latest quarter. And the decision to stop providing iPhone sales comes at a pivotal time for smartphones. Sales of smartphones in more affluent countries are slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer. While sales are still growing in emerging markets, such as India, the handsets that dominate those markets are cheaper. So as the sales mix shifts to those countries, it could crimp profit margins.\u201cI think we\u2019re at peak smartphone,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, a tech sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hot Seat for Facebook, an Empty Chair for Zuckerberg and a Vow to Share Secret Files", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Officials from nine countries examining Facebook\u2019s business practices have spent weeks trying to get the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to face questions at a hearing.On Tuesday in London, Mr. Zuckerberg was represented by an empty chair.\u201cYou have lost the trust of the international community,\u201d said Charlie Angus, an official representing Canada. He was joined by policymakers from Argentina, Brazil, Ireland, Latvia, Singapore, France, Belgium and Britain.Anticipation had built in recent days after the British official who called the hearing, Damian Collins, hinted that he might also release secret internal Facebook documents. The documents were originally uncovered during a California lawsuit over data sharing between Facebook and the maker of an app called Six4Three, and are under seal in the United States.But Mr. Collins did not release the documents on Tuesday, saying he needed more time to go through them.That left most of the hearing\u2019s spotlight on Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for policy solutions, who attended the session in place of Mr. Zuckerberg and who sat next to the empty seat left for his boss.\u201cWe have damaged public trust through some of the actions we\u2019ve taken,\u201d said Mr. Allan, who later repeated variations of the same apology.He added, \u201cThere were things that we missed that we were either not sufficiently focused on or too slow to react to.\u201dBut policymakers at the hearing were less than satisfied. Several brought up Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s no-show.\u201cWe don\u2019t have Mr. Zuckerberg here today, which is incredibly unfortunate and I think speaks to a failure to account for the loss of trust certainly across the world,\u201d said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, another Canadian official.Others called for tougher regulations, including one member who suggested it was time to break up Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp.In a statement on Tuesday, Facebook said that \u201cthe engineer who had flagged those initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity.\u201d Facebook also released the emails.Other policymakers, alluding to other internal Facebook documents, asked whether the company had ever restricted app developers\u2019 access to user data unless the developer had purchased mobile advertising. The company does not engage in such quid pro quo arrangements, Mr. Allan said.Mr. Collins said he hoped to release the cache of internal Facebook documents within the \u201cnext week or so.\u201d The panel, he added, was still going through the papers to decide what was in the public interest to disclose and what information might need to be redacted to protect personal information.Mr. Collins has faced questions about the methods he used to obtain the Facebook documents, which he got last week by dispatching Parliament\u2019s sergeant-at-arms to force the founder of Six4Three, Ted Kramer, to share the information while on a business trip to London.In papers filed on Monday in California, lawyers for Mr. Kramer and Six4Three said Mr. Collins was put in touch with Mr. Kramer by Carole Cadwalladr, a reporter for The Guardian and The Observer.Both Ms. Cadwalladr and Mr. Collins \u2014 at times working in concert \u2014 had sought to persuade Mr. Kramer to provide documents under seal in the litigation, in violation of a California court\u2019s order. Mr. Kramer said that Ms. Cadwalladr was the only person he had told where he was staying in London, suggesting she may have alerted Mr. Collins.Ms. Cadwalladr didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Mr. Collins defended the committee, saying it has the jurisdiction to get information related to its inquiry on British soil.While both Parliament and the United States Congress have occasionally used their privileges to publish otherwise confidential materials, legal experts said it was rare \u2014 if not unprecedented \u2014 for a British lawmaker to use those powers to subvert the lawful order of an American court.\u201cNow you\u2019ve got a clash between the court in California and the obligations in Parliament,\u201d said Mark Stephens, a lawyer based in London who specializes in international litigation. \u201cWe do see things like this from time to time. But we\u2019ve never had a foreign court be put in this situation before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What actually happened, according to Nicholas Confessore, Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance of the NYT:When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden told the NYT. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201dStocks dropped again yesterday as investors worried about the future of big technology companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 2 percent.Apple remains a key concern. The company has a market value above $900 billion, so moves in the share price have an outsize effect on stock indexes \u2014 like the S&P 500 \u2014 that are weighted by market size.\u2022 Companies\u2019 capital spending jumped in the first and second quarters, but fizzled out in the third.\u2022 Corporate tax receipts have fallen by a third compared with last year, belying Republicans\u2019 promise that the cuts would pay for themselves. (The federal budget deficit is up 17 percent from last year.)\u2022 Wages haven\u2019t grown in inflation-adjusted terms, though Republicans say that will take time.Mr. Tankersley\u2019s and Mr. Phillips\u2019s conclusion: \u201cTen months after the law took effect, that promised \u2018supply side\u2019 bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus.\u201dEven so, it has been signed by 50 nations, 130 private sector groups (including many big American tech companies) and 90 charitable groups and universities.

{"Headline": "Why Democrats Must Impeach the President", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey won the House by promising to hold Trump accountable. Mr. Steyer is the founder of Need to Impeach and NextGen America.On Tuesday, voters across the country demanded accountability in government, insisting their elected representatives not just talk a good game but act in the interests of the American people.Nationwide, Democrats received 7 percent more votes than Republicans \u2014 about three million \u2014 in an election that saw a higher percentage of voters than any midterm since 1966. Those voters flipped seven governorships and 367 state legislative seats to Democrats, giving them majorities in seven more state chambers. Most important, voters ended Donald Trump and his Republican enablers\u2019 free rein in Washington by flipping the House.But this blue wave should have been even bigger. Democrats\u2019 inability to run the table on a Republican Party that depended on lying, race-baiting and suppressing the vote is a sign that the American people do not know what the Democratic Party stands for. We Democrats can begin to answer that question by acting to guarantee equal justice under the law.As President Trump continues to accelerate his lawlessness, the new Democratic House majority must initiate impeachment proceedings against him as soon as it takes office in January.For nearly two years, Mr. Trump has publicly flouted his oath of office. He has turned the presidency into a moneymaking enterprise for a family business he refuses to divest from, in direct violation of any plain reading of the Constitution. He is all but an unindicted co-conspirator in two federal felony cases. He has created an atmosphere of criminality through his hateful, violent rhetoric against political opponents, journalists and private citizens alike.Most egregiously, he has a longstanding pattern of obstructing justice. On Wednesday, he continued this by firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and installing Matthew Whitaker \u2014 who has publicly called for curtailing the special counsel\u2019s investigation \u2014 as acting attorney general, sparking a constitutional crisis that threatens the rule of law itself. Yet the current Democratic leadership has insisted that no one so much as mention the word \u201cimpeachment.\u201d Instead, they have suggested using Mr. Trump\u2019s abuses of power as bargaining chips in future negotiations.For too long, Democratic leaders have convinced their fellow elected officials that bland, nonconfrontational and incremental centrism is the way to win elections and make progress. In truth, it\u2019s just the easiest way to protect the balance of power in Washington. But by trying to meet a corrupt Republican Party halfway, instead of taking clear stands for what\u2019s right, they have failed to define the party and failed to protect their constituents. We see the same approach on impeachment: As a way to delay making a decision, Democratic leaders have insisted on waiting for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to deliver his report. But now the investigation is at risk, because Mr. Whitaker could prevent the special counsel\u2019s team from reaching a just conclusion or even releasing its findings to the public.The current, Republican-led Congress could have already taken action to shield Mr. Mueller or to put Mr. Trump in check. It still can. If it does not, House Democrats must prepare subpoenas, to be issued as soon as they take over, to ensure that the public learns the truth uncovered by the special counsel, and call on his team to testify under oath in public hearings. Should the establishment refuse to give up conventional orthodoxy and take up impeachment proceedings when the new Congress convenes, freshmen members \u2014 many of whom ran and won because of their promise to stand up to the president \u2014 must challenge the establishment and demand a say over the agenda. An overwhelming majority of people in this country elected them to hold this president accountable. There is no majority without them. That means no one has the votes for a leadership title without their support.We cannot allow this to be an argument about what Republicans will permit \u2014 it\u2019s about demanding the truth and protecting the foundations of our free society. Anything less would mean abandoning the Constitution.Tom Steyer is the founder of Need to Impeach and NextGen America.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Loneliness Is Tearing America Apart", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen people have a hole in their life, they often fill it with angry politics.Mr. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute.America is suffering an epidemic of loneliness.In the \u201csiloed,\u201d or isolated, worlds of cable television, ideological punditry, campus politics and social media, people find a sense of community in the polarized tribes forming on the left and the right in America. Essentially, people locate their sense of \u201cus\u201d through the contempt peddled about \u201cthem\u201d on the other side of the political spectrum.There is profit to be made here. The \u201coutrage industrial complex\u201d is what I call the industries that accumulate wealth and power by providing this simulacrum of community that people crave \u2014 but cannot seem to find in real life.Why are we becoming so lonely? One reason is the changing nature of work. Work is one of the key sources of friendship and community. Think of your own relationships; surely many of your closest friendships \u2014 perhaps even your relationship with your spouse \u2014 started in the workplace. Yet the reality of the workplace is rapidly attenuating, as people hop from job to job, and from city to city, as steady work becomes harder to find and the \u201cgig\u201d economy grows.Mr. Sasse worries even more, however, about a pervasive feeling of homelessness: Too many Americans don\u2019t have a place they think of as home \u2014 a \u201cthick\u201d community in which people know and look out for one another and invest in relationships that are not transient. To adopt a phrase coined in Sports Illustrated, one might say we increasingly lack that \u201chometown gym on a Friday night feeling.\u201dMr. Sasse finds this phrase irresistible and warmly relates it to his own life growing up in Fremont, Neb., a town of 26,000 residents. He describes the high school sports events on Friday nights that drew the townspeople together in a common love for their neighbors and community that made most differences \u2014 especially political differences \u2014 seem trivial. He relates with deep fondness the feelings he experienced, after moving away for a couple of decades for school and work, when he returned to Fremont\u2019s small-town life with his family, and the deep sense of belonging it created.That can be a tricky proposition for many of us. On reading the book, I asked myself where I might get that hometown-gym feeling, where I have natural roots, where I can imagine being buried. No specific place came to mind. I have no Fremont \u2014 not even Seattle, my hometown, which is a perfectly nice place, but one I unsentimentally left behind 35 years ago.All this is particularly germane to my wife and me at the moment, as we prepare to move from Maryland to Massachusetts in the coming months. We fear the loneliness we are sure to feel as we enter a completely new place where neither of us grew up or has ever lived. Is a thick community and the happiness it brings out of reach for rootless cosmopolitans like us?And there lies the challenge to each of us in a country suffering from loneliness and ripped apart by political opportunists seeking to capitalize on that isolation. Each of us can be happier, and America will start to heal, when we become the kind neighbors and generous friends we wish we had.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crossing From Asia, the First Americans Rushed Into the Unknown", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterThree new genetic analyses lend detail, and mystery, to the migration of prehistoric humans throughout the Western Hemisphere.Nearly 11,000 years ago, a man died in what is now Nevada. Wrapped in a rabbit-skin blanket and reed mats, he was buried in a place called Spirit Cave.Now scientists have recovered and analyzed his DNA, along with that of 70 other ancient people whose remains were discovered throughout the Americas. The findings lend astonishing detail to a story once lost to prehistory: how and when humans spread across the Western Hemisphere.The earliest known arrivals from Asia were already splitting into recognizably distinct groups, the research suggests. Some of these populations thrived, becoming the ancestors of indigenous peoples throughout the hemisphere. But other groups died out entirely, leaving no trace save for what can be discerned in ancient DNA. Indeed, the new genetic research hints at many dramatic chapters in the peopling of the Americas that archaeology has yet to uncover.\u201cNow, this is the grist for archaeologists,\u201d said Ben Potter of the University of Alaska, who was not involved in the new papers. \u201cHoly cow, this is awesome.\u201dEarlier studies had indicated that people moved into the Americas at the end of the last ice age, traveling from Siberia to Alaska across a land bridge now under the Bering Sea. They spread southward, eventually reaching the tip of South America. Until recently, geneticists could offer little insight into these vast migrations. Five years ago, just one ancient human genome had been recovered in the Western Hemisphere: that of a 4,000-year-old man discovered in Greenland. The latest batch of analyses, published in three separate studies, marks a turnaround. In the past few years, researchers have recovered the genomes of 229 ancient people from teeth and bones discovered throughout the Americas.

Other teams have come to broadly similar conclusions, though many questions remain.NorthernbranchSouthernbranchNORTHAMERICAAncient Montana boySpirit CaveSOUTHAMERICABy The New York Times | Source: Cosimo Posth et al., CellThe first, described in January by Eske Willerslev, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen, was an 11,500-year-old girl whose remains were found in eastern Alaska. The second was discovered hundreds of miles away, in western Alaska, and lived 9,000 years ago, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues reported on Thursday in the journal Science.One group turned and headed north, following the retreating glaciers into Canada and back to Alaska. The other branch took a remarkable journey south. The genetic data suggest that this group spread swiftly across much of North America and South America about 14,000 years ago. The expansion may have taken only centuries. \u201cIt\u2019s basically an explosion,\u201d Dr. Willerslev said. The man from Spirit Cave in Nevada belonged to this so-called southern branch of migrants. He also was closely related to a 12,700-year-old boy found on the other side of the Rocky Mountains in Montana, Dr. Willerslev also found.But the man from Spirit Cave also turned out to have a close genetic link to 10,400-year-old skeletons found in Brazil, on the other side of the Equator.David Reich of Harvard University and his colleagues found a similar pattern in their own research, published on Thursday in the journal Cell. \u201cWe agree that this must be a rapid radiation,\u201d said Dr. Reich.Starting about 9,000 years ago, both teams found, additional waves of people moved southward. Dr. Willerslev\u2019s research suggests the new arrivals mixed with older South American populations. Dr. Reich, on the other hand, sees evidence for two waves of migrants who completely replaced the people who had lived in South America. The new research also revealed instances of remarkable continuity, kinships that spanned thousands of years. Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues compared the genome of the man from Spirit Cave to those of four sets of remains found nearby in Nevada\u2019s Lovelock Cave, who lived as recently as 600 years ago. A similar bond was found in the Andes. John Lindo of Emory University and his colleagues analyzed DNA from seven people who lived at high elevations between 6,800 and 1,400 years ago.\u201cThis is not something that you see in most other regions of the world,\u201d said Dr. Reich.In 2015, Dr. Reich and his colleagues found that some living people in the Amazon carry some DNA that\u2019s most similar to that of people who live today in Australia and New Guinea. In their new study, Dr. Reich and his colleagues found no trace of Population Y \u2014 but Dr. Willerslev\u2019s team succeeded in identifying their DNA in some of the 10,400-year-old skeletons in Brazil.\u201cThe million-dollar question obviously is, how did this happen?\u201d Dr. Willerslev said.Perhaps another group of Asians entered the Americas long before the ancestors of the man from Spirit Cave and other early Native Americans. Maybe they interbred with people in the Amazon before disappearing altogether.Or perhaps a few of the early members of the southern branch happened to have some odd genes that survived through the generations.The new rush of genetic samples reflects an improving relationship between scientists and indigenous peoples. For decades, many tribes rejected requests for DNA from researchers.The man from Spirit Cave, for example, was dug up by archaeologists in 1940 and stored in a museum. The local tribe, the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone, didn\u2019t learn of the body till 1996. For years they fought for its repatriation.\u201cIt\u2019s utterly disrespectful,\u201d said Rochanne L. Downs, a member of the tribe\u2019s cultural committee. \u201cIf someone went into Arlington Cemetery and dug the grave of one of the soldiers and took their medals, there would be outrage.\u201dInitially, the tribe was opposed to looking for DNA in the skeleton, because scientists would have to destroy much of it. Dr. Willerslev met with the tribe and explained that he would require only a tooth and a small piece of ear bone. The tribe agreed to give him one shot at finding DNA in the Spirit Cave remains.Dr. Willerslev\u2019s results led the Bureau of Land Management to turn over the skeleton to the tribe. They buried the man from Spirit Cave at an undisclosed location last year.Ms. Downs wouldn\u2019t rule out similar studies in the future, but said each request would require careful consideration.\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be on a case-by-case basis,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main thing is our respect for the remains.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.A poll conducted in September by the Simon Wiesenthal Center found that while nearly half of Americans said they were talking about politics more than a couple years ago, a whopping 72 percent said they found it \u201charder than ever\u201d to talk about the subject with people holding different views. Twenty-seven percent said they\u2019d lost friends because of political disagreements.So, clearly, all of that division has been taking a toll. A few days after the election, we asked our readers to tell us how it has impacted your lives. You sent us tales of lost friendships, mixed marriages and tense family gatherings.Here are some of your stories, just in time for Thanksgiving dinner:My best friend, whom I entrusted my soul as my closest confidant for 35 years, joined the Trump Troupe during the presidential campaign. Our friendship began to unravel and even though we agreed to not discuss politics, we have not seen each other for 11 months (yet live 10 min. apart). Texts that are occasionally shared are all that is left holding the last shredded thread that connects us.The political war that Trump raged has permanently taken its toll and has done irreparable harm.My family has decided no politics period at any event or meeting. As the only Democrat in this generation, I can live with that because we would otherwise be at one another\u2019s throat as we were when we were all younger \u2026 We actually love and support one another, except when it comes to politics.Living in Seattle and being more conservative, there are a lot of friends and relatives who do not share this philosophy. One walked out during a party, after I told a political joke. One said if he\u2019d known that another old friend had been a Republican they wouldn\u2019t be friends.The despise of Trump is palpable here.I am married to a man who voted for Trump. And I love my husband. I voted for Hilary. I seem to run into Republicans everywhere I go. I actually like Republicans now \u2014 Bush never looked so good to me.In general, I wake up determined to look at how we are all the same rather than our differences, but I find it hard work. I lose sleep, I am bothered by the political tension and the huge divide in America. I am grateful for the ability to see all the division, as I think it was there all along, but not nearly as visible. It is as if Trump threw open the doors to the closed clandestine workings of power. One cannot change things one cannot see, so for that I am grateful. He just might actually make American great again, but not in ways he thought.To be fair, almost everyone has a litmus issue, a deal-breaker for whether a candidate (or a party) can be supported. I am very sad to admit that I now have a broader application \u2014 I assign character or intellect weaknesses to people based upon whether they endorse Trump. In previous elections and maybe halfway through the 2015-2016 campaign, I could understand why people would support almost any of the candidates. For the last couple years, I am profoundly disheartened when I learn that a friend or family member continues to support a man so clearly without character or morals.My wife voted Democratic. I voted Republican.

Ms. Hyde-Smith said the comment was a joke, but in Jackson \u2014 where Evers lived \u2014 voters said such issues were no laughing matter.\u201cMedgar died because of stuff like this,\u201d one Jackson woman, Verna Lee, told me.I headed for the house shortly after._____________________________________________________________ Margaret Kramer contributed to this newsletter.Thanks for reading.

McKinley, reveals photography\u2019s role as a tool or weapon when investigating identity and empowerment.Uncovering the beauty of African women and their worlds within fractured and layered colonial histories demands a special attention to detail. As the documentary photographer Laylah Amatullah Barrayn and the author Catherine E. McKinley know, many of the earliest images weren\u2019t meant to be seen as art. Yet they had a disturbing, global reach, fueled by the racism and voyeurism of unknown European photographers. And they trigger discomfort \u2014 if not outrage \u2014 to this day.Ms. McKinley started collecting when she was researching the uses and evolution of indigo cloth from colonial to postcolonial periods. Studying images by Seydou Keita and the fashions his subjects wore, she delved deeper and researched textiles and trade history on a journey that took her to 11 African countries. \u201cI would go to people\u2019s homes and they would let me look at their family albums,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would have multiple images and wouldn\u2019t mind giving me copies. Initially, I was intrigued by the social history around what they were wearing. I had a fixation with the images. Then, I started going online, looking for postcard dealers and antique shops.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always interested in agency,\u201d Ms. Barrayn said. \u201cColonial photographers used images for completely different intentions without the subject having any say in how the photograph was used. You can see the difference when a person in a photograph has agency. It\u2019s in their posture and expression.\u201dOluremi Onabanjo, a curator and scholar of photography and African art and former director of exhibitions at the Walther Collection, noted that the earliest images in the exhibition were historical documents from 1870. Recent developments have been significant for African photography and contemporary art, and also for female artists of African descent. Christine Eyene became the first African woman to curate two biennales in the same year; the German-Cameroonian Marie-Ann Yemsi curated the 11th Bamako Encounters at the National Museum of Mali; and Sandrine Colard was appointed artistic director for next year\u2019s Biennale of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ms. Colard is also preparing the exhibition \u201cThe Way She Looks: A History of Female Gazes in African Portraiture\u201d at the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto in collaboration with the Walther Collection.\u201cDoing the work of tracing agency and power relationships, acknowledging the place of black African women inside of these networks, is one of the largest honors one can do,\u201d Ms. Onabanjo said.\u201cAunty!\u201d unites female subjects from colonial photos with those by the celebrated contemporary African photographers Seydou Keita, Malick Sidib\u00e9 and James Barnor, highlighting post-independence partygoers, studio photography, vernacular images and contemporary renderings. Photos by Zina Saro-Wiwa (United Kingdom/Nigeria), Patricia Coffie (Ghana/United States), Fatoumata Diabate (Mali) and Thabiso Sekgala (Namibia) illuminate subjects who are African women and control their own image.Mr. Sekgala\u2019s portrait features a seated woman confidently wearing a Victorian dress. \u201cThere was a German-led genocide in Namibia in 1904 and 80 percent of the population was wiped out,\u201d Ms. McKinley said. \u201cThe woman in the photograph is part of a committee demanding reparations. I love the image because it\u2019s a Victorian dress, but the image expresses her resistance of the genocide.\u201dMs. Barrayn, who is a co-author of \u201cMFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora,\u201d hopes the exhibit challenges viewers to contrast how photography was used then and now. \u201cWe are talking about fetishizing the black woman\u2019s body and the agency of studio photography,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look at how colonial photographs were distributed around the world, without the subjects\u2019 permission, through postcard correspondence. It\u2019s important to see how powerful photography is in shaping how people think about black women and also how it can be used as a weapon or as a tool for empowerment and shaping identity. We have new ways of making photographs and disseminating photographs. Not everyone had access to the equipment back then. But now everyone does. Ownership and authorship of imagery has shifted.\u201dFayemi Shakur is a writer and visiting lecturer at Rutgers University-Newark.

The penalties for tax evasion include a fine as well as up to 10 years of imprisonment.Speaking from Washington, D.C., where she received an award from the International Center for Journalists on Thursday evening, Ms. Ressa said an indictment \u2014 which the government has said could come as soon as next week \u2014 would have a chilling effect on reporters in some of the most dangerous places around the world.\u201cThis is really transforming our democracy and yet another blow,\u201d Ms. Ressa said on Friday. \u201cIt is meant for maximum impact of intimidation.\u201dSince taking office in 2016, Mr. Duterte has threatened to block the renewal of a license for the country\u2019s largest broadcast network, called reporters who ask him tough questions \u201cspies\u201d and warned that \u201cjust because you\u2019re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.\u201dMr. Duterte is one of a handful of populist and increasingly authoritarian leaders around the world who have turned on the media and accused reporters of deceit and \u201cfake news,\u201d echoing a phrase used by President Trump.In the Philippines, some of those attacks have been more literal than rhetorical as Mr. Duterte used government institutions and the law to pressure journalists.Mr. Duterte\u2019s hostility toward the publication has been apparent since soon after he took office.A former mayor from the southern city of Davao, Mr. Duterte ran for president as a blunt antidrug populist. He executed a brutal campaign against drug dealers and users, leading to the deaths of thousands and prompting outcry overseas. Rappler became one of the administration\u2019s biggest critics, writing stories that raised questions about the violence.Mr. Duterte used his first state-of-the-union address in 2017 to single out Rappler, accusing it of being foreign-owned without giving any evidence. Not long after, the country\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into the ownership structure.In January, the government revoked Rappler\u2019s license, prompting accusations by rights groups and activists that the speed of the decision showed it was politically motivated. Rappler appealed and continued to operate from overseas.\u201cIt\u2019s virtual assassination,\u201d Ms. Ressa said in an interview this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a smear campaign. \u2018You\u2019re biased, you\u2019re corrupt, you\u2019re owned by Americans,\u2019\u201d she said, quoting Mr. Duterte.A veteran reporter and former CNN bureau chief, Ms. Ressa has covered wars and talked to terrorists, but she described the past two years as the most challenging in her multidecade career.She has since traveled the world, attending journalism industry events to bring awareness to the battle in the Philippines between the media and the government.Ms. Ressa created Rappler in 2012 after persuading three friends to leave their high-powered jobs at other news organizations. The women shared an optimism that the internet would create a more level playing field and give a platform to those without a voice.They also had years of experience tackling thorny issues. Ms. Ressa, who had negotiated the release of three staff members kidnapped by a Qaeda group in 2008 when she was head of ABS-CBN, the national broadcaster, has written two books on terrorism.Chay F. Hofile\u00f1a, who is head of investigations at Rappler, has written about media corruption, and Glenda Gloria, managing editor, about military corruption.They built their careers in the wake of the \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt that brought down the regime of President Ferdinand E. Marcos and ushered in Corazon Aquino, the first woman to become president of the Philippines. They have been arrested and threatened with death. A black funeral wreath was once delivered to Ms. Gloria\u2019s family door. Lilibeth Frondoso, Rappler\u2019s head of multimedia, was once thrown in prison with her newborn child.Now the future of Rappler and journalism in the Philippines is less certain than ever.\u201cNext,\u201d Ms. Ressa said, \u201cwill be an arrest warrant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The president made clear his commitment to the use of the exclamation point, if not to truth and justice: \u201cIt could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d When Mr. Trump did briefly note Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u2014 \u201ca terrible one\u201d \u2014 the president repeated Saudi slanders that the journalist was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and an Islamist, disingenuously adding that this did not affect his thinking. It\u2019s not the first time Mr. Trump has suggested that this is not someone for whom America should jeopardize its interests.In the absence of leadership from the president, it falls to Congress to take action and protect America\u2019s standing in the world. Mr. Trump knows he is on a collision course with the legislature: His statement concludes with a challenge to members of Congress who \u201cfor political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction\u201d to go ahead and try.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the causes of human rights, justice and truth demand that no one in Saudi Arabia, certainly not the crown prince, escape accountability.Your move, Senator Graham.

{"Headline": "Springsteen, Sweat and the Salt Air: Your Memories of the Stone Pony ", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReaders shared stories about the New Jersey rock club, the place Bruce Springsteen called his \u201chome away from home.\u201dThere were marriages forged, nights that turned into mornings, and rock stars spotted and worshiped. Responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.In June 1982, I finished my sophomore year of college in Florida. On my final day of classes, my head was focused on exams, but my 19-year-old heart was already on summer break at the New Jersey shore.To reach my promised land on time, I swore I\u2019d drive all night. My friends had given me a heads-up that Bruce Springsteen was making surprise appearances at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park on Sunday nights with the house band, Cats on a Smooth Surface. I couldn\u2019t miss that opportunity.In my 1967 Ford Galaxie convertible, I sped the 1,100 miles up Interstate 95. My lasting memory from that nonstop drive from Orlando, Fla., to Jersey was one infectious song that floated hourly from my FM radio: \u201cFrom Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),\u201d sung by Dave Edmunds.I arrived Sunday at my mom\u2019s house in West Long Branch, about seven miles from Asbury Park. I took a nap, a shower, gave mom a hug and wolfed down her specialty of mussels marinara. Larry, Greg and I entered the Stone Pony to the pop sounds of Cats. This band was fronted by Bobby Bandiera, a shore music mainstay for years to come. We bought Miller Lite longnecks and watched them play.After 1:30 a.m., Greg excitedly blurted, \u201cHe\u2019s HERE! I was next to him at the urinals!\u201dMinutes later, pandemonium as Springsteen takes the small stage with Cats. The crowd pushes in. Standing on the dance floor, we\u2019re 12 feet from our local hero. To my wonder, one of the first songs is \u201cFrom Small Things,\u201d the catchy tune from my overnight trek.\u201cI love this song!\u201d I shout into Greg\u2019s ear. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s covering it.\u201dGreg sets me straight: \u201cBruce wrote this song. It\u2019s HIS song!\u201dBig things, indeed, came that magical summer. We saw Bruce four more times at the Pony, each set featuring vintage covers from Chuck Berry and the like. It was electric, a concoction of Springsteen\u2019s energy and a sweaty throng in a boardwalk bar.Aug. 22, 1987. My cousin and I are visiting Asbury Park, from Italy, with the secret hope to meet Bruce. The Pony is closed, and we can\u2019t get in for the evening show since we are just 18. But we sneak in an open door and ask a man if we can at least take a couple of pictures of the place. He says no problem.A couple of minutes after, he says, \u201cBut why don\u2019t you take a picture of him?\u201d We turn, and we can\u2019t believe our eyes. Bruce has just come inside. It\u2019s just the four of us, and we ask if we can take a picture with him. \u201cSure!\u201d he says. He\u2019s the kindest and most down-to-earth guy.Jan. 6, 2018. After 30 years of hearing about this iconic venue and wishing on hundreds of occasions that I could teleport myself there, I finally made the long trek from Australia for the Light of Day festival. Any Springsteen fan in Australia knows this venue. It\u2019s like a shrine to us, our mecca. We all dream of being inside and soaking up some of the musical history that has become folklore to us. I ran into another Aussie friend who was there: \u201cCan you believe we are at the Stone Pony? We\u2019re not at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. \u201d When I arrived it was foggy and wet, but the boardwalk at Asbury Park was just as I imagined it would be. I arrived early in the day, and at first wondered why so few fans were waiting in line. Did they know something I didn\u2019t? I worried Springsteen might be on tour elsewhere. Once we were let in, other local bands played throughout the day and into the night. I didn\u2019t know most of them, as my local scene was far away in Canada. The crowd thickened throughout the evening, with intense anticipation in the air. The stage went black around 10 p.m., and when a roadie brought out a certain beaten-up Fender Telecaster and set it on its stand, I knew Bruce would play after all. Around the time of my divorce, Clarence Clemons died. The juxtaposition of his death, my divorce, and Father\u2019s Day, remains one of thousands of fond Asbury Park memories. On the Sunday after his death, an impromptu memorial was erected as fans gathered in front of the Stone Pony. I had recently met Clarence at an after party at a restaurant on Cookman Avenue, as he was in town for a film festival and I had taken a shot of him. This would be my addition to the pile of offerings. As I was on my drive down to the Pony, I received a call from my children, who were with their dad for Father\u2019s Day: \u201cDaddy says he will drive us down to AP to be with you. He knows you are sad today.\u201d My children and their father found me near the stage. There we sang, danced and were swept up in the magic of the moment and of the place. I count myself among the lucky patrons who have been graced by the ghosts shut up in the bones of that place. I saw many shows at the Pony in the \u201970s and \u201980s. Southside Johnny, George Thorogood, Twisted Sister, but my recollection of them is a bit, let\u2019s say, hazy. After a long hiatus, in the summer of 2016, I returned with my then girlfriend, now wife, Laura, to see the Struts. It was a magical night. I felt all the old ghosts of the Jersey Shore past. If walls could talk, and objects have a soul, then yeah, the Pony was speaking to me.We planted ourselves against the front bar with a good view of the stage. I asked Laura if she was O.K. here, cause we weren\u2019t moving until the show was over. No need to worry about getting to the bathroom, because anything we drank we sweated right out. It was stifling hot, loud, crowded and superb. As the crowd drifted out of the bar, we lingered for just a bit, our ears ringing, our faces smiling, our belief that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll really can save your soul reaffirmed. We downed our last beer, tipped the bartenders generously \u2014 they earned it \u2014 and headed out. We strolled across the street onto the beach, the moon glistening off the ocean, the waves rolling in hypnotically, soothing our senses. We climbed atop a lifeguard chair, her head on my shoulder, the salt air filling our lungs, our ears ringing the echoes of a night we will never forget. I complain a lot about living in Jersey \u2014 the high taxes, the traffic, the torrid pace of life. But it\u2019s moments like that night that make it all worth while. I don\u2019t know anywhere else on this good earth we could experience a night like that. Jersey born and bred, baptized in the sweat, smoke and sounds of the Stone Pony. Wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything in the world. Jersey rules. You got a problem with that? Cause I sure as hell don\u2019t.On Sept. 11, 2010, I was newly 20 years old and packing up my car to move back to Brooklyn for the winter. The summer was over. The car was mostly packed when I got a text from my aunt. Five words: \u201cBruce is at the Pony.\u201d I slammed the trunk, yelled to my brother that he\u2019s going to have to wait a few hours, and sped down Ocean Avenue.The intersection at Second and Ocean in Asbury Park was completely full of people, dancing along to the barnburner that was happening inside. Not content with staying outside, and with the confidence of my youth, I walked straight up to the front door, ignoring the bouncer. The bouncer didn\u2019t ignore me, though, and I was back on the street. Time passed, songs were played, and I could not find an opening to get through that front door. It was a party on the streets of Asbury Park that night, but I was not satisfied until I would get inside that fortress of cold, white brick.When the opening to \u201cRosalita\u201d rang out, I panicked. I can\u2019t miss \u201cRosie.\u201d I walked around the building, through the parking lot, up to the green fence that surrounds the SummerStage, which was closed for the season. I figured I could jump it. Worst case scenario, I get arrested. But before I attempted the climb, I tried the door.It was open.Ended up in the back of the crowd just in time for \u201cRosalita, jump a little higher.\u201d 2015. Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes played two themed shows at the Stone Pony. The Feb. 28 show was \u201cProve It All Night: the Music of Bruce Springsteen.\u201dThe Pony was packed that night. So packed that I decided to stand in the back by the kitchen to watch the show. Midway through the show, this woman comes to where I am, obviously too hot and crowded for her as well, and decides to watch the show from the same spot. She was dancing and having the time of her life. We caught eyes a couple of times, but I couldn\u2019t figure out where I knew her from. After a couple of more songs I started to walk away, and as I did she called me by name and reminded me that we were in the same Springsteen Facebook group. We spoke for an hour or so. The Pony would turn out to be the venue for many other events where we would hang out together. We are now engaged to be married. April 17, 1977. The Jukes were scheduled to play, and a friend and I are there with some photos we had just taken in March at a Bruce concert in Boston. The club was packed, and the Jukes hadn\u2019t started playing yet, so we moved near the back bar where it was slightly less crowded. After a short while, we see Bruce squeezing through the crowd and taking a seat at the back bar. After working up our nerve, we approached him and asked if he\u2019d like to see our photos.He answered that with the crowd at the bar, it would be hard to look at them without them getting all messed up. Just as disappointment was about to set in, he says, \u201cFollow me.\u201d He led us through a door to the backstage room. After looking through the photos, he autographed a few.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "List of Missing in California Fire Is Over 1,000 People. Here Is How They\u2019re Being Counted.", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the death toll continues to rise in the deadliest wildfire in California history, the sheriff of the Northern California county where the fire still rages said on Friday that more than 1,000 people were still missing, a startling increase from previous lists.As of Friday, 71 people had been confirmed dead in the fire, which swept through the city of Paradise and surrounding areas on Nov. 8. Around 500 specialists and more than 20 cadaver dogs are combing the incinerated hills and gullies of the wooded community for human remains.The new list of the missing, which stunned even officials who have surveyed the devastation and were expecting the worst, raised questions about who is on the list and how it was compiled.A new list of the missing had hundreds more names than a list released earlier. Why did it increase so dramatically?Sheriff Kory L. Honea of Butte County said his staff revised the list by adding every person described as missing in every 911 call they had received since the fire started, including during the panicked moments when it first descended on the area.\u201cI give you the best information that I have now,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWe are not going to wait for perfect to impede progress.\u201dThe sheriff said Friday that officials had accounted for about 330 people on a prior list of people who were unaccounted for, but the total still grew on Friday as more names were added.\u201cThis is a dynamic list,\u201d Sheriff Honea said. \u201cIt will fluctuate both up and down every day.\u201dWhy put people on the list if the sheriff is not sure that they are actually missing?The list includes people who may not know they were reported missing. Sheriff Honea said his hope was that people who were safe and had wrongly been classified as missing would check the list and call the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201cWe are finding that there are a lot of people who don\u2019t know that we are looking for them,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThat is why we are publishing this list.\u201dIs there a pattern in the people listed as missing?Many are older. Of the 246 people for whom ages were given, more than 200 were over 60. The youngest person on the list is 20 and the oldest is 101.\u201cLike any community, we had elderly folks and some of them gave up driving or can\u2019t drive,\u201d Chief Reinbold said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of reasons for people not having the ability to evacuate on their own.\u201dHow reliable is the list?Has anyone on the list been found?A search through Facebook seems to indicate that at least a dozen people who survived the fire are on the missing list.David and Frances Neil are listed as missing on the Butte County list, but the couple\u2019s daughter-in-law, Domonique Neil, said they were \u201csafe and with family.\u201dWhen contacted by The New York Times, Ms. Neil said she was not aware that the couple were listed on the Butte County list. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of lists going around,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep track.\u201dThe experience of the Neil family and others erroneously reported as missing highlights one possible shortcoming of the system: those who are safe have no incentive to check the list and help correct it.Do officials have any estimates of what the final death toll might be?California has never seen a fire like this. Law enforcement officials are very reluctant to guess.Chief Reinbold said he had no way of predicting what the final numbers would be. But he prays it\u2019s nowhere near the hundreds of people on the list: \u201cNobody wants that number to be that high.\u201dSarah Mervosh contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Acosta: When Showboats Collide", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe codependent love-hate relationship between Trump and the media. Ms. Mangu-Ward is the editor in chief of Reason magazine.Getting into a public feud with the Trump White House is the best thing that could happen to CNN.The drama started when two of the nation\u2019s biggest showboats collided. Like all nautical disasters, the wreck happened slowly, then all at once. Knowing it was coming didn\u2019t make it any less mesmerizing. You\u2019ve probably seen the footage: an unwelcome question to the president from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, a tussle over a microphone, and then a testy denunciation from the bully pulpit. Later, a pulled press credential for Mr. Acosta, a series of recriminations, a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch, and then everyone called their lawyers.On Friday, a United States District Court judge temporarily restored Mr. Acosta\u2019s access to White House grounds. The ruling, however, was just the first stage of a long legal fight, and only a fool would underestimate Donald Trump in a drawn-out, vindictive lawsuit.Both sides are eager to paint the battle as a contest of good versus evil, where the very fate of truth and the future of the republic hang in the balance.In fact, what we are witnessing is a sick symbiosis, in which Mr. Trump is a golden goose and the Washington press corps is operating a 24-karat omelet station.What is markedly different now is the medium through which the public experiences these snipe-fests. We are all watching them. In real time, and then over and over again on repeat. And with a president as polarizing as this one, who never finds a shortage of sparring partners in the media, the temptation to binge watch is irresistible.For a sense of how much this can change what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s useful to look back at how cameras changed another piece of Washington business: Congress.Other than the outcomes of actual votes, vanishingly little news occurs where cameras are present. The real work of lawmaking is done elsewhere.Likewise, actual scoops are rarely obtained in the White House briefing room. Looking for news in a televised news conference is like looking for your lost contact lens under the streetlamp because that\u2019s where the light is. We all stare mesmerized at our screen, trying to slake the endless thirst for political news in our need to understand this administration\u2019s actions. The vital function of actually inquiring into the doings of the president and receiving information about the same has been shunted into side rooms and private chats. (Where, by the way, many very talented and undercompensated journalists labor valiantly.)Instead, for some, the briefing room has come to serve as a weird hybrid contraption for self-promotion \u2014 part soapbox, part springboard. Reporters can burnish their credentials before heading off to gigs as talking heads.Even after two years of this administration, it is alarming to hear a president refer to the press as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d and to consistently attack and undermine the media as it tries to hold him to account. It\u2019s especially jarring when he singles out individual reporters for criticism.In an interview after their confrontation, Mr. Trump strongly suggested that Mr. Acosta\u2019s aggressive style was motivated by personal financial gain. \u201cHe gets paid to do that,\u201d the president said. Mr. Trump said of reporter April Ryan, \u201cshe gets publicity and then she gets a pay raise or she gets a contract with CNN.\u201d This is ungenerous, to say the least.But this isn\u2019t an epic drama. It\u2019s a reality show. And like reality shows, it doesn\u2019t have a hero.The continual presence of cameras has a way of eroding public affection for whatever they are trained on, while paradoxically increasing appetite for the subject matter. (See: The Real Housewives of Every Single City in America.)Was there ever a time when Americans believed their elected officials to be benevolent and omnipotent and their journalists to be objective and omniscient beings? Those 1979 confidence figures aren\u2019t exactly overwhelming. But the benevolent and objective myth benefits the powerful, not the people. Puncturing it is not a loss for civility; it\u2019s a gain for reality.Lies need to be countered by truths, certainly, and that\u2019s something Americans have looked to the press to do in the past. But the same forces that buoyed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign have distorted news coverage toward sensationalism and away from sobriety.The best-case scenario, of course, would be for both elected officials and the Fourth Estate elites to be as pure as driven snow, in both action and intention. But that\u2019s unlikely to happen, as all of those positions are occupied by human beings.There are genuinely serious questions at stake right now about civil rights, debt, redistribution and the future of state power. But neither the press nor the politically powerful stand to gain much by grappling with those problems on TV, and they are tacitly willing to remain locked in a vicious cycle as long as it means they don\u2019t have to deal with the really sticky stuff.Which leaves us in a second-best scenario: If powerful politicians and powerful journalists can all, on occasion, be venal, petty and vain, it\u2019s far better that the American people should have every opportunity to see that for themselves. That way, they will know to take every bite they are spoon-fed with a grain of salt.Katherine Mangu-Ward is the editor in chief of Reason magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping This Fluffy, Fragile Beast Alive", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA veterinarian told them that rabbits, under stress, tend to die quickly and easily. They hoped their rabbit \u2014 and their new love \u2014 would prove more resilient.She\u2019d moved to town four months ago and still hadn\u2019t unpacked. Cardboard boxes lined the walls of her apartment, as if making way for the large cage in the center. \u201cIt\u2019s Judy!\u201d Ashley said, flinging her arms in the cage\u2019s direction.I wasn\u2019t sure how to greet a rabbit. \u201cHiya, Judy,\u201d I said in my dog voice. I waved.Judy did not seem impressed. She raised her ears from a head that remained at rest atop two rolls of dewlap and twitched her nose as if to swipe me aside.Layered in her own surfeit of furs, Judy carried herself like a czar in minks. Ashley opened the cage, and Judy allowed me, as if paying obeisance, to touch her spotted coat. \u201cAm I not the softest thing in the world?\u201d she seemed to ask.I expected things to warm between Judy and me, but I didn\u2019t know how to court a rabbit. I rabbit-sat for Ashley (just as a friend) a couple of times over the next months when she was out of town. This entailed providing Judy with kibble, romaine and twice daily hay. I would read on Ashley\u2019s couch while Judy hopped around, greasing the legs of the coffee table with her chin, marking her territory against me.Ashley had told me I would be able to wrangle Judy back into her cage if I made a bloop sound, so I waddled after her bloop-blooping and shooshing the air with my hands, but Judy would not let herself be harried by bloops like mine.The first day I made the mistake of picking her up, as I had seen Ashley do many times. (Judy allowed herself to be carried like a baby, feet up, in Ashley\u2019s arms.) But unworldly thigh strength hid beneath Judy\u2019s soft pelt, and she immediately bounded off, leaving deep purple scratches on my wrists.Judy eyed me the whole chaste year I spent hanging out at Ashley\u2019s apartment, as if questioning what I thought I was doing there.A few days after Ashley and I finally kissed, she called me in tears. Judy\u2019s cage was soaked with blood.We rushed her to the vet, where they cut her open, removed several afflicted organs and sewed her up again. While we waited, the vet said that rabbits often did not wake from surgery.Rabbits don\u2019t like pain, the vet said. Too much stress and they tend to quit.I found myself feeling envious of rabbits as the vet explained Judy\u2019s fragile physiology. Natural selection hadn\u2019t equipped me with a way to grant myself an easy death. But rabbits, apparently, were adept at having quick heart attacks when under mortal threat. I wondered how Judy would decide: Tough it out or fold?It was spring. The nights I had imagined with Ashley were not set at Bright Eyes & Bushy Tails Veterinary Hospital, but when Judy finally woke, Ashley\u2019s joy was all-embracing.The vet, though, did not seem relieved. Judy wasn\u2019t eating and drinking, and until she did, we had to fear a condition called gastrointestinal stasis, in which a rabbit\u2019s digestive system shuts down and the animal slowly bloats to death. I watched Ashley\u2019s face go ashen again and wondered if she really wanted me here for this. Something in me said: \u201cBack away.\u201dGood relationships, it seemed to me, were based on mutual niceness, a gentle zone where friends and partners lived out their affections. The rabbit had not been especially nice to me, not compared with golden retrievers I had known, and I didn\u2019t feel like being that nice to her, not since she chewed through my MacBook cord. Now the vet was handing me several IV rehydration bags and a mix of mealy food paste we were supposed to force-feed to a rabbit that I doubted even wanted me in her life.But it was a two-person task to administer her critical-care rabbit food, a powdered blend of timothy grass and soybean hulls to be mixed with warm water and syringed thrice daily past Judy\u2019s unfriendly teeth. Listening to the vet\u2019s instructions, I understood I was conscripted.Judy\u2019s mealtimes were small sagas. Ashley would lie on the floor and press her forehead against Judy\u2019s to calm her. Judy would then let herself be picked up and swaddled in a bath towel. Ashley would tenderly elevate the bundled rabbit to the couch, where I would hold Judy against the cushion like a football while Ashley tried to get a syringe nib past her lip.At the first whisker grazing, Judy would hunch powerfully backward, hiding her face in the towel. If the syringe neared again, she would buck and bolt from the couch altogether.It was infuriating to be angry at a rabbit. Couldn\u2019t she understand I was trying to save her life? I could, of course, muscle her down against the couch cushion if I had to, but she fought me so fiercely that I worried she would pull her stitches out.Ashley and I screamed at each other as we took turns trying to pry up Judy\u2019s lip and slip in the pasty nutrients: \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt her!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll die if she doesn\u2019t eat!\u201d And in the middle of it all, we would start fighting about why it had taken me a year to kiss her.As I cleaned the spilled rabbit food from the couch cushions, I thought about the couches of my life, all the times I had been wedged between parents to be told about a death or divorce. I could remember the couches more clearly than the talks. On this couch, Ashley and I were already having fights grievous enough to ensure I would remember this fabric forever, no matter how short our romance proved to be.I watched Ashley rolling her forehead against Judy\u2019s or barely smoothing the fur between her eyes. Judy didn\u2019t hop away or hunch back or even blink. She didn\u2019t look comfortable, but she seemed to know she was loved. That didn\u2019t mean she had to pretend to enjoy every minute or love the meal paste we were forcing her to eat.\u201cO.K., it\u2019s time,\u201d I said after a while, because food had to be followed by drink. Ashley picked Judy back up and pet her while I hung an IV bag from the lamp. The needles were fearsome, wide as cocktail straws. When Judy was ready, Ashley squeezed my hand and nodded. Neither of us could watch as I pinched a tent of skin from Judy\u2019s back and jabbed the needle in.Judy flinched but stayed. We opened our eyes and looked at each other. Then we switched on the drip.A rehydrated rabbit is a funny thing. We joke about Judy\u2019s dromedary days still, how she would drag her fluid-filled lump across the living-room floor, taking uncertain, lopsided hops that audibly sloshed.Two months ago we got married, and in thinking about the forever thing, I have been remembering the vet\u2019s talk: how, beyond some threshold of pain and stress, rabbits tend to quit. I suppose it remains to be seen whether Judy is invincible. Probably she isn\u2019t. But possessed of the ability to stop her heart at any time, she consistently chooses to stick around.Judy outlived that couch, which got torn up in a move, and another couch too, which we left behind in Denver when we moved to France, where Ashley has work.Judy (and Roberta too, our second rabbit) live in Paris now. The apartment we rented came with a bright red couch, and quite possibly we will have to swaddle Judy and pin her against it to dose her with something she doesn\u2019t like. Ashley or I may have to spend an angry solo night on the red couch from time to time. But we like it \u2014 for fights or, you know, making up. For watching the rabbits hop around the floor.Our friends and family advised us that international travel with rabbits sounds like an avoidable torment, and of course they are correct. But so what? Love entails plenty of those. Opt out too often and you opt out of the thing itself.Not us. Our love is a tough little monster. Also the softest thing in the world.Advertisement"}

Because if you\u2019re not going to talk about your feelings, you may as well eat them.Much like your weird uncle\u2019s theories about everything from immigration and climate change to the actual shape of our planet, this undercooked dish will be very difficult to swallow.You don\u2019t have to do everything yourself. Ask for help! Specifically, ask that same weird uncle to bake the casserole he thinks you want. Expect avocado toast, bits of tofu, Sour Patch Kids, Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, L.S.D., and, of course, Medicare for All.Brussels sprouts and a bowl of toxic waste. Which side is better? Which is worse? No one will be able to decide, or even tell the difference between these two equally stunning preparations.Cut one tiny sliver from your pumpkin pie. Divide that sliver even further and distribute among your family. The rest of the pie should go directly to your wealthiest relative. He\u2019ll now decide whether to share it, mark it up and resell it, or just keep it in some vault until he dies.Everyone loves Thanksgiving leftovers piled high on a sandwich the day after the big meal. Why not have your family members demonstrate that love by paying a small fee for a doggy bag of everything they didn\u2019t eat? If your little nephew can\u2019t afford it, encourage him to start a GoFundMe. It\u2019s time he learned that America is more than a country \u2014 it\u2019s a business. Why shouldn\u2019t family be too?Walter Green, a designer, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cHow to Eat Everything.\u201d Victor Kerlow is an artist and professor at the School of Visual Arts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Branzino, a Mediterranean Fish, Is Being Farmed in Connecticut", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIdeal Fish is banking on technology to provide a fresher, more sustainable source of the popular fish.WATERBURY, Conn. \u2014 Branzino can be found these days on restaurant menus from Seattle to Atlanta. The flaky, tender, silver-skinned fish \u2014 also known as European sea bass, or loup de mer \u2014 has become a fixation for chefs and diners.The reality, though, is that the species\u2019 ocean stock is depleted, and most of the branzino consumed in the United States is farmed in the Mediterranean Sea (where the species is native). Because fish in those farming operations are often enclosed in large cages in the ocean, the concentration of waste can lead to diseases that require treatment with chemicals.The fish are also flown thousands of miles to American consumers. By the time they reach a kitchen, they have lost much of their freshness and shelf life. The decades-old method is usually used on a small scale, by hobbyists at home; there are few commercial R.A.S. operations because of the high cost of filtration, Mr. Pedersen said.Branzino is his primary focus because it is popular, and commands a high price. And for chefs and grocers, farmed branzino is already a familiar commodity.The branzino arrive as hatchlings from France (though Mr. Pedersen and his small team plan eventually to hatch the eggs themselves). The fish spend 12 to 14 months growing to full size in the large tanks, which monitor temperature, oxygen and salinity.When the fish are fully grown and prepared for delivery, each receives a gill tag with a QR code that allows customers to track their fish\u2019s origins online. Mr. Pedersen plans to produce 350,000 pounds of branzino a year, and to begin harvesting and selling sweet basil from his aquaponic system in the next six months. The operation falls under the regulation of several federal, state and local agencies.\u201cThey gave me five fish in a plastic sack, and I pushed it to the bottom of the fridge,\u201d he said. \u201cA week later, I pulled it out and the fish were still firm, and the eyes were still clear.\u201d\u201cJust tell me where it was caught and the method of catch, and I can decide if I want it,\u201d Mr. Pulapaka said. \u201cBut distributors sometimes don\u2019t even know that info themselves. The supply chain is not set up to record that information.\u201dBut Mr. Pedersen said that his energy costs were not as high as he anticipated, and that he planned to install solar panels and use geothermal energy.But Mr. Pedersen said his branzino taste fresher because they are raised locally. Their diet is based on what fish eat in the ocean. \u201cWe mimic the wild composition in terms of protein and fat levels and carbohydrates,\" he said. \u201cSelling a Mediterranean fish growing in Connecticut, it just doesn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d he said. \u201cSea trout, Atlantic weakfish \u2014 these are beautiful fish that are depleted and hardly on the market. Why not do that?\u201dIdeal Fish has an aggressive five-year growth plan, including opening more facilities in Waterbury to raise other high-priced species like red snapper and yellowtail, followed by national expansion. Mr. MacKnight, the Ideal Fish marketer, sees his biggest challenge as overcoming negative perceptions of farmed fish by touting the company\u2019s ability to conserve water and grow fresh produce. The company already hosts field trips for schools, and Mr. Pedersen is considering a commercial kitchen with cooking classes and demonstrations.Companies like his, he said, will make that shift happen. \u201cThis is not the only future. But this is the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company had employed more than 100 people, about 30 of whom will remain.Mic\u2019s management had been in talks to sell the company to Bustle Digital Group, according to various reports this week, and that deal was completed on Thursday, after the layoffs.\u201cWe are proud of the work the team produced and its impact on the world over the last seven years.\u201d Mr. Altchek said in a statement provided to The New York Times. \u201cThe recent developments have been incredibly difficult and our focus has been on finding a solution that preserves as many jobs as possible and maximizes our abilities to care for impacted employees.\u201d\u201cIn a staff-wide email, Bustle C.E.O. Bryan Goldberg today announced plans to \u2018relaunch\u2019 Mic and build it from the ground up,\u201d said the union, a unit of the NewsGuild of New York, which also represents New York Times employees. \u201cWe cannot imagine a move more cynical or perverse than terminating your entire staff, only to cede the \u2018brand\u2019 to a new buyer who will presumably pick the scraps from the carcass of a newsroom that we all spent years building.\u201dBustle bought Mic on the strength of its brand among a younger audience and plans to revive the publication around mid-2019.The two employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mic had come to lean too heavily on a partnership with Facebook, which provided funding for a Mic-produced show on the social network\u2019s Facebook Watch video platform.\u201cFor those of us who didn\u2019t have insight into the financials, the shock was just that we were relying so heavily on it,\u201d said one of the employees, a senior member of the editorial staff.Mic, too, invested heavily in the partnership, its largest, under the expectation that it would last at least a year.

The party was a great success, lasted all night and continued into brunch the following day. Everybody felt a part of the same team. \u201cNearly two decades later,\u201d Applebaum writes, \u201cI would now cross the street to avoid some of the people who were at my New Year\u2019s Eve party.\u201d She estimates that half the people at that party are no longer on speaking terms with the other half. For example, in recent years Applebaum has not had a single conversation with a woman who was once one of her closest friends and is godmother to one of her children. She tried to reach out to this woman and suggested they get together, but the woman refused. \u201cWhat would we talk about?\u201d she texted.Those of us who came of age in conservative circles know exactly what Applebaum is talking about. The same kinds of rifts have opened up among conservatives around the world, in Britain, Italy, Germany and the U.S.Some conservatives stayed on the political trajectory they were on in 1999. Others embraced populist nativism. They wandered into territory that is xenophobic, anti-Semitic, authoritarian. Still others were driven leftward by the reactionary revival.What happened? This is the story I would tell.During the Cold War, being a conservative was a moral cause. You were fighting Communist tyranny \u2014 aligned with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Lech Walesa. But you were somewhat marginalized in your own society. Liberals controlled the universities, the news media, the cultural high ground, so the right attracted many people with outsider personalities.At the same time, they resent how spiritually flat conservatism has become. \u201cThe principles of competition, even when they encourage talent and create upward mobility, don\u2019t necessarily answer deeper questions about national identity, or satisfy the human desire to belong to a moral community,\u201d Applebaum continues.In such a situation, you\u2019re almost bound to get a return of blood-and-soil nationalism. The losers in the meritocratic competition, the permanent outsiders, seize on ethnic nationalism to give themselves a sense of belonging, to explain their failures, to rally the masses and to upend the meritocracy.In office, what the populist nationalists do is this: They replace the idea of excellence with the idea of \u201cpatriotism.\u201d Loyalty to the tribe is more important than professional competence. In fact, a person\u2019s very lack of creativity and talent becomes proof of his continued reliability to the cause, as we\u2019ve seen in the continued fealty to King Trump. While there is a sprinkling of good professionals in the Trump administration, they are there by accident, not by intent. Many of those staffing the White House could not get a job in any normal Republican administration, which selected people according to any traditional criteria of excellence.And now, as Trump reshuffles his administration yet again, we see the remnants of the B and C teams replaced by members of the D team. Over the past few days, there\u2019s been a lot of gossip over whether Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker will keep his job. But it almost doesn\u2019t matter, because from here on out, it\u2019s Whitakers all the way down.If conservatism is ever to recover it has to achieve two large tasks. First, it has to find a moral purpose large enough to displace the lure of blood-and-soil nationalism. Second, it has to restore standards of professional competence and reassert the importance of experience, integrity and political craftsmanship. When you take away excellence and integrity, loyalty to the great leader is the only currency that remains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Was Not Repudiated. He Was Rewarded.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president made the midterms a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters. Mr. McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Quarterly.If Donald Trump inaugurated a new era of conflict in American politics, Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections were just another skirmish, not a turning point in the war. Republicans lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than Democrats lost in 1994 or 2010, when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were in their first terms as president. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama both went on to win re-election two years after those midterm routs. And while Democrats also lost Senate seats in the first midterm elections under Presidents Clinton and Obama, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republicans defied the historical trend by adding to their Senate majority.Democrats and other critics of President Trump argue that given the health of the economy, the failure of Republicans to do better than just keeping the Senate amounts to a damning verdict on this administration. Democrats and their supporters also boast about winning the \u201cpopular vote\u201d for the House by a wide margin \u2014 by more than 8 percent, according to early estimates. Taken together, these claims are meant to show that Trumpism as a program and style of politics is unpopular, a drag on the Republican brand, and puts winning future elections into great doubt.Republicans on Tuesday did lose the governorship of Michigan, and they failed to win races for governor and the United States Senate in Pennsylvania. Those states, too, were part of Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral map two years ago and are apt to be critical in 2020. Would the president be unable to win them again? Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania (who lost to the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey), was a staunch immigration restrictionist, just as the president is. But Mr. Barletta ran what was almost universally deemed a poor campaign, and he had nothing of the president\u2019s star power or talent for exploiting an opponent\u2019s weaknesses through well-chosen insults. Democrats\u2019 successes in Pennsylvania suggest little about how a Democratic nominee will perform in the state against Mr. Trump in two years\u2019 time. The same can be said, with a little less confidence, about Democrats\u2019 midterm successes in other Upper Midwest contests.In an ordinary midterm election, turnout is low and the opposition party has an advantage, as is reflected in the long chronicle of losses for whichever party holds the White House at the time. In recent decades, only the 1998 and 2002 midterm elections were exceptions in which the president\u2019s party gained seats. It\u2019s easy to see why the president\u2019s party is usually endangered: It has to defend the real record of a real leader, while the opposition party can criticize the president without having to offer an alternative. Strong criticism from one side and a necessarily weaker defense from the other is a formula for gains by the party out of power.That was still the case this year. Yet Mr. Trump did something unusual by increasing turnout among his defenders as well as his opponents. Republicans felt that Mr. Trump had an agenda still worth fighting for, and they were heartened that on several key issues \u2014 perhaps most important, judicial appointments \u2014 the president had delivered what he promised. That helped to make Tuesday a good night for political engagement overall, and it kept Republican losses below what they would have been if Mr. Trump had simply been an unpopular and polarizing figure. Mr. Trump made the election a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is indeed widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters \u2014 not only by those who are nationalists as the president is but by those, too, who are conventional Republicans who want lower taxes, fewer regulations and more conservative judges. Far from bringing about Mr. Trump\u2019s repudiation, whether by a defeated and regretful right or by the country as a whole, the midterm election has only firmed up the lines of conflict for the future. President Trump will be at the center of that conflict, not as an aberration or departure from the norms of politics but as an integral part of the Republican Party \u2014 its head as well as its right arm.

There were babies at Studio 54.That\u2019s not a reference to actors dissatisfied with their dressing rooms or patrons griping about their seats.Child care, of course, is a challenge for many working parents. But a career in theater brings its own challenges. Artists are often self-employed freelancers, so they don\u2019t get parental leave. The arts tend to pay poorly, making hiring nannies or paying for day care difficult. And the hours are often long, especially during rehearsals and previews, making any work-life balance much harder.Some of the issues seem easy \u2014 making sure rehearsal breaks are long enough for nursing mothers to breast-feed or pump, for example \u2014 but women are sometimes reluctant to ask for accommodation. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an emerging playwright you don\u2019t feel comfortable asking because you\u2019re just so grateful someone is producing your play,\u201d Ms. Ruhl said.Space established its \u201cfamily residency,\u201d in association with the Lilly Awards Foundation, in 2015, offering artists with children ages 6 to 12 a weeklong retreat at the 130-acre organic farm. In 2017, the family program was expanded \u2014 there are now two one-week sessions \u2014 and this year, for the first time, artists were allowed to bring children as young as 3. \u201cIf we actually want to achieve parity, these people have to be given the opportunity to write plays,\u201d said Emily Simoness, a seventh-generation member of the family that established Ryder Farm in 1795, and the executive director of the Space program.Ms. Jones brought her own babysitter, but there is now nature-focused arts programming, led by theater educators, for children while the parents work. The artists have adults-only lunches, but are joined by the children for family-style dinners, and at the end of the week, just as the artists present to their colleagues a sample of the work they have been developing, the children display their own handiwork. (The week I visited, the children were turning their clubhouse into a museum to exhibit their farm-inspired visual art, as well as practicing dance moves to \u201cLet It Go.\u201d)\u201cI felt particularly trapped and shocked by the limitations of being a mother, and I endured a lot of that postpartum anxiety and depression,\u201d she said.

Another was set aside for a play space, so on especially grueling days the designers could bring their children, as well as someone to mind them, to the theater. The requests were made easier by the fact that the play has just a three-person cast, so there were rooms to spare backstage, and the producers readily agreed.One afternoon as the show was in previews, Ms. Silverman ran through the day\u2019s punch list for the designers.

{"Headline": "How to Get the Most Out of a Women\u2019s Ski Camp", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree days of concentrated instruction at Alta, near Salt Lake City, provided lessons in skiing the steeps, and a glimpse into why so many women seem to be flocking to these camps.As a sport, skiing is struggling to maintain a toehold, with the number of skiers falling to 6.8 million in 2016-17 from 7.3 million 20 years ago, according to a survey from the National Ski Area Association.Here are some lessons gleaned from a session for intermediate-advanced skiers held in January 2018.With 15 hours of instruction packed into three days, the camp is up and running quickly. It\u2019s a good idea to show up one or even two days ahead to get used to the altitude (the lodge is at 8,530 feet and Alta peaks at 10,550) and find your ski legs, especially if you haven\u2019t been on snow in the season yet. Women used to skiing in the Midwest or Northeast must also factor in the Wasatch\u2019s fluffier snow and steeper slopes \u2014 Alta\u2019s expert runs are much more demanding, on average, than expert ones in New York or Vermont, and that\u2019s true of much of the West. You don\u2019t have to fork over for a rental car or an on-slope lodge during these extra days, either: Hotels and Airbnbs abound in Cottonwood Heights, at the base of the mountain. I booked a room in the valley, and for two days I used Lyft to ski at Alta and neighboring Snowbird.Camps tend to include high-end rentals, which at Alta you can get at the Deep Powder House store next door. This makes it easy to find gear best suited to your skill level and skiing style, as well as the changing conditions. There was not much fresh snow when I arrived in Utah so I rented skis with a relatively narrow waist and a good edge hold that would provide decent grip on sketchy, hard-packed slopes. After Alta was hit with 23 inches of powder I switched to skis with a wider waist for better flotation.As for boots, they are the most critical piece of equipment and a necessary investment \u2014 \u201cdate your skis, marry your boots,\u201d as the saying goes. If you don\u2019t already own a pair, the camp is a good time to take the plunge because you can fine-tune the fit as much as necessary.Upon signing up, campers generally fill in forms about their skiing level and physical condition to help the instructors create cohesive groups. At the Alta camp, the head instructor, Jen Scott, 43, placed me in the upper-level group, which was both flattering and scary because I tend to underestimate my abilities. This is a common problem among women (men have the exact opposite one) and affects your skiing technique since the sport requires decisiveness and confidence. At Alta, the main imperative throughout was to make the campers adopt an aggressive \u201cathletic stance\u201d \u2014 leaning forward into the fall line, shins pressing against the boots\u2019 tongue to apply pressure on the ski tips. That affects not just your posture but your frame of mind: go out there and get it!Video reviews are an integral part of the instruction plan at many camps. Two or three times a day, the Alta instructors film students as they execute specific drills, then review the footage over lunch or dinner. The process helps make adjustments, but it\u2019s also sobering: It turns out that for decades I had lived in blissful ignorance of the fact that my butt sticks out when linking turns on steep terrain. It\u2019s one thing to have a vague idea of what you look like skiing; it\u2019s quite another to watch yourself while a professional dissects your every move.

{"Headline": "Australia: Wealthy but Still Second Rate", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor all our good fortune there is a sense in the country that these times, the best of times, have not brought out the best in us. Contributing Opinion WriterSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 One of the most quoted lines about Australia goes as follows: \u201cAustralia is a lucky country run mainly by second-rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people\u2019s ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.\u201dThese words, published in 1964 by the Australian journalist and intellectual Donald Horne in his seminal book \u201cThe Lucky Country,\u201d still ring true more than five decades later. Even more so in the current moment, as Australia has grown from a lucky country to perhaps the luckiest.Australia recently passed Switzerland to become home to the wealthiest people in the world, if considered on the basis of median adult wealth, one of the better measures of wealth among the general populace. Foods once reserved for dinner parties \u2014 salmon, avocado, raspberries \u2014 are now found in our children\u2019s lunchboxes. More Australians are traveling overseas than ever before, choosing destinations such as the ski fields of Japan because they are cheaper than skiing closer to home. We are a nation of people pretending we are not wealthy, with leaders who indulge us in this fantasy.But our growing wealth is distributed in a way that has fed insecurity. A series of real-estate booms have disproportionately excluded the young and less wealthy. This insecurity is fed by political leaders who, in the Australian vernacular, are obliged to indulge even the propertied and privileged in the cognitive dissonance that they are \u201cdoing it tough.\u201dFor all our good fortune, there is a sense in the country that these times, the best of times, have not brought out the best in us. They have certainly not brought out the best in our political leaders and policymakers. More than ever, we have the sense that our country is run by second-rate people, with second-rate ideas.This year, we have a new prime minister, as we often do. In the last decade, Australia has changed leaders as if it were a game of musical chairs \u2014 or Italy. The new prime minister, Scott Morrison, deposed the previous prime minister from his own party in August, for reasons that remain unclear.Mr. Morrison\u2019s leadership style has been marked by an appeal to a fictional idea of Australia that is far from our multicultural and highly urbanized reality. His is an Australia of white blokes who love their footy (rugby) and their beer, who still use archaic colloquialisms like \u201cfair dinkum,\u201d (a phrase used to emphasize that what the speaker is saying is genuine and unvarnished), whose highest aspirations in life are cheap electricity and tax breaks on multiple investment properties.The first months of his leadership have been an embodiment of Donald Horne\u2019s worst fears. In October, Mr. Morrison floated the idea of moving the Australian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (\u201cother people\u2019s ideas\u201d \u2014 in this case, President Trump\u2019s) and was taken aback when it angered our near neighbor and close trading partner Indonesia (\u201ctaken by surprise\u201d).Not long after, senators from his party voted in favor of a motion by a far-right politician stating that it is \u201cO.K. to be white,\u201d a meme popular with white supremacists on the internet, and condemning \u201cthe deplorable rise of anti-white racism.\u201d This vote was later explained away as an \u201cadministrative process failure.\u201dMr. Morrison spent early November undertaking a fair dinkum bus tour of the northern state of Queensland, with copious photo opportunities of him fair dinkum eating meat pies and drinking beer. During the tour it became apparent that rather than traveling on the tour bus plastered with his likeness, he was in fact flying between destinations on a Royal Australian Air Force V.I.P. jet.A recent survey of Australians by the Australian National University captures the declining confidence in our political leaders, a disease that is not unique to Australia of course. The Australian Values Study released in October notes, \u201cAlthough Australians remain supportive of the concept of democracy and broadly satisfied with how the political system is operating, their confidence in specific political organizations continues to fall.\u201dRecent years have been ones of good luck, but also thwarted opportunity. We have become a Ponzi scheme of a nation where every problem can be solved by ever rising property prices \u2014 that\u2019s how we build personal wealth and accumulate tax revenue, which is then fed back into the system to further inflate prices.We have become a funny sort of wealthy. A country wealthy enough to offer corporate tax cuts and subsidies to the coal industry, but not wealthy enough to afford action on climate change or high-quality care for the elderly. A country where those living in poverty on unemployment benefits get too much, but those with investments in real estate and stocks are still \u201cdoing it tough,\u201d and should not lose their tax breaks, because that would be \u201cthe politics of envy.\u201dStill lucky, still second rate.What I am saying should not be mistaken for cultural cringe, another Australian disease in which we think ourselves lesser than the grander cultures of elsewhere. I am not saying the country where I have gladly chosen to spend my life should be more like the United States, or more like Britain. I have much higher hopes for my country than that.We are better than our government, and better than our worst impulses. If we can shake off the small thinking of our leaders, we can provide a model of a way forward for other countries, at a time when the world is struggling with political volatility, extremism and a sense that worse is to come.Beyond the current malaise, our system has much to recommend it. We have compulsory voting \u2014 on paper ballots, on a Saturday \u2014 which we treat as a community event as much as an administrative task. We have universal health care, in which access to coverage is not linked to employment, so people are freer to change jobs and start their own businesses without worrying about their health. Our crime rates are low, and we have strict gun laws, which were introduced by a conservative leader and are embraced by almost all.But if we are to provide leadership to other countries, we need to let go of the fantasies of the past, face our new reality, grow up, be serious, be brave and demand leaders who are not less than this.Or perhaps we will have to leave that job to New Zealand.Lisa Pryor, a medical doctor, is the author, most recently, of \u201cA Small Book About Drugs\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

The subways (and mass transit in general) are the veins and arteries of New York. If they\u2019re clogged, we\u2019re in trouble.Information: How we get news, the shrinking of local journalism, and the vast expansion of Google, Facebook and Twitter are changing how we relate to those around us.I\u2019m hoping that New York Today can help you to navigate this landscape.Culture/Identity: How we talk about race, class, gender and other forms of identity in New York is changing. We\u2019re going to pick up and discuss some of those stories, from myriad perspectives.Let\u2019s begin.A special election to fill her public advocate position will take place in February. But many prospective candidates have already started their campaigns.Ms. Smalls, who served as a policy aide on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, is a lawyer and lives in Manhattan.Even as the Mexican police jet started its descent into Long Island, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera had no idea where he was going\u2026.But as an airport glimmered on the ground outside his window, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 shackled, handcuffed and in the care of two American law enforcement agents \u2014 anxiously asked where he was being was taken, according to a person briefed on the trip.\u201cBienvenido \u00e1 New York,\u201d one of the Americans said.El Chapo terrorized his native Mexico for decades. So why is he being tried in Brooklyn?\u201cThe Brooklyn indictment, originally filed in 2009, stems from a series of obscure contract killings that occurred in New York in the early 1990s,\u201d Alan writes.\u201c...the election on Tuesday strongly suggested that the golden era of charter schools is over in New York. The insurgent Democrats who were at the forefront of the party\u2019s successful effort to take over the State Senate have repeatedly expressed hostility to the movement....it seems highly likely that a New York Legislature entirely under Democratic control will restrict the number of new charter schools that can open, and tighten regulations on existing ones.\u201dGovernor Cuomo also recently softened his support for charter schools as he eyes a potential White House bid.Xavier\u2019s mother, Janet Guillen, of Inwood, said she has been out of work because of the demands of caring for Xavier.She had been working at a grocery store when she found out she was pregnant.\u201cI never thought I was going to have a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAt 38 \u2014 what? Nah. It\u2019s too late for me.\u201d After seeing specialists, Ms. Guillen learned her son had autism.Xavier now attends the Kennedy Children\u2019s Center, an affiliate of Catholic Charities that specializes in preschool for children with developmental issues.HOW TO HELPJeffrey M. Ward thinks the whole thing started with a tweet.\u201cWe kind of noticed that we were close to the same number in birds, somewhere around June, or July,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we were at the same number.\u201dThen, \u201cI went up on him and I posted on Twitter. So, he went out to the coast and got a few birds up on me and he replied back to me, with his numbers.\u201dThus began the great Birder Competition of 2018, starring two brothers from the South Bronx, each vying to see more species of birds.\u201cAs mad as I am that I\u2019m losing at the moment, I\u2019m happy that he got to Texas and got so many new birds that he\u2019s never seen before.\u201dHave a great Monday.Advertisement"}

Here are some tips to help.Most medical professionals categorize travel as a stressful event, even more so for those suffering from autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel, celiac, Hashimoto\u2019s or psoriasis. A change of routine, jet lag, and unfamiliar germs or foreign food can exacerbate one\u2019s condition.Plus, since a growing number of people adhere to strict anti-inflammatory diets to manage those illnesses, dining on the road can pose a real challenge. Here, doctors and specialists share some advice on how to stay healthy and eat well while traveling. As always however, talk to your doctor for specific advice related to your condition, depending on where you plan to visit.He also recommends carrying on medications in their original packaging with a copy of prescriptions, as well as a doctor\u2019s letter detailing their condition and necessary medications to decrease any chance of confiscation by airport or border security.\u201cVisiting regions like Western Europe where it\u2019s easy to replace medications is also helpful,\u201d he added. If specialty drugs are lost or confiscated, patients can contact their health insurance\u2019s or drug company\u2019s patient support programs, which typically provide a rescue supply of medications through a local specialty pharmacy or hospital (depending on the country). For generic drugs, patients can usually go to local pharmacies to get a short-term refill.Supporting the body\u2019s immune system is key to staying healthy while traveling. Ryan Warren, a clinical nutritionist at the Jill Roberts Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian steers her patients toward local, fresh, seasonal foods while traveling abroad. \u201cEvery patient\u2019s dietary needs are different, but I recommend fresh fruits and vegetables (well cooked, skinned and de-seeded if the patient is avoiding high roughage foods), lean proteins like fish, poultry and eggs, and a variety of whole grains, nuts, nut butters and legumes, as tolerated,\u201d she said.Ms. Warren also suggests staying away from raw foods because they can carry food-borne illnesses, exposing travelers to pathogens that might be problematic for people with compromised immune systems. Avoiding inflammatory triggers like concentrated sweets, fried greasy foods and alcohol is also beneficial. \u201cSince air travel is inherently dehydrating, drinking plenty of water is key,\u201d she adds.Tips for how to combine pleasure with wellness when you\u2019re on the road, because isn\u2019t living your best life the point of a vacation in the first place?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steve King Called Me a \u2018Junk Yard Dog\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat his press strategy tells us about the Republican Party and its base.Mr. Rubenstein is assistant opinion editor at The Weekly Standard.It\u2019s a strange thing to be called a junk yard dog. It\u2019s especially strange when the person calling you that is an eight-term Republican congressman and you are a writer working for a conservative publication. But such is the current state of American politics.I spent last week covering the midterm elections in Iowa\u2019s Fourth district, the Republican stronghold of the Hawkeye State. On Monday, Representative Steve King, the Republican incumbent, had three public campaign events: in Hampton, Webster City and Sioux Center. I went to all and recorded them.Jeff King, the congressman\u2019s son and paid campaign manager, wasn\u2019t happy this bit got out. He didn\u2019t like that I reported on something he thought nobody outside the generally receptive community had paid attention to.At the day\u2019s next event, in Webster City, Mr. King opened by telling supporters about his recent pheasant hunting trip. He spoke of a pheasant noodle soup that he makes, and the jalape\u00f1o peppers he grows and puts in the soup to give it a kick. Then the conversation turned:Mr. King: \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to go and get some dirt from Mexico to grow the next batch.\u201dHe and the audience laugh together.Audience member: \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s on its way.\u201dMr. King: \u201cWell, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt, it\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dMr. King will insist that his opposition to the press is political \u2014 as in, the press is all left-wing propaganda. In fact, it\u2019s part of his calculated assault on truth and the ability to determine it. His idea of how the press is supposed to function would be right at home in the Gaza Strip, Iran or Turkey. Favorable coverage gets you open access. Dare to criticize and you are denied. Stephen Hayes responded, standing by the story and adding, \u201cOur reporting wouldn\u2019t focus on your bigotry if you weren\u2019t a bigot.\u201d Representative King then challenged us to release audio of his \u201cdirt\u201d comment and called me a \u201cjunk yard dog.\u201dThen he accused us of turning into \u201cAntifa News.\u201dThe sad truth is that Representative King thought he could get away with his vile comment and his excuse with his base. That shows what he thinks of them. They\u2019re already hostile to the media, so why not blame it on them? Today, accusations of media bias so fill the ears of right-wingers that it serves as an effective rejoinder to annul any criticism.He also probably thought he could get away with his comments within his own party. And for the most part, he has. So far the only party members to publicly remonstrate him are Senator Jeff Flake, and Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Steve Stivers. And two of them won\u2019t be in the next Congress. Party leadership has been almost silent on Steve King\u2019s bigoted politics, and that\u2019s because the same sort of indecency comes from the top. Representative King was taking a page out of President Trump\u2019s book in his name-calling, bleating about the media and then lying to cover his back. This con shouldn\u2019t work as well as it does. That fact that it does \u2014 that it has become normal behavior for not a few Republican politicians \u2014 should frighten us all.Advertisement"}

It wouldn\u2019t thwart political disinformation campaigns that rely on false tweets or bogus Facebook pages, and it wouldn\u2019t be a solution to the problems presented by gerrymandering. However, done properly, online voting could boost voter participation, avoid administrative errors at polling stations, and help restore the public\u2019s trust in the electoral process and democracy.Until now, the internet as we know it has generally failed to meet basic voting system requirements: A vote must be cast and counted for the intended candidate, counted only once, remain anonymous, and be verifiable after the fact, even amid a power outage.The good news is that building a workable, scalable, and inclusive online voting system is now possible, thanks to blockchain technologies. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network for exchanging anything of value, from stocks, money, intellectual property, and, yes, votes. In a blockchain-based system, public trust in the voting process is achieved not by faith in one single institution, but through cryptography, code, and collaboration among citizens, government agencies, and other stakeholders.An attacker who wanted to spend the same dollar twice or cast the same vote twice would need to take command of 51% of the computers in the network simultaneously and rewrite the entire history of each dollar or vote on the blockchain in a short time frame, which is exceedingly difficult. Since the network is widely distributed, it could survive a natural disaster or an attack on critical infrastructure. Thus, blockchain prevents double-spending, enabling us to run secure, trustworthy online transactions including voting.As citizens, we can trust the outcome of such a voting system: voters can check the blockchain to verify that their vote was counted correctly, candidates can trust the vote count and election officials can verify and audit the results. Because the system is decentralized, no government or hacker can change the results without immediate detection.Absentee ballots offer a perfect test for blockchain-based mobile voting in government. This is no small matter: Hundreds of thousands of eligible voters live or serve overseas every election, and they face high hurdles to democratic participation. They must remember to vote early, because tens of thousands of absentee ballots arrive too late to be counted. Concerns over security and anonymity decrease online submissions, even when they\u2019re available.Online voting is not without challenges: Technical standards must be consistent across jurisdictions, and software and hardware would need to be audited regularly. The early days of blockchain-based voting would have growing pains, and election boards would need to test solutions at local and state levels before a national rollout.There is no shortage of politicians in power who benefit from the inaccessibility, insecurity, or lack of public faith in the electoral process. They have every reason to cast doubt upon, or outright oppose, an improvement in the way elections are run. But with the benefits of blockchain-based online voting so clear, citizens should insist that voters\u2019 interests come first.Alex Tapscott is Co-Founder of the Blockchain Research Institute and a former member of the Elections Canada Advisory Board.Advertisement"}

Coral reefs will continue to be damaged, but will not be wiped out. The percentage of people exposed to severe heat waves would plummet to about 14 percent. The number exposed to urban drought would drop by more than 60 million people.After describing the amount of energy that goes into making glass, he added, \u201cI hope that you have at least inherited a few of our windowpanes. Maybe you pried them out of drowned properties and fitted them into your caves.\u201dTo James Hansen, the scientist who warned of climate change in landmark congressional testimony 30 years ago, the apocalyptic talk gets old. \u201cI find the people who think we are doomed to be very tiring and unhelpful,\u201d he said. The most catastrophic outcomes can be avoided \u201cif we are smart, and I think we are capable of being smart.\u201d And a few we\u2019d rather not discussDr. Marvel agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out there is no scientific support for inevitable doom,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate change is not pass-fail,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is a real continuum of futures, a continuum of possibilities.\u201dSo yes, things will be bad. And yes, we need to do more, so much more, to head off what could come. But how awful things get, and for how many people, depends on what we do. And although humans famously avoid acting on long-term problems, the species does possess a capacity for looking ahead. \u201cWe do think about the future,\u201d Dr. Marvel said. \u201cWe plant trees,\u201d and \u201cwe have children.\u201dKatharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, noted that her professional peers tend to be conservative about their findings: \u201cIf they say something\u2019s bad, you know it\u2019s probably a lot worse than they said.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s expensive, but the fact that we can do it is pretty danged hopeful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world is changing,\u201d Dr. Hayhoe said. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t fast enough.\u201dThere is not just one way to talk about climate change, however.

Still think voting doesn\u2019t matter?No matter who wins, higher turnout is a good thing. It reaffirms the essence of the democratic process, and it tends to help candidates who are both more reasonable and more representative of the public at large. It comes down to this: Democracy isn\u2019t self-activating. It depends on citizens getting involved and making themselves heard. So if you haven\u2019t yet cast a ballot, get out and do it on Tuesday, or earlier if your state allows early voting. Help your family, friends and neighbors do the same. Help a stranger.

{"Headline": "600 Million Years Ago, the First Scavengers Lurked in Dark Ocean Gardens", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bizarre organisms of the Ediacaran Period have long puzzled researchers. Fossil discoveries suggest these ecosystems may have been more complicated than once thought.Some 635 million years ago, as the Earth shook off massive shrouds of glacial ice, an alien world blossomed on the ocean floors. No complex animals prowled the seas of the Ediacaran Period. Instead, the depths held microbial mats and strange, frond-like creatures that resembled nothing alive today. Paleontologists have suggested that this was a sort of Garden of Eden, a simple ecosystem wiped away by the more vibrant fauna of the following Cambrian Period. But recent research is complicating this view, suggesting that Ediacaran ecosystems were more complex than previously thought. Fossils also hint at the beginnings of a massive shift: scavenging that later evolved into predation.\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a major change in the ecosystem of the Earth, an irrevocable change,\u201d said Mary Droser, a paleobiologist at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cThe ability to eat another animal is a big deal, and is a major ecological and biological innovation.\u201dThe fossils of the Ediacaran, found in desolate locations like Namibia and South Australia, have been notoriously controversial and difficult to interpret. They include strange, quilted blobs; stationary filter-feeders; and organisms like enormous ferns, some up to eight feet long. Scientists also have debated how sophisticated these seafloor ecologies were, Dr. Darroch added. A complex ecosystem holds multiple species with a multitude of feeding strategies, like a modern forest or a reef. A simple ecosystem comprises only a few species with the same basic strategies.Dive into the Ediacaran seas, and you\u2019d see sediments covered in thick sheets of green or white microbes. There were no deep burrowers here; the ocean mud had the solidity and stickiness of a tile floor after a fraternity party. The few multicellular organisms grazed slowly on the congealed mats or sat atop them, using different body shapes to pluck nutrients from the currents. Sea jellies, or something like them, may have floated in the open waters \u2014 nobody\u2019s sure.Many of these organisms had an architecture unlike any seen in modern organisms, said Martin Smith, a paleontologist at Durham University in England. While they may have appeared plantlike, they lived in waters too deep for sunlight to penetrate. \u201cThey probably grew very slowly,\u201d Dr. Smith said, \u201carriving as spores on a virgin seafloor after a mudslide or land slip, then reproducing asexually to form interconnected colonies that gradually populated the seafloor.\u201dDr. Darroch and his colleagues suggest that different feeding strategies were at the root of this unexpected diversity, but Dr. Smith finds it hard to imagine such organisms feeding in radically different ways. Instead, the organisms may have competed with one another with varying reproductive strategies, he suggested. Some were able to alter their shapes according to their surroundings and then to spread their spores over a greater distance.Even with such unexpected diversity, the Ediacaran was a still world, without much in the way of predation. But dead organisms were an easy resource, Dr. Droser said, and some animals began to take advantage. In a world where nothing dug very deep, burrowing would have been a biological and ecological innovation.\u201cThe scavenging occurred after the organisms were buried, so we know that they were dead,\u201d Dr. Droser said. \u201cEating a dead animal requires more oxygen and also a metabolism that can digest it.\u201dBut Dr. Smith disagrees, pointing out that signs of scavenging after the Ediacaran Period are not like these. Scientists tend to find elaborate patterns in fossils, left by animals exploiting every inch of decaying organic matter. \u201cThese Ediacaran burrowers seem not to care that they\u2019ve just passed through a potential meal,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like a great strategy for a scavenger, less still for a predator,\u201d he added. \u201cBut perhaps these early organisms were still learning the ropes.\u201d There are clues that something was changing toward the end of the Ediacaran, Dr. Darroch said: signs of movement in the mud fall dramatically, as do the number of species recorded \u2014 symptoms of an ecosystem under stress. As the microbial mats disappeared in a world of burrowers, the fragile species that lived off them went, too. The appearance of more recognizable animals \u2014 mobile and powerful, able to punch through the mats and devour other living organisms \u2014 might have caused a biologically driven mass extinction.The Cambrian explosion gave rise to many recognizable animal groups, and for a time these overshadowed the strange, silent gardens of the Ediacaran. But the key to how multicellular ecosystems developed seems to lie in sandstones left by those chilly seas, in an ecosystem much more diverse than previously suspected.\u201cLife has impacted our world today from the production of oxygen to churning up soil,\u201d Dr. Droser said. \u201cWe can see in the Ediacaran the firsts of a number of these biological and ecological processes that later became essential to our planet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "WhatsApp Is Changing the Way India Talks About Food", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe application, blamed for all kinds of mayhem on the subcontinent, has proved a boon for farmers, home cooks and chefs who once lacked a way to share. To the south, in the state of Kerala, Bharathy Gopalakrishnan, a stay-at-home mother, wanted to make a little money from some leftover red-velvet cupcakes. That idea turned into PB Kitchen, a WhatsApp group she founded to allow the women in her apartment complex to buy and sell one another\u2019s homemade dishes, from sambars and vadas to burgers and cakes.Around the same time, Krishna Prasad, the director of an organic-agriculture advocacy group, and Abhishek Naik, a scientist, were looking for a way to share healthy recipes and information about organic food. So they created a group a WhatsApp group, Anna Arogya (\u201cfood for good health\u201d in Kannada).But among Indians who produce, cook or care about food, the service has been a godsend. In a country where culinary traditions are often spoken but not written, WhatsApp has provided an open, democratic forum where Indians can share and codify their knowledge and skills, in new ways, and even profit from them.\u201cOne of the problems with documenting Indian food is that the people who prepare it\u201d \u2014 mainly homemakers, farmers and young cooks \u2014 \u201ctend to be less empowered and less formally educated,\u201d said Vikram Doctor, 51, a journalist in Mumbai. \u201cThey just don\u2019t document. They are not comfortable using a computer or blogging, or people just don\u2019t ask them.\u201d\u201cShe sends us these voice notes on WhatsApp messages that allow her to give the really, really tiny details,\u201d Ms. Tanya said, \u201clike \u2018Brown the onions and listen to this sound.\u2019 It is so much more personal.\u201d (In a text message, on the other hand, sending and downloading a lengthy voice note could drain a phone\u2019s data, and cost money.)\u201cWhatsApp is my best marketing tool,\u201d he said, a good way to quickly show the quality of the mangoes. Even when he posts advertisements on other social media channels, customers still contact him on WhatsApp.He could publish his mango knowledge on a blog, he said, \u201cbut how many would be reading it?\u201d WhatsApp \u201cshares my information to a much larger audience,\u201d and in a targeted manner. He uses the groups to train new employees on the menu, devise dishes and motivate the staff. \u201cI have a lot of folks who haven\u2019t even graduated from high school, but they are really comfortable using WhatsApp,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatsApp breaks that barrier, and doesn\u2019t judge based on background or upbringing.\u201dBefore creating their organic advocacy group Anna Arogya, Mr. Naik, 32, and Mr. Prasad, 48, considered starting a Facebook group or a website instead. But Mr. Naik, the director of a sustainable agriculture organization called Sahaja Samrudha, said he found Facebook to be riddled with advertisements and hard to navigate; creating a website would have required hiring developers and designers \u2014 and many in the WhatsApp group don\u2019t even have a computer.What about Instagram, the favored platform for sharing food information in much of the world? \u201cPutting up Instagram posts is seen as dodgy, since you aren\u2019t knowing how many people are really seeing it,\u201d Ms. Tanya said. What she liked most about the application was that it \u201callowed for active debate over recipes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf somebody said, \u2018This cook in the family used to make onion pakoras using sliced onions,\u2019 someone else would come on and say, \u2018No, he didn\u2019t slice them, he chopped them fine.\u2019\u201dSharanya Deepak, a 28-year-old food writer in New Delhi, said older cooks used to be reluctant to share recipes. On WhatsApp, where messages are freely and frequently exchanged, \u201cthey seem to give away secrets more easily,\u201d said Ms. Deepak, who for years had pestered her mother\u2019s friend for a recipe for rajma chawal (kidney beans and rice). But when asked on WhatsApp, \u201cshe sent me the screen shot right away.\u201dGroups like these can provide not only a voice for their food-loving members, but also a source of income.Asha Nair, 38, a member of Ms. Gopalakrishnan\u2019s PB Kitchen, started offering homemade spice powders on the group. They sold so quickly that in 2016 she started her own food company, Health to All, which conducts most of its business on WhatsApp.After the floods in Kerala in August, Ms. Gopalakrishnan sent a message to PB Kitchen members asking for donations of chapati, an Indian bread. \u201cWe put a message at night, and by 10 a.m. we had between 2,000 and 2,500 chapatis that we packed and sent,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt really proud of this group.\u201dBeing a homemaker, Ms. Gopalakrishnan said, is a thankless job. With PB Kitchen, \u201cpeople feel that their food is wanted, and they are earning on the side.\u201dThe beneficiaries of this WhatsApp-based food culture are mainly in India, but there are signs of cross-pollination: Mr. Mistry has received inquiries from people in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates about his mangoes, and Mr. Bandawane plans to start a WhatsApp group for farmers in Thailand.Mr. Naik, the scientist, said many plant-based home remedies posted to Anna Arogya have turned out to be hoaxes. This is especially problematic for his organic-advocacy group, he added, as members turn to it as a credible source of health advice.Users have also complained to him that all the chats, photos and videos consume too much of their phone\u2019s memory. \u201cA few have deleted the group because their memory was getting full, and they were unable to use their phone for anything else,\u201d he said, while others have upgraded to a new phone just to stay in the group.Mr. Bandawane said he doesn\u2019t like the 256-person limit on the group sizes, given the huge number of farmers across India interested in joining.Kaushik Ramasway, 40, a caterer in New Delhi, said he preferred promoting his business on Instagram rather than WhatsApp. \u201cA message popping up on WhatsApp saying, \u2018Buy my aloo chokha\u2019 seems a bit intrusive,\u201d he said. \u201cInstagram is what culinary artists and restaurants and caterers have used from the very beginning to promote their food.\u201dBut Ms. Tanya, the Goya Journal co-founder, remains optimistic about WhatsApp\u2019s impact on India\u2019s food culture. She recalled interviewing Ummi Abdulla, an expert on the Muslim cuisine of Malabar, in Kerala, for an article. Ms. Abdulla, 84, is known for cooking traditional food, but for Ms. Tanya, \u201cshe made this dish that was so innovative and out of the box: It was homemade bread in the shape of a cone, stuffed with minced mutton.\u201dWhat had inspired such creativity? Ms. Abdulla was frank: She had seen the dish on WhatsApp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs laws relax on recreational use, marijuana derivatives \u2014 from THC to terpenes \u2014 are showing up in beers and nonalcoholic drinks.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to hide these things,\u201d said Freddy Bensch, who helped found the Atlanta brewery in 1997.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than watching a consumer pop a G13 cap, put it to his nose, take that first smell and see his eyes light up,\u201d Mr. Bensch said. Within two months, G13 became SweetWater\u2019s second-best-selling draft beer available year-round. \u201cIt\u2019s not that often that you see an area that\u2019s so wide open,\u201d said Gerry Khermouch, the editor of Beverage Business Insights.This fast-moving quest for a potential windfall is also a confusing one, because laws and enforcement can conflict and change. Federal law forbids mixtures of alcohol and THC, marijuana\u2019s psychoactive component; brewers are trying to get around that by putting THC into nonalcoholic drinks, and infusing alcoholic beers with other cannabis byproducts.Breweries say they are willing to leap over legal hurdles, in part, because cannabis and its associated compounds can deliver novel aromas, flavors and experiences. This allows beers to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole new world of hops has opened up,\u201d Mr. Bensch said.That world is rooted in a familiar relationship: Marijuana and hops \u2014 the flowers that impart bitterness, aroma and flavor to beer \u2014 both belong to the Cannabaceae plant family. Many varieties of marijuana and hops share aromatic signatures, from citrusy to resinous.Hi-Fi Hops comes in several different strengths and is sold only in marijuana dispensaries, where cannabis drinks accounted for $58 million in nationwide sales last year, according to the firms Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. That may seem minuscule compared with overall American beer sales \u2014 $111 billion last year, according to the Brewers Association \u2014 but Mr. Magee is playing the long game.\u201cThere\u2019s a generational change happening that\u2019s taking the handcuffs off marijuana,\u201d said Mr. Magee, who envisions a future in which beer and marijuana are sold on a level playing field. \u201cI think THC beverages will be competitors for beer.\u201dHe hopes to change that: In March, Mr. Villa announced the creation of Ceria Beverages, a company in Arvada, Colo., that will make nonalcoholic craft beers infused with small doses of THC. The first, a Belgian-style white ale called Grainwave, will go on sale in Colorado dispensaries in mid-December, with five milligrams of THC (a standard amount for edibles like gummies) per 10-ounce bottle.\u201cPeople should be able to drink our beers and experience the onset in about eight or nine minutes, which is similar to alcohol,\u201d Mr. Villa said. The goal is enjoyment, not inebriation. \u201cYou can easily have a couple of bottles while watching the Yankees game.\u201dThe company says it was eager to explore the biological similarities between hops and cannabis, and highlight their crossover aromatics and flavors. \u201cWe did not want to make a gimmick beer,\u201d said Phil Boyle, the general manger and an owner. \u201cWe wanted to make a beer that could stand by itself, irrespective if it had CBD or not.\u201dThe federal government also forbids brewers to add THC to products produced at their breweries. So for its Hi-Fi Hops, Lagunitas ships its hop-infused water to another company, AbsoluteXtracts (a division of CannaCraft), which doses it with THC and packages it under the Lagunitas name.There\u2019s always a fear that brewers will undercut their own products, but Mr. Bensch doesn\u2019t believe that cannabis will cannibalize beer sales.\u201cWe think the drinker and the cannabis consumer are the same person,\u201d Mr. Bensch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t smoke a joint and drink a beer at the same time.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of an owner of Coalition Brewing.

{"Headline": "Is There Hope for These Great Apes?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Science Times at 40Mountain gorillas are faring better \u2014 perhaps because some humans just won\u2019t listen to reason.Supported byLast Thursday there was a bit of good news relating to the impending extinction and destruction of everything. The mountain gorilla, a subspecies of the Eastern gorilla, was upgraded from critically endangered to endangered. There still are only about 1,000 of them, up from a low point of a few hundred, so it\u2019s not like they were declared vulnerable (better than endangered), or just fine (not a real category). And the Eastern gorilla as a species overall is still critically endangered.The gorillas\u2019 population has been increasing for about 30 years. And it has taken a tremendous amount of struggle and work to get this far. That raises a question: If things have improved so much for an animal in such a dire situation as the mountain gorilla, should we then give in to hope?I know this isn\u2019t the accepted way of speaking about the planet and its creatures. In public discourse, hope is the one thing you should never give up. But in our minds (well, in my mind, anyway, and I can\u2019t be the only one), the reasoning behind that often expressed sentiment is not so clear. What if a rational look at the facts points in the other direction? What if, for instance, the planet were getting warmer every year, and there was a lack of political will to try to stop the trend? What if we were in the middle of a mass extinction caused by humans? Of course, all those things are actually true. Perhaps I am blinded by my own pessimism, but I do often wonder whether hope is a rational response to reality.On the other hand, hope does seem to have played a role in the mountain gorillas\u2019 rebound. After we reduced them to a point where it seemed they would go extinct by the year 2000, some humans worked incredibly hard to protect them. And the gorillas survived, even through the very dark period of the Rwandan genocide.The gorillas are watched over by lots of field staff \u2014 20 times the global average per square kilometer in protected areas. What makes that possible is ecotourism, which is made possible by the great charisma of gorillas. If they were legless skinks, it might be hard to work up that kind of support.But that is a quibble. What is clear is that irrational hope combined with dedication and decades of work culminated in pulling back mountain gorillas one step from the brink.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussSo, should we give in to hope? I think that Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford professor, neuroscientist, author of many books and giver of many talks, has the answer. He\u2019s not a Pollyanna, is my point. No sugarcoating from Dr. Sapolsky.After describing many differences between humans and animals, even our close relatives, like the mountain gorillas, Dr. Sapolsky presents what he sees as one of the most remarkable human qualities: the ability to hold on to two contradictory ideas at once and find a way forward.His main example is Sister Helen Prejean, who wrote the book \u201cDead Man Walking,\u201d based on her work ministering to death row inmates. She said that the more unforgivable the sin, the more it must be forgiven, and the more unlovable the person, the more important it is to love him or her.In fact, he tells the Stanford graduates-to-be that this is precisely what they need to do. He acknowledges that they have probably learned enough to realize that it\u2019s impossible for any one person to make a difference in the world. But, \u201cthe more clearly, absolutely, utterly, irrevocably, unchangeably clear it is that it is impossible for you to make a difference and make the world better, the more you must.\u201dDr. Sapolsky\u2019s concluding challenge to the well educated, well connected, savvy Stanford seniors could be taken to heart by anyone burdened by the weight and apparent rationality of their own pessimism, which may be why I\u2019ve listened to it more than once.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Next Job: Bury Supply-Side Economics", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoters don\u2019t like Republican policies, but conservatives win by spinning a good story about economics. Liberals need to do the same.Contributing Opinion WriterWin, lose or draw on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will almost immediately turn its focus to the next presidential election and the fight between the establishment center and the left wing. But while the Democrats have that argument, they must also undertake the far more important task of thinking about what they agree on, and how they can construct a story about how the economy works and grows and spreads prosperity, a story that competes with \u2014 and defeats \u2014 the Republicans\u2019 own narrative.For 40 years, with a few exceptions, Democrats have utterly failed to do so. Until they fix this, they will lose economic arguments to the Republicans \u2014 even though majorities disagree with the Republicans on many questions \u2014 because every economic debate will proceed from Republican assumptions that make it all but impossible for Democrats to argue their case forcefully.Republicans have a theory and a story about how the economy grows. You know it as supply-side economics: Cutting taxes, especially on the rich, and decreasing regulation will unleash so much innovation and economic activity that tax revenues will actually increase and the entire economy will benefit.This has been the conservative story, which the right has elevated to veritable religion, for 30 or 40 years now. And the Democrats\u2019 alternative story is \u2026 what? If you\u2019re not recalling it, that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t one.The Democrats have impulses, they have beliefs, they even have principles. But they don\u2019t have a story to challenge the supply-side story and tell people about how the economy grows and helps everyone.They used to, once upon a time. It was called Keynesianism, or sometimes demand-side economics (which is why conservatives named their theory supply-side). Keynesianism \u2014 in a nutshell, government investment in public goods increase demand and prosperity \u2014 held sway from the 1940s through the 1970s, the greatest period of economic growth in history.Then came stagflation, which opened the door for the supply-siders. Democrats, by and large, stopped talking about theories. Their story was discredited, so the supply-siders said. Democrats stopped defending public investment, and they stopped defending government.They still defend particular investments that poll well, like infrastructure spending. And they defend specific programs when they know they\u2019re on safe ground, like Social Security and Medicare. And now that Obamacare, or at least the part about making insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions, is registering positive numbers, they\u2019re happy to defend it, as they should.But none of this amounts to an answer to supply-side economics. None of it creates an alternative story about how prosperity is spread.It seems to me that the Democrats\u2019 story has to be built around the simple idea of investing in middle- and working-class people. Not \u201cspending,\u201d but \u201cinvesting.\u201d Spending sounds profligate; investing sounds prudent.This is not to be done for reasons of \u201cfairness.\u201d That\u2019s an absolutely vital point. Liberals reflexively want to make economic arguments about fairness. But this persuades only liberals. People who aren\u2019t liberals \u2014 three-quarters of the country \u2014 don\u2019t especially care about fairness. They do, however, care about growth. So Democrats need to argue that these investments, not tax cuts for the rich, are the way to spur growth.Such an argument stands in direct contrast to the right\u2019s story. Republicans say the rich, with millions returned to them in the form of tax cuts, know best what to do with their money and the market can make the best decisions about investments and society\u2019s needs.It should be fairly easy for Democrats to say to Americans: Look around you. How has that worked out for you?So that\u2019s the easy half of the story \u2014 criticizing supply-side\u2019s failures. The harder half is making the affirmative case for the Democratic theory of growth.That\u2019s an argument that might appeal broadly, but it\u2019s backed up by a theory that in our time is practically seditious: that the public sector can make better decisions about where money should go than the private sector. That is a principle Democrats have been skittish about supporting. But it is one they must start defending without apology.They should defend it because it\u2019s what more and more economists argue and because it\u2019s what Democrats believe. There\u2019s a lot of ideological space between Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, who is among the most left-leaning members of the House. But they\u2019re both Democrats for a reason, and presumably that reason is they think government can be a force for good in people\u2019s lives. So, if Democrats think it, they should say it.And now we have arrived at an alternate theory, a story: Giving more money to working people and investing in their needs is how an economy grows. That\u2019s a direct counterargument to supply-side economics. If enough Democrats say it and say it and say it, they can drive a stake through supply-side\u2019s heart. Once Democrats can make that case, they\u2019ll be able to turn the tables on the supply-siders. Republicans will argue that government investments and wage increases are \u201cjob killers.\u201d But Democrats, rather than merely appealing to people\u2019s consciences, will be able to respond that government investments and wage increases are growth producers that will spread benefits well beyond the top 5 percent or 10 percent.The important thing is the idea. Democrats must persuade America that there\u2019s a better way to expand the economy than the way Republicans have been advocating for decades. Just as inflation and other ills opened the door for critiques of Keynesianism in the 1970s, so have inequality and disinvestment done the same for critiques of supply-side today. Someone just has to make them.Advertisement"}

Most outrageously, top Republicans, including President Trump and Senator Marco Rubio, are arguing that Florida should not carefully count all of the votes from this year\u2019s election. Before the midterms, the leaders of Indivisible, the big progressive grass-roots group, conducted a national survey of its members \u2014 people who had marched, knocked on doors or otherwise gotten politically involved over the past two years. The survey included a list of issues, and asked which should be the Democrats\u2019 top priorities after the midterms. It included health care, gun safety, the environment, civil rights, reproductive rights, taxes, the courts, education and criminal justice reform. And there was a landslide winner. But it wasn\u2019t any of those issues, important as they are.The winning issue was democracy.Some 69 percent of respondents named it in their top three priorities. Health care finished a distant second, at 48 percent. Then came the environment (43 percent), judicial nominations (32 percent) and civil rights (29 percent). \u201cIt comes from this general concern about democratic institutions not being reflective of the will of the people,\u201d Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, told me. Leah Greenberg, also a co-founder, says, \u201cWe have to unrig the rules.\u201d Best of all, the success of the recent ballot initiatives shows that these attitudes exist among many centrists and conservatives, too. More democratic participation won\u2019t solve all of the country\u2019s problems. But it will solve some of them. The United States has low voter turnout for a reason: Our system \u2014 with workday elections, long voting lines and cumbersome registration rules \u2014 is designed to discourage mass participation.

Who will fact-check Gossip Cop?Gossip Cop relies heavily on celebrity publicists to knock down rumors about their famous clients, so it\u2019s tempting to dismiss the site as a public relations arm of the entertainment industry. But there is an emerging rigor to Gossip Cop\u2019s methodology, reflected in the latest iteration of the site and the actions of the website\u2019s founder, Michael E. Lewittes. On the surface, it appears that Gossip Cop has ambitions to become, or at least be treated like, a full-blown fact-checking service on par with PolitiFact and Snopes.This notion is disputed by Mr. Lewittes, a former Access Hollywood producer and tabloid columnist who launched the site with financial backing from Dan Abrams, a television journalist and founder of Abrams Media, the boutique online publisher of Mediaite and The Mary Sue. (Mr. Abrams is listed as co-owner and co-founder, but is not connected to the editorial content of the site; he currently serves as chief legal correspondent for ABC News.)And Mr. Lewittes is the son of Joel Lewittes, a former federal judge, also in New York\u2019s Southern District, and his wife, Lee Kushnir Lewittes, is a booker for the Fox News morning show \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d (According to an online newsletter published earlier this year, the Lewittes family attends Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, the Upper East Side synagogue that, until early 2017, counted Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as members.)While giving verified independent outlets special license to fact-check may help embattled platforms like Facebook and Google help to restore their image in the short-term, in the long-term, as the Weekly Standard episode suggests, the same arrangement has the potential to do more damage.\u201cThe only people \u2018cheated\u2019 here are the tabloid\u2019s readers,\u201d the story said. Around the world, the spheres of politics and entertainment continue to overlap. The need for fact-checking outlets with an understanding of tabloid and celebrity culture, which is now political culture, is only likely to grow. Facebook, as is its way, wouldn\u2019t go into detail about its process for certifying third-party fact checkers. Controversially, the company enforces nondisclosure agreements with fact-checking partners, leaving the facts about fact-checking in a state of shadow. And Gossip Cop, for its part, would not speak of its plans for the future of fact-checking. But there is a world in which Gossip Cop could help determine what celebrity gossip gets to even exist on the internet.The Trump-Daniels affair is an uncomfortable reminder that in 2018, celebrity gossip can regularly be the real news. Almost every outlet that has covered the scandal has quoted or mentioned the story in The Dirty to establish the fact that the rumor predated Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Seven long years ago, Gossip Cop deemed the underlying rumor as false. Maybe more disturbingly, it also was one of only two outlets that bothered to check it out at all. Advertisement"}

Mr. Mahairas is the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s New York Special Operations and Cyber Division, and Mr. Beshar is the general counsel of Marsh & McLennan.Fortunately, there are many steps that both the private and public sectors can take to reduce their dependence on sheer luck.Many water utilities still need to adopt \u201cdefense in depth\u201d\u00a0approaches that create multiple layers of security, instead of relying on passive defenses like antivirus software, email filters and firewalls. The post-air-gap environment requires constant scanning for anomalous network activity as well as rigorous patch management and security upgrades. Utilities need to segregate their consumer and industrial control networks as much as possible and develop contingency plans for operating water systems without computers.Device manufacturers also have a critical role to play by producing more secure hardware for monitoring and managing things like water pressure, leakage and chemical levels.\u00a0Many industrial internet-connected devices are built much like their consumer counterparts, like web-connected toasters and wearable health monitors. As a result, they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a wide range of hackers, from hostile governments to sophisticated criminals. Devices often are too small to include the necessary security hardware, lack the computing power to host security software or can\u2019t be updated when flaws are discovered.Utilities also need more practical cybersecurity guidance from federal agencies, warnings that go beyond the typical bulletin identifying the kind of attack and its source. Depending on the threat, that guidance might be hardware instructions \u2014 like closing unused ports or using single-direction gateways that don\u2019t allow information to flow inward. Or it might point to organized phishing attacks and recommend specific filters for emails and attachments. The more utilities know about threats, the better their chances of defending themselves.Finally, utilities also need to trust the government channels available to them to report attacks. Robust cybersecurity depends on real-time updates about threats and tactics. So if one utility reports an attempted hack of a particular part of its system, utilities everywhere would know to how to fortify that portion of their network. In 2015, Congress gave companies legal protection to share sensitive customer data with the government when it relates to cyberthreats; only six companies have done so. But there is reason for optimism that this number will grow. The F.B.I. has an online portal for this purpose under the InfraGard program; the Department of Homeland Security recently formed the National Risk Management Center to coordinate private- and public-sector defense of infrastructure.

Caneiro is dead, killed on Tuesday along with his wife and children in their stately home in Colts Neck, N.J., which was then set on fire, law enforcement officials said.Paul J. Caneiro, 51, was arrested Wednesday and charged with setting his own house on fire in nearby Ocean Township on the same day his brother\u2019s family was found dead. His wife and two daughters were at home when he lit the blaze, a charging document said.While the two events seemed to be linked, Christopher J. Gramiccioni, the Monmouth County prosecutor, did not name a suspect on Wednesday in the killings of Keith Caneiro, 50; his wife, Jennifer Karidis Caneiro, 45; and their two children, Jesse, 11, and Sophia, 8.He added, however, that residents of the area did not need to be concerned that a random killer was loose among them.\u201cWe believe that in some form or fashion, that this family was targeted,\u201d Mr. Gramiccioni said. He said the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were involved in the investigation.He said one reason no charges had been filed in the killings was that investigators did not yet have full access to the smoldering ruins of Keith Caneiro\u2019s 5,700-square-foot home.Mr. Gramiccioni added that the quadruple homicide scene was \u201cone of most heinous cases\u201d that investigators had ever seen.The brothers appeared to have close ties, owning two businesses together: Square One, the technology consulting firm, and EcoStar Pest Management, the pest control firm, both in the same building on Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park.About 5 a.m. on Tuesday, the police received a report of a fire burning at 27 Tilton Drive in Ocean Township, Paul Caneiro\u2019s home.

But the islands have a rich, complex history beyond that of the textiles industry.Supported byLast fall, just a few days into my trip to the Shetland Islands, the Scottish subarctic archipelago across the sea from Norway, I found myself on the top of a cliff face, peering through the fog at a huge rock in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The rock was topped with a spike of white: the Muckle Flugga lighthouse, built in 1854, a mind-boggling feat as the rock\u2019s cliff face juts straight up out of the roiling sea. In the early days of the lighthouse, our tour guide told us, men had to be hoisted by ropes around their arms to safely cross the gap between their boat and the landing area on the rock. At this most northerly point in the U.K, I felt a profound sense that I was very far from home.Before I left New York, the only thing I really knew about Shetland was that it is the birthplace of Fair Isle knitting (Fair Isle being the most remote of the islands), a technique of colorwork recognizable in traditional sweaters. What I found was a place with a complex history beyond that of the knitting industry, difficult to get to but well worth the journey.In Shetland, knitting is a tradition that goes back centuries and is embedded in the place\u2019s rich history. Sheep here outnumber people by 20 to 1, and inclement weather on the islands has encouraged the local sheep to grow a softer and lighter weight fiber that makes Shetland wool unique.For much of the 20th century the textile industry was an important element of Shetland\u2019s local economy; women farmers, before production was moved to factories, knitted the yokes of sweaters to be sent abroad while they walked to and from the fields.Today, knitters in Shetland are unambiguously celebrated for their vision and skill; frequent signs on the road advertise local designers whose homes double as shops.There are about 100 islands in Shetland, though only 16 are inhabited. To get to mainland Shetland, one either takes an overnight ferry or a small plane from Aberdeen, on the coast of Scotland (I took the ferry, a very memorable roller-coaster experience on the heaving sea that I\u2019m nonetheless not sure I want to experience again). Some of the smaller islands\u2019 municipal needs are taken care of from Lerwick on mainland Shetland, the islands\u2019s central port and biggest city (with a population of about 7,500), which is also where the hub of the festival is.Often when you curve around a bend in the road the view before you is breathtaking, and if you are driving a car you have to be careful not to drive right off the road. Cliffs drop precipitously just feet from the pavement; inlets have choppy waves (and, in summer, killer whales who pick off sleepy seals), enormous rocks jut up from the ocean just off the coast, and everywhere, roofs and boats and houses are painted cheerful colors that burst against the overcast sky.In the winter, there is a month of near-perpetual darkness, and in the summer, a month of continuous sunlight; the wind, I was told, is constant no matter the time of year, though at certain times it is known to gust harder, stronger, or more or less predictably (in September, the month I was there, the winds are known as \u201cthe Equinox gales\u201d).Considering the size of Shetland, Wool Week is incredibly vast and diverse. The program is eight full days, and each day features myriad classes and exhibitions, tours, gatherings, teas and lectures on nearly all of the islands; on a random day, I counted 54 different offerings.For such a small place, Shetland offers an incredible amount to attract visitors. In addition to the textile industry, visitors are drawn by archaeology \u2014 (there are ancient sites scattered all over the islands), by geology (the islands sit atop a network of tectonic plates and boast an array of ancient and volcanic rocks), by caving and kayaking, and by an enormous diversity of nesting seabirds (puffins, who nest there in the 100s of thousands in the summer, are a popular draw).Two of the nights we were there, there were sightings of the northern lights, ethereal streaks of color across the night sky. The main industry on Shetland is still fishing \u2014 primarily mackerel, herring and salmon farming \u2014 and more than 75 percent of Scotland\u2019s mussels are produced there.Getting there was a bit of a challenge \u2014 as with most everywhere on the islands, there are no street addresses, so one has to know the landmarks one is looking for, or pray that Google recognizes what you are searching for and can lead you to the correct dropped pin.Jamieson and Smith Shetland Wool BrokersLerwickmainlandJamieson\u2019s ofShetlandA970ScallowayCastleB9073Virdafjell Bedand BreakfastUradale FarmGulberwickNorth SeaDetail, below1 mileNorwayMuckle FluggaLighthousescotlandAberdeenbritainunstHermanessNationalNatureReserveireland250 milesyellOllaberry HallEshaness Lighthousemainlandshetland islandsDetail, topAtlantic OceanNorth Sea20 milesBy The New York TimesUradale Farm is actively trying to bring more of the native Shetland sheep back to Shetland \u2014 currently, of about 150,000 sheep on Shetland (compared to 25,000 people), less than 30,000 are native, though the native sheep are the ones most well-adapted to thrive on the islands.Ronnie decried the phasing out of native sheep \u2014 for many years, only white wool has been worth any money (white wool can be more easily dyed, and is considered more \u201cpure\u201d for no clear reason), though native sheep are traditionally black or brown (or \u201cmoorit\u201d). Asked whether he saw any change, he spoke about Wool Week and the bigger crowds it brings to the islands every year, all with interest in and passion for the native wool. \u201cYou\u2019re standing here, that\u2019s the change,\u201d he said. Before Wool Week started nine years ago, he said, the situation seemed quite desperate.After he talked, he brought us into his colorful home (a rainbow is painted on the ceiling) for tea and more homebakes, and spoke a bit more generally about the increased interest that Wool Week has brought to Shetland (he and his wife also then let us shop for wool in their living room). One of the organizers I spoke to said that Wool Week in 2017 brought in more than 700,000 pounds (or about $900,000) to the local economy, and that doesn\u2019t include all that was spent at local shops, restaurants, or B & Bs by the 600 attendees. In 2018, nearly 700 people made the trip, primarily from Europe, the United States and Canada, but also from many farther-flung places such as Australia, Japan, Egypt, Lebanon, Indonesia and Israel.Where is all of this attention coming from? The BBC series has helped, as has perhaps a general back-to-basics interest in those of us who feel increasingly distanced from a natural form of community in our modern world.One doesn\u2019t want to get too positive \u2014 nearly every person who shared with us the good news about a resurgence of interest in the knitting industry was also quick to share the difficulties their line of work still faces (the general demand is still for inexpensive, mass-produced white wool, and the market for handmade goods is still small and imperiled) \u2014 but standing on the shores of Shetland during Wool Week, a knitter can\u2019t help but feel optimistic, and a person can\u2019t help but feel swept away.Nellie Hermann is the author most recently of the novel \u201cThe Season of Migration,\u201d and is a fellow at The Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the mystery writer who set a series of murder mysteries on the Shetland Islands.

{"Headline": "Maybe They\u2019re Just Bad People", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot all Trump support is ideological.Opinion ColumnistSeven years ago, a former aide to Ralph Reed \u2014 who also worked, briefly, for Paul Manafort \u2014 published a tawdry, shallow memoir that is also one of the more revealing political books I\u2019ve ever read. Lisa Baron was a pro-choice, pro-gay rights, hard-partying Jew who nonetheless made a career advancing the fortunes of the Christian right. She opened her book with an anecdote about performing oral sex on a future member of the George W. Bush administration during the 2000 primary, which, she wrote, \u201cperfectly summed up my groupie-like relationship to politics at that time \u2014 I wanted it, I worshiped it, and I went for it.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly a secret that politics is full of amoral careerists lusting \u2014 literally or figuratively \u2014 for access to power. Still, if you\u2019re interested in politics because of values and ideas, it can be easier to understand people who have foul ideologies than those who don\u2019t have ideologies at all. Steve Bannon, a quasi-fascist with delusions of grandeur, makes more sense to me than Anthony Scaramucci, a political cipher who likes to be on TV. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone. Consider all the energy spent trying to figure out Ivanka Trump\u2019s true beliefs, when she\u2019s shown that what she believes most is that she\u2019s entitled to power and prestige.Baron\u2019s book, \u201cLife of the Party: A Political Press Tart Bares All,\u201d is useful because it is a self-portrait of a cynical, fame-hungry narcissist, a common type but one underrepresented in the stories we tell about partisan combat. A person of limited self-awareness \u2014 she seemed to think readers would find her right-wing exploits plucky and cute \u2014 Baron became Reed\u2019s communications director because she saw it as a steppingstone to her dream job, White House press secretary, a position she envisioned in mostly sartorial terms. (\u201cOutfits would be planned around the news of the day,\u201d she wrote.) Reading Baron\u2019s story helped me realize emotionally something I knew intellectually. It\u2019s tempting for those of us who interpret politics for a living to overstate the importance of competing philosophies. We shouldn't forget the enduring role of sheer vanity. This story, like Baron\u2019s book, is arresting in its picture of shameless, unvarnished thirst. White and Eure mouth some talking points about disliking \u201cidentity politics\u201d and valuing \u201cauthenticity.\u201d Like a lot of Trump apologists, White insists the president isn\u2019t racist because African-American employment figures have improved during his administration. But the lurid opportunism that\u2019s driving him and his husband to embrace Trump is obvious. Such opportunism is far from rare; it\u2019s just not often that we see it exhibited so starkly.In many ways, the insincere Trumpists are the most frustrating. Because they don\u2019t really believe in Trump\u2019s belligerent nationalism and racist conspiracy theories, we keep expecting them to feel shame or remorse. But they\u2019re not insincere because they believe in something better than Trumpism. Rather, they believe in very little. They are transactional in a way that makes no psychological sense to those of us who see politics as a moral drama; they might as well all be wearing jackets saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesProject ahead a year or two: It is much easier to make a case for a troubled stock market than for a booming one.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.That abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201dI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201dGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.The stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201dMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.That last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.The stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.And that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.Yet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201dI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.The odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.If that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.But he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.After a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Makes Superstar Conductor Gustavo Dudamel So Good?", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "FeatureThe Venezuelan maestro of the Los Angeles Philharmonic conjures joy in difficult times.Supported byNot so many people believe in higher beauty these days, but Dudamel, the conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, believes in it. He believes in truth too, and in joy \u2014 especially in joy \u2014 and in the brotherhood of humankind and the freedom of the human spirit. Everywhere he goes, he brings a dog-eared copy of Rousseau\u2019s \u201cConfessions\u201d and the battered \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d that he has carried around since his youth in Venezuela. Now he and his orchestra, along with the chorus of the London Symphony, were about to tackle one of the purest expressions of the ideals he finds most stirring \u2014 the final movement of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, the \u201cOde to Joy.\u201dThe tip of Dudamel\u2019s baton dipped. BOOM! BADADA-DOOM! The timpani thundered in the empty auditorium. Then came the slashing string and wind lines, like rain blowing sideways, with which Beethoven conjures maximum chaos and desperation before the bass soloist suddenly breaks through, singingO Freunde! Nicht diese T\u00f6ne!Sondern lasst uns angenehmere anstimmen, undfreudenvollere.O friends! Not these sounds!Let us instead strike up more pleasingand more joyful ones!The instrumentalists were jet-lagged after their flight from Los Angeles. Dudamel himself spent the morning conducting a youth orchestra and then presided, onstage at the Barbican, over the release of a manifesto on the future of the arts written by young people from Los Angeles and Britain. He was exhausted, and he was starting to lose his voice. Slowly, though, over the course of the next hour, the music started to change.Dudamel uses the word \u201cmagic\u201d without hesitation when he talks about music; what happened now was that the Ninth began to be magical. Dudamel moved his hands on the air like a person describing the ocean, and the strings melted. He shook his fist like a king defying god, and happy avalanches crashed down on the empty seats. This, this was what he loved, the plummet and swell of it, the rumble, the hush, the roar when he lifted his arms. The beauty! The joy! The music!When everything comes together like this, when hundreds of people work as one to create something so special, he knows he is right to believe what Maestro Abreu taught him. What can sound na\u00efve and superficial in hard times is actually fundamental. Music can unite the world. The hope of human freedom lives in art. The world will change \u2014 he believes this sincerely \u2014 if people only listen.In Los Angeles, Dudamel conducts one of the best-paid, most critically acclaimed and most financially stable orchestras in America. The base pay for an L.A. Phil musician is more than $150,000, with the top principal making $500,000 or more; Dudamel himself earns just over $3 million a year. The orchestra reported $141 million in revenue in its 2016 tax filings and $170 million the year before that. Dudamel works in one of the world\u2019s great palaces of music, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, a shining silver confetti-burst designed by his close friend Frank Gehry. At times there\u2019s something almost comical about the ease with which the Phil\u2019s success has toppled conventional wisdom. At a moment when classical music is said to be divided between traditionalist audiences and progressive musicians, the Phil draws large, enthusiastic crowds to concerts of challenging new music. At a time when classical music is said to be exclusively for rich white people, hundreds of children from diverse racial and economic backgrounds participate in the Phil\u2019s education program, Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, which Dudamel helped found as one of his first acts after being hired in Los Angeles. Soon YOLA will have a new center in Inglewood, also designed by Gehry.The L.A. Phil\u2019s current season, 2018-19, is its 100th. This fall, it started an ambitious centennial celebration, a yearlong dazzle of world premieres and spectacular performances, with Dudamel squarely at the center. There have been parades, parties, concerts with pop stars. All over the city, on the poles of streetlights, advertising banners show him in the throes of performance, his face rapturous, his baton crashing down, his curls flying. Dudamel loves making music in Los Angeles. \u201cWe are doing something here that is an example of how things can work,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is bringing people together. For people to feel included. You know?\u201d The orchestra was in great shape before he arrived, under its previous music director, the acclaimed Finnish conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, but under Dudamel, it has soared. \u201cYou cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cI see people here sitting, they can be Democrats, they can be Republicans, they can be Catholics, they can be Protestant, or they can be whatever. But they are sitting listening to music. And they say hi and they embrace each other and they talk.\u201dMany conductors see their roles as explicitly political. Daniel Barenboim campaigns for the rights of Palestinians; Leonard Bernstein was famously ridiculed by Tom Wolfe, in his essay \u201cRadical Chic,\u201d for hosting a Black Panthers fund-raiser at his apartment. Dudamel\u2019s approach is more circumspect. A central part of his message is that music is not ideological. It is a way of \u201cbuilding bridges,\u201d he thinks, a language \u201cthat talks to everybody.\u201d The danger of thinking ideologically, he feels, is that \u201cyou get stuck in one or the other side, and we don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t believe in that. I don\u2019t believe in one or the other. I believe in the people that I see.\u201dDudamel is aware of what some people say about him. He tries to tune it out. \u201cPeople will always criticize,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople will always create stories. If you get inside of that, then you don\u2019t live, you don\u2019t have a life.\u201dThose are hard questions. But for now? The music is marvelous, the long days are full of pleasure and all the time, he says, \u201cI get more and more and more in love with what I do.\u201dDidn\u2019t Rousseau say somewhere that we carry our own happiness with us, in our hearts?That first day, though, he was only clowning around. This was in Barquisimeto, Dudamel\u2019s hometown, the capital of the northwestern Venezuelan state of Lara. The teacher didn\u2019t show up for his orchestra class, so Dudamel got up from his seat in the violin section and pretended to lead the rehearsal. His friends laughed. But then something happened that no one could explain. The mood in the room changed. He asked the class to play a passage, and he found that being up there, directing the music, felt perfectly natural to him. He seemed to know what to say, and how to move, to make the young musicians follow him. His friends stopped laughing and started working on the piece. The teacher, arriving late, watched from the back of the room. Afterward he asked Dudamel to be his assistant conductor.El Sistema is legendary in Venezuela. There is no way to talk about Gustavo Dudamel, its most famous product, without reckoning with the ways in which El Sistema influenced him or with the ways in which he was molded by its director, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu.Abreu: almost as legendary in Venezuela as the institution he founded. Picture him: A gaunt, penetrating man, bald, with a prominent brow, glasses and a crooked mouth. Jacket and tie; heavy overcoat even in the summer. In 1975, Abreu, who studied economics as well as music, and who served in the Venezuelan congress, started a new youth orchestra, dedicated to the idea that music can inspire social change. The first meeting was held in a parking garage. The \u201corchestra\u201d was made up of a handful of teenagers. He had a gift for uniting followers behind his vision; within a year, he had built an ensemble, taken it to a festival in Scotland and won critical praise for his work. He persuaded the government to finance what he soon began to see as his movement.What Abreu\u2019s message consisted of \u2014 what sort of social change El Sistema was meant to promulgate \u2014 was not always precisely clear. His statements tended toward the gnomic: The orchestra is an ideal image of society; music strengthens the spiritual development of the country; students who play in an orchestra develop a different set of values. He was also a canny politician who knew how to frame El Sistema\u2019s message to suit the priorities of whatever government happened to be in power. Are you a revolutionary socialist with strong authoritarian tendencies? Meet our symphony, which projects a proud national image and elevates children in poverty. (Please remember these keywords when it\u2019s time to renew our funding.)The older maestro was no fool. He knew what he had when he saw it. One reason it matters that all children have access to the arts, after all, is that the history of the world is a graveyard of lost geniuses. Think about the poems, songs and paintings that might have been, if a wider range of people had been given the tools to create them; if women, say, had been encouraged to explore their creativity rather than having it forcibly repressed for millenniums or if poor children had been taught to read. The mind reels. The symphonies we don\u2019t have are greater than the symphonies we do.There\u2019s the physical element, of course: the ability to communicate the rhythm, flow, texture and shifting moods of a piece of music through a set of traditional (yet freely elaborated) gestures. Conducting is a kind of strange, proactive dance. You move your body not in response to music but in anticipation of it. You need a perfect sense of tempo \u2014 you can have the most fluid wrists in the world, but that won\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t keep good time.The Venezuelan director Alberto Arvelo, who became a close friend of Dudamel\u2019s while filming a 2006 documentary about El Sistema, remembers giving Dudamel a copy of the score for the film, music he had never seen before. Dudamel read it as if it were a poem, turning the pages, smiling at the happy parts, looking sad when the mood darkened.More mysterious is the gift of communication. How do you put across your understanding of a musical work to the group of musicians whose performance of it will usher it into existence? Musicians who work with Dudamel tend to say that what sets him apart from other conductors isn\u2019t anything grand or obvious; it\u2019s an accumulation of small moments. How he speaks to them. How he listens to them.It was the end of May, the end of the season. On Friday night, the Phil would begin its final run of performances before moving for the summer from the Disney Hall (indoors, posh) to the Hollywood Bowl (outdoors, Sting plays there, you can eat a Snickers in your seat). For the finale of the orchestra\u2019s 99th season, essentially the lead-in to this year\u2019s centennial extravaganza, Dudamel was putting on \u201cDas Paradies und die Peri,\u201d Schumann\u2019s gigantic concert oratorio: nearly two hours long, renowned singers in dramatic roles, a huge chorus, shattering climaxes, tunes for days. The text tells the story of a Peri, a kind of benevolent fallen angel, who can gain admission to heaven only by bringing the proper gift to the gates of paradise. She tries three times, in escalatingly romantic-allegorical ways, and it\u2019s the third gift, the last tear of a sinner who repented on his deathbed, that causes the gates to open. The Peri enters heaven, to cloudbursts and hosannas.Famous in Schumann\u2019s lifetime, \u201cDas Paradies,\u201d composed in 1843, is seldom performed now; Dudamel came across it a few years ago and immediately felt he\u2019d discovered a masterpiece. \u201cI was like, my God,\u201d he whispers, recalling the moment. \u201cWhat is this? My God, how to deal for such a long time with that amount of beauty?\u201dThe difficulty seemed great enough when he was studying the score on his own, but once he began working with the musicians, it became even more pronounced. On Tuesday of that week, when the full chorus came in to rehearse with the soloists, Dudamel realized that the production design had caused them to be seated too far back, all the way behind the stage, in seats normally reserved for audience members, from which hinterland they couldn\u2019t see him properly and couldn\u2019t hear the soloists. The chorus members had little LED lights that clipped onto their music folders so they could see their scores in the dark; from the podium, they looked like a sea of distant white pinpricks. Then on Wednesday, when the singers were joined by the full orchestra, it became clear that the location of the soloists\u2019 elevated platform, which was positioned above and behind the instrumentalists, would make it hard for the Peri and others to be heard over the strings and winds. Now the singers were all out of sync, and the orchestra members were playing too loudly, because they weren\u2019t listening to the singers at all.The way Dudamel looks at it, he\u2019s not a ruler; he\u2019s more like an ally of the players. He is on hand to offer his thoughts, help them sound their best. Cooperation gets better results. Musicians, he thinks, are like everyone else. Music is supposed to feel good. Doesn\u2019t everyone do their best when they feel good?Dudamel does not see it that way, however. From his perspective, life is a series of invisibly overlapping moments, and he has lived each one as sincerely as he could. \u201cMy path,\u201d he says, \u201cthis path has been so natural.\u201d All his experiences have led him here, to this place where he feels so happy. Why would he draw lines? Every day is new.He goes hiking now, for instance. Maria, his new wife, takes him, and not in a million years could he ever have seen himself doing that. But he does it because he loves her, and because he loves her, he finds that he loves it, too. Being in love \u2014 nothing is more beautiful than that! Love is \u201cpure, pure, pure inspiration,\u201d he says. Love expands your horizons in ways you never could have imagined. Life is not about measuring up to arbitrary stages. Life is about staying open to the experience of life.He was sitting in his office, an hour or so before the season\u2019s final concert. Martin, his 7-year-old son, was encamped behind his desk, playing Minecraft on the iMac. Outside the door, Dudamel\u2019s assistant, Ebner Sobalvarro, a young man with a shaved head and rimless glasses, sat at his own desk, greeting the musicians going past with their instrument cases. An oboist was warming up down the hall. A soprano sang scales.How to deal for such a long time with this amount of beauty? When so much of the world is not, cannot be, beautiful? It made him sad, he said, so sad, to see the suffering in the world, the hunger, the misery in Venezuela. \u201cVery complex and very bad,\u201d Dudamel told me. In 2014, amid falling oil prices and violence in the streets, Dudamel and Abreu appeared on television with Maduro, to look at the blueprints for a new concert hall in Barquisimeto. It would be designed by Frank Gehry and named after Dudamel.El Sistema views music as a source of social change, but depends on the good will of an authoritarian government for its survival; hence perhaps Dudamel\u2019s reluctance to speak explicitly about politics. The more political he becomes, the more he puts his social movement at risk. Now he was rehearsing with the Bol\u00edvars, but only over FaceTime, and there were rumors on music blogs that he had been banned from going home or that Maduro would have him arrested if he tried.

{"Headline": "Why an Economic Populist Pitch Failed in Coal Country", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOGAN, W.Va. \u2014 Richard Ojeda presented himself as a new face of the Democratic Party: a tough guy in combat boots whose economic populism was the key to flipping coal country and maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 a model for winning in rural America in the age of Donald J. Trump.But on Tuesday he lost badly, taking just two out of the 18 counties that make up the Third Congressional District, a swath in the southern coal fields that is home to Mr. Ojeda and many of the teachers he supported. He even lost his home county, Logan, by 24 points.\u201cI was absolutely slapped in the face when I saw the totals,\u201d said Heather Ritter, a school librarian and supporter of Mr. Ojeda, the day after the election.She added, \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand what\u2019s just happened and the gravity of this.\u201dWhile the Democrats succeeded in winning back the House \u2014 and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia managed to hang onto his seat \u2014 the magnitude of Mr. Ojeda\u2019s loss served as a stinging reminder to Democrats of the enduring power of Mr. Trump in rural parts of the country, particularly in Appalachia.Mr. Ojeda\u2019s supporters expected him to become a major force on the national stage, an important corrective to past mistakes when Democrats did not listen to working-class voters. Instead, he was dragged down by the undertow of nationalized politics \u2014 with Mr. Trump making many visits to West Virginia and supporting Mr. Ojeda\u2019s opponent, Carol Miller, whose main appeal to voters appeared to be her connection to the president.Antipathy toward Mr. Trump helped drive record turnout in some parts of the country, but many voters also came out to support the president. This was especially true in West Virginia, where more than 47 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters turned out on Tuesday \u2014 significantly more than in recent midterm years, according to the West Virginia secretary of state. In 51 interviews in five different towns in the district where Mr. Ojeda ran, a majority of voters said they turned out to defend the president.Dennis McCloud, a retired coal miner in the tiny town of Dingess, said he was voting for the first time in a midterm election. He said he had come to show support for Mr. Trump, who he said had been besieged by the news media and Democrats.\u201cIf he says this cone is red, they\u2019ll say it\u2019s blue,\u201d said Mr. McCloud, 65, pointing to a traffic cone on the sidewalk as he stood outside an elementary school in Dingess, where he had just voted for Ms. Miller, a candidate he said he hadn\u2019t heard much about.\u201cI never felt this strongly about a president before,\u201d said Mr. McCloud, who was about to go celebrate his birthday \u2014 and his vote \u2014 with a steak.Matt Stanley, a school administrator who was staring in disbelief at the election results at Mr. Ojeda\u2019s election night party, said he saw them as a grim sign for the American political system.\u201cIt\u2019s just disgusting that social media rules,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he says they don\u2019t believe, but what they see on the computer, they do believe. Explain that to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around it.\u201dOf Ms. Miller, he said: \u201cShe didn\u2019t show up to anything. She didn\u2019t have to.\u201dMs. Miller, a state delegate, was relatively unknown among voters and mostly avoided interviews and open public appearances during the campaign. Even the men sitting in lawn chairs behind a large sign that urged voters in Dingess to choose Ms. Miller were thin on details about their candidate.\u201cDon\u2019t know that much about her to be honest with you,\u201d said Hayden Hannah, 70, a retired timber worker, \u201cbut she stands for Trump and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201dMs. Miller did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.Some voters said Mr. Ojeda had himself to blame for the poor showing. Carl Blevins, a retired coal miner in Chapmanville who said he did not like Mr. Trump and his style, said he also did not support Mr. Ojeda for some of the same reasons.\u201cHe was his own worst enemy,\u201d Mr. Blevins said, sitting with a group of friends on Wednesday at Tudor\u2019s Biscuit World. \u201cThere\u2019s an arrogance, like he knows more than the rest of us.\u201dMr. Trump made a number of trips to West Virginia to stump for Republicans, most recently last Friday. He has singled out Mr. Ojeda personally, calling him \u201cstone-cold crazy\u201d and \u201ca total wacko.\u201dMary Frances, a 78-year-old from Dingess, said she had come to vote for the sole purpose of supporting the president. She said she supported Ms. Miller, even though she did not know much about her.\u201cThere are too many crooked politicians \u2014 one is about as good as the next one,\u201d she said. But Mr. Trump was different, she said, and he was protecting the country, including from the caravan of migrants, a large traveling group that moved from Central America into Mexico last month. \u201cIf all those people come in here it will decimate this country,\u201d Ms. Frances said.On Tuesday night, Mr. Ojeda pledged to keep fighting, but also pondered whether it was even possible for a Democrat to win in West Virginia\u2019s Third Congressional District, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 50 points in 2016.\u201cLook, I really don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the outcome, but I\u2019m telling you right now, any place else in the United States of America we would have won. Anyplace else. We just happened to run in the reddest \u2014 and I hate to say this \u2014 an area where people just completely will fall for what we just had.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe had a president who came down here and said \u2018Hey, I want you all to vote for her.\u2019 They didn\u2019t look and say, \u2018Why should we vote for her?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Russians had staged a pogrom against the Jewish residents of a village \u2014 an organized act of ethnic persecution \u2014 storming a wedding celebration.Connor Drew and his girlfriend had just stepped into the lobby after the house lights went up when he heard a disturbance in the upper balcony.There was shouting. In a display that shocked audience members, a man stood up and yelled \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Trump\u201d repeatedly during the intermission, according to several witnesses. It was the latest in a recent string of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States. Mr. Drew said the man was escorted out minutes later.\u201cEveryone was whispering and consoling everyone because a lot of people were really startled,\u201d Mr. Drew said in an interview. A woman sitting nearby was on her phone expressing fear that there was about to be another mass shooting, he added. \u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of violence. I was just more afraid of the situation in general and seeing how people were shaken by it.\u201dBeth Pendergast attended the touring production with her 23-year-old daughter. She was sitting near the man in the balcony when he started to yell, and said the incident was \u201cfrightening and disturbing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m like shrinking in my seat thinking, \u2018Oh my God, does this guy have a gun?\u2019\u201d Ms. Pendergast said.Matthew Jablow, a spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department, said that no charges would be filed.\u201cAs reprehensible as the man\u2019s words were, they are considered protected free speech because nobody was directly threatened,\u201d Mr. Jablow said. The show went on after intermission.Late Thursday, the Baltimore police identified the man as Anthony M. Derlunas II, 58. According to the police report, Mr. Derlunas said he had been \u201cdrinking heavily throughout the night.\u201d He told officers he yelled the slogans because the final scene before intermission reminded him of his hatred for President Trump. According to the officer, Mr. Derlunas went on to say that the anger directed at him after his disruption was an indication of a high number of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in the theater. Mr. Derlunas could not be reached for comment.The National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene said in a statement that \u201canti-Semitic outbursts during the Baltimore production of \u2018Fiddler,\u2019 precisely after a scene of a pogrom, shows how anti-Semitism is unfortunately still alive and well in 2018.\u201dThe statement said, \u201cthe cast and company of the Yiddish \u2018Fiddler\u2019 is still reeling from the Pittsburgh massacre.\u201d\u201cI was waiting to hear a gunshot, frankly,\u201d Mr. Scherr said, adding that several members of the audience began to run for the exits. Security escorted Mr. Derlunas out, according to Mr. Scherr, \u201cwith no commotion.\u201dThe whole incident lasted about five minutes, and a spokesman for the Hippodrome said Mr. Derlunas was now banned from the theater.The Hippodrome issued a statement describing how its security team, along with the ushers, was able to remove Mr. Derlunas from the theater.

{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Nice Lady Caucus in Congress", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisWith 100-plus women heading to the House, let\u2019s examine some myths.Ms. Chira is a senior correspondent and editor on gender issues for The New York Times.The 116th Congress will have a record number of women. So that means more women will bring their vaunted ability to compromise and work across the aisle. Right?No, as it turns out, women are no more immune to the forces intensifying partisanship than men. That\u2019s what political scientists have found. And some of the positive qualities women are praised for bringing to public office \u2014 collegiality, collaboration, relentless work ethic \u2014 aren\u2019t born of some sort of innate gendered goodness. Chalk it up to self-preservation. As in other fields, women in politics often feel that they are held to a higher standard than men \u2014 and that they may lose their seats if they don\u2019t deliver legislation.Rather than an outbreak of bipartisanship, party polarization among women could well increase. That\u2019s because the majority of women elected are Democrats, many Republican women elected are conservatives who\u2019ve embraced President Trump, and both parties face pressures from their base to tack left or right.It is true that women in Congress play on softball teams that include Democrats and Republicans \u2014 with no fewer than four captains last year, two Democrats (Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida) and two Republicans (Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida). The men, on the other hand, play partisan ball. Women in the Senate gather for a regular dinner, and there is a longstanding bipartisan Women\u2019s Caucus. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into bipartisanship on votes or even sponsoring bills.\u201cIt\u2019s Washington lore that at cocktail parties you develop these friends, everyone holds hands and sings \u2018Kumbaya\u2019 \u2014 but you\u2019re first and foremost a partisan when you get to Capitol Hill,\u201d said Jennifer L. Lawless, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.She and a colleague evaluated bipartisanship on several measures, including how often men and women co-sponsor bills with members of the opposite party and whether men and women opted to travel on official congressional delegations with members of both parties, rather than stick to one-party travel. They found no differences between the sexes.Tracy Osborn, a political scientist at the University of Iowa, notes that most research has found female politicians have grown apart ideologically. In her study analyzing roll-call votes in state legislatures, she found increasing polarization. Moderate Republican women once joined forces with Democrats to support such issues as abortion rights, but moderate women have felt increasingly unwelcome in the Republican Party, said Michele Swers, a professor of government at Georgetown. Democrats are in their own tug of war between progressives and centrists.A database of all bills introduced to the House of Representatives from 1963 to 2009 showed that women not only propose more legislation than men, but they also do so on a wider range of issues. That research, conducted by Mary Layton Atkinson and Jason Harold Windett, political scientists at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, found that women who were successful at deterring challengers in primaries introduced twice as many bills as men. They deduced that women feel they must demonstrate more accomplishments than men to stay in office. Indeed, studies have found that women in Congress are highly effective \u2014 they steer more federal spending to their districts than male legislators and have higher rates of passage of their sponsored bills, for example, according to Mirya R. Holman, a political scientist at Tulane University. (The only exception is bills on issues affecting women, health, education and social welfare, which may encounter institutional roadblocks).\u201cWe\u2019re still partisan \u2014 just better,\u201d Professor Lawless said of women in Congress.Women in Congress say they bring their perspective to fill yawning gaps and previous blind spots in legislation. Issues at the forefront of the Democrats\u2019 agenda affect women disproportionately \u2014 more women live in poverty, more receive Medicare or Medicaid because they live longer than men, and many women oversee health care and education in their households.Veteran congresswomen cite examples of their advocacy. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said she presses to make sure that clinical trials include women of color, since they have often been left out of medical studies. Professor Swers noted that Senators Gillibrand of New York and Claire McCaskill of Missouri and former Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire were driving forces behind hearings and legislation on sexual assault in the military, even if their specific solutions differed.Of 83 women interviewed by the political scientist Kelly Dittmar and her co-authors for a recent book on women in Congress, \u201cA Seat at the Table,\u201d many said that they focused on getting things done \u2014 and that building personal ties can help them try to find some aspect of policy they can collaborate on. So even if the overall number of bipartisan bills isn\u2019t different for women than for men, they do feel as though collaboration matters.Representative Grace Meng, Democrat of New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing scientifically proven, but I do feel women legislators have a very different dynamic when they\u2019re working together. I have a network of women members, and when we have ideas we bounce them off each other and no one\u2019s worried about someone stealing credit.\u201d She conceded that it has been harder than ever before to find cross-party agreement, but she pointed to two bipartisan initiatives: hearings on sexual assaults in the workplace, and her work with Republicans to offer wider access to feminine hygiene products. And constituent protection will unite congressional delegations: Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, worked with her Democratic colleague from Alabama, Representative Terri Sewell, to defeat amendments that would have harmed Alabama\u2019s catfish industry, much of it in Representative Sewell\u2019s district.Professor Swers noted that women elected from swing districts will have incentives to embrace moderation and strike compromises to keep their seats and to placate voters disillusioned with congressional paralysis. With Democrats in control of the House, more women will be in positions of power in the institution \u2014 Nancy Pelosi of California may well become speaker again, and women will head a few powerful committees like Appropriations and Financial Services. In the end, even with the record numbers of women elected, they remain less than one quarter of Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re still a foreign body,\u201d Representative Meng said.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ll explain more below.1A. TIL a new way of saying \u201cmake crazy\u201d: If you ADDLE someone, you are putting them at sea.20A: I didn\u2019t believe that VIKES was a legitimate nickname for the Minn.

The things you learn in this job.56A: \u201cTag line?\u201d is better known as a punch line or line at the end of an advertisement, but not today. Today, we\u2019re playing tag and the answer to that clue is I\u2019M IT. The crossing of I\u2019M IT with I AM ALI at 45D seemed like a dupe to me, but Mr. Ezersky says that type of dupe in a puzzle doesn\u2019t bother him.2D: Whew, that\u2019s some tough wordplay there. \u201cArm for taking needles, for short?\u201d is hinting at the arm of a larger department, not a human arm that might take a needle. The answer is D.E.A.62D/63D: I really laughed out loud when I finally got this, because I got it without even knowing why it was right. I automatically filled in OMG for 62D\u2019s \u201cTexter\u2019s \u2018No 63D,\u2019\u201d because I read it as a solver being upset because a clue was missing (something that, in past years, used to keep me up at night). Once I moved on to 63D (\u201cSee 62-Down\u201d), I could see that 62D needed to be read as \u201cNo WAY!,\u201d which is a synonym for OMG.\u201cGO WEST YOUNG MAN, go west,\u201d was an expression first used by John Babsone Lane Soule in the Terre Haute Express in 1851. The author and journalist Horace Greeley \u2014 a proponent of western expansion into the territories \u2014 liked it, and rephrased it slightly for an editorial in the New York Tribune on July 13, 1865: \"Go West, young man, and grow up with the country.\"What does this have to do with our puzzle? Mr. Ezersky noticed that he could emulate that phrase inside a grid by taking a set of phrases that ended in LAD \u2014 a synonym for \u201cyoung man\u201d \u2014 and moving that LAD all the way to the left or west side of the phrase.I will admit that I got the revealer right off the bat, because what other advice is Horace Greeley really known for? (Horace Greeley experts appearing in force in 3 \u2026 2 ... 1 ...) Once I got GO WEST, YOUNG MAN, though, I honestly thought that the theme entries were going to be written in backward, as if they were traveling from east to west.But no. That\u2019s not enough for our Mr. Ezersky. He has to take an entire word and move it from one place to another. For example, at 17A, the clue is \u201cMany a hit by Def Leppard,\u201d and the answer is POWER BALLAD. But that\u2019s not how you write it in. You take the LAD at the eastern end of the phrase, move him west, and you wind up with LADPOWERBAL. Now you move the other three young men west.Welp, this is about everything the constructor and solver side of me could have wanted:1. A theme with an unconventional revealer that leads to quite the \u201caha!\u201d moment.2. Kooky bits of fill like I AM ALI and DVD-VIDEO to accompany a youthful, sportsy vibe in AIGHT, NOOB, VIKES and BREES. 3. Shout-outs to (objectively) awesome things in the clues, from Kendrick Lamar to Taco Bell\u2019s Baja Blast.But constructor Sam is just one solver. Editor Sam certainly knows that this puzzle isn\u2019t for everyone, and promises to make sure constructor Sam chills on those sick, twisted puzzles he creates ... it\u2019s been quite the stretch as of late!

If true, some fear the feat could open the door to \u201cdesigner babies.\u201d Ever since scientists created the powerful gene editing technique Crispr, they have braced apprehensively for the day when it would be used to create a genetically altered human being. Many nations banned such work, fearing it could be misused to alter everything from eye color to I.Q.Now, the moment they feared may have come. On Monday, a scientist in China announced that he had created the world\u2019s first genetically edited babies, twin girls who were born this month.The researcher, He Jiankui, said that he had altered a gene in the embryos, before having them implanted in the mother\u2019s womb, with the goal of making the babies resistant to infection with H.I.V. He has not published the research in any journal and did not share any evidence or data that definitively proved he had done it.But his previous work is known to many experts in the field, who said \u2014 many with alarm \u2014 that it was entirely possible he had.\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d said Dr. Alexander Marson, a gene editing expert at the University of California in San Francisco.While those possibilities might seem far in the future, a different concern is urgent and immediate: safety. The methods used for gene editing can inadvertently alter other genes in unpredictable ways. Dr. He said that did not happen in this case, but it is a worry that looms over the field.Dr. He made his announcement on the eve of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong, saying that he had recruited several couples in which the man had H.I.V. and then used in vitro fertilization to create human embryos that were resistant to the virus that causes AIDS. He said he did it by directing Crispr-Cas9 to deliberately disable a gene, known as CCR\u2085, that is used to make a protein H.I.V. needs to enter cells.Dr. He said the experiment worked for a couple whose twin girls were born in November.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Now that New York Democrats have regained control of the State Senate, while retaining control of the Assembly, they might want to take a look at how the election went down in New York City. You might be thinking that, in the year 2018, New York\u2019s voting should be proof against a little drizzle. No matter the precise reasons for this specific foul-up, the dysfunction in what residents like to think of as the most sophisticated city in the world was an example of the broader dysfunction of the state\u2019s electoral system. It is run by a calcified, partisan bureaucracy that is among the worst election agencies in the country. A Democratic Legislature could impose measures to make voting easier \u2014 reducing idiotically long lines on Election Day \u2014 and modernize the election system. New York could have early voting, as do more than three dozen other states. And allowing residents to get absentee ballots without having to provide a reason would give voters more options and also ease Election Day lines. While Tuesday\u2019s voting might have made it seem that New York has no problem getting its residents out to vote, turnout in most elections in the city and the state is dismal. It would improve if the Legislature approved automatic voter registration, which puts people on the voting rolls when they interact with a state agency, like the Department of Motor Vehicles. Same-day registration would allow New Yorkers to register and vote on the same day.After passing these urgent reforms, the Legislature should turn to the rest of its agenda.At the top of the list is moving to fix the subway, protect women\u2019s reproductive rights and pass other important legislation stymied by Republicans and others for too long.Millions of New York voters braved long waits and cold rain on Tuesday to make Albany work for them.

{"Headline": "\u2018I Like Your Photographs Because They Are Beautiful\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "OpinionOrhan Pamuk remembers his friend Ara Guler, the great photographer, who lovingly captured Istanbul and its people.Supported byMr. Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006.Ara Guler, who died on Oct. 17, was the greatest photographer of modern Istanbul. He was born in 1928 in an Armenian family in Istanbul. Ara began taking photographs of the city in 1950, images that captured the lives of individuals alongside the city\u2019s monumental Ottoman architecture, its majestic mosques and magnificent fountains. I was born two years later, in 1952, and lived in the same neighborhoods he lived in. Ara Guler\u2019s Istanbul is my Istanbul. Ara devotedly photographed Istanbul for over half a century, continuing into the 2000s. I eagerly studied his photographs, to see in them the development and transformation of the city itself. My friendship with Ara began in 2003, when I was consulting his archive of 900,000 photographs to research my book \u201cIstanbul.\u201d He had turned the large three-story home he inherited from his father, a pharmacist from the Galatasaray neighborhood in the Beyoglu district of the city, into a workshop, office and archive.The photographs I wanted for my book were not those famous Ara Guler shots everyone knew but images more attuned to the melancholy Istanbul I was describing, the grayscale atmosphere of my childhood. Ara had many more of such photographs than I expected. He detested images of a sterile, sanitized, touristic Istanbul. Having discovered where my interests lay, he gave me access to his archives undisturbed.It was through Ara\u2019s urban reportage photography, which appeared in newspapers in the early 1950s, his portraits of the poor, the unemployed and the new arrivals from the countryside, that I first saw the \u201cunknown\u201d Istanbul.Ara\u2019s attentiveness to the inhabitants of Istanbul\u2019s back streets \u2014 the fishermen sitting in coffee shops and mending their nets, the unemployed men getting inebriated in taverns, the children patching up car tires in the shadow of the city\u2019s crumbling ancient walls, the construction crews, the railway workers, the boatmen pulling at their oars to ferry city folk from one shore of the Golden Horn to the other, the fruit sellers pushing their handcarts, the people milling about at dawn waiting for the Galata Bridge to open, the early-morning minibus drivers \u2014 is evidence of how he always expressed his attachment to the city through the people who live in it.It is as if Ara\u2019s photographs were telling us, \u201cYes, there is no end to beautiful cityscapes in Istanbul, but first, the individuals!\u201d The crucial, defining characteristic of an Ara Guler photograph is the emotional correlation he draws between cityscapes and individuals. \u200eHis photographs also made me discover how much more fragile and poor the people of Istanbul appeared when captured alongside the city\u2019s monumental Ottoman architecture, its majestic mosques and magnificent fountains.\u201cYou only like my photographs because they remind you of the Istanbul of your childhood,\u201d he would at times say to me, sounding oddly irritated. \u200e\u201cNo!\u201d I would protest. \u201cI like your photographs because they are beautiful.\u201dBut are beauty and memory separate things? Are things not beautiful because they are slightly familiar and resemble our memories? I enjoyed discussing such questions with him.While working in his archive of Istanbul photographs, I often wondered what it was about them that so profoundly appealed to me. Would the same images appeal to others? There is something dizzying about looking at the images of the neglected and yet still lively details of the city I have spent my life in \u2014 the cars and the hawkers on its streets, the traffic policemen, the workers, the women in head scarves crossing bridges enveloped in fog, the old bus stops, the shadows of its trees, the graffiti on its walls.For those who, like me, have spent 65 years in the same city \u2014 sometimes without leaving it for years \u2014 the landscapes of the city eventually turn into a kind of index for our emotional life. A street might remind us of the sting of getting fired from a job; the sight of a particular bridge might bring back the loneliness of our youth. A city square might recall the bliss of a love affair; a dark alleyway might be a reminder of our political fears; an old coffeehouse might evoke the memory of our friends who have been jailed. And a sycamore tree might remind how we used to be poor.In the early days of our friendship, we never spoke about Ara\u2019s Armenian heritage and the suppressed, painful history of the destruction of the Ottoman Armenians \u2014 a subject that remains a veritable taboo in Turkey. I sensed that it would be difficult to speak about this harrowing subject with him, that it would put a strain on our relationship. He knew that speaking about it would make it harder for him to survive in Turkey.Over the years, he trusted me a little and occasionally brought up political subjects he wouldn\u2019t raise with others. One day he told me that in 1942, to avoid the exorbitant \u201cWealth Tax\u201d the Turkish government was imposing specifically on its non-Muslim citizens, and to evade deportation to a forced labor camp on failing to pay the tax, his pharmacist father had left his home in Galatasaray and hidden for months in a different house, never once venturing outside. He spoke to me about the night of Sept. 6, 1955, when in a moment of political tension between Turkey and Greece caused by events in Cyprus, gangs mobilized by the Turkish government roamed the city looting shops owned by Greeks, Armenians and Jews, desecrated churches and synagogues, and turned Istiklal Street, the central avenue that runs through Beyoglu, past Ara\u2019s home, into a war zone.Armenian and Greek families ran most of the stores on Istiklal Avenue. In the 1950s I would visit their shops with my mother. They spoke Turkish with an accent. When my mother and I would return home, I used to imitate their accented Turkish. After the ethnic cleansing of 1955, the purpose of which was to intimidate and exile the city\u2019s non-Muslim minorities, most of them left Istiklal Avenue and their homes in Istanbul. By the mid-1960s, barely anyone was left. In 2005, I gave an interview where I complained that there was no freedom of thought in Turkey and we still couldn\u2019t talk about the terrible things that were done to the Ottoman Armenians 90 years ago. The nationalist press exaggerated my comments. I was taken to court in Istanbul for insulting Turkishness, a charge that can lead to a three-year prison sentence.Two years later, my friend the Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was shot and killed in Istanbul, in the middle of the street, for using the words \u201cArmenian genocide.\u201d Certain newspapers began to hint that I might be next. Because of the death threats I was receiving, the charges that had been brought against me and the vicious campaign in the nationalist press, I started spending more time abroad, in New York. I would return to my office in Istanbul for brief stays, without telling anyone I was back.On one of those brief visits home from New York, during some of the darkest days after Hrant Dink\u2019s assassination, I walked into my office and the phone immediately started ringing. In those days I never picked up my office phone. The ringing would pause occasionally, but then it would start again, on and on. Uneasy, I eventually picked up. Straight away, I recognized Ara\u2019s voice. \u201cOh, you\u2019re back! I am coming over now,\u201d he said, and hung up without waiting for my response.[Discover the most compelling features and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]Fifteen minutes later, Ara walked into my office. He was out of breath and cursing everything and everyone, in his characteristic manner. Then he embraced me with his huge frame and started to cry. Those who knew Ara, knew how fond he was of swearing and forceful masculine expressions, will understand my amazement at seeing him cry like that. He kept on swearing and telling me, \u201cThey can\u2019t touch you, those people!\u201dHis tears weren\u2019t slowing down. The more he cried, the more I was gripped by a strange sense of guilt and felt paralyzed. After crying for a very long time, Ara finally calmed down, and then, as if this had been the whole purpose of his visit to my office, he drank a glass of water and left.Sometime after that we met again. I resumed my quiet work in his archives as if nothing had happened. I no longer felt the urge to ask him about his grandfathers and grandmothers. The great photographer had already told me everything through his tears.Ara had hoped for a democracy where individuals could speak freely of their murdered ancestors, or at least freely weep for them. Turkey never became that democracy. The success of the past 15 years, a period of economic growth built on borrowed money, has been used not to broaden the reach of democracy but to restrict freedom of thought even further. And after all this growth and all this construction, Ara Guler\u2019s old Istanbul has become \u2014 to use the title of one of his books \u2014 a \u201cLost Istanbul.\u201dOrhan Pamuk, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006, is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cThe Red-Haired Woman.\u201d This essay was translated by Ekin Oklap from the Turkish.

{"Headline": "Essay: The Experiments Are Fascinating. But Nobody Can Repeat Them.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScience Times at 40Science is mired in a \u201creplication\u201d crisis. Fixing it will not be easy. At this point, it is hardly a surprise to learn that even top scientific journals publish a lot of low-quality work \u2014 not just solid experiments that happen, by bad luck, to have yielded conclusions that don\u2019t stand up to replication, but poorly designed studies that had no real chance of succeeding before they were ever conducted.Studies that were dead on arrival. We\u2019ve seen lots of examples.In 1996, a psychology study claimed that unobtrusive priming \u2014 the insertion of certain innocuous words in a quiz \u2014 could produce consistent behavioral change.That paper got cited by other scientists a few thousand times \u2014 before failed replications many years later made it clear that this finding, and much of the subsequent literature, was little more than researchers chasing patterns in noise.As a political scientist, my personal favorite was the survey finding in 2012 that women were 20 points more likely to support Barack Obama for president during certain days of their monthly cycle.In retrospect, this claim made no sense and was not supported by data. Even prospectively, the experiment had no chance of working: the way the study was conducted, the noise in estimating any effect \u2014 in this case, any average difference in political attitudes during different parts of the cycle \u2014 was much larger than any realistically possible signal (real result).We see it all the time. Remember the claims that subliminal smiley faces on a computer screen can cause big changes in attitudes toward immigration? That elections are decided by college football games and shark attacks? These studies were published in serious journals or promoted in serious news outlets.Scientists know this is a problem. In a recent paper in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, a team of respected economists and psychologists released the results of 21 replications of high-profile experiments.Replication is important to scientists, because it means the finding might just be real. In this study, many findings failed to replicate. On average, results were only about half the size of the originally published claims.Here\u2019s where it gets really weird. The lack of replication was predicted ahead of time by a panel of experts using a \u201cprediction market,\u201d in which experts were allowed to bet on which experiments were more or less likely to \u2014 well, be real.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussSimilar prediction markets have been used for many years for elections, mimicking the movement of the betting line in sports. Basically, the results in this instance indicated that informed scientists were clear from the get-go that what they were reading would not hold up.So yes, that\u2019s a problem. There has been resistance to fixing it, some of which has come from prominent researchers at leading universities. But many, if not most, scientists are aware of the seriousness of the replication crisis and fear its corrosive effects on public trust in science.The challenge is what to do next. One potential solution is preregistration, in which researchers beginning a study publish their analysis plan before collecting their data.Preregistration can be seen as a sort of time-reversed replication, a firewall against \u201cdata dredging,\u201d the inclination to go looking for results when your first idea doesn\u2019t pan out.But it won\u2019t fix the problem on its own.The replication crisis in science is often presented as an issue of scientific procedure or integrity. But all the careful procedure and all the honesty in the world won\u2019t help if your signal (the pattern you\u2019re looking for) is small, and the variation (all the confounders, the other things that might explain this pattern) is high.From this perspective, the crisis in science is more fundamental, and it involves moving beyond the existing model of routine discovery.Say you wish to study the effect of a drug or an educational innovation on a small number of people. Unless the treatment is very clearly targeted to an outcome of interest (for example, a math curriculum focused on a particular standardized test), then your study is likely to be too noisy \u2014 there will too many variables \u2014 to pinpoint real effects.If something at random does turn up and achieve statistical significance, it is likely to be a massive overestimate of any true effect. In an attempt at replication, we\u2019re likely to see something much closer to zero.The failed replications have been no surprise to many scientists, including myself, who have lots of experience of false starts and blind alleys in our own research.The big problem in science is not cheaters or opportunists, but sincere researchers who have unfortunately been trained to think that every statistically \u201csignificant\u201d result is notable. When you read about research in the news media (and, as a taxpayer, you are indirectly a funder of research, too), you should ask what exactly is being measured, and why._____Advertisement"}

Andrew Gillum, the candidate for governor in Florida, had caught lightning, too.A moderate or a progressive? An old-timer or a newcomer? A woman or a man? That part of the drill is familiar, but it will have an unfamiliar urgency, because Trump ratchets up everything, especially the stakes.

They\u2019re peculiar to his intentionally abrasive personality, his deliberately provocative tactics and his almost mystical domination of the media.But plenty of other prominent Democrats told me that the smartest strategy is to float above the muck, because campaigns are about contrasts and many Americans are desperate for something cleaner and calmer.I happened to reconnect with O\u2019Rourke recently in Fort Worth, Tex., and I asked him about the optimal tone for a Democrat at this juncture and about Avenatti\u2019s and Holder\u2019s repudiations of Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cthey go low, we go high\u201d credo.\u201cAvenatti does not represent us,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told me, meaning most Democrats. \u201cEric Holder \u2014 what he said \u2014 that\u2019s not where we\u2019re at.\u201d He added that among American voters, \u201cthere is a real concern about civility \u2014 not for the sake of manners but for the sake of the country working.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about confronting him where he\u2019s weakest,\u201d said Bob Kerrey, the former senator and former Nebraska governor. \u201cYou have to say to the audience: This country is dangerously divided and it\u2019s on the edge of something awful.\u201d Kerrey said that in a perfect world, a Democratic candidate would go even further than that in the primary and tell voters: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get angry at me, because I\u2019m going to embrace a Republican idea if it feels good. Don\u2019t expect me to be 100 percent \u2014 100 percent may make you happy, but it won\u2019t pull this country together.\u201d Standing out will require one nonnegotiable quality: the vividness to loosen Trump\u2019s stranglehold on the media. To that end, any serious challenger has to figure out how to tell his or her story in a riveting way.So there\u2019s pressure on a Democratic challenger not just to communicate memorably but to say memorable things \u2014 i.e., new ones.\u201cThat would be fatal,\u201d said Beth Myers, a prominent Republican consultant and longtime senior adviser to Mitt Romney. She wasn\u2019t speaking as someone who wanted a strategy to dislodge Trump; she was just sizing up the situation.Lewandowski and I didn\u2019t get into that, but we got into plenty else. He said that politicians with fewer years in office and shorter records often have an advantage over those with more years and longer ones: There\u2019s less to defend and explain. Obama, he noted, wasn\u2019t even midway through his first term in the Senate when he announced his presidential bid.Be direct, blunt and consistent. \u201cHe has the same message today that he did the day he came down the elevator at Trump Tower,\u201d Myers observed. \u201cThe message discipline is incredible.

And on top: a golden orb of a fish cutlet, and a wrinkled, paunchy oval that proves to be a deep-fried hard-boiled egg, crunchy coat giving way to creamy yolk.Elsewhere on the table might be hoppers, crepes of fermented rice flour curved like bowls, thick and spongy at the bottom with sides that get thinner and lacier as they reach up. And kurakkan pittu, small pillars of grated coconut and ragi (finger millet), to be knocked over and mixed with coconut milk and lunu miris, raw onion and chile smashed in a mortar until the heat blooms, sweet and rank at once, brightened with the faintest trace of lime.Here too is kottu, tangled scraps of roti tossed in a wok with vegetables and curry, calling to mind fried rice. One version gets a trickledown of melted mozzarella, Cheddar and blue cheese for a happy hint of funk.Staten Island is home to more Sri Lankan immigrants than any other borough, with a population estimated at 5,000, more than five times what it was two decades ago when Mr. Hewabajgamage first came to New York. In his early years he took many jobs, driving a taxi and commuting as far as Philadelphia for work.In 2007, he and his wife opened a restaurant called Vidutara, half a mile from where Sagara now stands, with Ms. Hewabajgamage running the kitchen. Then their third child was born and the economy went south, and they had to shutter within the year. Now they\u2019re trying again, this time with the help of a veteran chef, Lalith Gunasekera.But the spirit is kind. On a recent evening, with the next ferry departure looming and Uber far in the distance, my group of offshore diners inquired hesitantly as to a local car service. Mr. Hewabajgamage sprang into action, ushering us into his S.U.V. and cheerfully reminiscing about his years as a taxi driver (\u201cI was mugged!\u201d).There was no charge.

Recently I visited Sweden to talk with conscripts in mechanized infantry, artillery and army ranger units. I learned that the performance of women in those units was not at issue. What was, at times, was the ability of their male peers to accept them.Yet if women seemed to have assimilated into the military lifestyle in Sweden, their stories demonstrate that not all men had fully accepted them.The question, then, is not whether women can be effective combat troops but whether a hypermasculine military culture can adjust. The potential benefits of having women in combat units argue for making that happen.Women volunteer for the infantry for the same reason men do: to protect their country and their comrades. When a revered leader like Mr. Mattis hedges on whether women should be in the combat arms, he does all of the troops a disservice.Teresa Fazio, a former Marine, is a freelance writer.

{"Headline": "Will Mitch Run?", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLandrieu speaks with certainty on many issues, but a 2020 candidacy may not yet be one of them. Opinion ColumnistNEW ORLEANS \u2014 \u201cI am not already running for president.\u201d He continues, \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything that a person who was running for president would do.\u201dThat\u2019s what the former New Orleans mayor and current whispered-about presidential possibility Mitch Landrieu told me Friday afternoon as we sat at a window table in a hotel restaurant in the city\u2019s French Quarter.I have known Mitch for a while. I, like most people, call him Mitch. We are both born and raised sons of Louisiana. When he swept into the hotel lobby, greeting and razzing the staff, all of whom seemed to light up at the sight of him, he seemed relaxed, the way a person is when in transition, not beholden to the previous labor nor fully engaged in the next.The 58-year-old Landrieu has spent 30 years in politics, but he really began to be talked about as a possible presidential contender when he moved to take down Confederate statues in the city and gave a powerful, poetic speech explaining why.Mitch is now asked about running for president so often that his answers sound like ones that have been honed by repetition, shaved down sharp and smooth.He recalls a recent exchange he had about the subject:\u201cSomeone said to me the other day, \u2018Are you running?\u2019 I said, \u2018No.\u2019 They said, \u2018That\u2019s what everybody says.\u2019 I said, \u2018What do the people who aren\u2019t running say?\u2019 \u201d We laugh.But it seems to me that much of Landrieu\u2019s trepidation, whether he articulates it as such or not, is that on the one hand he\u2019s not exactly aligned with this moment, but rather speaks to a previous era that prized pragmatics and didn\u2019t condemn compromise. And on the other, he envisions a future in which America\u2019s intractable racial problems can actually be resolved.As he told me:\u201cCentrism has come to be known as a lukewarm version of not standing for anything so you\u2019ll stand for everything. I call myself, like, a radical centrist. Every organization I\u2019ve taken over has been in, like, meltdown, and I had to build it back up. So, it requires really hard, tough decisions. But, those things always require some level of compromise.\u201dBut the problem facing Landrieu is that being any kind of centrist Democrat when the party\u2019s progressives are ascendant would be perilous.The other issue is, ironically, Landrieu\u2019s noble quest to be a racial healer.He continues, \u201cWe\u2019re in the planning period to see if there is a need to or a desire to actually build an institute for racial reconciliation in the South somewhere.\u201dBut he recognizes the conundrum the all-important black Democratic primary voters in the South would be in when faced with a white man from the region and black candidates from beyond it.As he put it:\u201cYou don\u2019t know how African-Americans in the South are going to perform if a white Democrat from the South is running against three really good African-American candidates. We\u2019ve never had that before. You could have it this time. You could have Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Deval Patrick. So, that theory has never been tested before.\u201dIt would be a hard debate stage to manage without looking like a white savior, coming to fix America\u2019s race problem and saying that he was a better choice to do so than the women and minorities in the race.But, that is not Landrieu. One thing that I\u2019ve always admired about him is that he\u2019s not race blind, but race conscious. He talks straight about race, its complexities and its absolutes.During our talk, he says flatly: \u201cDonald Trump is a racist. Now, I\u2019ve really refrained from making that accusation because the headline is, \u2018Mitch Calls Donald a Racist, Donald Calls Mitch Ballheaded.\u2019\u201dAnd, he's doing precisely what many of us have insisted white America do: He is a white man fighting to dismantle white supremacy, so that the burden isn't only on the shoulders of the oppressed.Later he adds:\u201cYou can never countenance white supremacy. You can\u2019t accept it. You don\u2019t need to think about it. The judgment, the historical judgment on this, in my opinion, is closed. Now, people have a First Amendment right to say whatever they want, wherever they want, but the body politic, the people of the United States of America, cannot give any room for fertilization or growth of white supremacy. That will lead us to a place that will lead to a world war.\u201dThat\u2019s how Mitch talks. That\u2019s how Mitch thinks. That\u2019s who Mitch is.I doubt he will run this cycle, even though he says it\u2019s \u201cego gratifying\u201d to be considered and even though he couldn\u2019t help dropping remarks like: \u201cIf I had my choice and I was flipping a coin, I would pick mayors before I would pick senators or congressmen.\u201dMitch is still trying to figure out if this is his moment, but even if it isn't, I'm sure he'll one day have a moment.An earlier version of this column misspelled the first name of a potential candidate for president. He is Deval Patrick, not Duval.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, the Monster Who Feeds on Fear ", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion Writer It took Donald Trump to make me associate Franklin Roosevelt with Pennywise the Dancing Clown.The primary obstacle to this restoration was not economics but fear: \u201cnameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\u201d A key strategy for conquering that fear, he went on, is speaking with candor: \u201cThis is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly.\u201dIf, 85 years later, you wanted to imagine the presidency of Mr. Trump in a nutshell, simply take all of the generousness and wisdom in Roosevelt\u2019s first inaugural address and do the opposite.The only thing Mr. Trump has is fear itself.He wants us to be afraid, for it is fear that divides us, that sets us one against the other. If there is anything frank and bold about this presidency, it is Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to invent falsehoods out of fairy dust and marzipan, solely to make us afraid \u2014 of immigrants, of transgender people, of one another. It doesn\u2019t matter to him that most of the things he urges us to be afraid of pose no danger. What matters is that his paranoid inventions suck up our attention and make us focus, week after week, upon him. Those of us in the media devote endless hours to refuting the latest barrage of hooey emanating from the White House. But even in this, we\u2019re still amplifying his noise and nurturing, even in the process of refutation, the fear on which the man thrives.So we can\u2019t ignore him, and we can\u2019t report on him without engaging in his game. In so many ways we\u2019re trapped \u2014 which is, one suspects, exactly what this president wants.If this were a horror movie, our heroes would understand that the only way to defeat the monster is by refusing to be afraid of it, to shrink it through indifference.This being reality, though, that path is really not available to us \u2014 either as journalists or as citizens. Try as we might, we cannot ignore the president of the United States.But we still have options.These actions will give this president ample reason to feel some of the fear he has inflicted on others.The other strategy is the one thing that Mr. Trump appears to fear most, for it is the one thing that all his riches and power have apparently never brought him. And that thing is a sense of humor.In J.K. Rowling\u2019s \u201cHarry Potter\u201d stories, one of the most terrible creatures our young heroes can face is the boggart \u2014 a creature that feeds on fear. A boggart takes the form of whatever it is you fear the most. Harry sees a wraithlike creature called a Dementor; Ron Weasley sees a giant spider; Neville Longbottom sees the cruel and mysterious Professor Snape.Want to conquer fear? Tell better jokes \u2014 and not the easy kind, salted with cruelty and malice, but the more complex, generous and fundamentally American variety, as pioneered by Mark Twain, or Richard Pryor, or Lily Tomlin.Let the rule of law, the power of truth and the subversion of humor vanquish this boggart for good. In so doing we shall assert our firm belief: The only thing we have to fear is Trump himself.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the writer of a New Yorker article on White House press briefings.

{"Headline": "Steve King, for a Change, Faces a Battle for House Seat in Iowa", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut suddenly, the overlap of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting by a virulent anti-Semite and Mr. King\u2019s latest inflammatory remarks, to a publication associated with neo-Nazis, have converged to add some drama to a re-election bid that once looked assured.\u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior,\u201d Mr. Stivers wrote.In Des Moines on Thursday, Mr. King responded angrily when accused of sharing the same ideology as the Pittsburgh shooter, and he demanded that the man who made the suggestion be ejected from a candidate forum.In an acknowledgment of the heat Mr. King is feeling, his campaign released its first TV advertisement Friday. (It turned out to be an expression of heartland pride and optimism recycled from his 2014 campaign.)A public poll on Monday showed Mr. King leading his opponent, J.D. Scholten, by a single point. After news of the survey popped up on social media, money poured in to Mr. Scholten from around the country: $641,000 in 48 hours, his campaign said, enough to launch a 90-second TV ad of his own, featuring farmers, mothers and others who the campaign says are former King supporters.Three large agriculture businesses \u2014 Land O\u2019Lakes, Purina and Smithfield \u2014 announced they would no longer support Mr. King because his conduct did not represent their values. AT&T announced Friday that the employees who manage disbursements from its political action committee have determined that it will not make future contributions to him.Douglas Burns, an owner of The Carroll Daily Times Herald and other newspapers in Mr. King\u2019s deeply conservative district, which President Trump won by 27 points, said the Republican base was still with Mr. King, who remains the favorite to win. But Mr. Scholten was his first Democratic challenger not easily caricatured as a carpetbagger or a liberal. Mr. Scholten, 38, is a fifth-generation Iowan and former professional baseball player who is running largely on his biography, not ideology.\u201cI think Scholten\u2019s strength is that he is an acceptable place for potentially a lot of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents to park a discontented vote,\u201d Mr. Burns said.He added that Mr. King has been running \u201cthe laziest campaign\u201d he has seen. \u201cKing is a natural political animal. He\u2019d maul Scholten in a debate, but he is just ignoring him. I don\u2019t understand why.\u201dIn contrast to the often elusive Mr. King, Mr. Scholten has crisscrossed the 39-county district in an RV named the Sioux City Sue, for the Gene Autry song, sleeping overnight in Walmart parking lots, while accusing the incumbent of ignoring constituents to pick fights on behalf of white nationalists.\u201cPeople have been frustrated with King for years but they haven\u2019t had somebody else they could trust,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Scholten, calling from his RV on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we made such an effort of getting out there to the people.\u201d He is stopping in downtowns to encounter voters of both parties rather than just holding town halls that attract supporters.The issues he talks about are mainly the high cost of health care and making a farm economy work for young people who keep moving away.\u201cEvery time I fill up this RV with gas there\u2019s usually a donation box for someone who just got sick or in an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in the wealthiest country in the world and people have to beg to pay for their medical expenses.\u2019\u2019In the past, Iowans in the Fourth District rolled their eyes, or simply ignored Mr. King\u2019s controversial statements about undocumented immigrants or Muslims that attract national outrage. He was a Republican whose views on abortion, taxes and gun rights were in step with the voters in northwest Iowa, the state\u2019s most conservative region. Two years ago, he was re-elected to an eighth term by 22 percentage points.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Iowa\u2019s senior Republican, declined to discuss Mr. King on Friday at a campaign stop for a different House Republican, Representative David Young. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give you any words that would detract from the importance of re-electing Young,\u201d he said.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Nancy Trapolino, a 34-year-old mother of two from Arcadia, Iowa, who works in a family business that manufactures farm machinery, said she was likely to vote for Mr. King to keep the House in Republican hands. She approves of the tax cut passed last year and other Republican priorities.\u201cI haven\u2019t found anybody running against Steve King that\u2019s given me much hope,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think having a Republican Congress is going to be important for achieving some of the goals that they have.\u201dAsked about his remarks supporting white nationalists, she said: \u201cI can\u2019t support the racist remarks Steve King makes. It makes me upset.\u201dMr. King\u2019s most fervent supporters have in the past accepted his denials that he is a racist and agreed with him that news media distorts his remarks.But his latest comments and actions come at a time when the country\u2019s nerves are newly sensitive to hate speech, after the Pittsburgh massacre and Mr. Trump\u2019s escalation of heated rhetoric about the caravan of Central Americans headed toward the United States, and his misleading online ad about an undocumented immigrant bragging about killing police officers.He also argued that diversity does not strengthen American society. \u201cWhat does this diversity bring that we don\u2019t already have?\u201d he said. \u201cMexican food, Chinese food, those things, well, that\u2019s fine, but what does it bring that we don\u2019t have that is worth the price?\u201dThe remarks came after a five-day visit he made to Holocaust sites funded by a nonprofit group that educates lawmakers about Nazi genocide.In his Des Moines appearance on Thursday, Mr. King vehemently rejected a connection between his words and actions and the anti-Semitic ideology of the Pittsburgh gunman.Saying he has \u201cstood with Israel all along,\u201d he asked organizers to remove the man who suggested a connection to the gunman, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not listening to another word from you.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cYou\u2019re done; we don\u2019t play these games here in Iowa,\u201d he said.On Friday, Mr. Scholten said his internal polls showed him further behind Mr. King than the survey showing a one-point race, but he is happy the attention will drive up his name recognition, which has been a challenge of his campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re just saying there is a need in the Fourth District for a new moral leadership, one that rejects white supremacy and racism,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Struggle to Stay Human Amid the Fight", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "OpinionWorld War I and the adversarial mentality.Supported byOpinion ColumnistI watched Stanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d last weekend, prompted by all the World War I centenary tributes. Set in the trenches near the end of the war, it\u2019s a movie about a man who tries to maintain his integrity and his faith in humanity amid the stupidity, futility, cruelty and cynicism of war. It\u2019s weirdly relevant today.Kirk Douglas plays a French colonel named Dax who lives in the trenches and leads his men in battle. Far away in the palaces, pampered French generals order his exhausted men to take a nearly impregnable German position. One general hopes the assault will help him score political points. Another is promised a promotion. Something like 4,000 men are expected to die or be wounded for these objectives.When the assault catastrophically fails, the generals look for scapegoats and decide to execute three enlisted men, more or less chosen at random, for alleged cowardice. Colonel Dax is finally overcome with disgust and explodes at one of the generals: \u201cYou\u2019re a degenerate, sadistic old man. You can go to hell!\u201dThe general \u2014 cynical, crafty, bureaucratic, incapable of emotion \u2014 replies: \u201cYou\u2019ve spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality. \u2026 You are an idealist, and I pity you as I would the village idiot. We are fighting a war, Dax, a war that we\u2019ve got to win.\u201dIt\u2019s the eternal argument. When you are fighting a repulsive foe, the ends justify any means and serve as rationale for any selfishness.Dax\u2019s struggle is not to change the war or to save lives. That\u2019s impossible. The war has won. The struggle is simply to remain a human being, to maintain some contact with goodness in circumstances that are inhumane.Disillusionment was the classic challenge for the generation that fought and watched that war. Before 1914, there was an assumed faith in progress, a general trust in the institutions and certainties of Western civilization. People, especially in the educated classes, approached life with a gentlemanly, sporting spirit.The war blew away that gentility, those ideals and that faith in progress. Ernest Hemingway captured the rising irony and cynicism in \u201cA Farewell to Arms.\u201d His hero is embarrassed \u201cby the words sacred, glorious and sacrifice and the expression, in vain.\u201d He had seen nothing sacred in the war, nothing glorious, just meaningless slaughter.European culture suffered a massive disillusion during the conflict \u2014 no God, no beauty, no coherence, no meaning, just the cruel ironic joke of life. Cynicism breeds a kind of nihilism, a disbelief in all values, an assumption that others\u2019 motives are bad. It makes it hard to see the good that remains.Fussell wrote that the war spread an adversarial mentality. The men in the trenches were obsessed with the enemy \u2014 those anonymous creatures across no man\u2019s land who rained down death. \u201cProlonged trench warfare, whether enacted or remembered, fosters paranoid melodrama,\u201d he wrote. The \u201cversus habit\u201d construes reality as us versus them \u2014 a mentality that spread through British society. It was the officers versus the men, and, when they got home, the students at university versus the dons. \u201cSimple antithesis everywhere\u201d is how Fussell captured the mentality. Along with it was what T.S. Eliot called a \u201cdissociation of sensibility,\u201d in which thoughts of tenderness and care are cut off from reason and calculation.George Orwell wrote that he recognized the Great War mentality lingering even in the 1930s in his own left-wing circles \u2014 the same desire to sniff out those who departed from party orthodoxy, the same retelling of mostly false atrocity stories, the same war hysteria. As Christopher Isherwood put it, all the young people who were ashamed of never having fought in the war brought warlike simplicities to political life. Some of the disillusioned drop out of public life, since it\u2019s all meaningless. But others want to burn it all down because it\u2019s all rotten. Moderation is taken for cowardice. Aggression is regarded as courage. No conciliatory word is permitted when a fighting word will do. Today we face no horrors equal to the Great War, but there is the same loss of faith in progress, the reality of endless political trench warfare, the paranoid melodrama, the specter that we are all being dehumanized amid the fight.At the end of the movie Dax returns to his barracks. His men have captured a pretty, innocent young German woman. She\u2019s crying and terrified. They put her on stage, leer at her body and practically rape her with their eyes and catcalls. Then they make her sing. She sings a sweet little folk song called \u201cThe Faithful Hussar.\u201d The men begin to quiet, then hum along, and then \u2014 thinking of home, of sweetness and humanity itself \u2014 they fall to weeping over what they\u2019ve lost. A little visitation of tenderness amid the fight.Advertisement"}

My mother used to shake her head and say, \u201cJust let them come to you,\u201d but I was no good at biding my time. In sixth grade, I asked a boy I liked if he liked me; in freshman year of college, I asked a man I was attracted to if he felt the same. In each case, I felt that something was wrong with me for having brought up the topic. I was too much like a guy, I thought. But even then, I was asking them about their desires, not speaking my own.As I got older, I developed other methods for getting a man to make the first move: bumping into him as we walked together, shivering with unfelt cold, standing fetchingly on steps that would bring me to his eye level \u2014 all so he\u2019d be overtaken with desire and, for God\u2019s sake, kiss me. So much work, this active passivity \u2014 but I never considered kissing any of them first. After all, what worse insult can a man give a woman than \u201cShe wanted it,\u201d a phrase that carries its own sneer.So the reason that afternoon is still so bright in my memory, why I can still feel the metal chain of the swing in my hand, see Matthew\u2019s smile: Sadie Hawkins was a day of respite from pretending not to want, or from distorting my want into a hint.How great, I thought, that someone came up with this idea!But when I look up its history now, I find that Sadie Hawkins is not, as I had always assumed, a remnant of Puritan times, a day when the rules went topsy-turvy in the spirit of a medieval carnival. It was not a safety valve for the female energy that might otherwise knock out the spigot with its force of pent-up desire.The intention wasn\u2019t of liberation, then \u2014 it was a joke at the expense of unmarried women, and a naked invocation of patriarchal power. This is disheartening.I\u2019d like to think that women are becoming more comfortable voicing their own desires, that there\u2019s no need for permission anymore. But change seems slow in coming. Stories of heterosexual marriage proposals usually still feature the man asking and the woman thrilled to be asked.How about the youngest generation, who have the benefit of the new fluidity of gender \u2014 have they transcended this dynamic? Maybe not as much as we would hope. Consider the hoopla around \u201cpromposals\u201d: Girls may send out emissaries to test the waters, but the request still usually comes from the boy \u2014 sometimes with as many bells and whistles as a marriage proposal. And with the same enactment of amazed gratitude on the girl\u2019s part. They cling to their own disempowerment and call it romance. Is romance worth such passivity?As the MeToo movement threatens to uproot the patriarchal assumption of women as objects, we need to recognize that women\u2019s self-denial is connected to the mentality that allows men to believe that our desire is their prerogative. Our conditioned passivity leaves a vacuum that male narcissism fills with its version of us.Until it is no big deal for a woman to say, \u201cI want,\u201d as well as \u201cI don\u2019t want\u201d \u2014 until heterosexual women no longer feel the need to wait for the man to propose or to invite us to the prom or to kiss us on a beautiful summer evening when we want to kiss \u2014 we leave ourselves at the mercy of men\u2019s desires.Sadie Hawkins should be any and every day we choose.Kate Neuman is an actor and writer and serves on the faculty of the Barrow Group Theater Company and the creative writing program at Hunter College.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook to Drop Forced Arbitration in Harassment Cases", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Friday that it would no longer force employees to settle sexual harassment claims in private arbitration, making it the latest technology company to do away with a practice that critics say has stacked the deck against victims of harassment.Facebook acted one day after Google announced similar plans. Last week, 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout from the company\u2019s offices around the world to demand that it change the way it handled sexual harassment incidents. Microsoft changed its arbitration policy about a year ago, as did the ride-hailing company Uber six months ago.The technology industry, known for its groundbreaking products as well as its trendsetting office culture, has gone to considerable lengths in recent years to keep work-force disputes out of the court system. Forcing employee complaints into arbitration has become as common as free lunches and shuttle buses to the office.In arbitration, employment experts say, the playing field shifts toward businesses. Cases are decided by arbitrators instead of judges, and the more cases that companies take to arbitration, the better they fare, according to a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\u201cThis is a pivotal moment for our industry and corporate America more broadly,\u201d Lori Goler, a Facebook vice president, said in a statement. \u201cWe think this is the right thing to do and hope other companies do, too.\u201dThe use of arbitration clauses, embedded in the fine print of contracts, has soared in the last decade, as corporations try to keep disputes away from public scrutiny.Chris Baker, an employment lawyer and partner at the law firm Baker Curtis & Schwartz, said arbitration cases were often heard by a retired judge who may not be as empathetic as a jury to a harassment victim. They are often shrouded in confidentiality, and arbitration awards tend to be less than those in a jury trial.Mr. Baker said the moves by the tech firms could chip away at arbitration in all kinds of employee disputes because it would be hard for companies to draw the line at sexual harassment.\u201cI think it\u2019s the pebble that starts the avalanche,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very meaningful.\u201dBecause the claims are often kept under wraps in confidential arbitration hearings, critics say harassers often move easily to other jobs without warning to future victims.It has become a significant issue in Silicon Valley, where gender imbalance is stark and tales of sexual harassment are rampant. Critics of arbitration requirements have pushed companies to do away with arbitration and confidentiality clauses that often help companies keep the public and their own employees in the dark about bad behavior.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has noted that forced arbitration \u201ccan prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.\u201dFacebook said it would now make arbitration an option, but not a requirement, for employees reporting a sexual harassment claim. Facebook said it had been planning to make the changes to its arbitration policy for \u201ca while\u201d but did not specify a time frame. There is no indication the company was facing specific pressure to alter its policies.Lyft, Uber\u2019s top competitor, made a similar policy change around the same time.In December, as Microsoft faced a proposed class-action lawsuit by female technical staff claiming discrimination, it vowed to end the arbitration requirement for harassment claims. The women lost the case and are appealing.Microsoft\u2019s policy change was largely symbolic because the company rarely used arbitration clauses in its employment agreements. However, Microsoft also said it would support federal legislation making the requirement of arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable.Apple has never arbitrated a harassment or discrimination claim, said Kristin Huguet, a company spokeswoman. It had a forced arbitration requirement for new employees until earlier this year, but it made arbitration optional and then eliminated the clause from employment contracts altogether. She did not specify when. Ms. Huguet said that even Apple employees who had agreed to such an agreement were no longer bound by it.Companies large and small have figured out how to use arbitration to prevent employees from taking disputes to court and to prevent others, including customers, from banding together in a class action. Some state judges have called the ban on class actions \u2014 one of the few ways that ordinary citizens can fight deep-pocketed corporations over unfair business and employment practices \u2014 a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for employers.In recent years, it has become tough to apply for a credit card, get cable service, rent a car or shop online without agreeing to settle any disputes in arbitration. The same is true for getting a job.The use of arbitration clauses can be traced back to a coalition of credit card companies and retailers that came up with a plan to shield themselves from expensive lawsuits. Starting around 1999, the group\u2019s legal teams began discussing how to use the fine print of contracts to stop class actions. Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, Discover, Sears, Toyota and General Electric all attended.Arbitration clauses that don\u2019t allow class-action suits are used by a wide variety of companies, including Macy\u2019s and Kmart. In 2016, when Gretchen Carlson sued Roger E. Ailes, her former boss at Fox News, over allegations of sexual harassment, his lawyers pushed for the case to move into arbitration.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.

{"Headline": "The Rockies, the Alps, the Caucasus? Georgia Plans for the Future", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySki IssueThis country has beautiful mountains, dependable snow, hearty food and welcoming people. Now they just need to decide how to build a tourism industry. I\u2019d come to Georgia to ski \u2014 attracted by images of the towering Caucasus Mountains and reports of affordable skiing without the crowds. Those who knew Georgia tended to describe it warmly: exotic and undiscovered, with great food, situated at a crossroads full of history, and changing \u2014 its young population striving to show off a post-Soviet identity to the world.Beginning at around 7,200 feet and rising to 10,000 at its peak, Gudauri\u2019s slopes are above the tree line. When we passed through there was plenty of snow on the ground and sparkling blue skies, which made for strikingly beautiful days on the slopes \u2014 nothing but marshmallowy peaks of white in every direction. For those looking to go off-piste and have a bit of solitude without traveling several hours west to more obscure mountains, Gudauri is the place to be. If one of several heli-ski operators doesn\u2019t appeal, there are other ways to explore the backcountry. At the top of the main gondola a fleet of snowmobiles waits to take skiers up to ungroomed territory \u2014 and the gravity-defying ride is arguably even more exciting than getting back down. It\u2019s also possible to ski down the back of the mountain and end up a ways down the road to the north, a short taxi ride back to the lifts. Guides are available to help navigate \u2014 recommended considering the avalanche risk.  A few weeks after our trip, a video showing an apparent lift malfunction at Gudauri went viral. In it, we see the lift reversing at high speed down the mountain, the skiers facing the opposite direction having to jump off, and the chairs being swung violently around the lift entrance before ending up in a pile. Luckily no one was killed, and it seems to have been a one-off, freak occurrence. Nevertheless it was, perhaps, a reminder that this isn\u2019t yet quite like skiing in the Alps. That\u2019s also part of Georgia\u2019s draw \u2014 only a few hours away, it is a country that manages to feel like an entirely different world.russiaMount KazbekgeorgiaStepantsmindasouth ossetiaGudauri15 miles50 milesAbkhaziarussiaBakurianiGeorgiaDetail belowTbilisiturkeyArmeniaAzer.Best WesternBakurianiGeorgiaMiminoMitarbiski liftKokhta ski resortM20Agmashenebeli st.Didveli ski resort1 mileBy The New York TimesGeorgia has few natural resources, a relatively low profile internationally and powerful neighbors that don\u2019t always play nice. It\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s eager to attract visitors and show the world what makes it special. And as visitor numbers grow and Georgia emerges as a destination, the country is pinning much hope on its mountains. It struck me that this is a country at an inflection point, with a generation trying to start from scratch in many ways, and make a clean break from the past. That\u2019s part of its appeal. It\u2019s got the basic elements covered: good food, beautiful mountains, dependable snow and welcoming people \u2014 the rest they\u2019re figuring out as they go along.We had begun our Georgia trip in Tbilisi, arriving on an Air Baltic flight from Riga at 4:45 a.m. The immigration officer, a young woman, addressed me in a way I would come to see many more times when making any kind of official or commercial transaction in Georgia: the initial interaction unsmiling, even tense, but giving way quickly to a half-smile and then full-blown friendliness. After locating the Enterprise rental car office, which was just a man in the parking lot who handled our paperwork on the hood of the car under a drizzle, we headed west on a deserted highway in the dark. Before Gudauri, our plan was to visit Bakuriani, a ski and resort town in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, which run through the southern part of the country into Armenia and AzerbaijanAn hour and a half into the drive, the sun began to rise, revealing the mountain ranges to the north and south, beautiful in the early blue glow. We turned onto a smaller road and began climbing. The towns along the road were gritty \u2014 a mixture of old wooden houses and Soviet-style apartment blocks. There were few evergreens on the way up, and no snow, the houses as brown as the mountainside. A lonely brick tower stood in a field, a faint hammer and sickle near the top almost completely faded. Eventually as we gained altitude, the look of things changed \u2014 there was more pine, and more snow. Bakuriani is a ramshackle place, but one with a certain charm \u2014 a place of camouflage-jacketed men on horseback; old Russian trucks and buses; elderly ladies selling the traditional cheese-filled bread khachapuri from hole-in-the-wall shops; and families, mostly Georgian and Russian, slipping around on the icy sidewalks. There is one main commercial strip, some very old and beautiful wooden houses on their last legs, and a number of new-build \u201cchalet\u201d style rental houses plus a few larger hotels. There are two main ski areas: Didveli and Kokhta. Didveli has a gondola and a few decent runs plus a couple of spots for some relaxed off-piste exploring. Kokhta has a lift that starts just outside of town, but traffic was gridlocked there when we passed through, and the parking lot full. Much better to continue east down the dirt road to find the newer lift from Mitarbi, which connects to the main Kokhta runs. These latter runs are favored by professional skiers for a bit of practice on the weekends, thanks to fewer crowds and a good vertical drop. \u201cThe children in these villages are really fearless,\u201d Eka told me. \u201cSo we want to train them to participate in the Olympics, in world championships, and get medals. We have the resources, we just have to attract people, and that\u2019s an effective way to do it.\u201d For those looking for some pleasant runs amid the trees, Bakuriani is not a bad place to do it. It has reliably good snow for around five months of the year, and quite a few good places to eat and drink. It was here that I first encountered chacha, the Georgian spirit made from grapes that\u2019s often referred to as \u201cGeorgian vodka.\u201d (Its quality ranges widely, from outright firewater to something pretty refined.) It was often brought to our table, on the house. And Georgian food is perfect post-ski fare: meat stews, cheesy breads, and lots of strong flavors. Some of the highlights: chicken liver chashushli packed with barberry spice and cilantro; khachapuri adjaruli, the classic cheese bread but with a couple of fried eggs and melted butter dropped into the middle; spicy beef ostri slow-cooked in tomato and garlic. Then there\u2019s the semisweet wine, which really grows on you after a bottle or two \u2014 at the grocery store a fellow customer recommended I try a bottle of Saperavi said to be a favorite of Joseph Stalin\u2019s. It didn\u2019t disappoint. Our first night in town we ate at the log cabinlike Mimino, where we ate and drank far too much, then emerged into the cold mountain evening. We asked a group of Georgians where we ought to head next, and someone mentioned the rooftop bar in the new Best Western, just up the road. There we found a group of teenagers bouncing around to hard house music, crowding the D.J. booth. A man who still had his white ski goggles on his head approached us, eager to chat but too drunk to really say much. Russian music videos looking straight out of the 1990s played on a monitor overhead. We stayed 10 minutes and called it a night.  The town around Gudauri, by contrast, is characterless \u2014 a collection of mostly bland rental apartments, hotels and a handful of restaurants and bars. During our days skiing in Gudauri, we stayed in the village of Stepantsminda and the Rooms Hotel Kazbegi \u2014 a beautifully restored old turbaza, or Soviet-era vacation camp, about a 40-minute drive from the slopes. From my room\u2019s balcony, I sat staring at the looming Mount Kazbegi and the dozens of other snowy peaks rising up on either side of the valley as the fog rolled in.  In Tbilisi on my last night in the country, I sat down with George Gotsiridze, a spatial planner and expert in all things mountains who works closely with the government creating development plans for ski areas. He told me there are many more incredible mountains with perfect snow in the west of the country that don\u2019t have the infrastructure to receive many skiers. And that lack of infrastructure leads to more and more people moving away, leaving the villages depopulated and dying. In a country that\u2019s 60 percent mountainous, skiing and other mountain sports present a huge opportunity to correct that \u2014 but it\u2019s a delicate balance. \u201cMy vision of development of winter sports in Georgia is for an approach that\u2019s very sensitive, careful \u2014 not just put the lifts and put the hotels and build the road everywhere that it\u2019s possible,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the mountain shouldn\u2019t be developed. The mountains are our treasure, our opportunity. We should raise our kids, our next generation, on skis.\u201d Advertisement"}

I came to talk about The New York Times\u2019s digital strategy, and I stayed for three days to explore Budapest and interview people here.And yet life in Budapest doesn\u2019t feel authoritarian.

Zselyke Csaky of Freedom House, the democracy watchdog, told me, \u201cThere is no violence, not any kind of political violence.\u201dDoes any of this sound familiar?Most alarming, the Republican Party has shown multiple signs of early Orb\u00e1nism. No, the party is not as bad as Fidesz, and, yes, American democracy remains much healthier than the Hungarian version. But the parallels are there for anyone willing to see them: Like Orb\u00e1n, Republican leaders have repeatedly been willing to change the rules and customs of democracy for the sake of raw power.Usually, Trump is not even the main force behind these tactics. Other Republicans are. In North Carolina, after Republicans lost the governorship in 2016, they went so far as to strip the office of some of its authority. Of course it\u2019s true that Democrats sometimes play rough too, but there is no list remotely like the one above for them.The United States won\u2019t suddenly become Hungary. We start from a much stronger place. But our democracy will suffer. And democracies can deteriorate more quickly than people often realize.Not so long ago, Hungary was a shining example of post-Soviet success. Power alternated between the center-right and center-left. Orb\u00e1n \u2014 a pro-democracy activist during the end of Soviet rule in Hungary, who co-founded Fidesz as a center-right party \u2014 originally became prime minister in 1998. After only one term, and to his shock, he lost the job.He responded with a plan to recapture power for \u201c15 to 20 years,\u201d as he said at the time. \u201cWe have only to win once, but then properly,\u201d he explained. Fidesz did win in 2010, with help from a bungling socialist government and widespread income stagnation. Orb\u00e1n went to work.His strategy has had three main pillars. One, he sought to control the media. Two, he launched a Christian-themed culture war that discredits his opponents. Three, he changed the rules of democracy. In each of these ways \u2014 just as Bannon understands \u2014 Fidesz is a turbocharged version of the Republican Party.I found it chilling to return home to a Republican closing message in the midterms that echoed Orb\u00e1n\u2019s so closely. In both, fictitious invading hordes \u2014 and those who supposedly support them \u2014 are the enemy of the people.As I kept seeing photos of male politicians in Hungary, I was reminded of the all-male group of Republicans who tried to rewrite health care law in the United States. Or the all-male group of Republicans who designed Trump\u2019s tax cut. Or the all-male group of Republicans who handle Supreme Court nominations on the Senate Judiciary Committee.Conservative parties, wherever they are, should by all means push for the political changes they favor, be it less immigration, more public religion, lower taxes on the rich or almost anything else. But win or lose, those conservative parties also need to accept the basic rules of democracy.When they instead subvert those rules, I hope that citizens \u2014 including conservatives \u2014 have the courage to resist. In Hungary, it is no longer easy to do so. In the United States, this week will help determine the health of our democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kilogram Is Dead. Long Live the Kilogram!", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "After a vote (and a century of research), the standard measure for mass is redefined, and the long reign of Le Grand K is ended.Supported bySince 1889, Le Grand K, a sleek cylinder of platinum-iridium metal, has ruled from its underground vault in Paris. An absolute monarch, it was the very definition of one kilogram of mass. Scientists from around the world made pilgrimages to it, bringing along their national kilogram standards to weigh in comparison and adjust accordingly.\u201cThe mother ship is never wrong,\u201d said Robert Vocke Jr., a chemist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (N.I.S.T.) in Gaithersburg, MD.No longer. Friday, in a small conference center located just steps from the Palace of Versailles, several dozen nations voted to overthrow Le Grand K and to redefine the kilogram and three other standard units of measure: the ampere, for electrical current; the kelvin, for temperature; and the mole, which describes the amount of a chemical substance. The vote fulfills an 18th-century dream. Henceforth, all seven units in the International System of Units, otherwise known as the S.I., will no longer be defined by material objects and instead will be defined only by abstract constants of nature.\u201cThis arc of history started before the French Revolution and now, I think we\u2019ve finished the journey,\u201d said Stephan Schlamminger, a N.I.S.T. physicist. The \u201cdemocratization of the units,\u201d he said, is now complete.The S.I. originated at the end of the eighteenth century with just the meter and the kilogram. The idea was to standardize the basic units of trade and scientific measurement. After all, for one kilogram of gold coins to hold universal value, everyone has to agree on the exact definition of one kilogram.By 1875, 17 nations had signed the Treaty of the Meter in Paris, which set international standards for the meter and the kilogram. The meter was defined as the distance between two scratches on a hallowed bar of platinum-iridium metal. The standard kilogram was Le Grand K. Both artifacts would be stored under lock and key at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, with copies distributed to various countries. \u201cPeople called it \u2018for all times, for all people,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Schlamminger.But it wasn\u2019t. A physical object could be scratched, chipped or even destroyed. Scientists began to dream of standard units of measurement that would remain forever constant \u2014 standards with definitions built from the fabric of the universe.The meter achieved this stature in 1983, when it was redefined in terms of the universally constant speed of light. Scientists had been estimating light\u2019s speed for centuries, but not until the 1970s, following experiments involving lasers in a vacuum, did they settle on a number: exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. The meter was defined accordingly, as the distance traveled by a beam of light in exactly 1/299,792,458th of a second. (The second, another fundamental unit, has been defined since 1967 as the amount of time it takes an atom of cesium-133 to vibrate 9,192,631,770 times.) In effect, a meter no longer needed to be measured; now it could be conjured on demand \u2014 \u201crealized,\u201d in the parlance of metrology.In 1990, metrologists discovered that Le Grand K had mysteriously become lighter than its six official copies by some 50 micrograms. The kilogram standard was in trouble, and the mission to redefine it took on a new level of urgency. Over the years, two possibilities presented themselves: to measure the exact mass of one kilogram in terms of the electromagnetic force required to lift it, or in terms of the specific number of atoms in its mass. But like the meter before 1983, neither of those experimental ideas linked the kilogram to a fundamental constant. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, your definition is useless,\u201d said Ian Robinson, a physicist at the National Physical Laboratory in London.\u201cIt was a devil to work with,\u201d said Anne Kibble, a retired N.P.L. scientist and the widow of Dr. Kibble, who died in 2016.Dr. Kibble dreamed up a different apparatus, renamed the Kibble balance following his death, that eliminated many of the sources of inaccuracy and error that plagued the original.\u201cAll of the difficult things just melt away,\u201d says Dr. Robinson, who worked closely with Dr. Kibble. Together, Dr. Kibble and Dr. Robinson built the world\u2019s first Kibble balance, named the N.P.L. Mark I, in the 1970s.Just as with the experiments that measured the speed of light, once Planck\u2019s constant was measured with extreme accuracy and agreed upon, the role of the Kibble balance could be reversed, to define a kilogram in electromagnetic terms.In the 1990s, a few hundred miles to the east, Horst Bettin, a physicist at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany, was working on realizing the kilogram in a very different way, by counting atoms. \u201cThat was our idea,\u201d said Dr. Bettin. \u201cIt would be far more simple than with the Planck constant.\u201dIn effect, Dr. Bettin had devised an experiment that would precisely measure a constant known as Avogadro\u2019s number, which for many years dictated that one mole of a substance contains 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 particles such as electrons, atoms, ions, or molecules. Avogadro\u2019s number had been estimated but, like the speed of light, never precisely measured and agreed upon. (As of today, Avogadro\u2019s constant has been set at the value 6.02214076 \u00d7 10^23.)But the kilogram could not be redefined until the scientists had derived the same answer for the Planck and Avogadro constants within seven decimal places.\u201cWhat we call \u2018measurement\u2019 is an estimate,\u201d Dr. Schlamminger said. \u201cBasically you can estimate what the true value is. The true value, only the universe knows.\u201dThat accomplishment took 20 years. In 2008, the N.P.L. shut down the Kibble balance effort and sold the instrument to Canada\u2019s National Research Council (N.R.C.). By 2014, the Kibble balances from N.I.S.T. and N.R.C. produced numbers for the Planck and Avogadro constants that agreed with the results from Dr. Bettin\u2019s work for the first time.Anne Kibble said of her husband: \u201cI think he would have been so very, very happy that it has all come to fruition, I\u2019m absolutely convinced of that. It dominated his life.\u201d\u201cThey mustn\u2019t notice, because if they do, we haven\u2019t done our jobs right,\u201d said Dr. Robinson, of the N.P.L. Le Grand K will join its counterpart, the meter bar, in the archives of metrology. Dr. Bettin will retire next year. Dr. Schlamminger has set his sights on big G, the universal gravitational constant.\u201cIf we love to measure things,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s tons of stuff out there that can be measured.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It marks a sharp increase in the political tension between Italy and the rest of Europe \u2014 tension that might even cause Italy to exit from the eurozone.This escalation is in the short-term political interest of both sides, but it is against their long-term political and economic interests. How is it possible that the Italy-Europe relationship has arrived at this low point?Exasperated by stagnant income and increased uncertainty, Italians overwhelmingly voted last March for two parties \u2014 the Five Star Movement and the League \u2014 that promised change, especially in the relationship between Italy and the European Union.Italy\u2019s E.U. partners, however, have shown no interest in reshaping this relationship. Everyone sees the flaws of the current system. The problem is that it would be political suicide to be seen as granting Italy concessions. It\u2019s not just budget issues; it also extends to immigration, for which Italy (and Greece) bear more than their share of the cost.This raises a question: The commission has bent budgetary rules before. So why the intransigence toward the new Italian government?There are optimistic and cynical possibilities for the commission\u2019s rejection. The optimistic one is that the commission had to intervene aggressively to save its reputation because the Italian government made a mockery of the budgetary process. The economic case for the larger Italian budget deficit seemed less like a good-faith argument and more like a deliberate provocation to create a casus belli with European officials. If this were the case, however, it would not make sense for the commission to fall for it.The more cynical view is that the commission is playing a game of national politics, pitting one nation against another against another, even at the cost of the long-term well-being of the European Union. With President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany losing popularity at home, both leaders love to blame an external villain like the new Italian government. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron have certainly not been outdone by the new Italian government, which in turn loves to blame Europe for Italy\u2019s problems.The real loser, in this scenario, is the hope of a functioning Europe.If the unelected European commissioners care about the future of Europe as much as they proclaim, they should make every effort to engage the Italian government in a sensible budget plan that finds a balance between preventing the debt from exploding with the demands the Italian population has made on its government. The best way to prevent the worst form of populism from spreading \u2014 which is in the interests of both the European Union commissioners and Italian citizens \u2014 is recognizing and addressing the legitimate grievances that a large fraction of the population has voiced in electing this new Italian government.One of the lessons we learned from 1930s Germany is what happens when an intransigent group of nations tries to humiliate a prostrated borrower country for petty national politics. It would be an unforgivable tragedy if the European Union were to repeat the same mistake with Italy today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Sydney Can Learn From Los Angeles About Dining", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookOur restaurant critic in Australia wishes that Sydney could take a few lessons from another sunny city.It is staggering how much has changed for Los Angeles over the past six years. When I moved there in 2012, the city\u2019s reputation was still overwhelmingly based on lazy clich\u00e9s: that its supposed cultural vapidity carried over into its restaurants; that its Hollywood artifice bled into the lives and onto the plates of its millions of non-movie-star residents. Very few people \u2014 apart from those residents \u2014 understood the culinary riches Los Angeles had to offer. Ignorance on the part of outside observers was mainly to blame, but the city\u2019s food scene was still in the process of blooming.As I ate my way through Los Angeles last month, I started thinking about Sydney, and all the things that other sunny city might learn from Los Angeles\u2019s recent meteoric rise in culinary status. Why Sydney? There are lessons that Los Angeles could teach any other city, in Australia and beyond, but in Sydney I see a similar trajectory and search for identity. Both cities are often chided about their sun-drenched, health-obsessed culture, and Sydney is still in the process of blooming.There are painfully evident things that Los Angeles has and Sydney doesn\u2019t, which I\u2019ll leave out of this particular argument \u2014 amazing tacos, world-class-yet-affordable sushi \u2014 but that\u2019s beside the point. The important lessons Los Angeles has to offer are mainly philosophical. Much of that philosophy, and many of Los Angeles\u2019s greatest strengths, were pointed out and encouraged by the longtime restaurant critic Jonathan Gold of LA Weekly and, later, The Los Angeles Times. And one of the most profound lessons he taught the city was: Your most important restaurants don\u2019t have to be your fanciest.In his yearly lists of the best and most essential restaurants in Los Angeles, he didn\u2019t elevate European cooking over other types of food. Taco trucks and dumpling houses gained the same status in the eyes of his fans \u2014 practically every dedicated eater in the city \u2014 as any fine dining establishment.In Sydney there is certainly a class of diners, food writers among them, who enjoy exploring all the nooks and crannies of their city and in celebrating the hole-in-the-wall noodle joints. But it\u2019s rare to see those places alongside fine-dining and modern Australian restaurants on the city\u2019s best-of lists. Usually they\u2019re banished to \u201ccheap eats\u201d sections, as if their low prices are the main thing that gives them value. I wish Sydney, and Australia, judged its restaurants purely on the power of deliciousness and less on glittery dining rooms and high-rent real estate. Both have value, but style is not inherently better than substance.And in one corner of his restaurant is a painting of Mr. Gold\u2019s silhouette.In Australia, I tend to find myself either in a room full of white people, or in one where I am the only white person \u2014 a situation that often signifies a kind of badge of honor for another type of diner, a sign that they have found that coveted and elusive quality: authenticity.\u201cWhen we were finally like, \u2018Screw it, this is what we want to eat, this is who we are, we don\u2019t really care what anyone else thinks,\u2019 that\u2019s when everything got so good,\u201d she said.Sydney desperately wants to be recognized as a global food destination. But after eating there roughly every month for the past year, I\u2019m still unsure of the soul of the place. There are lots of great restaurants, but very few that have a clear sense of place other than the majestic harbor and beach views that define some landmark restaurants.Outsiders may refer to Sydney with generalizations about juice cleanses, a\u00e7ai bowls and botox, but Los Angeles is proof that those skewed perceptions can be thwarted by an engaged dining public. If the city stopped caring what anyone else thought, if the goal was simply to have fun and eat whatever pleases the people who live in Sydney, what would that look like?I\u2019d love to find out.Advertisement"}

And democracy, after a surge of voters who had checked out of their role in the governing part, has a pulse.One-party rule is over. The Democrats are on pace to win the overall popular vote \u2014 that is, the total tally cast in House races \u2014 by about seven percentage points. They lost it by a point in 2016, and six points in 2014. People under 30 favored the insurgents by about 35 points. Independents, our fastest-growing segment of voters, broke big for the Dems as well.

That argument is over.As always, policies to help people \u2014 a boost in the minimum wage in Arkansas and Missouri, pragmatic restrictions on guns in Washington State \u2014 passed handily, once they got past the gatekeepers and were put to voters.Trump did his Mussolini-lite thing \u2014 the vainglorious tilt of the chin, the boasts and lies that follow his Red State One plane from bubble to bubble, the authoritarian swipes at an independent press and judiciary.But white women, from the suburbs of Dallas and Houston and Chicago and Oklahoma City and Denver, ain\u2019t buying it anymore. They\u2019ve joined the majority. The Trump cult is diminishing, though an appeal to facts will not bring his followers to reason.No matter. For here is where history will give us some comfort. The American Know Nothing movement peaked in the 1850s on a wave of anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment. The targets then were Irish and German.Those dark forces morphed into the Ku Klux Klan, America\u2019s original and most durable domestic terrorists, who waged a post-Civil War campaign of murder and intimidation. They rose again in an oddball coalition \u2014 again targeting Irish, Germans and a new element, \u201cswarthy\u201d immigrants from the south of Italy \u2014 that gave us Prohibition.Intermittently dormant thereafter for nearly a century, the devil we know came roaring back when Trump launched his presidency of fear and hate. And of course, he had the full backing of the Klan elements. \u201cGo, Trump, go,\u201d tweeted David Duke, the former Klan leader, on this year\u2019s election eve. Duke loved the Trump anti-Mexican ad that was so racist even Fox News pulled it.Sadly, fear of \u201cothers\u201d was probably the deciding factor in governor\u2019s races in Florida and Georgia. And our petulant president on Wednesday sneered at the Republicans who refused to embrace his dark vision and lost. He didn\u2019t mention the many who did wrap their arms around him \u2014 in the Senate races in Montana and Nevada \u2014 and were shown the door.Kansas, always a bellwether for how race shapes this country, said, enough! Kris Kobach, one of the most anti-immigrant politicians in the country, was soundly defeated for governor there. He ran caravan ads, the full Trumpian dystopia, but it couldn\u2019t save him.True, the caravan scare was likely to have inspired a man to slaughter people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2014 probably the worst act of anti-Semitic violence in our nation\u2019s history.But let\u2019s not forget what happened afterward. Ari Mahler, a nurse and the son of a rabbi, cared for the shooter. \u201cI wanted him to feel compassion,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI chose to show him empathy.\u201dAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of our better angels, let\u2019s cherish the 83-year-old man in Wisconsin who walked a mile to the polls after his car was totaled by a deer.

But there are words for this, entire books full of words: the books the murdered people were reading at the hour of their deaths. News reports described these victims as praying, but Jewish prayer is not primarily personal or spontaneous. It is communal reading. Public recitations of ancient words, scripts compiled centuries ago and nearly identical in every synagogue in the world. A lot of those words are about exactly this.When I told my children what had happened, they didn\u2019t ask why; they knew. \u201cBecause some people hate Jews,\u201d they said. How did these American children know that? They shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Passover story,\u201d my 9-year-old told me. \u201cAnd the Hanukkah story. And the Purim story. And the Babylonians, and the Romans.\u201d My children are descendants of Holocaust survivors, but they didn\u2019t go that far forward in history. The words were already there.The people murdered in Pittsburgh were mostly old, because the old are the pillars of Jewish life, full of days and memories. They are the ones who come to synagogue first, the ones who know the words by heart. The oldest victim was Rose Mallinger, 97.People Ms. Mallinger\u2019s age were in their 20s when word spread about mass murders of Jews in Europe. In synagogue on Rosh Hashana, they read the old words begging God for compassion, \u201cfor the sake of those killed for your holy name,\u201d and \u201cfor the sake of those slaughtered for your uniqueness.\u201d My husband\u2019s grandparents came here after those massacres, their previous spouses and children slaughtered like the people in the prayer. They kept reciting the prayer, and for their new American family it reverted to metaphor. In the decades that followed, Jews from other places joined American synagogues, many bringing memories that American Jews had forgotten. Those memories were waiting for them in the synagogue\u2019s books. On the holiday of Purim, they recited the Book of Esther, about an ancient Persian leader\u2019s failed attempt at a Jewish genocide. It\u2019s a time for costumes and levity, for shaking noisemakers to blot out the evildoer\u2019s name. One year my brother dressed as the ayatollah, and the Persians in our congregation laughed. Another year someone dressed as Gorbachev; the Russians loved it. The evildoers seemed defeated.In the years that followed, the internet suddenly allowed anyone to say whatever he wanted, rewarding the most outrageous from every political stripe. Soon, comments sections became an open sewer, flowing with centuries-old garbage \u2014 and as social media exploded, those comments scaled up to the open vitriol of the past few years. To young Jews this felt confusing. To old Jews it must have felt familiar, a memory passed down and repeated in the holy books. My children were right: This story is old, with far too many words. Yet they were wrong about one thing. In the old stories, those outside the community rarely helped or cared; our ancestors\u2019 consolation came only from one another and from God. But in this horrific week, perhaps our old words might mean something new.This week in synagogue as always, we read from the scroll we call the Tree of Life, and the place will comfort us. As we put the book away, we repeat the words from Lamentations: \u201cRenew our days as of old.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We are working our way toward a new political dispensation.Mr. Buskirk is editor and publisher of the journal American Greatness and a contributing opinion writer.With Election Day at hand, we know one thing for sure: Voter turnout is huge. In fact, it looks like we will have the highest midterm turnout since 1966. The rationale for a gigantic blue wave that would represent a repudiation of the 2016 election has been that millions of Americans are so turned off by President Trump and his agenda that they will come out en masse and hand Congress to Democrats with large majorities, proving what has been an article of faith among Trump-haters, that his election was an anomaly and that American politics would quickly revert to the mean.But that\u2019s not going to happen \u2014 because it relies on a false premise. Republicans don\u2019t want to go back to the Bush-McCain-Romney era any more than Democrats want to go back to Clintonism. And since the Kavanaugh hearings, Republicans are just as energized and united as Democrats. That means everything is up for grabs. This election, in other words, is part of a process in which the electorate is working toward a new political dispensation that will replace the one that prevailed from the end of World War II until sometime during the Obama administration.What seems most likely is that we will get a split decision. As of now, Republicans are set up to increase their majority in the Senate, while Democrats have some advantages in the House. Though things are moving quickly and Democrats have had to spend money to defend incumbents in what should be safe seats. Senator Bob Menendez in New Jersey and Representative Jim Costa in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley both have Republicans nipping at their heels. Democrats remain likely to win both races, but if this were really a wave election they wouldn\u2019t be close.In Texas, Beto O\u2019Rourke, has raised far more money than Senator Ted Cruz and has captured the imagination of the political press, but has not led in a single poll and is currently far behind. Across the country, Democrats have consistently out-raised Republicans, but one of the lessons of this cycle may be that you can\u2019t buy a wave election.With Mr. Trump more popular than Mr. Obama just before the 2010 midterms, Republicans just might retain a House majority too, but if they do it, it will be close. Even if they don\u2019t and Democratic gains there are balanced by Republican gains in the Senate, it is simply not a blue wave and is just a typical midterm adjustment by voters. What this would suggest is that Mr. Trump, or at least his policies, are much more popular than his media detractors believe.This cycle was always going to be more difficult for Democrats than they thought. Even though the progressive agenda is embraced with almost religious totality by electoral supermajorities on the coasts and in many cities it is deplored almost everywhere else. That conflict is the basis for the sharp division in our politics. Democrats made a strategic error with the failed character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh. The viciousness of the choreographed, late-in-the-process attacks and Democrats\u2019 rush to jettison the presumption of innocence disgusted many people who might otherwise have been more open to the Democrats\u2019 message. And it did what Republicans had been unable to do for themselves: galvanize their base.In Minnesota in September, Mr. Trump told supporters at a rally that the \u201crage-fueled resistance\u201d to Kavanaugh \u201cis starting to backfire at a level nobody has ever seen before.\u201d He was right.

He congratulated Sinema last night in a heartfelt tweet. But are these our only standards for Trump critics? Good manners?When his book came out last year, I saluted Flake for doing something politically contraindicated and Rubicon-crossing, establishing himself as the first Republican senator to call President Trump the domestic and international menace that he is. I applauded him for describing the president\u2019s tweets as \u201call noise and no signal\u201d and for daring to charge his administration with Orwellian doublespeak, \u201cdividing us along fissures of truth and falsity and keeping us in a kind of low-level dread.\u201dI said that Flake\u2019s book had rhetorical power.You could make the case that Flake, as a conservative, had every right to vote for measures consistent with his philosophy: tax cuts, the appointment of Federalist Society-approved judges, environmental deregulation.But try this as a thought experiment: Imagine if, by some cosmic twist of dystopian lunacy, Sean Penn captured the Democratic nomination in 2020 and then won the White House. Would Democrats consider him worth the trouble in exchange for a tax increase and the appointment of two liberal Supreme Court justices?Some undoubtedly would. But they\u2019d be cowards. Their objective should be to render him as impotent as possible.It is also true that Flake\u2019s record is better than all but a handful of his Senate Republican colleagues. This week, he and Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, are planning to ask for a vote on legislation that protects the investigation of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.But Flake didn\u2019t write the original legislation. Other colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee did. And it would be shocking if it went anywhere.The truth of the matter is this: If Flake believed, all along, that Trump posed a genuine threat to democracy \u2014 that he is the least stable element on the periodic table of American presidents, with a half-life of 22 minutes and a terrifying potential to blow things up \u2014 then why did he slavishly follow the president\u2019s desires at all? Why did he ever allow ideological ends to justify republic-endangering means?In my initial review, I did note that Flake\u2019s words wouldn\u2019t be worth much if they weren\u2019t matched by deeds. But I made this point late, at the bottom of the staircase. (Thank goodness it appeared in the headline.) I was otherwise snowed by Flake\u2019s candor. Along with lavender-scented baths, chamomile tea and barbiturates, books by politicians tend to rank among the world\u2019s most potent soporifics. His was not. He wrote of the despair he was feeling beneath the lacquered smile.If you\u2019re a truly committed Never Trumper, there\u2019s a fundamental problem with selectively supporting Trump\u2019s agenda. Whenever you hand him a vote, you strengthen him. You contribute to his roster of accomplishments. The more victories he accumulates, the more reasons he has for voters to buy the same product in 2020.Flake, I\u2019m sure, would disagree. He\u2019d probably say that someone within his party needed to hold up the banner for a morally sound conservatism. \u201cConscience of a Conservative\u201d was mainly a lament, an anguished monograph showing just how far the modern Republican Party had strayed from the free-market, vigorous-foreign-policy principles of Barry Goldwater, who wrote a manifesto of the same name. The book was an impassioned plea to return to them before it was too late.But it is too late. What we\u2019ve learned, in the 15-plus months since Flake\u2019s book was published, is that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s Republican Party now \u2014 one heavy with nativists, populists, protectionists, assorted supremacists. Flake\u2019s protest votes \u2014 and his repeated exhortations to return to the party\u2019s roots, its conscience \u2014 had zero effect.In which case, perhaps I should soften my critique of my critique. It wasn\u2019t that I was too kind to Flake when his book came out. It was that I mischaracterized his book altogether. \u201cConscience of a Conservative\u201d was not a cri de coeur, a critique of Trump, an analysis of the sorry state of our politics or an invitation to recommit to Goldwater\u2019s philosophy.It was a relic. It was a bit of quixotica. It was a tragedy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A School Strike That Never Quite Ended", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe struggle over who should teach in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville district of Brooklyn 50 years ago changed the trajectory of modern liberalism.Mr. Kahlenberg is the author of a biography of Albert Shanker. On Nov. 17, 1968, Albert Shanker, a tough Queens-bred union president, stood next to New York City\u2019s patrician mayor, John Lindsay, to announce a settlement to a crippling teacher strike that had thrown a million students out of New York City public schools for weeks on end. The divisive strike laid bare long simmering tensions within American liberalism over unions, education and race. Almost a half-century later, the evolution in liberal attitudes that the strike symbolized created vulnerabilities that a very different son of Queens, Donald Trump, exploited in his rise to the presidency.By the late 1960s, after years of frustration with vicious white resistance to school integration, many African-American leaders supported the creation of a black-controlled local school district in the low-income Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn. The idea was that the district would hire more minority schoolteachers in order to provide role models for students and adopt a curriculum that was culturally affirming.A firestorm erupted, however, when the local school board (then known as the governing board) sent a telegram to 19 unionized educators indicating that the board \u201cvoted to end your employment in the schools of this district.\u201d The list included 18 white educators and one black teacher, mistakenly included, who was immediately reinstated once the error was discovered. A hearing by a retired African-American judge hired by the board, Francis Rivers, found that there were no credible charges against the teachers. But Rhody McCoy, the Ocean Hill-Brownsville local superintendent, told The New York Times, \u201cNot one of these teachers will be allowed to teach anywhere in the city. The black community will see to that.\u201d To protest the terminations, teachers throughout the city began a series of strikes shutting down the nation\u2019s largest school system from early September through mid-November. For many progressives committed to working-class people, including Shanker, the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin and the socialist writer Michael Harrington, the governing board\u2019s actions and philosophy raised red flags.To begin with, Shanker believed he had no choice but to call a strike to protect his members from arbitrary dismissal. If an employer \u2014 of whatever race \u2014 had the right to dismiss unionized employees without due process, why have a union? Shanker understood that conservatives didn\u2019t believe in collective bargaining rights and due process. But wasn\u2019t it a bedrock liberal principle, he asked, for workers to have a right to organize and protect themselves from arbitrary actions by their employers?Shanker and Rustin also thought it was important to fight for integrated schools and noted that \u201ccommunity control\u201d was originally the slogan adopted by white parents in Queens who opposed desegregation. Shanker supported the creation of the nation\u2019s first nonselective magnet schools to foster integration and cited the 1966 Coleman Report, which found that low-income students achieved at much higher levels in socioeconomically integrated schools than in those with concentrated poverty. Settling for community control of segregated schools was wrong, Rustin argued. The idea was, as he put it, \u201cthe spiritual descendant of states\u2019 rights.\u201dFinally, Shanker and Rustin believed in diversifying the teaching force but said it had to be done in the right way. Shanker said it sent a terrible message to students when a white teacher led the typical school classroom with a black or Hispanic aide assisting her. But he said that race should not determine who was fired or hired. He was particularly irked at the idea that economically insecure white teachers should give up their jobs to make room for others, while more privileged whites \u2014 who lectured teachers about their bigotry \u2014 did not.Instead, to improve teacher diversity, Shanker worked hard to unionize teacher aides and to negotiate a stipend for them to go back to school, get their college degrees and become teachers themselves. Over time, more than 8,000 paraprofessionals became teachers, providing the largest single source of minority teachers in New York City.When the third and final strike was settled, the community control effort was gutted. Shanker won among broader public opinion, but lost among liberals. Many progressives dismissed Shanker, a cerebral former graduate student in philosophy, as a madman, as a well-known joke from the era suggests. In Woody Allen\u2019s 1973 science fiction comedy, \u201cSleeper,\u201d Mr. Allen\u2019s character wakes up two centuries in the future to find that that civilization was destroyed when \u201ca man by the name of Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead.\u201dMore generally, over the subsequent 50 years, the Lindsay/Bundy/Carmichael worldview would largely prevail over the Shanker/Rustin/Harrington approach among progressives. In the years since Ocean Hill-Brownsville, many upper-middle class liberals have demonstrated a lukewarm attitude toward unions. When Democrats held majorities in Congress under presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the progressive coalition failed to prioritize labor law reforms to give unions a fair shot at surviving. Likewise, those same Democratic administrations largely avoided the fight to support school integration, favoring instead spending more money for high-poverty schools. And at the federal level, Democrats have largely adopted the view articulated by Bundy and others involved in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville conflict that race could be an explicit factor in hiring decisions.The shifts on unions, school integration and race-conscious decision-making that the 1968 teachers strikes symbolized are not unrelated to the disastrous election in 2016, a calamity from which progressives only partially recovered in 2018. A strong labor movement, an integrated public school system and a legal commitment to equal treatment of individuals by race all help make authoritarian white nationalism less appealing. But the reduced progressive commitment to these critical bulwarks helped clear the way for a demagogue.In the turbulent strikes of 1968, Shanker, Rustin and Harrington articulated a pro-union, pro-integration program that offered a different path to the crucial goal of teacher diversity. A half-century later, that vision still holds great power.Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, is the author of \u201cTough Liberal: Albert Shanker and the Battles Over Schools, Unions, Race and Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unraveling the Mysteries of Dorothea Lange\u2019s \u2018Migrant Mother\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensThe history behind Ms. Lange\u2019s photograph of Florence Owens Thompson has intrigued academics and photographers for decades. But a new book sheds fresh light on the portrait\u2019s little-explored details. Dorothea Lange\u2019s 1936 portrait of Florence Owens Thompson and her daughters is so well-known that finding anything new to say about it seems futile. Yet as with the Mona Lisa \u2014 to which the \u201cMigrant Mother\u201d photo has been compared \u2014 the image retains an air of mystery.But \u201cDorothea Lange: Migrant Mother,\u201d a new book from the Museum of Modern Art, offers fresh insights as it weaves a compelling tale about some little-explored details. Written by Sarah Meister, a photography curator at MoMA, the book comes out at a time when faces of desperately poor people in migrant caravans dominate the news.\u201cI thought, could there possibly be anything new to say about this picture?\u201d Ms. Meister said. \u201cBut Lange is so important. I find her politics so admirable. Her sense of commitment and her ability to distill very important and complex arguments into imagery that made those arguments seem absolutely impossible to ignore. It feels particularly timely.\u201dBecause the photograph was made while Ms. Lange was working for the federal Farm Security Administration, the photo is available to everyone, and it has been used in many ways, including as a postage stamp, a 1,000-piece puzzle and on trinkets, T-shirts, posters and postcards.Part of why so many people related to the image was, perhaps, the anonymity of this family, which could have been any of millions of Americans suffering through the Great Depression, Ms. Meister said. But in 1978, Ms. Thompson wrote to the editor of the Modesto Bee newspaper explaining that she was the woman in the photo \u2014 and that she felt exploited because she was never compensated for the image.\u201cWe have never been a race-blind country, frankly,\u201d Ms. Meister said. \u201cI wish that I could say that the response would have been the same if everyone had been aware that she was Cherokee, but I don\u2019t think that you can.\u201dWith help from librarians at the San Francisco Public Library, Ms. Meister pieced together how the inaccurate caption information probably came about. After Ms. Lange filed her pictures to The San Francisco News, a reporter for United Press went to the migrant encampment in Nipomo. Although Ms. Lange \u2014 and, apparently, the Thompson family \u2014 had left days earlier, her photos were published with the United Press\u2019s reporter\u2019s article. Details from it appear in the captions in the Library of Congress, Ms. Meister said.Which brings us to the case of the missing thumb.It is easy to tell whether a print of \u201cMigrant Mother\u201d was made before 1939, because that year Ms. Lange had an assistant retouch the negative and remove Ms. Thompson\u2019s thumb from the bottom right corner, much to the chagrin of Roy Stryker, her boss at the Farm Security Administration. While that was a fairly common practice at the time, Mr. Stryker thought it compromised the authenticity not just of the photo but also of his whole F.S.A. documentary project, Ms. Meister said. But Ms. Lange considered the thumb to be such a glaring defect that she apparently didn\u2019t have a second thought about removing it. In the print from the Library of Congress below, the thumb is still in the image\u2019s lower right corner.Ms. Meister said she loved \u201can unsolved mystery,\u201d so searching for the answers of whether \u201cMigrant Mother\u201d was made in February or March 1936, or where the captions came from and why they upset the family, was satisfying. But to her, correcting the historical record was especially meaningful.\u201cAs a civilization we need to be able to establish facts and still accept that for some people this might represent the pinnacle of motherhood,\u201d she said. \u201cFor others this might represent the depth of the Depression; and for others this might represent a suppressing of racial identity. Each of those interpretations is perfectly valid so long as we agree on the facts.\u201cI don\u2019t believe there are alternative facts,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you can have alternative interpretations.\u00ad\u00ad\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than a Pirate, a Rebel With a Democratic Spirit ", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDecades before the American Revolution, Blackbeard and his pirates revolted against unjust conditions imposed by shipowners and captains. Mr. Woodard is the author of \u201cThe Republic of Pirates: Being the True and Surprising Story of the Caribbean Pirates and the Man Who Brought Them Down.\u201dBATH, N.C. \u2014 Three hundred years ago this week, a band of Royal Navy sailors killed Blackbeard, the most infamous pirate in history, putting a symbolic end to the golden age of piracy, a maritime rebellion that strangled trans-Atlantic commerce, terrified naval captains and colonial governors, and briefly gave hope to downtrodden sailors, plantation slaves and even the House of Stuart, recently deposed from the British throne.Blackbeard didn\u2019t go quietly. Surprised at his Outer Banks pirate\u2019s nest on the morning of Nov. 22, 1718 \u2014 his crew hung over from a night of revelry \u2014 he blasted his opponents\u2019 vessels with broadsides and died in hand-to-hand combat, with five musket wounds \u201cand 20 dismal cuts on several parts of his body.\u201dHe didn\u2019t live quietly, either. In a piracy career lasting no more than four years, Blackbeard helped his fellow pirates occupy war-torn Nassau in the Bahamas, where they restored the fort and strangled commerce making the obligatory passage out of the Caribbean via the nearby Florida Straits. He terrorized the approaches to New York, Philadelphia, the Chesapeake and Charleston, S.C., and cultivated so terrible a visage that merchant captains simply surrendered to him without a fight.In the process, his deeds captivated the popular consciousness on both sides of the Atlantic and never let it go. \u201cA General History of the Pyrates,\u201d a surprisingly sympathetic and often embellished account of their depredations, became a best seller in Britain and its colonies. The book, written by a pseudonymous author, informed the novels of Robert Louis Stevenson, the films of Walt Disney and most every fictional pirate from Captain Hook to Captain Jack Sparrow.But why? The Bahamian pirates were unlike most other pirates who\u2019ve come before or since in that they claimed to be engaged in more than simple banditry. Most, including Blackbeard, were former merchant and naval sailors who thought themselves engaged in a social revolt against shipowners and captains who\u2019d made their lives miserable. The pirate Sam Bellamy\u2019s crew referred to themselves as Robin Hood\u2019s men. \u201cThey vilify us, the scoundrels do, when there is only this difference,\u201d Bellamy told a captive. \u201cThey rob the poor under the cover of law\u201d and \u201cwe plunder the rich under the cover of our own courage.\u201dThere was also a democratic spirit aboard the pirates\u2019 ships six decades before Lexington and Yorktown, more than seven ahead of the storming of the Bastille. Upon seizing a vessel, the pirates turned its government upside down. Instead of using whips and beatings to enforce a rigid, top-down hierarchy, they elected and deposed their captains by popular vote. They shared their treasure almost equally and on most ships didn\u2019t allow the captain his own cabin. The contracts some crews drew up and signed included disability benefits: payments for lost eyes and limbs taken from the shared plunder before it was divvied up.All this \u2014 and far better food, drink and hours \u2014 made piracy extremely attractive to merchant and naval sailors alike, who in this time period faced malnourishment, wage cheating, and brutal and sometimes sadistic officers. Typically when the pirates captured a ship, a portion of its crew would enthusiastically join their ranks, allowing the outbreak to expand from a handful of pirates in sloops to several thousand in multi-ship squadrons in just three years. Even the Royal Navy was vulnerable; when the ship H.M.S. Phoenix confronted the pirates at their Nassau lair 300 years ago this spring, a number of the frigate\u2019s sailors sneaked off in the night to serve under the black flag.Runaway slaves also joined the pirates as word spread that they allowed people of African descent to participate as equal members of their crews and sometimes as captains. At the height of the outbreak, it was not unusual for escaped or liberated slaves to account for a quarter or more of the pirates\u2019 crews. In the months after Blackbeard captured his flagship, Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, witnesses would report as many as 70 serving aboard, and several remained in his closest circle to the day he died. Although pirates also treated many of the slaves they found on captured slave ships as cargo to be sold, not colleagues to recruit, their integrated ships still represented a threat to the slave colonies surrounding the Bahamas. Gov. Benjamin Bennett of Bermuda warned that slaves had \u201cgrown so impudent and insulting of late that we have reason to suspect their rising\u201d against us and \u201cfear their joining with the pirates.\u201dNot all pirates were downtrodden. Bellamy\u2019s sidekick Paulsgrave Williams was the son of Rhode Island\u2019s attorney general, and the \u201cgentleman pirate\u201d Stede Bonnet was the scion of an influential Barbados family. There\u2019s considerable evidence that these pirates had a secret motivation of their own: to depose George I \u2014 who had ascended to the throne in 1714 \u2014 and restore the Stuarts. Some of the pirates sent a letter to the court of the would-be Stuart king in exile in France offering their services, while several others were closely associated with a suspected organizer of a failed, pro-Stuart uprising in 1715.Their motives may have been mixed, but popular opinion was on the pirates\u2019 side. Authorities regularly complained to their superiors in London that many of their subjects regarded the pirates as heroes. Lt. Gov. Alexander Spotswood of Virginia fumed that his citizens had \u201can unaccountable inclination to favor pirates.\u201d The gang included the female pirates Mary Read and Anne Bonny, the flamboyant Calico Jack Rackham and the bombastic Charles Vane, but Blackbeard became the most famous of them all. This was partly because of the terrifying image he cultivated, tying lighted fuses in his beard as his ship closed on its prey so as to appear bathed in demonic fire and smoke. Opposing crews were so fearful they usually surrendered without firing a shot, which was exactly the intent; he wanted his prize, its cargo and crew of potential recruits to be undamaged. Indeed, in the dozens of eyewitness accounts of his victims, there is not a single instance in which he killed anyone before his final, fatal battle with the Royal Navy.It was that battle that sealed his place in history. North America\u2019s only newspaper, The Boston News-Letter, covered it exhaustively, and the controversy over the legality of the operation carried on for years. Lt. Gov. Spotswood had sent the naval sailors \u2014 including a detachment traveling overland \u2014 into what amounted to an unsanctioned invasion of North Carolina. Authorities there had protested it \u2014 several of them had colluded with Blackbeard, who had bought a house, married a local woman and fenced pirated goods in the diminutive capital, Bath. The scandal helped bring down Spotswood, who resigned his post in 1722, and the hero of the battle, Lt. Robert Maynard, was repeatedly passed over for promotions.As for Blackbeard, his body was thrown into Pamlico Sound, his head presented to Spotswood, who displayed it on a tall pole at Hampton Roads at a place now known as Blackbeard\u2019s Point. But while the lieutenant governor has been all but forgotten, the pirate has lived on, more famous in death than he ever was in life.Colin Woodard, state and national affairs writer at The Portland (Maine) Press Herald, is the author of \u201cThe Republic of Pirates: Being the True and Surprising Story of the Caribbean Pirates and the Man Who Brought Them Down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Zuckerberg, if you want to use a comic-book reference here, is a combination of Wolverine and Deadpool with a little bit of zombie magic thrown in.Mr. Schrage, the one who actually made the bad call on the press strategy, is also somehow evading censure: He is now seen as the loyal guy who fell on his sword, while Ms. Sandberg looks more like the one who pushed him onto the blade.And that is one of the key lessons to learn here about the tech industry today: Everyone expects so little from the male leaders who are often seen as the fulcrum of the digital worlds they create, while the female leaders \u2014 who are not usually the inventors \u2014 are held to a tougher line.Ms. Sandberg, of course, has power over much of Facebook\u2019s business operations, advertising and also the critical communications and policy units. Perhaps it\u2019s only fair that, as women rise to power, they pay the price for failure.But what is more often true in tech is that men are seen as the key players, and women are just not seen as crucial to a company's success. That inequity has become a theme of a wide range of employment issues across Silicon Valley of late, including the phenomenon of \u201cunderleveling\u201d \u2014 hiring women and people of color at a lower level than they deserve.\u201cI, as a black woman at Google, came in with an undergraduate and master\u2019s degree from Stanford and three years\u2019 worth of experience working in the tech industry, and they chose to put me into an entry-level six-month contract position in recruiting,\u201d she said.She said Google managers insist that the company isn\u2019t diverse enough because of the \u201cpipeline problem.\u201d They say: \u201cWe need to go to more schools and teach them how to code. There\u2019s something wrong with these students and something wrong with the pipeline.\u201d But she argued there\u2019s a bigger problem at Google that has nothing to do with the pipeline. \u201cBlack women have the highest attrition rate. They\u2019re leaving Google at higher rates than any other group, all over the industry.\u201dShe and the other organizers blamed this on opportunities that were not offered as readily, on tougher hurdles to leap over, on pay that was consistently lower and, most of all, on a system that forgave the men for their mistakes, and did not forgive the women.That was underscored at Google by an astonishing $90 million payout to the top executive Andy Rubin when he left in a cloud of controversy.Ms. Parker, who now works at YouTube, described succinctly the issue of who really paid the price for his sins. At the walkout, she said she asked the crowd: \u201cWhere do you think Google got that $90 million they used to pay out Andy Rubin? They got it from every time you worked late. Every promotion you didn\u2019t get because they said there\u2019s not enough budget, you have to wait. It\u2019s from every contractor who came to work sick because they have no paid time off. These are conscious decisions that the company is making, and abusers are getting rich off of our hard work. It\u2019s just not fair, and they completely know what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThey completely do. Ms. Sandberg is hardly blameless, but notice that she is the one facing the real firing line and not Mr. Zuckerberg. Which is to say, no matter his responsibility, he is unkillable, unfireable and untouchable and no amount of leaning in by Ms. Sandberg or any other woman in tech is going to change that.Advertisement"}

But I was surprised how massive the Republican turnout was in response.The Republicans who flooded to the polls weren\u2019t college-educated suburbanites. Those people voted for Democrats this year.They weren\u2019t tax-cut fanatics. Half of the Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee either left Congress, ran for other offices or were defeated.They weren\u2019t even small-government Republicans. The same red states that elected conservatives to office also \u2014 in Nebraska, Idaho and Utah \u2014 approved ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid. The same red states that elected conservatives also approved initiatives \u2014 in Arkansas and Missouri \u2014 to raise the minimum wage.These were high-school-educated, working-class Republicans.A lot of us pundits said Donald Trump should run a positive campaign bragging about all the economic growth. But Trump ran another American carnage campaign. That\u2019s because American life still feels like carnage to many.This is still a country in which nearly 20 percent of prime-age American men are not working full time. This is still a country in which only 37 percent of adults expect children to be better off financially than they are. This is still a country in which millions of new jobs are through \u201calternative work arrangements\u201d like contracting or consulting \u2014 meaning no steady salary, no predictable hours and no security.Part of the problem is misplaced priorities. For the last several decades, American economic policy has been pinioned on one goal: expanding G.D.P. We measure G.D.P. We talk incessantly about economic growth. Between 1975 and 2015, American G.D.P. increased threefold. But what good is that growth if it means that a thick slice of America is discarded for efficiency reasons?Similarly, for the last several decades American, welfare policy has focused on consumption \u2014 giving money to the poor so they can consume more. Yet we have not successfully helped poor people produce more so that they can take control of their own lives. We now spend more than $20,000 a year in means-tested government spending per person in poverty. And yet the average poverty rate for 2000 to 2015 was higher than it was for 1970 to 1985.\u201cWhat if people\u2019s ability to produce matters more than how much they can consume?\u201d Cass asks.The bulk of his book is a series of ideas for how we can reform labor markets.For example, Cass supports academic tracking. Right now, we have a one-size-fits-all education system. Everybody should go to college. The problem is that roughly one-fifth of our students fail to graduate high school in four years; roughly one-fifth take no further schooling after high school; roughly one-fifth drop out of college; roughly one-fifth get a job that doesn\u2019t require the degree they just earned; and roughly one-fifth actually navigate the path the system is built around \u2014 from school to career.We build a broken system and then ask people to try to fit into the system instead of tailoring a system around people\u2019s actual needs.Cass suggests that we instead do what nearly every other affluent nation does: Let students, starting in high school, decide whether they want to be on an apprenticeship track or an academic track. Vocational and technical schools are ubiquitous across the developed world, and yet that model is mostly rejected here.Cass also supports worker co-ops. Today, we have an old, adversarial labor union model that is inappropriate for the gig economy and uninteresting to most private-sector workers. But co-ops, drawing on more successful models used in several European nations, could represent workers in negotiations, train and retrain workers as they moved from firm to firm and build a safety net for periods of unemployment. Shopping for a worker co-op would be more like buying a gym membership. Each co-op would be a community and service provider to address a range of each worker\u2019s needs.Cass has many other proposals \u2014 wage subsidies, immigration reforms. But he\u2019s really trying to put work, and the dignity of work, at the center of our culture and concern. In the 1970s and 1980s, he points out, the Emmy Award-winning TV shows were about blue-collar families: \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cTaxi,\u201d \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d Now the Emmy-winning shows are mostly about white-collar adults working in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, New York and Washington.We in the college-educated sliver have built a culture, an economy and a political system that are all about ourselves. It\u2019s time to pass labor market reforms that will make life decent for everybody.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ice Age Asteroid Crater Discovered Beneath Greenland Glacier ", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesBuried beneath a half mile of snow and ice in Greenland, scientists have uncovered an impact crater large enough to swallow the District of Columbia. The finding suggests that a giant iron asteroid smashed into what is today a glacier during the last ice age, an era known as the Pleistocene Epoch that started 2.6 million years ago. When it ended only 11,700 years ago, mega-fauna like saber-toothed cats had died out while humanity had inherited the Earth. The discovery could lead to insights into the ice age climate, and the effects on it from the eruption of debris that would have resulted from such a cataclysmic collision.In 2015, Dr. Kj\u00e6r and a colleague were analyzing a NASA map of Greenland when they noticed an enormous circular depression on the Hiawatha Glacier at Greenland\u2019s northwest tip.\u201cThere was a hidden landscape starting to take shape,\u201d said Dr. Kj\u00e6r. \u201cWe looked at it and said, \u2018What is that?\u2019\u201dAt that moment Dr. Kj\u00e6r thought about the car-size meteorite on display in the courtyard near his office in Copenhagen, which had coincidentally been recovered from the northwest of Greenland. He and his colleague joked that perhaps the circular structure was a crater left by an asteroid. After the laughs subsided, they realized their suggestion might not be far-fetched. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many ways you could create a circular feature beneath an ice sheet,\u201d said Dr. Kj\u00e6r.For three days in May 2016, his team flew over the crater in a German airplane with ice-penetrating radar, drawing imaginary grid lines across the surface.The bowl of the crater presses right against the edge of the glacier, giving the wandering ice sheet a semi-circle-like appearance that is visible from above. Breaking out from that semicircle is a white tongue of ice, a large river containing sediments from the bottom of the ice sheet.Dr. Kj\u00e6r ventured to the floodplain via helicopter and collected sediment. He found what he said were pieces of highly shocked quartz, which signaled that a violent impact had occurred at some time in the area\u2019s history. The area\u2019s sediments also had high concentrations of nickel, cobalt, chromium, gold and platinum, an indicator that the meteorite was made of iron.Because the team has not yet searched for ejected material from the impact in ice cores, they cannot establish an accurate date for the impact, beyond saying it occurred during the Pleistocene. Their next steps are to determine whether the asteroid smashed into a glacier or an area that was subsequently covered by ice, and to assess the climatic effects of the impact.Dr. Kj\u00e6r still wonders if the meteorite in the courtyard outside his office, which was found about 200 miles away from the Hiawatha crater, may hold clues to better understanding the ancient impact.\u201cEven though we have looked into the planet\u2019s surface so much, with every type of equipment,\u201d said Dr. Kj\u00e6r, \u201cthe Age of Discovery is not over yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We want to hear from our readers.Please include your full name and where you\u2019re from.Here are some of the reactions we have already gotten from readers in our comments section, on Twitter and in our Reader Center Facebook group. They have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.Mostly I\u2019m relieved to know that while our democracy is still broken, it\u2019s not dead, and that Democrats can actually win the races they\u2019re projected to win. There\u2019s good news on the diversity front, and it\u2019s great that we\u2019ve flipped a few Midwestern governors.But we must accept the fact that this was not really a defeat for Trump, and may actually help him. The blue House will provide him with fresh fodder for his Twitter rants and a new place to focus his wrath and make his base feel aggrieved.History teaches us that there is no reason to assume that the Democrats\u2019 successes this year will lead to a return to power in 2020.Nothing can undo the damage that Trump has already done and will continue to inflict, including the stacking of SCOTUS and lower courts with justices that will turn back the clock on hard-won rights for generations to come. And there\u2019s no reason to hope that the deep divisions in our country won\u2019t deepen and become even more bitter and violent.We now know two sobering facts: Most of Trump\u2019s voters don\u2019t have buyer\u2019s remorse, and voting patterns don\u2019t radically change when everyone shows up to vote. The election confirmed that we can\u2019t blame our country\u2019s divisions on voter apathy or foreign agents: This is just who we are right now.Most of the media is characterizing the Democratic Party\u2019s gains in the House as signs of Democratic revival. However, the party that does not have the White House almost always gains dramatically in the midterms.I choose to believe having the Dems in charge of the House COULD be good for America and the Republican Party, but it really depends on the Dem leadership and the tone they want to start with.Ideally, there could be old-fashioned deal making across the aisle to advance both agendas. This is no doubt a long shot.There is no way that last night was a big victory for Trump OR Republicans, and he knows it. The only silver lining for Trump is that the Senate stayed in Republican hands, but that is more a reflection of electoral circumstance than anything else.As a Canadian we are shocked at how deeply polarized the U.S. is. Uncivil and uncompromising. Sad to see. I hope the U.S. finds its way.In spite of the deep division and rancor separating the two parties and the nation, I would hope that the Democrats at least attempt to take the high road and sincerely reach across the aisle for the good of the country.I\u2019m really happy! Dems took the House, and I\u2019m ready to push back against Trump, our only president unwilling to be president for all the people. His approach to governing has been unconscionable in that respect.The 2018 Senate map was never good for Dems, so I\u2019m encouraged by the strong showing of several major candidates. In 2020, the Senate map favors Dems. Lots of new Dem governors. This is not a time to despair, it\u2019s time to seize this day and move forward!I was an organizer for Amy McGrath\u2019s campaign in Kentucky\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Amy\u2019s loss was crushing, but I still have hope for Kentucky. My state is changing; that Amy could come so close to winning in a district that voted heavily for Trump is inspiring. I am 18 years old. Many of my peers have become politicized by this race, and we don\u2019t plan to stop fighting any time soon.\u2014 Eliana Shapere, Lexington, Ky.You asked \u201chow do I feel?\u201d Having worked hard to help flip a neighboring congressional district, I got up this morning and felt like an elite marathon runner who trains for months and years. I feel like I won last night, but I didn\u2019t achieve a personal best. That opportunity lies ahead and I will just have to keep training for 2020.\u2014 Jon Hinebauch.

China seems to have assumed the role, but with U.N. climate talks set to take place in Poland next month, there are numerous questions about the direction the Chinese will take.Worryingly for countries that used to rely on Washington to push for a strong climate agreement, Beijing\u2019s influence could steer the Paris agreement toward a slower pace of climate action, with more flexible rules for developing countries.These days, he uses the same ideas but aims them at China, not Japan. Personal grudges against Beijing may have played a role, as the WSJ points out:Mr. Trump\u2019s observations on China \u2014 based on his own experiences and stories from friends and business associates \u2014 gave his old views on trade a new urgency. He could find only Chinese glass and furniture for his buildings, despite looking for U.S.-made versions, he complained. The Trump Organization failed in at least four attempts at property deals in China. He struggled to secure trademarks in the country for the coveted Trump name.That may mean an end to his trade fight with Beijing won\u2019t come soon.

{"Headline": "The Democrats Won the House. Now What? ", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor starters, pick policy battles wisely.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.With the House of Representatives in Democrats\u2019 control, the next two years will give them the opportunity to show that there\u2019s a better model of legislating, that Congress is capable of doing more for Americans than cutting taxes for the wealthy and menacing everyone else\u2019s health care. Now and again Democratic leaders may need to play constitutional hardball \u2014\u00a0and they\u2019ll have a chance to do it in a more constructive fashion than Mitch McConnell and his team, who have dominated Congress since 2014. Even as Democratic House members are picking the confetti from their hair, one thought should be foremost in their minds: How do they avoid screwing things up?They are also causes for which the president has explicitly expressed his own enthusiasm, whether real or feigned. This gives Democrats the chance to press President Trump about whether he is interested in making progress on his stated goals or is a hypocrite intent on waging partisan trench warfare for the remainder of his term. First up on the Democrats\u2019 agenda is expected to be the reform package. But they also plan to move quickly to address the plight of the Dreamers, some 700,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children and granted protection from deportation by President Barack Obama. Huge majorities of Americans support letting the Dreamers stay. Finding a compromise path with Mr. Trump would be good policy and good politics.Of course, even if the president is interested in chalking up a few bipartisan wins, the Republican Senate is unlikely to play along. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Democrats pursuing legislation, such as to raise the minimum wage, that fills out their governing priorities even if, for now, it does little more than clarify the contrasts between their priorities and their opposition\u2019s. Avoid the \u201cI\u201d word for now.Democrats would do well to wait and see if the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, turns up high crimes and misdemeanors before deciding whether to pursue the painful and divisive path of impeachment. If so, they\u2019ll want to bring along at least some of their Republican colleagues.It has been a long two years for Democrats, watching Republicans fail to check Trumpian excesses. Which means the new majority might be tempted to overreach and, like Mr. Gingrich\u2019s professed revolutionaries, wind up coming across as more partisan and prurient than public-spirited. Investigations should be strategic and methodical and clearly in the public interest \u2014 for instance, looking into corruption among cabinet officials or waste of taxpayer dollars, rather than targeting more lascivious matters, like hush-money payments to former mistresses.The topic of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns will be especially ticklish. The president\u2019s refusal to follow his predecessors\u2019 example and release such basic information raises too many questions about conflicts of interest to ignore. But things could get ugly. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has the right to request a copy, at which point the White House must decide if it wants to mount a legal challenge. Democrats need to be ready to make a cogent case \u2014 persuasive to the public as well as the courts \u2014 for why Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes are a matter of critical concern.Groom the party\u2019s next leaders. The widespread assumption in Democratic circles is that Nancy Pelosi will reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel. Practically speaking, this may be for the best, but even Ms. Pelosi has begun referring to herself as a \u201ctransitional\u201d leader.Love her or hate her, nobody herds the cats better than Ms. Pelosi.Given the dismal example set so far by President Trump, Democratic leaders now have a political opportunity, and also a heavy responsibility. Winning the House is one thing. Restoring some sanity to American politics and a sense of higher, common purpose to American governance is yet another. Advertisement"}

The anxiety that I always carry around was finally lifting.While I\u2019m not afraid of dying, I\u2019m terrified of losing the people I love. Eventually, death will separate them from me, and I have no idea how or when. None of us do. If we abide by objective time, we are temporary passengers on a bizarre machine that does not care about our driving urge to love the people we love longer than forever. It moves how it moves. Love feels eternal, yet we, in this bodily form, at least, are finite. It doesn\u2019t add up.The way our staggered microcosms of time and space play out, my people are at home on the East Coast of the United States, safe in their beds, while I\u2019m going about my daily routine in Southeast Asia. I don\u2019t have to worry about their getting into a car accident, because they\u2019re under the covers sleeping. I don\u2019t have to fear they\u2019ll fall and injure their heads, because they\u2019re not upright and walking. Conversely, when they\u2019re awake and animated, out in the dangerous world, sleep numbs my anxiety.Also, I\u2019m ahead of the people I love in time. If time occurs the way I perceive it, I live in a reality that exists before theirs, where nothing unfortunate can touch them. Here in Malaysia, I venture into the amorphous future before they do. A tragic event will not befall them as long as I\u2019m ahead of it. Death can never catch up.The other night over FaceTime, my 6-year-old nephew asked why it was dark where I was in Malaysia and light where he was in the United States. I said to imagine a giant flashlight shining down on earth. I told him it takes a day for our planet to rotate, a year to revolve. \u201cThe light can\u2019t touch everything at once,\u201d I said. I\u2019m well aware that my theory is a strategy, that in my attempt to shirk time and prevent death from robbing me of my loved ones, I am merely deceiving myself. And of course, I realize that all this does not protect my fianc\u00e9, here in the same time zone. I\u2019d protect him myself, but it\u2019s not easy when he\u2019s out in the Malaysian jungle shooting a movie, texting me that there are four men with shotguns and machetes to defend him and his crew from snakes, leopards and boars. He sends me a photo of a baby king cobra they caught, trapped in a water bottle, its eyes lidless, its mouth agape. Not today, snake, not today.I know there is no trick or tool that will shield anyone I love, not with my hands, nor with time\u2019s. So I wait up, I wait up late for my fianc\u00e9 to return to our temporary apartment, our shared temporal space. It gets so late that it\u2019s peak of day for my parents. As we FaceTime, I watch the light from yesterday\u2019s sun drift toward the screen. It reaches and forms a protective sash across my mother\u2019s chest, like spectral armor. Like time\u2019s seatbelt; holding her still, locking us in.\u201cNow he\u2019s gone slightly ahead of me again, leaving this strange world. That doesn\u2019t mean anything. For us believing physicists this separation between past, present and future has the value of mere illusion, however tenacious.\u201dI\u2019ll buy into time when I have to; that I must. But in the meantime, I\u2019ll continue to hope and imagine we will always have one another, no matter how delusional and tenacious it may seem.It is late in Malaysia, and eventually, I sleep. In the middle of the night I feel my fianc\u00e9\u2019s arm drape over my waist. For the moment, we\u2019re safe.When we wake, the sun is high and the sky is azure and gray again.Advertisement"}

Too often, political figures simply blame the other side \u2014 or at least someone besides themselves.While it\u2019s human nature to blame someone, what happened here is far bigger than any postelection spin, given that it has been more than 40 years since a Democrat has held this seat, which runs along South Carolina\u2019s coast and leans Republican by 10 points. In fact, there was not a more conservative district in the country to flip to the Democrats.

Both contestants were well financed, and you saw the same midterm drag on the Republican side that you saw in other congressional races. But three things made this race different \u2014 things that could prove instructive for Republicans, if we choose to look at them.One, the environment matters to voters. As a party, we have somehow forgotten that conservatism should apply to more than just financial resources. Being conservative should entail being conservative with natural resources, too. I\u2019ve always believed this \u2014 so much so that the Sierra Club endorsed me in my race for re-election as governor. Not so many years ago, I was hardly an outlier. But the Republican playbook has changed, and it damages Republicans in suburban districts.In the primary, Ms. Arrington criticized my stand against offshore drilling and my disagreement with President Trump\u2019s plan to repeal a moratorium on offshore drilling \u2014 a moratorium that has held under Republican and Democratic presidents for 37 years. She attempted to pivot away from this stand in the general election, but voters didn\u2019t forget, and Mr. Cunningham was able to use it as a wedge issue. As Republicans, we\u2019ve drifted from our roots. The party, in fact, has a remarkable legacy on conservation and the environment \u2014 and this race suggests we should recommit ourselves to it.Two, financial irresponsibility proved a drag. Even in a hyperpartisan world, you still need reasons for traditional conservatives like myself to show up. It\u2019s got to be more than the blue team is bad. One of the underpinnings of the Republican Party has long been financial responsibility, but here, again, the party has drifted. The president has done very little to trim the size of the federal government or entitlement spending, even as he asks for more money for corn farmers hit by his tariffs. That\u2019s hardly motivating for a traditional conservative. We need to once again be the party of not just lower taxes, but less spending.Third, civility is important. What happened to Ronald Reagan\u2019s notion of being a happy warrior? Like his policies or not, he was pleasant. He smiled. He joked. He played to optimism rather than fear. He and Tip O\u2019Neill, the Democratic speaker of the House, had a famously strong working relationship despite their political differences.The Republican Party that so many of us care deeply about continues to be held hostage these days, and what I saw last week in a district I grew up in and know well is that there is a half-life to insults, bullying and an embrace of a post-truth world.I heard it from young soccer moms and longtime Republican voters alike. They don\u2019t want to condone behavior that is counter to what they\u2019ve taught their children.In this district, my former opponent adopted Mr. Trump\u2019s highly combative style. It worked in the primary, but it fell flat in the general election. Mr. Cunningham presented himself as warm and affable. Republicans got a wake-up call last week. But will we wake up?My party would be wise to take a step back from President Trump\u2019s approach to politics. We should renew our commitment to tenets like environmental conservation and financial responsibility. We should run from the president\u2019s zero-sum approach to politics. These are not revolutionary ideas. But adhering to the simple approaches of kindness and respect, principles that have long guided society, could these days be groundbreaking.Mark Sanford is a Republican representative from South Carolina.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Party Time ", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federalist Society\u2019s celebration of Brett Kavanaugh is a reminder that social control can shape the way justices approach their jobs. Contributing Opinion WriterThe Federalist Society celebrated the four Supreme Court justices in attendance at its annual gala in Washington last week, including the newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who received a minute-long ovation when his name was announced. Justice Gorsuch was there again this year, along with two other Federalist Society regulars, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr. One of the dinner speakers, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, acknowledged the obvious when he said to laughter and applause: \u201cSome have accused President Trump of outsourcing his judicial selection process to the Federalist Society. I say, damn right!\u201dNot actual control, obviously, but social control, the not so subtle message of the evening being: We\u2019ve been here for you, and we expect you to be here for us. If you want to come back, don\u2019t disappoint us.Can social control of that sort really matter to a life-tenured Supreme Court justice who has already achieved everything an ambitious lawyer could possibly want? Well, yes \u2014 and to be clear, in making that claim, I\u2019m not suggesting that the desire for continued acceptance by one\u2019s social network is a trait that afflicts only conservative judges. But the network that counts now is the one that has finally captured the Supreme Court.It\u2019s a fresh observation of an old phenomenon. It often surprises people to learn, for example, that Roe v. Wade was a 7-to-2 decision, with the majority opinion joined by three of the four appointees of President Richard Nixon. Viewed from the perspective of today\u2019s freighted abortion discourse, the court\u2019s bipartisan consensus sounds barely plausible 45 years later. Though hardly the sole explanation for the court\u2019s decision, it\u2019s significant that by the time the court ruled, the elites of the legal, public health and medical professions \u2014 the justices\u2019 professional and social peers, in other words \u2014 had been calling for abortion\u2019s decriminalization for years.The chief justice took a bullet for the court, and I gather he is still paying a price for it within the social network that would ordinarily be his comfortable home. Will he ever do it again? Will any of the four justices who were feted last week by the Federalist Society try it even once? That was the crucial unasked question as the cheering died away and the justices and their friends departed into the icy Washington night.Advertisement"}

But lately, they have told me, in plain English, that my opinions and standards (from my education at a parochial school and military academy) don\u2019t count for much. The last time we had dinner, they talked over me and generally excluded me from the conversation. My opinions were dismissed, and my values were derided.

Better yet, ask the women what they find troubling. Then listen closely.We all have a right to our opinions, of course. But one of the interesting shifts in the past few years has been a greater public awareness of who feels entitled to speak up and expect their views to be heard \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t. You may not suffer from blind privilege, but it\u2019s a question worth considering. (Otherwise, why has this problem surfaced only recently?)If you have been holding the Talking Stick for too long, perhaps the women have become impatient for their turns. So, share it! And especially because they are so dear to you, make an effort to understand how their views differ from yours. In my experience, the respect in that gesture is often reciprocated.Ten years ago, I was asked to be a bridesmaid in two of my best friends\u2019 weddings. Just before the weddings, the brides told me that I could not bring my partner as my date because he would make guests uncomfortable. He was significantly older than me. I declined to go without him; the brides were furious with me, and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I am still devastated by this. One of the women tried to \u201cfriend\u201d me recently on Facebook.

{"Headline": "Ukraine, After Naval Clash With Russia, Considers Martial Law", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A dispute between Ukraine and Russia in which each accuses the other of violating laws of the sea escalated sharply on Sunday when the Ukrainian Navy said the Russian military opened fire on several of its ships, wounding six sailors, and seized the vessels.The incident in and around the Kerch Strait, a narrow body of water separating the Black and Azov Seas, marked a pivot in the undeclared war, now nearly five years old, between the former members of the Soviet Union.The Ukrainian military has been fighting two separatist movements in eastern Ukraine that are clearly backed by Moscow, though the Russian government has formally denied any direct military intervention.That is in contrast to Sunday\u2019s events, which unfolded as a direct confrontation between Russia and Western-backed Ukrainian armed forces at sea.At a midnight meeting, Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council said it would ask Parliament to declare martial law. That raised alarms that President Petro O. Poroshenko could use the incident to delay a presidential election scheduled for March that polls suggest he is unlikely to win.\u201cThis whole story grows more complicated by the fact that during martial law, it is forbidden to hold presidential, parliamentary or local elections, as well as strikes, protests, rallies and mass actions,\u201d Mustafa Nayyem, a member of Parliament, posted on Facebook.The Ukrainian Navy left little ambiguity in asserting that its ships had been attacked. \u201cFighter jets used weapons against the naval ships of the armed forces of Ukraine,\u201d the navy\u2019s statement said.Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, a law enforcement agency known as the F.S.B. that oversees the Coast Guard, initially issued a statement saying the Ukrainian ships had, after an altercation, altered course to return to a Ukrainian port. But it later said that Russia had detained the vessels and that it was providing first aid to three sailors.The F.S.B. said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that the Ukrainian naval convoy of two small warships and a tugboat had entered Russian territorial waters near Crimea on Sunday in a \u201cprovocation.\u201d The Russian Coast Guard responded by trying to escort them out of the area, it said.\u201cTheir goal is clear,\u201d the F.S.B. said of the Ukrainian naval ships, \u201cto create a conflict situation in the region.\u201dThe Russian reports said the Ukrainian ships disregarded announcements that the Kerch Strait was temporarily closed.The portion of the Black Sea where the confrontation unfolded is a swirl of contested borders and disputed rights to access through the strait.After annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, Russia claimed territorial waters off the peninsula\u2019s coast that Ukraine does not recognize.Ukraine claims a right to patrol in the entire Sea of Azov under a treaty with Russia designating the sea as shared territorial water. The treaty was signed long before relations curdled after street protesters overthrew a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine in 2014.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a statement carried by the Ukrainian news media, came down on Ukraine\u2019s side in the dispute. \u201cNATO fully supports the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity, including its rights to navigation in its own territorial waters,\u201d said the statement, which was carried in the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda.Photographs and videos posted online showed a Russian cargo ship moored in the shipping channel of the strait, blocking it, and fighter jets buzzing over the waterway.Blocking the strait, Ukrainian officials say, has been Russia\u2019s intent since earlier this year, when tensions escalated over Ukrainian shipping into and out of the Sea of Azov, home to important steel and coal ports.Earlier in the day, a Russian Coast Guard vessel rammed one of the Ukrainian ships, the tugboat, according to the Ukraine Navy. The small Ukrainian convoy was sailing from Odessa in the Black Sea to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov.Ukraine\u2019s Parliament speaker, Iryna Gerashchenko, said on Facebook that Ukraine had asked the United Nations Security Council to review the Kerch Strait incident. \u201cWe have a direct armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u201cOur marine space is being attacked.\u201dTensions in the Sea of Azov escalated this spring after Russia completed a bridge across the strait, which links the Crimea Peninsula and mainland Russia. The Russian Coast Guard began inspections of Ukrainian commercial traffic to the coal and steel ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk.Since then, Ukrainian officials say, Russia has moved some naval vessels, including warships, from its Caspian Flotilla to the Sea of Azov and inspected more than 200 foreign merchant ships, mostly Ukrainian.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}

Yes, Beto O\u2019Rourke lost to Ted Cruz, 51-48 percent, an outcome that surprised almost no seasoned politicos around these parts \u2014 they\u2019ve been predicting it for months, some since the congressman from El Paso first announced his candidacy last year. Rest assured that the Monday-morning quarterbacking will proceed apace starting \u2026 now.In fact, it kind of started last Sunday, Nov. 4, with a lengthy critique in Politico that quoted mostly Republican operatives \u2014 Karl Rove, back from the dead \u2014 who cited Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s failure to tack toward the middle, instead doing crazy things (in Texas, at least) like supporting the N.F.L. players who took a knee to protest police brutality. \u201cDid Beto Blow It?\u201d was the pre-emptory headline.But before all of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s errors are carved in stone in the next few hours, maybe it\u2019s worth taking a minute to say that, whatever his flaws, Mr. O\u2019Rourke came very close to defeating a powerful incumbent \u2014 O.K., not one who was exactly beloved \u2014 and he did it pretty much as he promised, without going negative and by raising a whole bunch of money without the help of PACs or fancy political consultants. (The early fears that Mr. O\u2019Rourke would be eclipsed by Mr. Cruz\u2019s millions in dark money never materialized; Mr. Cruz raised $40 million to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s $70 million.)He was the first Democratic candidate in a very long time to engage new voters in Texas \u2014 women, young people, people of color \u2014 many of whom who had given up on the political process. Yesterday, my 52-year-old Uber driver showed me his first-ever voter registration, and asked me what he had to do to cast his vote. He was a large man whose arms were covered in homemade tattoos, and he spent most of his days \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t working \u2014 taking care of his mother, a legal immigrant from Mexico who was terrified that somehow she would be deported. He\u2019d never voted before, but now he wanted to \u2014 \u201cfor Beto,\u201d he kept repeating, like an incantation. I saw the same passion in a sacker at my grocery store, and in countless others who organized and knocked on doors and wrote checks because they had finally found a Texas candidate who gave them something to be for instead of against. Who made them feel they mattered.Maybe this was a failed campaign to the experts, but for a lot of people, myself included, there was a lot of good in it: a chance to see the Texas I\u2019ve always known was there \u2014 a place where working people and immigrants still have the right to thrive alongside those with much more; a place where we aren\u2019t so devastatingly divided; a place where people are energized by the political process because they saw a way to make a difference. Mr. O\u2019Rourke gave Texans who have long felt disenfranchised a glimpse of what could be, and I hope they don\u2019t take his defeat as a sign that victory is beyond their grasp.It wasn\u2019t all for nothing: The enthusiasm for Mr. O\u2019Rourke most likely helped less glamorous and less moneyed candidates win down the ballot. The youthful attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher beat the self-satisfied Republican Congressman John Culberson, who had represented West Houston since 2001. In North Dallas, the Democrat Colin Allred, a black former N.F.L. player and civil rights attorney, defeated the Republican Pete Sessions, who had held office for 22 years, was chairman of the House Rules Committee and had sworn vengeance on Obamacare. Maria Teresa Kumar, the president of Voto Latino, which mobilizes Latino voters, tonight said that her organizations saw a 500 percent increase in registration among young Latino voters in Texas, the state that previously had the lowest voter participation of all.It\u2019s also true that many of the same politicos who had been hanging crepe for Mr. O\u2019Rourke for months now suggest that, for him, this is the beginning, not the end. Most likely he will run for the Senate again in 2020, this time against the Republican who decides to run for the seat John Cornyn is expected to vacate. Most Texans know that when you fall off a horse, the best thing to do is get right back on again.Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017.

Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year.

The alliance issued a statement condemning Russian forces for impounding Ukrainian vessels on Sunday \u2014 as the European Union did on Wednesday when it announced that the bloc would not impose sanctions \u2014 but NATO commanders have said entering the Sea of Azov is unlikely: It is not considered international waters.Ukrainian officials say Russia is disregarding that treaty and asserting control over the Sea of Azov and whittling away at Ukrainian sovereignty.Russian officials say that is not the case, adding and that the episode on Sunday turned violent because the Ukrainian ships had failed to follow protocols for entering the strait, such as notifying the Russian Coast Guard in advance.The dispute continued to simmer on Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s minister of infrastructure, Volodymyr Omelyan, wrote on Facebook that Russia was blocking 35 ships from entering or leaving the Kerch Strait in a de facto blockade of two Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov: Mariupol and Berdyansk.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, said that the waterway was open for Ukrainian shipping but that the authorities might temporarily close it during rough seas.The commander of the Ukrainian Navy suggested that countries retaliate against Russia by closing the Bosporus in Turkey to Russian military traffic, citing a 1930s treaty that might justify such a move. This, too, seemed unlikely: Russia uses the waterway to supply its military forces in Syria, and although Turkey and Russia back opposite sides in the Syrian civil war, Turkey has allowed this traffic.Mr. Poroshenko also said on Thursday that he would close the land border on the isthmus of the Crimean Peninsula, between Ukraine and Russian-annexed territory, to all foreigners, preventing Russians from entering the area overland via Ukraine.In the Bild interview, Mr. Poroshenko said that NATO could help enforce Ukraine\u2019s rights to navigation. \u201cGermany is one of our closest allies,\u201d he said, \u201cand we hope that states within NATO are now ready to relocate naval ships to the Sea of Azov in order to assist Ukraine and provide security.\u201dThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, responded on Thursday by saying that there was \u201cno military solution\u201d to the dispute.The conflict at sea was \u201centirely the doing of the Russian president,\u201d Ms. Merkel said in remarks broadcast by the BBC, adding, \u201cissues like these can only be solved by sensible dialogue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Can Teach an Old-Vine Grape New Tricks", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolIn California, a handful of popular grapes accounts for an overwhelming proportion of the state\u2019s vineyard acreage. These grapes \u2014 cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, zinfandel, merlot, pinot noir, syrah and sauvignon blanc \u2014 dominate production and the perception of California wines.Yet some of the most satisfying California wines today are made by producers working outside this mainstream.Some gravitated toward lesser-known grapes simply because they were interested in making different sorts of wines. Others did not own vineyards and lacked the means to buy the better-known but more expensive grapes.Regardless of their motivation, winemakers who have adopted these scorned grapes have provided a necessary counterbalance to what had become a stultifying lack of diversity among California wines.Unlike in Europe \u2014 where, in many regions, decisions about which grapes to plant were culturally preordained \u2014 Californians faced no such restrictions. Without traditions or local grapes, they could choose whatever they desired.Beginning roughly in the 1960s, American winemakers began to narrow down their preferred varieties. Robert Mondavi and others, eager to lift the image of California wine, ambitiously aimed to compete with the best wine regions in the world, which back then they identified as Bordeaux, where cabernet sauvignon and merlot are the leading grapes for reds, and Burgundy, for white wine, where chardonnay rules.These grapes, along with a handful of others, came to dominate California wines. At the high end, they could indeed produce world-class bottles. Because of their popularity and the critical acclaim, large producers of inexpensive wines sought to mimic them, using the same set of grapes \u2014 along with technology and other manipulations \u2014 to make dull, contrived imitations.As homogeneous as California wine may have seemed, the state always had the potential for greater diversity. Before cabernet, chardonnay and the rest were hard-wired into the industry, California was growing far more different sorts of grapes: riesling, s\u00e9millon, grenache, valdigui\u00e9, gamay noir and many others, and that was just in Napa alone.Trousseau, picpoul, ribolla gialla, palomino, refosco and counoise are among them. Several less obscure Mediterranean grapes, like mourv\u00e8dre, cinsault and carignan, have also gained a toehold.This is why we spent the last month tasting California carignan here at Wine School.We have nothing but respect for the grapes that made California\u2019s wine fortune. But we have seen the need, particularly among moderately priced bottles, for wines that did not masquerade as something they were not. That is why wines like California carignan, presented straightforwardly without pretense, are so exciting.Each represents a modern expression of carignan \u2014 immediately accessible, friendly and soulful, delicious and drinkable, yet not simple. Still, the wines clearly differ from one another. While the intents of the three producers were somewhat similar, they achieved their goals through different methods.The one thing these producers have in common is that they all use grapes from very old vines \u2014 65-plus years for Porter Creek and Lioco, and 100-plus years for Broc \u2014 from vineyards that survived or ignored the wholesale purge of grapes considered too proletarian for most California winemakers.Older vines are less vigorous than younger vines, and so are thought to produce grapes of greater concentration and potential quality. This is an issue with carignan, which, when young, produces very high yields resulting in insipid wines.In the ordinary production of red wine, grapes (with or without their stems) are crushed and put in some sort of vat, where the juice eventually begins to ferment as yeast transforms the grape sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide.In semi-carbonic maceration, uncrushed grape bunches are piled into vats filled with carbon dioxide. The bottom grapes are crushed by the weight of those on top and begin to ferment, but the uncrushed grapes in the airless environment also begin a different sort of intracellular fermentation.Eventually, a conventional fermentation is completed, but the process generally yields a wine that is light, fresh and fruity, with diminished tannins. That\u2019s an important point with a grape like carignan, which can be quite tannic.The Broc carignan was easygoing and relaxed, rich but not heavy, with aromas and flavors of red fruits, herbs, spices and flowers, and a savory, almost salty edge to it, which made the wine deliciously refreshing.The Lioco had a lot in common with the Broc. Matt and Sara Licklider, the Lioco proprietors, generally make excellent pinot noirs and chardonnays, but they wanted to explore an heirloom variety from old vines. That led them to carignan, which Mr. Licklider said in an email allowed them to make the sort of wine they were looking for: \u201cbistro-friendly, food versatile, low cost, authentic.\u201dThe Lioco is made by a different method. Whole clusters of grapes (stems and all) are stomped \u2014 the oldest method of crushing grapes \u2014 then put into vats. The skins and stems, which generally float to the top of the grape juice to form a cap, are pushed down by a perforated steel sheet, which Mr. Licklider likened to a French-press coffee maker.Some of the grapes are not crushed by the feet, however, and these grapes do undergo a carbonic-style intracellular fermentation, which perhaps accounts for some of the similarities to the Broc carignan.The Porter Creek stood out from the other two. The winemaker, Alex Davis, has procured his organic carignan grapes from an old vineyard near Hopland in Mendocino since 2008. Like Lioco, Porter Creek is better known for its pinot noirs and chardonnays. So why carignan?\u201cIt allows me to produce a wine with a sense of soul and place that is very different from the pinot noirs that we are mostly known for,\u201d Mr. Davis said by email.Rather than leaving the bunches intact, he destems the grapes and ferments them in the conventional fashion. The result is a wine that is darker and richer than the other two, maybe a little more structured though not heavy or unpleasantly tannic. Along with a creaminess, and aromas of red fruits and herbs, the wine had delicious flavors of tobacco, licorice and what I called menthol but several readers referred to as \u201cpine.\u201dAll three of these bottles were the sort of unpretentious, everyday wines that good California winemakers have recently rediscovered. Some readers complained about the cost of these wines, $27 to $30, but sadly that often seems to be the cost of doing business in California, particularly if you want wines made with care from grapes grown conscientiously.Several readers suggested carignans from southern France or Spain, and why not? But the idea here was to learn something about California carignan.My takeaway was a reinforced conviction that many grapes like carignan, once scorned or written off, have great potential to make delightful wines. They may not necessarily compete with the best wines in the world, but as the philosophers say, a pursuit of the best should not be the enemy of the good.Advertisement"}

Intellectually honest conservatives \u2014 the six or seven who remain, at any rate \u2014 need to say this, loudly. His appointment represents an unprecedented assault on the integrity and reputation of the Justice Department, the advice and consent function of the Senate, and the rule of law in the United States.How so? A first-pass list:That makes Gonzales the intellectual equivalent of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. next to Whitaker, whose legal credentials include a little more than a year at the Justice Department as Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, a couple of unsuccessful political runs in Iowa, a stint as a U.S. attorney, and work at regional law firms. Never in the history of the Justice Department has so much rested on the shoulders of someone who can boast of so little.But if Whitaker\u2019s appointment is legal thanks to the Vacancies Reform Act, it\u2019s, ahem, barely legal. Acting A.G.\u2019s are typically placeholders, previously confirmed to deputy-level positions, who serve in office for a few days pending Senate approval of a successor. Whitaker is being installed for what could be a seven-month term, and perhaps twice as long.

Fight Over Nancy Pelosi.", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust get it out of your systems now, please.Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board.The feud over who will be the next speaker of the House is heating up, as allies of the longtime Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, take on a rowdy band of rebels pushing for regime change.To which I feel moved to reply: Bollocks. For the sake of the new majority, now is precisely the time for squabbling over the shape and direction of the caucus \u2014 though Mr. Ryan should seriously rethink his talking points.With a large freshman class on its way and the Democratic Party in the midst of a roaring debate about its core values, there will, of course, be clashes about who will have what kind of influence in the caucus, and which voices will lead the way. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the member-elect representing parts of the Bronx and Queens, does not share the political style or the priorities of Representative Conor Lamb, who was first elected in a special election in March from a decidedly Trumpy corner of Pennsylvania. Many incoming Democrats ran on the promise of disrupting the status quo. And there\u2019s a wide range of views about the degree to which the party should try to work with President Trump on issues of shared interest versus pursuing a path of total resistance. Members old and new need to air their grievances, hash out their differences and set a course for how the team can better function over the next two sure-to-be-bonkers years.All of these ideas, and more, should be worked through while the caucus is getting organized and hammering out the rules of engagement for the coming Congress. While some will argue that it is risky, or even wrong, for members to leverage their votes for speaker to get concerns taken seriously, the reality is that this is how the game is played.Change is hard. Change in Congress can be darn near impossible. And convincing powerful members who have been well-served by the existing system to tinker with that system requires more than a gentle nudge.Why shouldn\u2019t reformers press their issues now, when they have influence with leadership? While Ms. Pelosi is seeking their support, they can lobby for rule changes to empower the rank-and-file, to reform how chairmanships are assigned, to put in place programs aimed at nurturing young talent \u2014 or maybe even to extract a promise that she will step gracefully aside in 2020.Ms. Pelosi is a wily negotiator \u2014 one of the wiliest. She is not going to get rolled. But history shows that she does need a shove now and again to get her to embrace change. Better to have as many of these fights as possible before the new Congress convenes in January. At that point, the caucus will need to get focused and pull together for the real fights to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A \u2018Perfectly Imperfect\u2019 Life: The Victims of the California Wildfires", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In many ways, the story of Ernie Foss runs right alongside the narrative of the state he loved, California. He was a surfer and skateboarder as a young man. He grew up in San Francisco and worked at a store in the hippie heyday of Haight-Ashbury, selling candles and crystals, a job that allowed him to pursue his passion of music. And then tech money flooded the city, his neighborhood was gentrified, and like so many others he was priced out.He left San Francisco a decade ago and settled down in Paradise, Calif., near the woods. By then, he was sick and bedridden and often in pain, but he never stopped thinking of San Francisco. A few months ago he sent his daughter, Angela Loo, on a mission: to go back to the city and take videos of his favorite places, so he could see how they had changed.\u201cHis San Francisco roots were very important to him,\u201d Ms. Loo said. \u201cIt\u2019s where he got into music. And did his thing and where he raised his kids. It\u2019s his hometown and he loved it very much and he missed it all the time.\u201dThose videos were some of the last glimpses of the city for Mr. Foss, who died at 63 a few days ago in the wildfire that reduced Paradise to ash. His body was found outside his home, near his minivan, in what Ms. Loo believes was a desperate attempt to escape with his stepson Andrew Burt, his caretaker, as the flames engulfed the street. Mr. Foss\u2019s dog, Bernice, a little brown mutt he had rescued from a shelter, died there too.The Camp Fire, which tore through Paradise and its surroundings last week, has become the deadliest wildfire in modern California history, with at least 56 people confirmed dead so far. Another three people were killed in the Woolsey Fire, which raced through the mountains of Southern California near Malibu.Among those unaccounted for, although not on the list, is Mr. Burt, Ms. Loo\u2019s stepbrother.\u201cI don\u2019t have confirmation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I do have confirmation of is that he was last seen trying to help, or get help, for my dad to get him into their van, and failing at it. They just didn\u2019t make it. I can\u2019t imagine that he is alive, but we have not stopped looking. We are still calling the shelters every day. We are calling the hospitals every day.\u201dMr. Foss is among a handful of the victims whose names have been released, as authorities slowly add to the roster of the dead. Jesus Fernandez, 48, died of smoke inhalation, probably trying to rescue his dog, King. Mr. Fernandez, nicknamed Zeus, had a son who lives in Las Vegas, and was described by a friend as someone \u201cwho people counted on in rough times.\u201dAlso killed in the fire was Bill Godbout, 79, an influential figure in the early days of Silicon Valley who ran a popular electronics store. He was well-known in the hacker community, and remembered for his quirks, like his license to fly blimps. Robert Tuck, Mr. Godbout\u2019s grandson, said that Mr. Godbout had stayed behind as his wife and relatives fled, probably to save his three cats.As his family drove away, they looked back and \u201ccould see the fire coming down on the house,\u201d Mr. Tuck said through tears. \u201cHe was listening to the radio report and thought he had a little more time.\u201dAnd while the family of 58-year-old Lolene Rios has kept her listed as missing, her stepdaughter told a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle that they believed she had died trapped inside her home.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just a recovery effort,\u201d said Maria Rios, whose father Rick Rios escaped and is now recovering from severe burns on his hands and face. \u201cMy dad is in a lot of pain \u2014 he keeps saying, \u2018I have no skin, no skin.\u2019\u201dMs. Loo spoke expansively about her father \u2014 his days as a musician in San Francisco, when he was in so many blues and rock bands that she couldn\u2019t remember any of their names but one, Raine Daze. She recalled how their living room in their cottage in the Fillmore District was turned into a music studio, for recording and teaching lessons to students; how all of his recordings had been lost in the fire; and his last painful years in Paradise with lymphedema, a condition that swells the arms and legs.\u201cYou know, whenever something like this happens we tend to focus on all the positive attributes of a person,\u201d she said. \u201cGraciously ignoring all of their faults. My dad was not a perfect person. He struggled in life and was perfectly imperfect.\u201dMuch of Mr. Foss\u2019s music is lost, and so are many old photos, but there is one memento she does have: the scarf her father wore when he played music. A few years ago he said to her, \u201cI want you to take your daddy\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll scarf.\u201d She described it as \u201clike Mick Jagger\u2019s scarf.\u201dEvery few months, Ms. Loo, 43, who lives in Oregon, would travel to Paradise to clean her father\u2019s house, stock up at Costco, and fill the freezer with home-cooked meals. \u201cThey lived like men, you know, my dad and my stepbrother,\u201d she said.In Paradise, friends dropped by when they were able, and social workers and volunteers came over to keep him company, sometimes to watch his beloved 49ers or Giants with him. But over all, it was a lonely time for Mr. Foss.\u201cHe was isolated,\u201d said Ms. Loo. \u201cHe was an extrovert. He was a people person. He has been a teacher and a mentor and a friend his whole life.\u201dHe was also constantly in physical pain, something Mr. Foss wrote about in his last Facebook post, three days before he died, in which he talked about his health, and losing a wife and son in recent years.\u201cEvery day is a challenge to me physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI lost my wife six years ago and my firstborn son a little more than three years ago. I am asking for prayers and positive energy.\u201dThis is one of the lasting memories Ms. Loo has of her father, one that brought her to tears as she recounted it.Mr. Foss also had melanoma, and the few times he got out of the house and out of Paradise were when he would get his cancer treatments.A few years ago, after being brought home in an ambulance, a light rain \u2014 just a mist \u2014 began falling, and he asked to be left outside, on his gurney, so he could feel the rain and look at the trees. The mist, she said, reminded him of San Francisco.Tim Arango reported from Los Angeles. Reporting was contributed by Jose A.

Ms. Tavernise is a national correspondent for The Times.As the country catches its breath after one of the most acrimonious midterm elections in years, it would be easy to conclude that all of America is hopelessly divided \u2014 a land where two angry tribes are at each other\u2019s throats and everybody thinks about politics all the time.But the reality is far less extreme.For Ms. McDaniel, who works full time and is raising a young daughter, politics is not a hobby but an obligation to be endured \u2014 more dental appointment than ballgame. She does not know her friends\u2019 political persuasions, nor they hers, because it is not part of how they see themselves. Ms. McDaniel voted on Nov. 6, mostly for Democrats, in a church. But in an interview three days later, she said she had not checked to see who won.\u201cI prefer to be in the dark because of all of the hostility going on,\u201d she said.The ugliness of politics has turned some people off.\u201cIt\u2019s like World War I, where you\u2019re pushing each other back and forth over the same quarter-mile of ground and nothing happens,\u201d said Christopher Kershaw, 39, a logistics manager in rural New Jersey. It also found that many in the Exhausted Majority tend to see both sides.\u201cMy husband would tell you I\u2019m a devil\u2019s advocate,\u201d said Mary Linda Vetter, 71, a retired teaching assistant in Woodhull, N.Y. \u201cI\u2019m always looking at the other side of the coin.\u201dDuring the 2016 campaign, Ms. Vetter\u2019s husband would watch the conservative pundit Glenn Beck and then accuse her of not caring because she had little interest. In fact, she cares a lot. Her whole life, she has voted and volunteered \u2014 at her church and at a local nursing home, visiting residents who did not have families. But she is uncomfortable with the culture of outrage and ideological conformity.\u201cI guess I would have to say that I\u2019m completely confused as to who is lying and who is telling the truth,\u201d Ms. Vetter said. \u201cI just feel helpless.\u201dPartisanship may be at a modern high, but that doesn\u2019t mean people are happy with their political choices. The study shows that most Americans have political tastes that are not uniform: They may lean toward one party, but they see things they like in both. Its findings suggest a deep hunger for political leaders who are practical and not tribal \u2014 who do not cast the world in starkly moral terms, but in bread-and-butter policy terms.The approval of several ballot initiatives long supported by Democrats but opposed by Republicans in Republican or Republican-leaning states last week might have signaled the power of the Exhausted Majority to break partisan gridlock. Those included a measure in Florida that re-enfranchised former felons; measures in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah that expanded Medicaid; and minimum-wage measures in Arkansas and Missouri.\u201cFor the last two years it\u2019s been impossible to go to a bar on a Monday night and not have to talk about politics,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Americans are sick of that. I think you can win in 2020 by promising that if you become president, people can go back to talking about football.\u201d\u201cMore than anything, they just want to pick fights,\u201d Dr. Damon said of Democrats.

Children can create new e-mail addresses that their parents do not know about; adult strangers could obtain enough information about children to get past the site\u2019s safeguards; pornographic links spring up as quickly as they can be removed.\u201cNo measure is a panacea,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said.Go to Home Page \u00bb"}
{"Headline": "Why Do You Keep Dreaming You Forgot Your Pants? It\u2019s Science", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere your brain goes when you\u2019re asleep helps you when you\u2019re awake.Ms. Robb is the author of a new book on dreams.One muggy Saturday last summer, I went on a date with a man who seemed entirely fine. We drank two beers and went for a walk, and he explained why he liked certain buildings that we passed. We kissed, and his breath tasted like cigarettes. We parted ways, and I couldn\u2019t muster the energy to answer his emoji-laden follow-up texts about my weekend activities.The date was mediocre at best \u2014 but in the days that followed, I second-guessed my decision not to see him again. Maybe I had written him off too soon; maybe I should have given things a chance to develop. After all, he had some good qualities. He was handsome, tall, employed \u2014 and not, refreshingly, as a writer.It was only after a painfully on-the-nose dream a few weeks later that I stopped doubting my intuition. In the dream, I had agreed to a second date, and I had brought along two friends to observe our interactions and help me assess him. At the end of the group outing, my friends pulled me away and offered a unanimous decision: He wasn\u2019t for me. I had made the right call.By the time we reach adulthood, most of us have accepted the conventional wisdom: We shouldn\u2019t dwell on our dreams. Even though research suggests that REM sleep \u2014 when most dreaming takes place \u2014 is crucial for mental and physical health, we think of dreams as silly little stories, the dandruff of the brain. We\u2019re taught that talking about our dreams is juvenile, self-indulgent, and that we should shake off their traces and get on with our day.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. For the past two years, a group of my friends has been gathering every month to talk about dreams; we do it for fun. Even if we resist, dreams have a way of sneaking into conscious territory and influencing our daytime mood. In three years of reporting on the science behind dreams, I\u2019ve heard strangers describe flying, tooth loss, reunions with the dead \u2014 all the classics. I\u2019ve seen that a dream can be a fascinating window into another person\u2019s private life, and I\u2019ve learned that paying attention to dreams can help us understand ourselves.Because dreams rarely make literal sense, it can be easier to dismiss them than to try to interpret them. But a growing body of scientific work indicates that it\u2019s likely to be worth the effort. Dreams might help us consolidate new memories and prune extraneous pieces of information. They might be a breeding ground for ideas \u2014 a time for the brain to experiment in a wider network of associations. Some argue they\u2019re an accident of biology and mean nothing at all. For an evolutionary psychologist like Dr. Revonsuo, this presents a puzzle: Why would our minds subject us to something so consistently unpleasant? If our ancestors could practice dealing with dangerous situations as they slept, he reasoned, they might have an advantage when it came time to confront them in the day.Even if the person fails in the dream, the test seems familiar in real life \u2014 and the illusion of familiarity can translate into a real advantage. My own exam dreams are simultaneously boring to reproduce and pulse-quickening to remember. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the test center and realize I forgot to write any essays.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m taking my exams and then I remember I\u2019m not wearing pants.\u201dThese nightmares come years after I\u2019ve left school, but they pop up when I\u2019m worried about something else, like a looming deadline. Some psychologists believe that in times of stress, we dream about exams that we actually succeeded in; our brains are reminding us of a time when we prevailed over something we had feared, boosting our confidence.In reality, I wore clothes to my college finals and didn\u2019t leave them blank. But mulling over the worst-case scenarios in the light of day forces me to recognize how unlikely, even ridiculous, they are; confronting them saps them of their power to terrify and even makes me laugh. I wake with a sigh of relief \u2014 no matter how unprepared I feel for this meeting, at least I won\u2019t turn up naked.I spend a lot of time these days raving about the value of dreams, and I sometimes meet people who protest: They don\u2019t remember their dreams. But most people can improve their dream recall just by reminding themselves before bed that they want to, or \u2014 better yet \u2014 committing to write down their dreams in the morning. When I started keeping a dream journal, I couldn\u2019t believe how quickly the entries grew from brief, tentative snippets (\u201cI am watching the \u2018Nutcracker\u2019?\u201d \u201cThere is a spider?\u201d) to convoluted stories featuring characters like a literary rival named Alice Robby and a cat that had lived in my wall for 20 years.If dreams are so important, and if so many of their functions depend on our understanding them, why do they often seem incomprehensible? Why do they traffic in garbled metaphors and disjointed images? We tend to focus on and discuss dreams that are strange, but most dreams are less bizarre than we might assume. In the 1960s, after analyzing more than 600 dream reports from labs in Brooklyn and Bethesda, Md., Frederick Snyder, a psychologist, concluded that \u201cdreaming consciousness\u201d was in fact \u201ca remarkably faithful replica of waking life.\u201d In his sample, 38 percent of the settings were real places that dreamers recognized from their lives; another 43 percent resembled places they knew.Just 5 percent were considered \u201cexotic,\u201d and less than 1 percent counted as \u201cfantastic.\u201d When Dr. Snyder scored each dream report on various measures of coherence \u2014 whether the story made sense or whether the events could conceivably take place \u2014 he found that as many as nine out of 10 \u201cwould have been considered credible descriptions of everyday experience;\u201d even among the longest dreams, half lacked so much as a single bizarre element.Nonetheless, the fact remains that on some nights, our brains spin scenes that are far-fetched at the very least. In the 1990s, three researchers \u2014 Robert Stickgold, Allan Hobson and Cynthia Rittenhouse \u2014 set out to study whether there were any constraints on the dreaming imagination. After analyzing 97 discontinuities in 200 of their students\u2019 dreams, they found that there were, in fact, rules and patterns at play. Dreams aren\u2019t governed by the normal laws of physics, and many aspects of dreaming remain mysterious. We can\u2019t explain why a certain image strikes on a given night or predict whether some long-lost friend will ever resurface in our sleep. But dreams aren\u2019t a free-for-all, either. Intraclass metamorphoses were much more common than interclass ones; that is, when a dream character transformed, it would usually assume the guise of another character rather than an inanimate object (and vice versa). And even within classes, the transformations were far from random: A pool became a beach; an uncle turned into a neighbor; a car changed into a bike. \u201cThe most surprising and novel finding of this study is that many discontinuous dream images are paradoxically coherent,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cA dream object does not transform randomly into another object, but into an object that shares formal associative qualities with the first.\u201dIn another study, Dr. Revonsuo and Dr. Christina Salmivalli, a psychologist, analyzed hundreds of dreams from a group of their students and discovered that the emotions in dreams were usually appropriate to the situation, even if the situation itself was odd. And another important element was surprisingly constant: The dreamer\u2019s own self was \u201cwell preserved\u201d and \u201crarely plagued by features incongruous with waking reality.\u201d \u201cThe representation of self is presumably one of the fundamental cornerstones of our long-term memory systems,\u201d they explained.Even in dreams, we know who we are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Facebook Movie Told Us What We Needed to Know About Mark Zuckerberg", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorEverything we needed to know about Facebook was right in front of our faces, on the big screen, in 2010.Come with me on this journey back in time, to the AMC Mountainside 10, on Route 22 in New Jersey, where I first saw \u201cThe Social Network.\u201dAt the time, I was rooting for the young Mark Zuckerberg to get the better of the people trying to hold him back. He was an unusual movie protagonist, introverted and inconsiderate, but wasn\u2019t it time for the geeks to take the power from the old guard? For the underdogs to beat the establishment?His journey to moguldom began ignobly, with Facemash.com, a meanspirited site that encouraged his fellow male students at Harvard College to rate women on campus by their looks.Every movie needs foils, and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the director David Fincher found theirs in a pair of well-heeled alpha males, the Winklevoss twins.But now, the Winklevii don\u2019t seem quite so bad. Weren\u2019t they, after all, the first of many to be run over by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ambitions?Watching this origin story unfold from stadium seating eight years ago, I thought I was seeing a series of hard lessons learned as a callow 19-year-old came of age. Streaming it in 2018, I saw something else: the beginning of a pattern that has become all too familiar.Facebook, which had no comment on Sunday, has responded defensively.\u201cThe reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said on Thursday, \u201cis that you\u2019re not going to know everything that\u2019s going on.\u201dNothing was more at variance with their promises of transparency than The Times\u2019s revelation that the company had hired Definers Public Affairs, whose founders are known in Republican circles as lords of the so-called \u201cdark arts\u201d of political opposition research.In his recent remarks, Mr. Zuckerberg told reporters that Facebook had gotten rid of Definers and that neither he nor Ms. Sandberg knew about its tactics. Yet he still felt it necessary to say that highlighting wealthy donors to Freedom From Facebook was a fair way to show it was \u201cnot a spontaneous, grass-roots movement\u201dMr. Soros did not directly finance the anti-Facebook coalition. Though he has given to some of its member groups, it was not specifically to go after Facebook, according to his nonprofit organization, the Open Society Foundations. The Open Society also said on Friday that it declined a request to donate directly to Freedom from Facebook.Mr. Soros and his colleagues saw at least one obvious reason to single him out. \u201cThey were trying to stir up animus and rally right-wing support for Facebook,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, the president of Open Society Foundations. \u201cAnd the best way to do that is to lift up old tropes against George Soros.\u201dMr. Pariser attributed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s failure to appreciate Facebook\u2019s destructive capabilities to a hyperfocus on his rivals. \u201cI just think the problems that Facebook was looking at in 2012 and 2014 were, \u2018Hey, is Twitter going to eat our lunch? Is Snapchat going to eat our lunch?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pariser said.In the final scene of \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d a lawyer advises Mr. Zuckerberg to settle with the people who had accused him of steamrolling them \u2014 the Winklevii and his Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.I knew in 2010 that he would do just that as the camera showed him alone in an office to ponder it. But I had the reason wrong. It wasn\u2019t about doing right by those he had trampled. It was about doing only what he had to do to keep moving on, unimpeded.Before the credits roll, we see Mr. Zuckerberg refreshing his laptop screen again and again \u2014 a signal, in retrospect, that history would repeat itself.Follow Jim Rutenberg on Twitter: @jimrutenberg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Need to Go to the Dark Web to Find Hateful Conspiracy Theories", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorYou don\u2019t have to go deep into the internet to find the baseless conspiracies that provided a backdrop for mass murder in Pittsburgh and the recent pipe-bomb mailings to Barack Obama, the Clintons, George Soros and CNN. They are served up in plain sight, for profit, at airport bookstores, at movie-theater chains and on cable television.They come by way of publishing houses like Hachette and Penguin Random House; film distributors like Universal Home Studios and Lionsgate; theater chains like AMC and Cinemark; and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News.Those companies have all helped feed a segment of the media business that should be called what it is \u2014 the Incitement Industry.It rakes in profits by serving up agitprop that targets liberals, Democrats and \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives who are said to be plotting to destroy America for the benefit of darker-skinned migrants or a shadowy consortium of elites.You can see this kind of thing in the pages of \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals\u201d by the Fox News opinion host Jeanine Pirro. Published in July by Center Street, a division of the Hachette Book Group, Ms. Pirro\u2019s book lays out \u201cthe globalist, open-border oligarchy\u201d that, the author asserts, is seeking to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe perpetrators of this anti-American plot include, but are not limited to, the leadership at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, the Democratic Party and perhaps even the FISA courts,\u201d she writes.Another recent best seller in the same vein, \u201cResistance Is Futile!\u201d by the conservative provocateur Ann Coulter, was published by Sentinel, an imprint of the publishing giant Penguin Random House. It argues that the \u201cresistance\u201d that sprang up in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election is \u201cnothing less than a coup.\u201d And it lights into a conveniently vague villain \u2014 \u201cthe media\u201d \u2014 in a chapter titled \u201cFor Democracy to Live, We Must Kill the Media.\u201d\u201cThe media\u2019s position is that they\u2019re allowed to engage in lies, deception and even illegal acts to swing an election,\u201d Ms. Coulter writes.The film makes the case that the Nazi platform was similar to that of today\u2019s Democratic Party. Prominent among its villains is George Soros, who was allegedly sent a pipe bomb by Cesar Sayoc Jr., who also is accused of sending similar packages to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama.\u201cThe progressive Democrats are the true racists,\u201d the film\u2019s narrator intones. \u201cThey are the true fascists. They want to steal our income. They want to steal our earnings and our wealth and our freedom and our lives.\u201d\u201cDeath of a Nation\u201d will have a second life on the streaming platforms Amazon, iTunes and Google Play, as well as on DVD, sold at Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. The distribution is being handled by Quality Flix and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.The hysteria led Bill Kristol, the conservative Republican who was once a regular on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News, to tell Brian Stelter of CNN that it was time for Fox\u2019s owners and investors to take a hard look at the rhetoric spilling out of its news channel.(Representatives for Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, did not comment for this article.)But where is the line between falsehoods that may incite violence and good, old-fashioned American political hyperbole? And should book publishers and entertainment companies be more careful about the products they send out into the world in a tense sociopolitical atmosphere?\u201cI don\u2019t want some publisher telling me that something is beyond bounds,\u201d Mr. Kristol told me in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m a libertarian on points of view and even interpretations of history.\u201dBut after noting that conspiracy theories of recent vintage have whipped up fear and hatred, Mr. Kristol added, \u201cThere are things that normal fact-checking would rule out. It\u2019s not a matter of ideology; it\u2019s truth.\u201dI asked Hachette, the company behind \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals,\u201d whether Ms. Pirro\u2019s statement that Mr. Soros has \u201can agenda to destroy this country and the capitalist system\u201d had passed muster with the publisher\u2019s editors and fact-checkers. I got no answer.Sentinel, the division of Penguin Random House that published Ms. Coulter\u2019s recent best seller, was at least willing to engage. Its publisher, Adrian Zackheim, told me the author\u2019s views were \u201cexpressions of opinion.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s time to stop labeling her book \u201cnonfiction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For Politico, Tim Alberta tells the story of how the internet essentially killed off the anti-pornography movement, by making pornography so ubiquitous and porn use so pervasive that trying to regulate it in any meaningful way seemed like giving orders to the tide.Then Kate Julian\u2019s Atlantic examination of what she calls the \u201csexual recession\u201d looks at a surprising reality of life in the sexually liberated West \u2014 the fact that despite (or because of?) our permissive culture and the sweeping availability of entertainments that cater to every kind of sexual desire, the sexual act itself has fallen somewhat out of fashion, along with its usual accompaniments (relationships, marriage, childbearing), while onanism and long-term celibacy are on the rise.What both writers are describing is a post-sexual revolution landscape that almost nobody expected \u2014 with one notable exception, to be discussed below.Conservatives didn\u2019t expect it because they believed that sexual liberation would inevitably lead to social chaos \u2014 that if you declared consent the only standard of sexual morality and encouraged young people to define fulfillment libidinally, you would get not only promiscuity but also a host of dire secondary consequences: Teen pregnancy rates and abortion rates rising together, a pornography-abetted spike in rape and sexual violence, higher crime rates among fatherless young men \u2026 basically everything that seemed to be happening in the 1970s and 1980s, when the anti-porn crusade Alberta describes was strongest.So the pornified, permissive post-sexual revolution order today seems much more stable than conservative pessimists expected 30 years ago, with no social collapse looming on the horizon.But liberal optimists were wrong as well \u2014 wrong to expect that the new order would bring about a clear increase in sexual fulfillment, wrong to anticipate a healthy integration of sexual desire and romantic attachment, wrong to assume that a happily egalitarian relationship between the sexes awaited once puritanism was rejected and repression cast aside.Instead we\u2019ve achieved social stability through, in part, the substitution of self-abuse for intercourse, the crowding-out of real-world interactions by virtual entertainment, and the growing alienation of the sexes from one another. (\u201cI\u2019m 33, I\u2019ve been dating forever, and, you know, women are better,\u201d one straight woman in Julian\u2019s story says. \u201cThey\u2019re just better.\u201d)This isn\u2019t the sex-positive utopia prophesied by Wilhelm Reich and Alex Comfort and eventually embraced by third-wave feminists. It\u2019s a realm of fleeting private pleasures and lasting social isolation, of social peace purchased through sterility, of virtual sex as the opiate of the otherwise sexually unsuccessful masses.And the one person who really saw it coming was Aldous Huxley in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the essential dystopia for our times, which captured the most important feature of late-modern social life \u2014 the way that libertinism, once a radically disruptive force, could be tamed, domesticated and used to stabilize society through the mediation of technology and drugs.True, none of our pharmaceuticals quite match his \u201csoma\u201d \u2014 the \u201cperfect drug,\u201d a booster calls it, with \u201call the advantages of Christianity and alcohol\u201d but no hangover or religious guilt. (Our own versions are more dangerous and unevenly distributed.) But our hedonic forms of virtual reality are catching up to his pornographic \u201cfeelies\u201d and his \u201cViolent Passion Surrogate.\u201d (\u201cAll the tonic effects of murdering Desdemona and being murdered by Othello, without any of the inconveniences.\u201d) And on the evidence of many internet-era social indicators, they increasingly play the same tranquilizing and stabilizing roles.Above all Huxley nailed the way that a society sufficiently far gone into hedonism will lose even the language to describe clearly why, say, \u201ca single-use silicone egg that men fill with lubricant and masturbate inside\u201d (a recent Japanese innovation mentioned by Julian) might not be a positive development.The people trying to argue against porn in Alberta\u2019s article, or the people struggling to articulate their sexual and romantic discontents in Julian\u2019s, are trying to find their way back to a worldview that takes moral virtue and human flourishing seriously again. But they inhabit a society that often recognizes only arguments about pleasure versus harm, and that at some level has internalized the logic of Mustapha Mond, one of the Controllers of Huxley\u2019s world civilization: \u201cChastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and neurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization. You can\u2019t have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.\u201dPleasant vices and stability: With some technological assistance, that\u2019s the sexual culture we\u2019ve been forging. The only good news, and the best evidence that we might yet escape Huxley\u2019s trap, is that we retain enough genuinely-human aspiration to be unhappy with it.Advertisement"}

Did we expect a generation of younger corporate owners and investors, having made their money so large and fast, to somehow live up to the values expressed in their TED Talking enthusiasms? For all their world-changing identification, they are reproducing the social destruction so perfected by their corporate elders \u2014 that is, to brand themselves as do-gooders while working feverishly to prevent policy changes that would restrict, in any way, their ability to mine profits from ventures that are in direct conflict with their acclaimed values.As long as corporate culture embraces growth through profit as the ultimate criterion for success, and our politicians take a share of the winnings as the price of their support, we will continue down this slide. Facebook, Google, Amazon \u2014 they are merely the most recent players in the big Monopoly game that is our financial culture, and I thank the journalists who have been tracking their double-dealing. At least we know who the players are in the game of destruction.To the Editor:Privacy in the digital world is an antiquated concept. The government\u2019s efforts to curb abuse are equally antiquated. No one is truly protecting us. Sadly, we all have culpability because we believe the illusion that free really is free and that the digital world makes life better without significant cost.To the Editor: To the Editor:I\u2019m speechless at the chicanery. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg live in ivory towers. They played a big part in the current very dangerous erosion of American democracy and the rise of far-right extremism and got away with it for a while, blinded by their own giant egotism and financial success. But they forgot the oldest clich\u00e9 in the book, that power corrupts, and they apparently didn\u2019t read their history lesson on the rise and fall of corrupt individuals. Most of all, they obviously thought they were powerful enough that they didn\u2019t need to worry about journalists. The arrogance of that is beyond description. Ultimately nobody is above the law or beyond the reach of good investigative journalism. Bravo, New York Times!To the Editor:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do Democrats Know What Unites Us?", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey have failed to offer a response to Trumpian nationalism.Opinion ColumnistNational identity is the most powerful force in world politics today. Most of the strong leaders around the world were swept to power with a strong nationalist story and govern in nationalist ways. This is true in Russia, China, India, the U.S., Israel, Turkey, Britain, Brazil and on and on. It\u2019s hard to see how any party could appeal or govern these days without a strong national story.In this country, Donald Trump has almost nothing but a national story, which he returned to with a vengeance in the closing days of this year\u2019s campaigns. It happens to be a cramped, reactionary and racial story. Trump effectively defines America as a white ethnic nation that is being overrun by aliens \u2014 people who don\u2019t look like us, don\u2019t share our values, who threaten our safety and take our jobs.Trump\u2019s blood-and-soil nationalism overturns the historical ideal of American nationalism, which was pluralistic \u2014 that we are united by creed, not blood; that our common culture is defined by a shared American dream \u2014 pioneers settling the West, immigrants crossing an ocean in search of opportunity, African-Americans rising from slavery toward equality.The Republicans have flocked to Trump\u2019s cramped nationalism and abandoned their creedal story. That\u2019s left the Democrats with a remarkable opportunity. They could seize the traditional American national story, or expand it to gather in the unheard voices, while providing a coherent, unifying vehicle to celebrate the American dream.And yet what have we heard from the Democrats? Crickets.What is the Democratic national story? A void.Why have the Democrats failed to offer a counternarrative to Trumpian nationalism? For two reasons, I think, one political and one moral.First, these days nations often define their national identities through their immigration policies. Democrats have never liked to talk about immigration at election time. The immigration issue splits the Democratic coalition. Affluent progressive and liberal activists are for it, but working-class whites and African-Americans are more skeptical.Second, over the last several years, Democrats have begun to think about nationalism and immigration differently. In the past, Democrats tended to see immigration as an economic issue. Most mainstream Democrats have always been pro-immigrant, but they also favored border enforcement as a way to protect working-class wages. Barack Obama deported more unauthorized immigrants in his first two years in office than Trump has so far. Bernie Sanders used to dismiss open borders as a \u201cKoch brothers proposal.\u201dBut now, especially in the wake of Trumpian nativism, immigration is seen as a racial justice issue. Calls for law and order on the border are taken as code for racism. The phrase \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d has been struck from the Democratic lexicon. Anything that is pro-immigrant is seen as enlightened, and anything that restricts immigration is regarded as morally suspect. This framing unwittingly cuts the legs out from any position that falls short of open borders.After 30 years of multiculturalism, the bonds of racial solidarity trump the bonds of national solidarity. Democrats have a very strong story to tell about what we owe the victims of racism and oppression. They do not have a strong story to tell about what we owe to other Americans, how we define our national borders and what binds us as Americans.Here\u2019s the central challenge of our age: Over the next few decades, America will become a majority-minority country. It is hard to think of other major nations, down through history, that have managed such a transition and still held together.It seems that the Democratic Party is going to lead us through this transition. The Republicans have decided to pretend it\u2019s not happening. Trump had a chance to build a pan-ethnic nationalist coalition but went with white identity politics instead. Republicans have rendered themselves irrelevant to the great generational challenge before us.But if the Democrats are going to lead this transition, they\u2019ll need not just a mind-set that celebrates diversity, but also a mind-set that creates unity. They\u2019ll need policies that integrate different groups into a coherent nation, with shared projects, a common language and culture and clear borders.If you don\u2019t offer people a positive, uplifting nationalism, they will grab the nasty one. History and recent events have shown us that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Searching Social Media for Clues About Violent Crimes", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderTimes Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.In the last several weeks, my colleagues and I have reported on two suspects in high-profile crimes: Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people in a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and Cesar Sayoc Jr., who has been charged with sending explosives through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Mr. Sayoc to be held without bail.In both cases, the social media accounts of the suspects were instrumental in determining possible motives for their alleged crimes. Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Twitter and Facebook accounts were filled with pro-Trump partisan content, right-wing conspiracy theories and violent threats \u2014 including some he made against Democrats who ultimately were sent explosives.Typically, the first step in investigating a breaking news situation playing out on social media is to save and screenshot everything you can find. Social networks often act quickly to remove the pages of named suspects in high-profile crimes. And if you want to study these accounts, you need the raw material.You also need to verify that the accounts actually belong to the suspect. In Mr. Sayoc\u2019s case, his accounts didn\u2019t match the name given out by law enforcement. On Twitter, he went by \u201cCesar Altieri.\u201d On Facebook, he went by \u201cCesar Altieri Randazzo.\u201d Verifying account ownership often takes a combination of conventional reporting (contacting the platforms, as well as law enforcement) and digital forensics. Often, it\u2019s hard to be 100 percent sure, but in the case of Mr. Sayoc, several clues \u2014 such as photos of decals posted to his Twitter account that matched the photos of his van \u2014 helped us feel confident enough to move forward.While I was verifying Mr. Sayoc\u2019s accounts, my colleagues helped me scrape their contents. My colleague Rich Harris built an automated tool that allows for the mass-archiving of tweets. It\u2019s incredibly useful, and allowed us to save thousands of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s tweets before they were taken down. I also took screenshots of the images that appeared on Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Facebook page, and another colleague, Paul Murray, helped me archive years\u2019 worth of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Facebook posts.In Mr. Bowers\u2019s case, others first discovered his profile on Gab and, luckily, a few of them archived the contents on archive.is, a website that allows you to save a snapshot of a website at a given point in time. Someone also posted a video to Bitchute, a video-sharing site, that showed a person scrolling through Mr. Bowers\u2019s Gab feed before it was taken down. We used that video, plus the archived posts, to reconstruct as much of Mr. Bowers\u2019s feed as possible inside a Google doc, which we shared with the team reporting on the shooting.Sometimes, once you find one piece of a social media trail \u2014 say, a username or alias used on one website \u2014 you can use it to find other pieces. Other times, you hit a dead end. I have a small toolbox of apps and utilities I turn to in situations where I need to dig deeper into a given person\u2019s social media presence. But in this case, I didn\u2019t need to \u2014 there was more than enough information on each suspect\u2019s profiles to start reporting on them.In both cases, social media provided a trove of evidence.Social media will never give a full measure of a person\u2019s motivations. But as more people live more of their lives on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, it\u2019s increasingly important to understand the contours of these networks, including the darker corners where violent behavior can take root.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

(What is that like?!)Supported byMr. Raz cuts in, astonished. \u201cBut half a billion dollars \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, wow.\u201d\u201cTwo billion is more,\u201d Mr. Saban says.\u201cWas money \u2014 becoming really rich \u2014 did that motivate you?\u201d Mr. Raz asks a moment later.There\u2019s a moment like this in every episode of How I Built This. The guest has let his or her guard down and revealed something intimate, or financial, or financially intimate, and Mr. Raz keeps the disclosures rolling by reacting with total marvelment.The Betterment chief executive Jon Stein, whom Mr. Raz stokes with 12 individual \u201cwow\u201ds, details an agonizing split with his partners. The Cisco co-founder Sandy Lerner, amid 15 of Mr. Raz\u2019s wows, tells about being ousted from her own company. Eighteen further wows get Bobby Trussell, who created the Tempur-Pedic mattress empire, to describe a breakthrough moment with the Brookstone chain of stores: \u201cTalk about high-fiving!\u201dThe jewel in Mr. Raz\u2019s earbud empire remains How I Built This. Produced by NPR, the series began in September 2016 with Mr. Raz interviewing the Spanx founder Sara Blakely, setting the tone that it would be about business without being stodgy.\u201cYes, the baseline is that somebody eventually is going to make a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Raz says. But the show succeeds because it taps into something deeper: \u201cWho are you when you\u2019re on the bathroom floor in the fetal position, crying because you are not going to make it to the next day?\u201dIn each installment, Mr. Raz takes listeners on a journey through the free market toward some of capitalism\u2019s most glorious finales: Howard Schultz builds Starbucks, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger build Instagram, Eileen Fisher builds Eileen Fisher.\u201cBusiness is filled with crisis and failure and sadness and tension and discomfort and then triumph,\u201d Mr. Raz says. He calls How I Built This a show about vulnerability. And it is \u2014 in that it is a show about how much we will do to our lives and ourselves for money, and how vulnerable we are in the face of the enormous desire for capital and power. Mr. Raz gets founders to open up and tell wrenching stories about sacrifices, late nights, self-doubt and the mistakes that led to success.How Mr. Raz built How I Built This is inseparable from his interview voice of constant wonder.Mr. Raz sounds like no matter what he is saying, he is also saying \u201cWow.\u201dWhen he says \u201cbillions,\u201d he pops the \u201cB.\u201dIf a voice could be wearing pool-blue acrylic glasses, his would be. When I meet Mr. Raz, he is.The biggest name in business podcasts arrives at a Berkeley coffee shop on a cargo bike. The back has seats for his sons to ride, and in front Mr. Raz has installed a grocery rack. He shows me a layer of padding that is present specifically to keep farmers-market tomatoes from bruising on the ride home.\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s Nellie Bowles!\u201d is how he says hello to me, and to almost anyone whose name he knows. To be on the receiving end of this welcome is delightful, like we are all CEOs to this buoyant man.Mr. Raz seems as surprised as anyone that he has emerged as one of capitalism\u2019s biggest boosters. His background is not in business, but in globe-trotting radio journalism: He was NPR\u2019s Berlin bureau chief by 25, then London bureau chief; he covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and spent two years with CNN in Jerusalem; then he returned to NPR, where he was the defense correspondent and finally the weekend host of All Things Considered.In 2012, feeling ground down at 37, Mr. Raz left the news cycle. He started working on the TED Radio Hour, which is co-produced with NPR and explores one big human experience per episode, like \u201cWhy do we have the capacity to imagine?\u201dAnd to Mr. Raz, no stories captured the human experience as much as clawing out a living. \u201cThe question from everyone was, \u2018What makes this different from Bloomberg and CNBC?\u2019\u201d Mr. Raz said. \u201cAnd the case I was making was: I\u2019m not looking for news, I\u2019m not interested in your fourth-quarter strategy, I\u2019m looking to get into your heart and mind.\u201dHe decided from the start that How I Built This would feature only entrepreneurs he liked. He spends months researching them before an interview to make sure they align with what he and his team want to put into the world.\u201cWe had this responsibility to find people who kind of reflected a certain way of doing business,\u201d Mr. Raz says. \u201cPeople we think are generally kind. Are generally moral and ethical. Did you run your business honestly? Did you treat people well?\u201dHe also demands that those who sit for an interview are completely open. \u201cI ask them, \u2018Are you willing to come to this interview and surrender?\u2019\u201d he says.Some people say no. But most yield. They do so because they know that at the moment their belly is upturned, their worst decisions laid bare, Mr. Raz will guide them gently back to where they both know this is going: success. He does not consider himself a reporter anymore, he says.Mr. Raz insists that he is not trying to glorify money, even if his show occasionally does just that. \u201cThere are definitely people who believe in a world, a just world, or a more equal world that would find How I Built This offensive,\u201d he says. He worries about this, and he wants to make it clear that the free market just happens to be where he found a narrative groove.\u201cThere aren\u2019t an infinite number of narrative arcs,\u201d he says, citing Joseph Campbell\u2019s theory of storytelling archetypes. \u201cIt\u2019s like how every romantic comedy is the same movie with slight differences.\u201dThe arcs Mr. Raz describes are finding an audience. His podcasts have a combined monthly audience of 19.2 million downloads. In the coffee shop, Mr. Raz tries to argue that this does not necessarily mean he has become a celebrity himself.\u201cI know the numbers but, you know, look,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of the day, nobody knows who I am.\u201d A few minutes later, the man sitting next to us interrupts, apologizes, and says he just has to tell Mr. Raz that his wife is a big fan.In October, in San Francisco, Mr. Raz hosted the How I Built This Summit \u2014 the largest event of its kind that NPR has ever put on. The session was held in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the same space where Apple used to introduce its gadgets, and its 850 spots, costing between $699 and $899 a person, quickly sold out. Featuring the Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, the Stitch Fix co-founder Katrina Lake, the Lyft co-founder John Zimmer, and the Carol\u2019s Daughter founder Lisa Price, the event established Mr. Raz as one of radio\u2019s most marketable personalities, up there with the likes of Ira Glass and Terry Gross.I meet Mr. Raz for a second time backstage. He\u2019s alone in the dark and seems sedated. I get a softer \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s Nellie Bowles.\u201dOnstage, though, Mr. Raz switches on his persona: bounding, effusive and handsome in a clean-cut way. His hair maintains an immaculate side part. He looks like a game-show host or the dad in a TV show from the 1950s.Everyone is celebrated. It\u2019s like a kinder, less carnivorous \u201cShark Tank.\u201dMr. Gebbia comes onstage for a chat. Mr. Raz asks, \u201cWhat was your trough of sorrow?\u201d He jokes that this is exposure therapy, and he\u2019s the therapist.At the entrance to the theater, American Express has sponsored a selfie-friendly wall display of blue hats with block letters on the front: \u201cMoney Manager,\u201d \u201cHype Person,\u201d \u201cCEOOOOO,\u201d \u201cMaster Motivator.\u201d Jenelle Isaacson, who owns a real estate brokerage in Portland, Ore., and her 11-year-old daughter are in line to take pictures.\u201cThis is the podcast she\u2019s always requesting in the car,\u201d Ms. Isaacson says. \u201cAnd then we found out she\u2019s listening to it while she\u2019s doing her homework.\u201dThe energy is jarringly friendly for a tech conference, possibly because the How I Built This audience skews slightly female, with an average age of 28. In a Summit bathroom, one woman turns to another and says, \u201cThis is weird, but I just wanted to tell you, your hair looks great.\u201d The second woman responds that she was just about to say the same thing.Several of Mr. Raz\u2019s fans tell me they consider the show basically an M.B.A. course. His founder interviews function as case studies. Listeners get inspired. Many say the show makes them feel less lonely. Others say they cue up an episode when their business is a mess and they need a kick of enthusiasm. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m having one of those days, when I think I\u2019m going to quit, I listen to one,\u201d says Jenny Brien, 35, the founder of Snohomish Pie Company in Seattle. Sometimes she listens to the same episode over and over again.\u201cI won\u2019t hire someone at Rent the Runway unless they\u2019ve listened to my How I Built This interview,\u201d Ms. Hyman says. \u201cYou can\u2019t listen to that podcast without understanding who I am as a person and a leader. It gets to the core of me. There\u2019s nothing more authentic to me as a person than that interview.\u201dAcross the street from Mr. Raz\u2019s event, his wife, a consultant named Hannah Raz, is catching up with their friends Stewart Butterfield, the founder of Slack, and Jen Rubio, who co-founded the smart-luggage start-up Away.Ms. Raz is not quite sure how to describe Mr. Raz\u2019s hobbies without making him sound \u201clike such an NPR dad.\u201d Truly, it is difficult. \u201cHe loves to cook,\u201d she says. \u201cHe made his own almond milk, but moved on because of water issues, so now he makes cashew milk.\u201dMr. Raz, she says, is obsessed with kale and tries to eat paleo. He is awake and ready to go each day at 5:30 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of things that don\u2019t make him sound so precious,\u201d Ms. Raz says.Mr. Butterfield jumps in. \u201cOh, I can help,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the cast-iron pans.\u201d\u201cHe does love to oil his cast-iron pans,\u201d Ms. Raz says, resigned to the emerging narrative.\u201cAnd coconut aminos, carbon-neutral beef,\u201d Ms. Rubio chimes in. \u201cAnd the salmon.\u201d\u201cOh god,\u201d Ms. Raz says.Mr. Raz\u2019s unchecked enthusiasm across subject areas, from Alaskan seafood to risk-adjusted returns on capital, helps to explain how he came to create a founder-friendly podcast at a cultural moment that is trending anti-start-up, if not anticapitalist. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are constantly in the news for allowing hate and disinformation to spread, and across the political spectrum, C.E.O.s are hardly seen as moral leaders.\u201cI\u2019m not some rah-rah, \u2018Go, capitalism!\u2019 person,\u201d Mr. Raz says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in human experiences, and building a business is rich with natural drama.\u201dMr. Raz\u2019s own possibilities keep expanding. He just got a How I Built This book deal from the educational publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, for publication in the autumn of 2020.Mr. Raz\u2019s next podcast, Wisdom From the Top, will debut in early 2019, and highlight people who run big companies, organizations, nonprofits or entire cities. The animating idea, he says, is \u201cAre you born a leader, or do you become a leader?\u201dAbout that title, I say. Might it trigger those already worried he is glorifying the rich?\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good point,\u201d Mr. Raz says. \u201cWe can change the name.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We could spend them as we\u2019ve spent the last two: React to every Trump outrage. Keep Trump\u2019s narcissistic provocations at center stage. Express daily contempt from within the safety of our political silos.This seems to be the business model for cable news and online media. There\u2019s a big, reliable audience of people who will tune in to feel appalled by and superior to Trump, and who are addicted to their daily rituals of moral onanism.On the other hand, we could put the Trump soap opera off to the side and pay attention to actual Americans and actual solutions. We could acknowledge that we are an evenly divided country. We could build the bipartisan governing coalitions and agendas suited to that reality.Fortunately, many people are opting for plan B. For example, the Convergence Center for Policy Resolution gathers stakeholders across the political spectrum and gets them working together on common visions \u2014 union bosses with Wal-Mart executives, teacher union leaders with charter school heads.Washington think tanks are undergoing a fundamental evolution. A lot of them, like the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution, were built to advise parties that no longer exist. They were built for a style of public debate \u2014 based on social science evidence and congressional hearings that are more than just show trials \u2014 that no longer exists. Many people at these places have discovered that they have more in common with one another than they do with the extremists on their own sides.Written by a wide array of scholars, the report starts with the truth that the working class has been mostly ignored by the rest of society. Government has welfare programs to serve the poor and they have programs like 529 savings accounts to subsidize the rich. But there\u2019s very little for families making, say, $50,000 a year.Businesses like Amazon will invest in rich places like New York and Northern Virginia, but they won\u2019t invest much in working-class communities in Ohio or Kentucky. Universities, religious organizations and activist groups will recruit from the affluent suburbs and serve those in dire poverty, but they barely touch the working class.What you get is a layer of society that has been denuded of institutions and social bonds. Working-class men have been dropping out of the labor force at alarming rates. A generation ago, working-class families were about as likely to be part of religious communities as affluent Americans, but now their participation rates have plummeted. A generation ago, working-class families were nearly as likely to be married as affluent people, but now only half the children in working-class families will be raised in adolescence by stably married parents. From the 1970s to the 2000s, the share of working-class people aged 25 to 60 who were involved in a neighborhood organization fell from 71 percent to 52 percent.As the authors of the Opportunity America report lay out the evidence, you see how the debate has evolved over the past few years. First, there used to be relatively little research attention paid to the working class at all. Now it\u2019s the epicenter. Second, there used to be a silly debate over whether economics or culture explained social breakdown. Now these two elements are woven seamlessly together. Third, geography plays a much bigger role. Social problems are concentrated in specific places.The authors of this report dismiss the policy slogans coming from the extremes. Building a wall is not a policy. Universal basic income degrades the work ethic that is at the core of working-class life. Free college is a massive subsidy for the upper middle class.Instead, the authors come up with a broad left/right agenda that 70 percent of Republicans and Democrats could support: wage subsidies, improved parental leave, work requirements for some federal benefits, child care tax credits.I especially like their point that we have overemphasized four-year colleges as the only route to success. In 2016, the federal government spent $139 billion on post-secondary education and training. Only a sliver, 14 percent, went to career education and training. Private sector employers fetishize the college degree even where it\u2019s unnecessary. Two-thirds of the job postings for production supervisors now require a college degree. But only 16 percent of the people currently holding those jobs have such a degree.One of the core questions before us is this: Who is going to lead this country? Is it perpetual outsiders like Trump, with no governing or policy competence, who say the establishments have forfeited all credibility? Or are there enough chastened members of establishments, who have governing experience, who acknowledge past mistakes, who take the time to reconnect with the country and apply their expertise in new ways?I don\u2019t know about you, I\u2019ll take a chastened establishment any day.Advertisement"}

Once I\u2019m there, the single bunch of sage I came for somehow turns into yet another full bag of groceries.But leftover bags of raw cranberries, extra squash that have served their purpose as centerpieces and the bunches of parsley and bags of onions I find stashed all over the house are harder to get rid of. No one wants to eat cranberry sauce once the turkey runs out. Everyone is sick of pumpkin, sweet potatoes and all things sweet and starchy. So at this time of year, I go on the hunt for recipes that show off those ingredients, but without repeating the tastes of Thanksgiving.Cynthia Chen McTernan is a food blogger and photographer (and lawyer) in Los Angeles whose first cookbook, \u201cA Common Table,\u201d has just been published. She cooks from a combination of spectacularly delicious influences: her upbringing in Virginia, her Chinese-born parents, her Korean-Hawaiian-American in-laws and her California home. All are present at Thanksgiving, she says. Her Cantonese mother insists on reserving a place at the table for her favorite spicy soy-braised lamb shanks, and the other side of the family produces platters of jeon (fritters) and mandoo (dumplings).Ms. McTernan, who calls kabocha her \u201csoul-mate squash,\u201d said that a few years ago she told her mother all about the fabulous new squash she\u2019d discovered in California. Her mother informed her that she had been eating it all her life, under the name \u201cJapanese pumpkin.\u201d Their recipe is a simple braise, popular in many parts of East Asia, where the squash is cut into chunks, stir-fried with lots of scallions, then simmered in broth until tender and soupy. It\u2019s substantial, but light and savory \u2014 a perfect post-holiday dinner with freshly steamed rice and a soft-cooked egg.Ms. Beranbaum\u2019s favorite leftover is not sweet but salty: a whole 18-pound ham that her supermarket throws in along with her enormous Thanksgiving order.

{"Headline": "Air Force Mascot, a Falcon, Is Injured by West Point Cadets During Prank", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Saturday approached, the United States Military Academy revved up for a football game against the visiting Air Force Academy in West Point, N.Y., in a highly charged clash of rivals.And with the rivalry came an idea of mischief.But a scheme by West Point cadets to swipe two falcons belonging to the Air Force Academy ended with one of the birds bloodied, the start of an investigation and a public apology from West Point.The episode began sometime on Friday night, Sam Dollar, the Air Force Academy\u2019s falconry team adviser, said on Sunday.Aurora, a 22-year-old gyrfalcon who is the academy\u2019s official mascot, and Oblio, a Peregrine falcon about seven years younger, were taken by two West Point cadets.They threw sweaters over the birds, and later stuffed them into dog crates, Mr. Dollar said.The cadets turned the birds in on Saturday morning, but not before Aurora suffered abrasions that bloodied her wings, likely when she was thrashing inside the crate, Mr. Dollar said. Aurora\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening, and she was to be examined by a veterinarian on Sunday, he said. Oblio did not sustain any obvious injuries.\u201cI think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake,\u201d Mr. Dollar said. \u201cWhen Aurora started thrashing around in the crate, they decided that wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201dMedia reports of the episode raised furious calls for those responsible for Aurora\u2019s injuries to be disciplined.\u201cIt upsets me,\u201d Mr. Dollar said. \u201cI\u2019m more about the health and welfare of the birds. I understand them pranking and doing stuff and things like that.\u201dBut Mr. Dollar said falcons require special care and their handling is tightly regulated by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, among other agencies.\u201cUnless you are federally licensed, you can\u2019t even touch them,\u201d he said. The Air Force cadets who work with the falcons spend two months in training, and have to take an exam before they can handle the birds.Mr. Dollar did not know where the birds were taken from or where they were returned, though he said the falcons, along with another, an American kestrel named Zeus, were sleeping in a home near the Air Force football team while it was visiting West Point.Lt. Col. Chevelle Thomas, a West Point spokeswoman, said on Sunday that the \u201cU.S. Military Academy sincerely apologizes for an incident involving U.S.M.A. cadets and the Air Force Academy falcons.\u201d\u201cOne of the birds was injured and the matter is currently under investigation,\u201d Colonel Thomas said. \u201cWe are taking this situation very seriously.\u201dShe said West Point had sent an apology to the Air Force Academy and that \u201cthis occurrence does not reflect\u201d Army or military academy core values of \u201cdignity and respect.\u201dTroy Garnhart, associate athletic director for strategic communications at the Air Force Academy, said he did not know where and how Aurora was discovered to be injured.In 1991, after midshipmen raided a West Point veterinary clinic, took four Army mules and were chased by helicopters, the two academies signed a pact exempting mascots from their pranks.Mr. Kosakowski said falcons routinely sustain wing injuries, and many can be treated and live.Mr. Dollar said he wanted to debunk news circulating that Aurora\u2019s injuries were life-threatening or that she might have to be euthanized. He said Aurora did not have any broken bones, and he expected her to be able to fly again.\u201cThey scuffed up her wings a bit, putting her in a box probably too small for her,\u201d Mr. Dollar said. \u201cA little bit of antibiotics and food and rest and she\u2019ll be fine.\u201dHe said that her injuries could have been much worse if the cadets did not have a \u201cmoment of clarity\u201d to turn the falcons back in.Falcons were chosen as the Air Force Academy\u2019s mascot in 1955, and Aurora is the oldest of 10 in the falconry program, Mr. Dollar said, noting, \u201cShe\u2019s an old lady of the group.\u201dBy the way, Army beat the Air Force 17 to 14 on Saturday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Saudi Murder Becomes a Gift to Iran", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe assassination of a journalist has further hurt the Trump administration\u2019s frail strategy of buddying with Saudi Arabia to restrain Iran\u2019s expanding influence.Professor Nasr, a scholar of Middle East politics and diplomacy, is the author of \u201cThe Shia Revival: How Conflicts Within Islam Will Shape the Future.\u201dThe Trump administration is not ready to admit it, but its Middle East strategy is in deep trouble, now compounded by the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last month. The administration\u2019s recent pressure on the Saudis to seek a truce in their war in Yemen is a clear signal of just how much the credibility of Saudi Arabia, which is at the heart of that strategy, has shrunk, perhaps even in President Trump\u2019s eyes.The strategy\u2019s goal was to work with the Saudis to contain Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East. Instead, we can now expect a growing sense of ease in Tehran about exerting its influence, even as it adjusts to the tough economic sanctions that were reimposed last week. That freedom is more likely to be used through maneuvering and deal-making, rather than through aggressions.It\u2019s not as if Iran expects a change in American policy toward it in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair. Instead, the weakening of confidence in Saudi Arabia throughout the region is more likely to confirm to Iran\u2019s leaders the wisdom of their own current strategy \u2014 manage pressure from America by mobilizing domestic resources; rely on Europe, China and Russia to keep economic channels with Iran open; and consolidate Iran\u2019s alliances and positions of influence politically.Over the past year, Iran has been able to avoid escalating tensions with the United States, in part because it has confidence in Russia\u2019s commitment to stay its course in Syria. Iran shows no sign of ever abandoning Syria, even as it stays surprisingly quiet in the face of repeated Israeli strikes on Iranian bases there. Similarly, expectations of a confrontation in Iraq after the Iranian consulate in Basra was torched in September proved unwarranted. Instead, Iran quietly helped Iraqis forge a political alliance that formed a government reliant on Iranian-backed militias that the United States wants disbanded.Now, the leaders in Tehran may well expect that a weakened Saudi Arabia could be compelled to end both its military campaign in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. All along, the Iranians have sought talks with the Saudis, who may be ready to talk to them \u2014 especially if the Saudis take American advice and decide to end the Yemen war. The government in Riyadh may also find it necessary to mend relations with Iran to rebalance its relations with Turkey, which has been aligned with a buoyant Qatar and was further angered by the Saudi assassination on Turkish soil. Remaining calm, in turn, might give Iran\u2019s leaders greater confidence in their own bargaining power, perhaps to the point of talking to the United States about its nuclear and missile programs. The ruling circles in Tehran already seem confident that the economy has absorbed much of the shock of American sanctions and that Iran can sell enough oil and have enough trade with Europe, China, Russia and India to keep its economy afloat. Conservatives and moderates have formed a united front to rally the population to the flag and to fend off any popular discontent that the United States might hope economic hardship would bring.The Trump administration has derided the nuclear deal, asserting that it was failing to curb Iran\u2019s regional influence and claiming to want a new deal strong enough to do just that. But Mr. Trump will now find it even more difficult to deliver on his promise of forcing Iran to come to the table on his terms. If Iran comes at all, it will not be in a position of abject weakness. All it needs to do is remain committed to the deal it signed with Barack Obama and let Mr. Trump recognize that his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy falls short. Then Tehran might be ready to talk.From the start, the Trump administration thought it could rein in Iran\u2019s regional influence by forging a close partnership with Saudi Arabia\u2019s young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But a series of heavy-handed Saudi missteps, culminating in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, have backfired, leaving Iran with much more room for strategic initiatives.Relying on Saudi Arabia to contain Iran was always questionable. Saudi Arabia has never been truly successful at rolling back Iran\u2019s regional presence, and in recent years Iran\u2019s influence in the region has only grown. For example, Saudi Arabia has for all practical purposes washed its hands of Syria, leaving it to the United States to deal with Iran and the endgame of that conflict. The greatest missteps started in 2015 with the ill-conceived war in Yemen, followed last year by a blockade that failed to ostracize Qatar and then a weekslong detention of the prime minister of Lebanon that failed to lessen his reliance on Hezbollah. All were clumsy attempts to make other Arabs afraid to deal with Iran and its allies. All had the opposite effect, with the region\u2019s principal players \u2014 America\u2019s friends among them \u2014 seeing Saudi Arabia as a greater menace than Iran.The Khashoggi affair has been a watershed event. It brought into sharp relief the weakness at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy, even as it weakened the crown prince himself, along with support for his partnership with America. The ability of Saudi Arabia to help Israel contain Iran and provide political cover for a final deal with the Palestinians now looks far-fetched. Israel\u2019s hand has been weakened, while Turkey \u2014 which also wants greater regional influence and has shared Iran\u2019s concerns about the budding alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 has gained stature.It is now clear that Saudi Arabia will not be able to lead a regional coalition to force Iran out of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and then Yemen. Unless Mr. Trump plans to send large numbers of troops to do that, and then have them stay on to make sure Iranian influence does not return, he can hope for regional stability only by focusing on first bringing the Middle East\u2019s wars to an end. Then he would have to set aside his high hopes that \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d can successfully deal with Iran on regional issues. Accepting those truths would not eliminate Iran\u2019s influence, but it could set limits on it and provide time for the Arab world to recover and rebuild \u2014 which ultimately is the best way to check Iranian power.As for Iran, it doesn\u2019t need to flex its muscles. It just needs to wait for the Trump administration to fully appreciate the balance of power in the Middle East. As Mr. Trump\u2019s mirage of an Arab order evaporates, a stark reality emerges: There is no credible Arab challenge to Iran\u2019s regional influence, nor is there any prospect of reducing it with American threats and bluster.Vali R.

LONDON \u2014 It began, PETA says, as a playful attempt to draw attention to animal cruelty in the wool industry: The animal rights group sent a letter asking the English village of Wool to change its name to Vegan Wool. \u201cWith a simple name change, your village can take a stand against this cruelty,\u201d Elisa Allen, director of PETA\u2019s London office, wrote, pointing to evidence of mistreatment of sheep on farms around the world.In exchange for the name change, Ms. Allen said, \u201cwe\u2019d be happy to provide every Vegan Wool household that would like one with a cozy, cruelty-free blanket.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a benign industry \u2014 it\u2019s not a haircut as people often assume it is,\u201d she said. The parish council of Wool, in the county of Dorset, 120 miles southwest of London, said in an email on Friday that PETA\u2019s \u201crequest has not been received very well.\u201d Headlines in traditionally conservative tabloids cried foul, saying that PETA believed the name Wool promoted animal cruelty when it was actually linked to water, and quoting residents who ridiculed the suggested name change. For one thing, this ancient village of 5,000 people in the verdant countryside of England was not named after the wool from sheep. True, in the 19th century it was known for sheep of the Dorset Down breed, but most farms have turned to dairy production, the paper said.The name Wool, which is more than 1,000 years old, derives from Wyllon or Well, which means spring, the council said.Ms. Allen said PETA knew that, and wanted only to draw attention to its campaign in a \u201cfun way.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to look a little bit silly provided that we can bring these issues into the public domain,\u201d she said. But PETA\u2019s letter touched a nerve with some vegans and animal rights activists.

{"Headline": "Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySheryl Sandberg was seething.But it wasn\u2019t the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\u201cYou threw us under the bus!\u201d she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.The clash that day would set off a reckoning \u2014 for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.But as evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack.While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook\u2019s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.Facebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.\u201cThis has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\u201dEven so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook\u2019s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook\u2019s data-hungry business model.\u201cWe failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u201d Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.His answer each time: a resounding \u201cNo.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company\u2019s extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \u201cLean In,\u201d in 2013.But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.The question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg\u2019s domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook\u2019s chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company\u2019s terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump\u2019s account, violated Facebook\u2019s rules.Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.\u201cDon\u2019t poke the bear,\u201d Mr. Kaplan warned.Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s language had not violated Facebook\u2019s rules and that the candidate\u2019s views had public value. \u201cWe were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\u201d he said in an interview.In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump\u2019s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.In the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos \u2014 alarmed that the company\u2019s chief executive seemed unaware of his team\u2019s findings \u2014 met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos\u2019s work, creating a group called Project P, for \u201cpropaganda,\u201d to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos\u2019s original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.But Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians\u2019 fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.Ms. Sandberg\u2019s subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators\u2019 concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \u201cfive-alarm fire,\u201d said a person familiar with the discussions.Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company\u2019s quarterly board meeting.After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board\u2019s audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company\u2019s headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook\u2019s founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites \u2014 a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner\u2019s former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan\u2019s team took a larger role in managing the company\u2019s Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s 2015 memoir, and the senator\u2019s chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg\u2019s charitable foundation.But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook\u2019s lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \u201cFacebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\u201d he said.In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations \u2014 an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to \u201cmake sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\u201d (Mr. Cook\u2019s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.)Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company\u2019s American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook.The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company\u2019s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients\u2019 enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.Mr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers\u2019 work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook\u2019s criticism upset Facebook.If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \u201cmuddy the waters,\u201d Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \u201cHere Together,\u201d to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company\u2019s communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic \u2014 a suspicion confirmed by Facebook\u2019s pollsters.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook\u2019s leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company\u2019s problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg \u2014 whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company \u2014 was protecting her own brand at Facebook\u2019s expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company\u2019s Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee\u2019s Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about \u201ccorporate citizenship in the digital age\u201d and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s presence \u2014 companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings \u2014 persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.\u201cDepicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cProtest Facebook \u2014 or anyone \u2014 all you want, but pick a different image.\u201d The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \u201cextreme anti-Israel groups.\u201dFacebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \u201cmenace\u201d with \u201cneither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\u201dDefiners pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son. (An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook\u2019s New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.In July, as Facebook\u2019s troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer\u2019s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook\u2019s Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 a pivotal encounter for her embattled company \u2014 and her aides were taking no chances.Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled \u201cGoogle.\u201d Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook\u2019s rival.Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.In large letters were her stage directions: \u201cSlow, Pause, Determined.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Began weekly calls to her representatives.January 2017: Went to the Women\u2019s March and formed the Fogelsville Huddle with three neighbors. Phone-banked for Planned Parenthood. \u201cHad to go to counseling.\u201dFebruary included a town-hall-style meeting against Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and a letter-writing campaign to protest the president\u2019s travel ban. And by earlier this year, the women had written postcards supporting the redistricting of Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional map, had attended debates and had begun volunteering for the winner of the Democratic primary for Congress, Susan Wild, phone-banking for her three times a week. Throughout, they have marched: for science and for the climate; against gun violence and families being separated at the border.\u201cI never knew I had so many issues,\u201d said Ms. Novotnak, 61, a remedial math teacher.If 2018 is the Year of the Woman, it is not just because of the record number of women running for office, but also for the surge of activism among women like those of the Fogelsville Huddle. The political awakening that began with the women\u2019s marches has swelled into the midterm elections and expanded the definition of \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d to include health care, immigration, gun violence and the environment.And it has deepened the gender divide between the two parties, as women have moved increasingly to the left.\u201cIf people ever ask me, \u2018Why did you leave the party?\u2019 I say, \u2018I didn\u2019t leave anywhere; I am a member of my cohort; I am a white, college-educated woman,\u2019\u201d said Christine Matthews, a pollster who was a Republican until Mr. Trump secured the nomination and now considers herself an independent.Last week, about 15 of her \u201cmom friends\u201d gathered at Ms. Matthews\u2019s home in Alexandria, Va., for the second of two postcard parties, eating chocolate and drinking wine as they wrote to encourage voters in a congressional district south of them to support the Democratic challenger, Abigail Spanberger.Several were Never Trumpers, as Ms. Matthews describes herself, and about half had been to multiple postcard parties to support Democratic women in other congressional districts. Some had begun writing postcards in Virginia\u2019s 2017 elections, when female candidates had unusual success challenging incumbents in the state\u2019s House of Delegates.\u201cEveryone\u2019s mood was lifted because we\u2019re all doing something that\u2019s very tangible,\u201d Ms. Matthews said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the names of these voters; it\u2019s not the hopeless \u2018I\u2019m writing to my congressman\u2019 thing.\u201dAlarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, Ms. Matthews and two friends \u2014 one a Democrat, one a Republican \u2014 started 1PlanetWomen to try to make women into climate voters.They are working with Virginia garden clubs to talk about how climate change affects women\u2019s immediate lives \u2014 they cannot enjoy their gardens, for example, with ticks and mosquitoes having longer seasons, and more children have asthma \u2014 and have begun running targeted Instagram ads supporting Ms. Spanberger. To start the group, they turned to their contact lists of women from school, the neighborhood and church.\u201cThe initial burst of enthusiasm was people pulling together their church friends or neighbors or PTA groups,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said. \u201cThe social connections are incredible for sustaining the activism.\u201dIn Orange County, Calif., the women who had been organizing the weekly rallies in defense of Obamacare outside Congressman Darrell Issa\u2019s office decided one day to go out to lunch afterward.\u201cThere happened to have been a little wine involved, and it became a tradition,\u201d said one of the organizers, Ellen Montanari, an executive coach. They nicknamed themselves the ReSistas, and after successfully badgering Mr. Issa, a Republican, into retirement, they began volunteering for a group seeking to elect a Democrat, Mike Levin, who polls show is now leading in a once reliably Republican district.\u201cI have friends who say, \u2018I just can\u2019t watch the news anymore,\u2019\u201d Ms. Montanari said. \u201cI understand it, that it does cause stress, but the only thing that relieves the stress for me is being active.\u201d\u201cI think that women want to take out their frustration and their feeling of powerlessness,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the group\u2019s founder. \u201cWe\u2019re only 20 percent of legislators. The power that we have is to use our votes and our voices, and I see women wanting to plug in and get involved.\u201dWomen are doing more than just turning out; donations by women to congressional campaigns have increased by 36 percent since 2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Women\u2019s Philanthropy Institute found a spike in women\u2019s donations to \u201cprogressive\u201d charities such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center in the week after the 2016 election; women donated six times as much as men to such groups in that week.Eve Jorgensen, the leader of the Little Rock, Ark., Moms Demand chapter, raised $10,000 at an event for Clarke Tucker, a Democrat running for Congress, hounding friends on Facebook and by text to show up.She did a birthday fund-raiser on Facebook for him and joined friends who started #LunchWithClarke, brown-bagging and donating the $10 they would have spent on lunch to Mr. Tucker\u2019s campaign.\u201cWith MeToo and with gun violence and with Kavanaugh, we\u2019ve seen that women really need to speak up and speak out,\u201d said Ms. Jorgensen, who maps water lines for a large utility. \u201cUnfortunately, I think you have to have money to play the game.\u201dOne cause led to another. \u201cYou get on these lists, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018If you\u2019re mad about children being held in prison, give here.\u2019\u201d Ms. Jorgensen said, \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019m mad about that.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cIn the South especially, the No. 1 rule is don\u2019t talk about money and don\u2019t talk about politics. Now we\u2019re doing both.\u201dIn Pennsylvania, the women of the Fogelsville Huddle went beyond traditional political events. Ms. Novotnak began driving families from a local refugee resettlement office to doctor\u2019s appointments, and the group collected toiletries and Christmas gifts for marginalized groups: veterans, women, immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. people.They did not consider themselves political before 2016; they supported abortion rights but, in a Republican neighborhood, didn\u2019t mention it, and they didn\u2019t vote on it.And they had not known each other well. Ms. Novotnak ran into Karen Pietrantonio, the lone Democrat in the group, while walking her dog the morning after the 2016 election, and Ms. Pietrantonio suggested the wine and venting. Ms. Novotnak invited Lori Barnett, a podiatrist she knew from their children\u2019s high school theater production. At the grocery store, she recognized Cathy Schoener as a neighbor; Ms. Schoener recognized the look on Ms. Novotnak\u2019s face and knew that they felt the same way about the new president.\u201cHe embodied every behavior I try to teach 5-year-olds not to do,\u201d said Ms. Schoener, a preschool teacher. Ms. Novotnak invited her for wine.The group was soon active and texting every day. Ms. Novotnak stopped going to counseling. \u201cThe huddle has saved thousands of dollars in therapy,\u201d she said.Phone-banking has pushed them beyond what would have been their comfort zone. Many people hang up; others say they are voting, but not Democratic.Last week, Ms. Barnett called somebody who did not know Ms. Wild, the candidate, but was open to voting for a Democrat. \u201cWell, Susan\u2019s very calm, and she doesn\u2019t tweet out crazy things,\u201d Ms. Barnett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start right there.\u201dAt least three people said they were Republicans but were voting straight Democratic. \u201cUntil Trump\u2019s out of office,\u201d one told Ms. Schoener. \u201cI\u2019m right there with you!\u201d she responded.She got an older woman on the phone. Yes, the woman said, she planned to vote for Ms. Wild. \u201cLet\u2019s get her done,\u201d she added, and hung up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe French comedian Blanche Gardin is taking on all of feminism\u2019s orthodoxies. Contributing Opinion Writer \u201cStill,\u201d she added innocently, \u201cIt\u2019s funny that this separation applies only to artists. For example, no one says about the baker, \u2018Yes, O.K., it\u2019s true, he rapes kids in the bakehouse, but come on, he makes an extraordinary baguette.\u201dHer own audience was growing. A subsequent show was picked up by Netflix. Parisians \u2014 who typically confine private feelings to a \u201csecret garden\u201d \u2014 were fascinated by Ms. Gardin\u2019s self-deprecating, stream-of-consciousness style, in which she seemed to be confessing dark thoughts to a close friend. Critics compared her to Louis C.K.She argued that it\u2019s hypocritical to shun Louis C.K. His humor, she noted, \u201cexplored his dark side, his perversions, and deciphered the darkness of the human soul.\u201d \u201cPeople loved him for that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it made them feel better about their own dark sides.\u201dIn Ms. Gardin\u2019s newest show, which I saw recently here, gender relations are a major theme. Her message: They\u2019re complicated.You can pass a law against street harassment, but when a woman decorates herself like a Christmas tree, \u201cyou have to risk that someone says you\u2019re well-decorated,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the game.\u201d Ms. Gardin also has words for actresses who lament the dearth of leading roles for women over 40. \u201cI know that at 41, I\u2019m not as attractive as I was at 20,\u201d she tells the crowd. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018You say that because you\u2019ve integrated a masculine vision of desire.\u2019 No, not at all.\u201d It\u2019s because, she says, \u201cWe\u2019re born, we grow up, we get stronger, we have a peak of physical and sensual power. And then we get older, and become weaker, and uglier, and we die. We need to digest that.\u201dWhereas the American version of #MeToo often seems like a battle of the sexes or a story of male domination, Ms. Gardin expresses sympathy for men. She describes how their desires can make them vulnerable, and how this can give women power. Men are driven to have sex, she says, while \u201cwe just need to get to the point where we can sense, in the man\u2019s eyes, that we can ruin his life.\u201dBut Ms. Gardin is more popular than ever.

{"Headline": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.At the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.Now the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.Not long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?But you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.Advertisement"}

He refused, telling a local radio host, \u201cIt really diminishes democracy if you\u2019re going to show up to a meeting to just scream and yell.\u201d Instead, he said, he was appearing on \u201cevery national TV show,\u201d as if that were a substitute for facing his constituents.Grechen Shirley is 37; King has been in office since she was 12. She has a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old, and before 2016, she hadn\u2019t considered running for office anytime soon. To make her campaign feasible, she successfully petitioned the Federal Election Commission to allow the use of campaign funds for child care.\u201cPolitics wasn\u2019t set up for people like me to run,\u201d Grechen Shirley told me. Besides being a young mother, she\u2019s not wealthy, and she hasn\u2019t spent her adult life building political connections. But the calamity of Donald Trump\u2019s election has motivated a flood of people who never saw themselves as politicians to seek office, including a record number of women.Yet if the past two years have given lie to the myth of American exceptionalism \u2014 a system that elevates a person like Trump is by definition not the best in the world \u2014 they have also revealed an enduring strain of actual American greatness. Movements like Trump\u2019s thrive on social decay and atomization. Millions of Americans who oppose Trump have responded to him with an enormous civic revival. They have marched, organized Resistance groups, and reinvigorated American politics at every level. In the face of an existential threat to democracy, they\u2019ve rededicated themselves to its practice.After Trump\u2019s election, I was in a state of deep grief that didn\u2019t begin to lift until April 2017, when I went to Georgia to cover the special congressional election in the Sixth District. Democrat Jon Ossoff didn\u2019t win, but I was inspired by all the women \u2014 some of whom had been largely apolitical before Trump \u2014 pouring supernatural amounts of energy into organizing their community. Last month I went back to that district, and found the women more active than ever. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to go back to being the same person I was before 2016,\u201d said Jessica Zeigler, who since we first met had quit her job to work full-time as a progressive organizer.This year, the Democratic candidate in the Sixth District is Lucy McBath, who became a gun control activist after the 2012 murder of her son, Jordan Davis. The Cook Political Report just moved the once solidly Republican district into the tossup category, likely due to both new voters energized by Stacey Abrams\u2019s historic campaign for Georgia governor and the movement that local activists started building last year.Cook still rates Grechen Shirley\u2019s district as \u201clikely Republican,\u201d but she has out-raised King in the last two quarters, and she\u2019s convinced there\u2019s going to be an upset. \u201cWe are absolutely going to win,\u201d she told me. The fact that Trump became president is a sign that this country was deeply broken. In 24 hours we\u2019ll find out if women can repair it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cruz Might Win the Senate, but the Democrats Are Winning Texas", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross the state, diverse liberal candidates are redefining its politics.Mr. Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dEL PASO \u2014 \u201cWhat does it mean,\u201d a man asked Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke at the end of a televised town hall, \u201cto be a Texan?\u201dThat question summed up the most-watched Senate race in America. It isn\u2019t merely a contest over political power, though a quarter-century-old Republican monopoly is on the line. It\u2019s an existential struggle over which Texas emerges, with national consequence. One version is being sold by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, the incumbent. A shibboleth of tall tales and 10-gallon hats, it\u2019s a story the Republicans have been telling for years to persuade new arrivals, refugees from the Rust Belt, that being Texan meant driving pickups and caring only about God, gays and guns. In that Texas, during Mr. Cruz\u2019s first Senate campaign in 2012, hardly anyone voted. He claimed that \u201cmillions of Texans\u201d were \u201crising up\u201d to support him. But in fact he won in a squeaker, edging out another Republican in a runoff by 150,000 votes \u2014 a whopping 1 percent of registered voters. If margins were bass fishing he\u2019d have had to throw his back. And back then, general elections against Democrats were an afterthought.Defeated in his bid for the Republican nomination by Donald Trump, Mr. Cruz has run for re-election as a born-again good old boy. That\u2019s why this Canadian-born product of Princeton and Harvard Law opened his campaign at the Redneck Country Club. \u201cTexas is tough,\u201d he told the crowd, adding that he would now be known as \u201cTough for Texas.\u201d It didn\u2019t stick.On the other hand, there is real Texas, today.When other Americans think of Texas they probably think of Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston, the cities where 75 percent of the state lives, though the triangle they form counts nearly 20 percent of its landmass. That\u2019s real Texas. So are the 20 or so suburban counties that surround these cities and swing elections. But these are far different from the rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 Texas of the Cruz campaign. Real Texas has the largest Muslim population in the country. Vietnamese is our third language; Chinese is our fourth. Missouri City, near Houston, may be one of the most ethnically and racially diverse spot in America. It\u2019s also one of the most densely populated. People are crammed in at nearly 2,600 per square mile \u2014 over twice that of New Jersey. The surrounding county was bedrock Republican but flipped for Hillary Clinton in 2016. This is not Ted Cruz\u2019s Texas. Neither is Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown (and mine) of El Paso. It\u2019s a tattooed, blue-collar, Latino city of nearly one million. Mr. Cruz hardly comes here; his last visit he attracted just 2,000 people at a West Side high school \u2014 on a Saturday. This Texas hasn\u2019t benefited from a quarter-century of unbroken Republican power. The biggest employer, the Army, ships people out just as quickly as it ships them in. A sprawling city of rail yards and refineries, El Paso has one of the highest illiteracy rates in America and some of its worst access to health care.There\u2019s a lot more of this Texas: the Lower Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio, South Dallas, East Austin and inside the Loop in Houston. This is a young Texas, about which there is a prevailing myth: It doesn\u2019t vote. But that myth is being sorely tested. Some 15.6 million people are registered to vote this year, 1.6 million more than in 2014. More than four million have voted so far; so far in El Paso this year\u2019s turnout has looked more like a presidential contest than a midterm. There\u2019s another myth about Texas: \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s still Texas.\u201d Which is to say, whatever the personalities and trends might indicate, in the end, Texas will vote as it always has, for crimson-red candidates. As Erica Grieder at The Houston Chronicle has pointed out, that\u2019s about the laziest thing that non-Texan experts on politics can say. The number of Texans who identify as conservative has flattened, according to the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, while the number who identify as progressive has swollen. This election is an exercise in brute electoral force: the full on clash of the real, modern Texas with a worn out, calcified caricature. \u201cThis is not a persuasion election,\u201d said James Henson, a University of Texas political scientist. \u201cThis is a mobilization election.\u201dThe Cruz-O\u2019Rourke race may be the main event, but the ballot is full of competitive matchups. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, may lose to a Houston lawyer named Justin Nelson. Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has his hands full with his Democratic opponent, a retired Air Force colonel named Kim Olson. Up in Dallas, Representative Pete Sessions, a Republican, is hearing the footsteps of the former N.F.L. player Colin Allred. In the western Houston suburbs, the Democrat, Lizzie Fletcher, is just a few points behind the incumbent, John Culberson. The Texas Tribune reports that Republicans may even lose their supermajority in the State Senate. Not this year, though. \u201cWe have lots of evidence that the anger is there,\u201d said Matt A. Barreto, the chief executive of the polling firm Latino Decisions, citing the mass deportation of Latinos and the internment of children this summer. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely upset with Trump.\u201dThe Senate race has always been Mr. Cruz\u2019s to lose. If Mr. O\u2019Rourke wins, the American electoral map will be tossed in the air just in time for 2020. In the modern era, after all, no Republican has won the White House without winning Texas\u2019 38 electoral votes. But the impact of the O\u2019Rourke candidacy can\u2019t be measured by a simple W/L. The Democrat has helped sweep up new and motivated voters, people who will also vote in House, state and local races. After next week, Democratic donors will figure that spending on Texas is no longer gambling.So, what does it mean to be a Texan? Molly Ivins said being a Texan is lot like being an American, only more so. But the great folklorist J. Frank Dobie got it exactly right. Being a Texan is about being open to change. \u201cThe Texians\u201d \u2014 the original Anglo settlers \u2014 \u201care the old rock itself; the Texans were out of the old rock; the others are wearing the rock away.\u201dWhatever happens on Tuesday, one thing is clear: What Texas is not. It is not Ted Cruz\u2019s pandering, ten-gallon circus act.Richard Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "True Islam Does Not Kill Blasphemers", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Quran has 6,236 verses, none of which tell the faithful to stifle blasphemy by force.Contributing Opinion WriterThe agony of Asia Bibi, a 54-year-old Roman Catholic and mother of five, shows there is something rotten in her country, Pakistan \u2014 and in the broader world of Islam.She was arrested for blasphemy in 2009 after Muslim co-workers on a destitute farm denounced her for merely drinking from the same cup and, during the subsequent quarrel, for \u201cinsulting Prophet Muhammad\u201d \u2014 a charge Ms. Bibi always denied. Yet she was convicted in 2010 and spent the next eight years in solitary confinement, on death row.I am hoping that the traumatized family will be able to leave Pakistan safely, to find asylum in some free nation. As a Muslim, I feel ashamed of the cruelty they have suffered at the hands of people who act in the name of my faith.In other words, the militant Islamists who want to kill all blasphemers, real or perceived, do not define Islam. But they do define a fanatic, ferocious, dangerous strain within Islam.This strain has led to various attacks on freedom of expression, the bedrock of civilization, over the past three decades. The first one was the Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s infamous 1989 \u201cdeath fatwa\u201d calling for the execution of the author Salman Rushdie for his irreverent novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d Then came the violent reactions to cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2005. Terrorist attacks on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo followed. And among nations like Pakistan, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, Ms. Bibi is only one of the many victims of blasphemy laws.Muslims who support such violent or oppressive responses to blasphemy are missing two important points. One is that it is them, not the blasphemers, who are defaming Islam, by presenting it as an immature tradition that has little room for civilized discourse. The second point is that their zealotry is not as religiously grounded as they think.To see this, one must look at the Quran \u2014 the most fundamental and only undisputed source of Islam. Most notably, throughout all of its 6,236 verses, it never tells Muslims to silence blasphemy with force. It tells them only to respond with dignity.However, as Islamic jurisprudence developed over the centuries, much was added to the spirit of the Quran, based often on dubious reports about the words and deeds of the prophet. Blasphemy, in particular sabb al-rasul, or \u201cinsulting the prophet,\u201d gradually became a capital crime \u2014 but only with objections from prominent jurists like Abu Hanifa, the eighth-century founder of one of the four main Sunni schools. A bigger sin than insulting the prophet is disbelief in God, he reasoned, but Islam decrees no punishment for that.At the same time, Muslim opinion leaders should help their societies understand that these laws serve not the honor of Islam, but much more mundane interests \u2014 for example, persecuting non-Muslim minorities out of greed or jealousy, or silencing Muslims themselves who criticize and challenge the powers that be.And all Muslims of good faith should stand up more forcefully for people like Asia Bibi, who is falsely accused of blasphemy. Also, they should tolerate those who really do blaspheme and at most \u201cnot sit with them,\u201d as the Quran counsels.They should walk away, saying, \u201cPeace.\u201dMustafa Akyol is a senior fellow on Islam and modernity at the Cato Institute and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Islamic Jesus.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But they can still use their House majority to do more than investigate Trump. Democrats can hold hearings and pass bills that make clear their party\u2019s vision for 2020 and beyond. They can figure out which ideas have the potential both to improve people\u2019s lives and to win over voters.The allure is clear enough. Americans now hold about $1.4 trillion in student debt. Eliminating it seems like the kind of bold, progressive idea that Democrats should embrace.But it\u2019s actually a bad idea. It is the sort of proposal \u2014 alluring but counterproductive \u2014 that Democrats should avoid as they build an agenda.Most graduates of four-year colleges, by contrast, are doing just fine. I know you\u2019ve probably read stories about liberal-arts college graduates who ran up enormous debts and now can\u2019t find decent work. But they are the rare exceptions.I happen to have been an example \u2014 of a college graduate who did not deserve to have his loans forgiven. I grew up in a middle-class family that was doing fine but needed financial aid. My dad worked as a high school teacher, and my mom worked at a local college. I went to Yale with the help of extended family members who pitched in, a scholarship and student loans. In today\u2019s dollars, I graduated with about $22,000 in debt.And I certainly did not enjoy repaying it. I remember grumpily writing the checks. It was a meaningful amount of money for a young journalist. It also became a monthly reminder of how bureaucratically frustrating the Yale financial-aid office had been for my parents and me. If some politician had suggested canceling my debt, I might have signed on to the movement.I understand why sweeping ideas like \u201ccancel all debt\u201d or \u201cfree college\u201d seem appealing. And I know that some four-year college graduates really are struggling. But this country has too many big problems to start showering the upper-middle-class with enormous government benefits.The right approach is a debt-forgiveness program that helps families who really need it. People whose income is below a certain threshold should have some of their debt forgiven (expanding the income-based repayment programs that already exist). And federal financial aid should expand too, with a focus on poor, working-class and truly middle-class families.Congressional Republicans, unfortunately, have shown no interest in these issues. Now that Democrats have the House, let\u2019s see what they can come up with.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bird Rules the Thanksgiving Magazine Cover", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNovember is the high-stakes Super Bowl for editors at food magazines. Here\u2019s how they strategize their cover images.No matter how colorful they are, or how perfectly crimped their crusts, pies are unreliable cover stars. So are heaps of mashed potatoes, even when melted butter, the color of pure sunlight, pools in their dimples. As a general rule, November\u2019s food magazines lead with the birds.Printed covers, aimed primarily at seducing readers at the newsstand, aren\u2019t as important as they once were, before Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and other digital platforms became crucial to the business. But magazine editors say they are still a brand\u2019s calling card, a billboard that drives sales of what is often the biggest, most ad-packed and competitive issue of the year. That was 2016. Like most editors, Ms. Carpenter is attuned to the smallest changes in turkey presentation, from sizes and props to angles and colors, because they shape the tone of the issue and the reader\u2019s response. The issue with the carved-bird cover sold 21 percent fewer newsstand copies than the previous year\u2019s.This year, the turkey on Food Network Magazine\u2019s cover is whole, roasted to a particularly warm shade of butterscotch brown and shot from overhead on a simple white platter. (\u201cYou don\u2019t want the platter to steal attention,\u201d Ms. Carpenter said.) With its wing tips tucked under and its legs neatly tied, the bird reclines on a bed of flat-leaf parsley, surrounded by a few grilled lemon halves.At the magazines that do keep up the tradition, editorial teams are smaller than they used to be, stretching each year to do more with fewer resources. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see five different turkeys with five different gravy spills on my wall, which I\u2019ve seen \u2014 it\u2019s like a scene from \u2018Silence of the Lambs.\u2019\u201d Instead, Ms. Iannotti said she follows her gut, guided by a simple ethos: \u201cI want to make you want to eat.\u201d This year, her team went with a single, abundant plate of food, shot so close up that it doesn\u2019t even fit in the frame: sliced turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and cranberry sauce, all gleaming with a caramel-colored gravy.\u201cI love gravy so much, I\u2019d drink it,\u201d Ms. Iannotti said. \u201cBut it\u2019s challenging to shoot. It tastes better than it looks.\u201dTo get the image exactly right, balanced in color and texture, browned but not overly brown, Ms. Iannotti said she set aside money in her budget to hire an outside team to help with the Thanksgiving shoot. \u201cThey\u2019re brilliant. They\u2019re looking at the gravy color, and is the pepper in the perfect place? And is it messy, but not too messy?\u201d\u201cThree years ago, a beautiful plate of simple Thanksgiving food did really well on the newsstand for Cooking Light, so that\u2019s the path we\u2019ve taken for a few years,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.Mr. Lewis went for a design with symmetry and contrast \u2014 the orange sweet potato and singed meringue in a black oval casserole against a geometric black trivet. \u201cThere are times when you know instantly you\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said. \u201cOther times, you shoot for two full days and you don\u2019t know. Because you can plan to the hilt, you can have a whole roomful of props and you can have six turkeys and prepare and prepare and prepare, but until you see the food under the camera, on set, you just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a feeling.\u201dShe already knew what she didn\u2019t want. She didn\u2019t want to shoot from above (too alienating). She didn\u2019t want to use an overly extravagant floral arrangement (too distracting). She didn\u2019t want a cover that was too brown (the image wouldn\u2019t pop on the newsstand). And she didn\u2019t want to show the whole turkey.Analytics have shown that a cover with turkey slices and sides on a plate performs better than one with a whole carved bird. Pies have mixed results, and cakes consistently underperform.But most editors say they listen to their instincts. They want their covers to evoke an immediate, visceral reaction from readers \u2014 a mood, a vibe, an emotion. \u201cIs it Martha?\u201d Ms. Graves asked. \u201cFor it to be a Martha image, it\u2019s not just pretty, it\u2019s also an idea and it has to feel of the brand.\u201d That means that even without any text or a logo, the image has a way of telling readers that it\u2019s Martha Stewart Living.And that image tends to include turkeys. \u201cThey\u2019re like supermodels,\u201d said Ms. Carpenter, of Food Network, who added that although there\u2019s plenty of fussing over every detail of the birds, there\u2019s no food-styling trickery involving hot glue or spray paint or other inedible ingredients. After the big shoot, which usually takes place in the summer, her team always goes home with plenty of perfectly seasoned leftover meat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Uses Misleading Video to Justify Barring of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration relied on a misleadingly edited video from a contributor to the conspiracy site Infowars to help justify removing the credentials of CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, a striking escalation in President Trump\u2019s broadsides against the press.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, falsely accused Jim Acosta, the CNN journalist, of \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman,\u201d a White House intern, as Mr. Acosta asked questions that irked the president during a formal news conference on Wednesday.Television footage showed that Mr. Acosta and the intern made brief, benign contact \u2014 \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d the correspondent said \u2014 as she tried to take a microphone away from him at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest.But Ms. Sanders posted a 15-second video clip on Twitter that misleadingly suggested Mr. Acosta had pushed the intern\u2019s upper arm. The clip was identical to one posted earlier by Paul Joseph Watson, an Infowars contributor, according to a forensic analysis by The New York Times.\u201cWe will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,\u201d Ms. Sanders wrote.Infowars, which has been banned by platforms like Twitter and Facebook, is known for spreading conspiracy theories, including one pushed by its founder, Alex Jones, that the mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax. Ms. Sanders \u2014 who once encouraged Americans to view the work of James O\u2019Keefe, a right-wing activist, \u201cwhether it\u2019s accurate or not\u201d \u2014 declined to say on Thursday why she had distributed the video from her official White House account.\u201cThe question is: Did the reporter make contact or not?\u201d Ms. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe video is clear, he did.\u201dThere is no evidence the video has been faked. But the editing, including zooming in and repeating several frames, exaggerated the contact between Mr. Acosta and the intern. The low quality of the video, which briefly freezes either deliberately or because of a glitch, adds to the ambiguity, the analysis showed.The removal of Mr. Acosta\u2019s credentials, which curbs his access to the West Wing and its staff, has little precedent in the modern White House. Past presidents have clashed with outspoken journalists like Sam Donaldson and Helen Thomas, but did not restrict their access.Still, the move against Mr. Acosta, a frequent antagonist known for challenging the president during news conferences, was not entirely a surprise.Mr. Trump and his political team are no doubt aware that Mr. Acosta is a useful foil. \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d is a common chant at the president\u2019s rallies, and there is little political downside for the administration to restrict access to one of the network\u2019s star correspondents. The move is likely to rile Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents, buoy his supporters and have little or no effect on those occupying the nation\u2019s shrinking middle ground.And, as with most things Trump, nothing was cut-and-dried.There was the timing: Mr. Acosta\u2019s credential was stripped hours after the president fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and had to explain away a difficult midterm election that handed his Democratic antagonists control of the House. Political strategists observed that a controversy over press rights, instigated by the White House, would make for a useful ploy to distract journalists and perhaps the public.Then there were the players: a showman president and an ambitious television correspondent in the spotlight.Mr. Acosta sometimes elicits eye-rolls from others in the White House press corps, who wonder if his aggressive questions are meant less to draw out information from Mr. Trump than to create a camera-ready spectacle. \u201cMost of the people there were serious reporters asking serious questions,\u201d Chris Wallace, the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d moderator, said of Wednesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cBut Jim Acosta, I thought, embarrassed himself.\u201dDozens of other journalists disagreed with that view, offering public support. The Washington Post\u2019s media columnist Margaret Sullivan, for one, advised CNN to sue the White House on First Amendment grounds.The move against Mr. Acosta also came shortly after a pipe bomb turned up at CNN\u2019s New York headquarters. The suspect arrested in the case, Cesar Sayoc Jr., had been photographed at a Trump rally holding an anti-CNN sign, and the authorities found a \u201cCNN Sucks\u201d sticker on his van.At Infowars, the imprimatur of the White House was a welcome development.The site has lost a chunk of its audience since being banned by several major online platforms this summer, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Apple\u2019s App Store. Mr. Watson, who rose to prominence on the site, has kept his social media and YouTube accounts, providing one of the few remaining means for Mr. Jones to reach a mainstream audience.The video tweeted by Ms. Sanders makes it appear that Mr. Acosta is making forceful, sustained contact with the intern\u2019s arm. The Infowars video also has no sound, so that Mr. Acosta\u2019s \u201cpardon me\u201d is not heard.\u201cIf you look at original, higher-quality videos from other vantage points, you can more clearly see that while there was some contact between the reporter and intern, he did not strike her as his hand comes down,\u201d said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College who analyzed the clip for The Times.The news conference was broadcast on major cable outlets, including the public affairs network C-SPAN, meaning that she had other options than to use a clip put together by a contributor to a notorious site.Infowars seized on the publicity that went with Ms. Sanders\u2019s use of the clip, posting incendiary items under headlines like \u201cDid Jim Acosta Assault a Woman?\u201d Mr. Jones did not respond to a message left on his cellphone. Mr. Watson, who is based in Britain, did not respond to requests for comment.In a video interview posted on Infowars on Thursday, Mr. Watson acknowledged to Mr. Jones that the clip had what he called \u201cdigital artifact problems.\u201d\u201cI ran it through like three different programs and re-uploaded it to Twitter, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Watson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not doctoring. Doctoring is when you change the footage deliberately.\u201d He added: \u201cThe media invented a conspiracy theory to distract from Acosta\u2019s behavior. Sarah Sanders was perfectly correct in posting this video, which is genuine, and it proves her point that Acosta placed his hands on the woman to overpower her.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, Paul, he overpowered a woman,\u201d Mr. Jones interjected.Mr. Acosta did no such thing. On Thursday, the White House News Photographers Association said it was \u201cappalled\u201d that the White House had distributed the Infowars clip.\u201cAs visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country\u2019s highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\u201dMr. Trump has made CNN into one of his marquee targets. In the summer of 2017, he used the @realdonaldtrump and @POTUS accounts to share a 28-second video that showed Mr. Trump himself violently wrestling to the ground an opponent with the CNN logo for a head. \u201c#FraudNewsNetwork,\u201d the president added as a comment.CNN\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, has recently criticized Mr. Trump in unflinching language, calling his anti-press language a danger to journalists. On Wednesday, the network said the White House\u2019s retaliation against Mr. Acosta was a \u201cthreat to our democracy.\u201dChristoph Koettl and David Botti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marooned on \u2018Love Island\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhen a medical crisis asks a young woman to confront the messier aspects of love, she plunges into a reality TV version of romance.One of the greatest joys of my life is watching the British reality television program \u201cLove Island,\u201d a daily show in which six men and six women are placed in a luxury island villa, filmed constantly and encouraged to fall in love. The couple that wins the heart of the United Kingdom wins 50,000 British pounds. The concept is admittedly shallow and heteronormative, verging on dystopian.I did not miss an episode of \u201cLove Island\u201d during last summer\u2019s blistering heat wave, the summer my life turned upside down. It didn\u2019t matter how late I got home or how terrible I felt. When I was especially tired or lonely I often fell asleep watching it and, upon waking, would prod my laptop to life to see what I had missed \u2014 an easing out of one day and into the next, in the spaces I would have been chatting with my partner, Chris. That summer, the pillow where his head normally lay was empty.Within a week of seeing the first episode, I had ordered a personalized \u201cLove Island\u201d water bottle and began sharing knowing looks with others on the bus or subway when I drank from it. Our glances were a sort of communion.The symptoms had started in late autumn, but we brushed them off. We ate salads and stayed in more, partly because he was suffering a mysterious tiredness. It\u2019s easy to see signs in retrospect, the things that creep up on you.There were more concerning facts too, but you see what you want to see. So when the referrals started \u2014 a CT scan, an MRI, more appointments \u2014 I tried not to see anything right up until the moment the news broke: He had bowel cancer.It all happened within a month of the colonoscopy, which is not very long \u2014 half as long, in fact, as a season of \u201cLove Island.\u201d Within four short weeks of filming, most of the contestants pair up and start committed relationships, shyly moving their bodies in bedclothes under the gaze of the nighttime cameras.A month is long enough for your life to change. A day is enough. Ten minutes.Such a turn of phrase is characteristic of him, this man I love.\u201cI love you too,\u201d I said.On the bus home, I thought about how \u201cLove Island\u201d would be there for me, six hours a week for the next two months. It would mark almost exactly the period of his early recovery to whatever would come next.As the hospital days continued, I started to invest my energy in buying new furniture and assembling it alone in front of the contestants, whom I had started to think of passionately and protectively as friends, children even. Their vulnerability made me feel as if I knew them. I wept for them with genuine emotion that I was afraid to express any other way, because when I did I usually ended up lying on the carpet in our hall, hyperventilating.When a design flaw meant that a screw would not fit where it should in a shelving unit, I had to get resourceful. There was nobody to help me, and it was 1 a.m., the bodies of the contestants lithe and bikini-clad, their voices on a low volume so I wouldn\u2019t wake my neighbors.I broke down and cried for 10 minutes, and then I used a shoe to hammer it in. It was as if I were on an island too (my own personal \u201cLove Island\u201d!) with my water bottle and the small matters of survival that I had to solve in isolation, where I was marooned. But my life would have certainly been sad to observe, so I was glad that my new friends could not see the tragic person on the other side of the screen.It gave me comfort to see these love stories taking place outside of the dirty context of reality. May you never see the person you love with tubes running out of their body, I wished for them, these beautiful couples who were all years younger than me, though I considered myself young, and too young for what was happening.May you never know the terror of your future changing before your eyes, children and homes and plans evaporating. May your futures be symmetrical, adoring and sponsored as long as you live.And yet I was glad for them, too, and for the ability to revel in love stories with problems so distant from my own. There was no ugly crying in hospital bathrooms, checking the color of catheter bags or mopping up vomit. No mashed potato or custard spooned into mouths. Only potential and the golden days of new love.I remembered those days, but there was a different love in play for me now \u2014 a wiser one, for which I was unprepared and that I had assumed we would not be flung into for years, decades.He returned home before the end of the season. Though he had not watched any episodes, I had kept up a commentary with him about these strangers to whom I had grown so attached. We watched it, ceremonially. The love story of Jack and Dani, the eventual winners, had already established itself as one of the great romances of our time. Chris held my hand as I wept. The catharsis of crying over these people had been very beneficial to me, I explained.I remembered being a dizzying two weeks into our relationship and understood how quickly the contestants could fall for each other. I believed it was real because it had been real for us. All those years ago, taking a long walk on a winter beach, hair in our eyes and mouths and feeling a happiness so powerful I believed I might die if I didn\u2019t see it through.I believed in the radical possibility of love, the radical stupidity of it, of letting myself fall. I believed, too, in the maelstrom of emotional energy that my screen had been transmitting nightly, restoring my faith, or something like it. To see that even under the most cynical of circumstances, love would find a way through adversity.I am grateful for the slow restoration of normalcy, the new skin of it, even with the pink tenderness still underneath.We are a week away from the wounds on his stomach healing, the ileostomy reversed now, by which I mean the slides are back inside the water park. We cook and talk about the future, freshly aware that what can seem like the destruction of everything is sometimes just the beginning.Occasionally the best-case scenarios play out. Love flourishes in a place that seems hopeless. There is a new love story happening for us now. Day by day, month by month, we face uncertainty but are no longer marooned; we are in possession of a strange and hopeful beauty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Only One Democrat Deserves to Be Speaker", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNancy Pelosi\u2019s skills are a perfect match for the job, and there is no better choice in the Democratic caucus \u2014 it\u2019s not even close.Ms. Kamarck is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of a book about presidential primaries.The final vote will not come until Jan. 3, when 218 members of Congress will have to vote for the new speaker. Representative Pelosi will need 218 Democratic votes. Yesterday, 32 Democrats voted no on her nomination. So between now and 2019, Ms. Pelosi has some work to do. But the simple fact is, at the moment, there is no one in the Democratic caucus better for the job. And it\u2019s not even close. The primary role of a legislative leader has rarely been to serve as the \u201cface\u201d of the party. She is not running for president. It is instead the unglamorous and complex job of making some subset of 435 individual political entrepreneurs come together in the name of a political party. Even her detractors say that she\u2019s best at one of the most critical, if not most critical, roles of speaker, which is to court votes and count votes. Counting is a lot more complicated than conducting a survey. It involves understanding the political challenges of each and every member of Congress and then devising a legislative package that can pass. Sometimes this entails compromise; sometimes this entails structuring the vote so that a member can cast a vote against an amendment and sometimes this entails allowing a member to vote against their party \u2014 if it already has the votes to prevail.Ms. Pelosi has shown her toughness over and over. For instance, in 2005, she played a central role in the battle against privatizing Social Security. For the Affordable Care Act, she united both the left and right wings of her caucus. Later, as minority leader, she managed to keep the caucus together enough to prevent the Republican Congress from chipping away at Obamacare. Like Lyndon Johnson, a Senate majority leader who eventually rose to the presidency, Ms. Pelosi is a machine politician with a progressive bent. To court votes, an effective legislative leader cannot stick to an overtly ideological line. If she were rigid, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold together a caucus that consists of conservative \u201cblue dogs\u201d and \u201cdemocratic socialists.\u201d Finally, a speaker has to be able to win majorities. In the midterms, Ms. Pelosi and her leadership partner Steny Hoyer of Maryland were a very big part of the reason that the party gained at least 39 seats. Mr. Hoyer recruited and campaigned with candidates from the purple or red districts where Ms. Pelosi was viewed as too liberal. She helped raise the millions to make it all happen. They both imposed a stern message of discipline on their candidates, downplaying talk of impeachment and focusing Democrats on pocketbook issues like health care. Ms. Pelosi will need to convince about 17 Democrats to vote with her. In tough districts in the midterms, some Democrats promised to vote against Ms. Pelosi if elected. Having won, they now find themselves between a rock and a hard place; voting against the overwhelming favorite in the caucus (who also happens to be a woman in a year where women gave Democrats the majority) is a surefire way to make yourself unpopular and ineffective internally. But reversing a promise to your voters in your first act in office is a surefire way to make you look like a shady politician if ever there was one.The irony here is that while Democratic candidates were being pressured into the anti-Pelosi faction, Republicans were bemoaning the fact that all the time and money spent on demonizing Ms. Pelosi was a waste that could have been better spent talking about the good economy.Holdouts will be confronted with a lot of pressure to show unity in the opening of the new Democratic Congress. If I had to bet, we\u2019ll be saying \u201cMadam Speaker\u201d for the second time in American history.Elaine C.

Ms. Davis is a writer. If only, in other words, someone told you, \u201cYou need to really prepare, emotionally and physically, for middle age.\u201dBut of course, no one does. We put a lot of time and effort into preparing teenagers for what changes puberty will wreak, but for women, midlife brings another kind of puberty \u2014 perimenopause, a road that we in our 40s navigate blind, without enough information from our doctors or often other women, wondering in silent shame at the intensity and seeming endlessness of the changes.Recently I asked friends on Facebook what no one had told them about middle age. No post of mine has ever garnered so many responses, so equally divided between sad and funny. Or both.There are the physical issues \u2014 the random acne, the skin tags, the cough that causes a little bit of pee, the long recovery time from minor injuries and how easy it is to get those injuries. \u201cDoing something really banal like reaching for the remote can put my back out and leave me wailing like a child for a day,\u201d one friend wrote. And then there are the emotional issues: How will I feel differently about myself as my hormonal profile shifts, as I lose estrogen in the years just before my young children surge with it?The Talk doesn\u2019t have to be all bad. Among the things my Facebook friends noted was that they felt better and stronger than they did in their 20s and 30s, and that they had become much less vain. One friend wrote, \u201cI prioritize the things that are important to me and people I care about.\u201d So your doctor might also say, \u201cYou will most likely find that you no longer sweat the small stuff (except at night, when you will sweat uncontrollably), that you care less about the approval of others and feel less attached to an iteration of your life that you haven\u2019t achieved.

A mix of shame and self-preservation would make candidates less inclined to put out ads that were false or just plain ugly.Adorable.The video was so demonizing of Latino migrants and so defamatory of Democrats that it took a place alongside the infamous Willie Horton ad that helped George Bush defeat his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, in the 1988 presidential election.Mr. Trump\u2019s tactic wasn\u2019t unusual in a year of new lows in politics and media.It\u2019s enough to make a political slasher of yore feel irrelevant.\u201cGuys like me are anachronisms now \u2014 the candidates can curse themselves,\u201d said Floyd G.

{"Headline": "Packing Tips for an Evacuation", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBenefit from my hard-earned experience.Ms. Markoe is a comedy writer.Three weeks ago, everyone in my house crammed our worldly belongings into a Prius and fled from the billowing black clouds that were racing toward us over the hills and down the canyons from the fast moving Woolsey Fire.Unlike the previous fires I\u2019d lived through, this one gave us no real warning. We woke to a mandatory evacuation notice from the city of Malibu, leaving us no choice but to wedge our car into a line of traffic creeping down the Pacific Coast Highway, the only artery out of the area.On the bright side, I got to see for the first time that when driving 1 mile per hour, the engine of my hybrid car really did rely on its electric part and consumed no gas during the six hours it took us to go less than 25 miles.On Tuesday, I was temporarily allowed back into the neighborhood for the first time in 12 days. It\u2019s hard to describe the gratitude and relief I felt at seeing my house still standing there, relatively unharmed. Even my uncleaned messes were as I remembered them. In fact, everything seemed relatively O.K. until I walked around the block and saw firsthand the once-lovely homes of friends that were now completely destroyed.And even the worst of what happened in my area doesn\u2019t compare with the stories that were coming out of Paradise, Calif., at the same time \u2014 a situation so terrifying it\u2019s beyond imagining.I don\u2019t know if the desire to try to take grim data and make it into something useful is built into human DNA or if it\u2019s simply a product of my having consumed too much self-help literature in the 1980s. But as I sit here camped out at a friend\u2019s house, waiting for the all-clear to return home, I find myself overcome with the desire to turn the experience into something useful. I can\u2019t rebuild everyone\u2019s house by myself or do much to help those mourning loved ones lost in the Camp Fire.But I believe I can help you plan for when it\u2019s your turn to flee from the flood, fire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, wildfire or nonspecific global warming related catastrophe that may be headed your way.Of course, I did better this time than I did with the last fire, when I wound up sleeping on a friend\u2019s couch for five days wrapped in the leashes of four large dogs. There, I made the unhappy discovery that I\u2019d packed no bras or underwear, yet had somehow brought along the program from my sixth grade dance recital.That is why I recommend that you maintain, year round, a carefully packed box containing important papers, such as your birth certificate, passport, insurance policies, selected sentimental photos that are too glued into bulky photo albums to be digitized. And by the way, why did you glue them down like that? What is wrong with you? But now is not the time for recriminations. While you\u2019re in preparation mode, don\u2019t forget to include a list of all your internet passwords, even though it will turn out to be a futile gesture because every single site you sign onto during your emergency will tell you that your username or password is incorrect. So forget I even mentioned that one.Having accomplished that, breathe a sigh of relief, despite the fact that when you get to your place of safety, you will discover that repeated emergency raids to this prepacked box of important papers over the years have removed all things of importance and left in their place some old mail and a note full of incomprehensible jokes someone passed to you during a history test in the eighth grade. Why you took these things on an emergency evacuation will remain a mystery that will puzzle the ages.Some frequently asked questions about packing for an evacuation:Realize that all the items of clothing you pack will quickly blend together into one big mix-and-match outfit. You\u2019ll discover that the only T-shirt you packed says \u201cI\u2019m FUN!\u201d in 8-inch letters. (It was turned inside out in the drawer when you grabbed what you thought was a plain white shirt.) Just accept the fact that you\u2019ll be seen in public wearing it with a pair of plaid pajama bottoms, a straw hat and a shawl made out of a duvet cover.No. When I packed a lot of makeup this time, I forgot that an older woman dressed in a T-shirt that screams \u201cI\u2019m fun,\u201d only looks weirder if she also has a face full of makeup.You will have two choices:1) Dorothea Lange\u2019s Dust Bowl studies2) The entire canon of Diane Arbus.The best you can hope for, if all goes well, is a look that says: \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of doing my laundry. Oh, and by the way, in case you were wondering, I\u2019m fun.\u201dYour clothing choices are now a superpower. Understand that a disaster is sent from a universe that finds amusement in backing you into a corner to see what you will do.Would you like to see more rain? Pack only thin cotton shirts and flip-flops. Would you like the weather to warm up a little? Pack only clothes made of wool. Whatever climate you prepare for, the opposite will materialize \u2014 an unexpected consequence of imagining you can properly prepare for anything.Pack only the clothes that are comfortable and utilitarian enough to accommodate spending the night on the floor of a middle school cafeteria, yet are also perfect for cleaning out a refrigerator full of rotting food that has learned to masquerade as an aerial photo of Neptune as it patiently awaits your return.There is something else I\u2019ve learned in my multiple evacuations. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have made it somewhere safely, with Spotify intact, you discover that there\u2019s a Tom Petty song for every moment. Petty is the poet laureate of evacuation. Right now, I\u2019m humming \u201cFree Falling.\u201d Yesterday, I was singing \u201cDon\u2019t have to live like a refugee.\u201dIt\u2019s probably not a coincidence that Tom Petty was a resident of Malibu.Merrill Markoe is a comedy writer and the co-author, most recently, of the audiobook \u201cThe Indignities of Being a Woman.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In our legal system, the record is developed in the lower courts long before the Supreme Court hears the appeal, and the justices don\u2019t get to do their own fact-finding to figure out what happened in the case before them. But one of the greatest challenges posed by moderation of speech on Facebook is how heavily these decisions depend on context; the difference between a racist slur and a rap lyric, for example, might turn on the speaker\u2019s identity, her motivations, her audience. These challenges become even more complex in a global context in which moderators must account for different languages and slang; for different historical, cultural and political divides; and for different power structures \u2014 all of which might color the social meaning of the speech.What does this mean for Facebook\u2019s new oversight council? In short, you need real-world evidence to get real-world context. The Silicon Valley \u201cjustices\u201d adjudicating questions of online speech will need fact-finding powers that we don\u2019t give to their counterparts in Washington. If all that they review is the same lifeless screenshot seen by Facebook\u2019s own moderators, it\u2019s tough to see how they\u2019ll be in a much better position to correct mistakes. That may give Facebook\u2019s users more process, but is that really the process they are due?Then there\u2019s the issue of representation: Who will Facebook\u2019s justices be, and how will they be chosen? As we saw with the recent confirmation battle over Brett Kavanaugh, the identity of our judges matters a great deal. We subject nominees to extreme scrutiny, and the Constitution splits the authority to appoint justices between two branches of government to offer at least some check on that awesome power.Given the diversity of Facebook\u2019s community, the body should be international, represent multiple stakeholders, and include voices from groups that are targets of hate speech and harassment on social media. But that still leaves the problem of \u201cwho.\u201d A 100-person panel might represent Facebook\u2019s diverse community better than the nine-justice Supreme Court represents America, but such a vast institution would surely struggle to deliberate and decide on the questions before it. Still, Facebook\u2019s council can\u2019t hope to gain legitimacy if it doesn\u2019t represent a broad array of viewpoints and perspectives.Finally, in considering the issue of independence, Facebook can learn a few things from our nation\u2019s highest court. The Supreme Court is part of something greater \u2014 it is the third branch in a system that creates a separation of powers. Congress makes laws, the court interprets them, and the executive enforces them. Here, Facebook would, in a sense, still be playing the role of both Congress and the executive. But the court\u2019s role in checking congressional and executive actions is crucial, and it works only because the court is independent from the other branches. The justices have broad discretion in deciding which cases to hear, and justices are appointed for life in an attempt to shield them from the pressures of outside politics.The new council imagined by Facebook feels like an attempt to create this type of independent body. Indeed, Mr. Zuckerberg says that Facebook is creating this organization to \u201cprevent the concentration of too much decision-making within our teams\u201d and to \u201cprovide assurance that these decisions are made in the best interests of our community and not for commercial reasons.\u201d But it is also in the best interests of Facebook: such a tribunal would be a convenient scapegoat for contentious decisions: \u201cDon\u2019t like how we dealt with the takedown of the Alex Jones pages? Don\u2019t blame us! It was the Council!\u201dWith that in mind, Facebook should consider \u2014 especially if it continues to act as a type of governing body \u2014 adopting something like a constitution that is harder to amend that its ever-shifting content-moderation rules, which it could alter mercurially to get around decisions issued by its court that it doesn\u2019t like.The idea of a Supreme Court of Facebook is promising in theory. But how all this will function ultimately rests on choices that Mr. Zuckerberg has yet to make. All we can do is hope that he chooses wisely \u2014 and therein lies the perilous relationship we have with Facebook.Advertisement"}

And lo, it is. They are the Ben and Jerry cows, black and white. They are bred to produce milk. The breed is 2,000 years old and originated in Europe. They are also raised for their meat, and, since Knickers was a steer (a castrated bull), he unfortunately had no future in the dairy business.But, Mr. Sheffield said, \u201cSteers can grow to tremendous sizes at a mature age.

{"Headline": "Fine-Tuning Hublot\u2019s \u2018Art of Fusion\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMinute mechanical movements assembled by hand and a global, yet ephemeral, web of traceable data are opposites in terms of scale, albeit equally complex. And yet Hublot married these unlikely partners earlier this month with the introduction of its Big Bang Meca-10 P2P, a $25,000 watch exclusively available for purchase with Bitcoin, the digital currency powered by blockchain.This union of watchmaking tradition and 21st-century innovation is an apt one for the LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned brand. \u201cThe Art of Fusion\u201d has been its motto since Jean-Claude Biver took its helm in 2004.Ricardo Guadalupe, who followed Mr. Biver to become chief executive in 2012 and who has worked at the company since 2004, was in the room when Mr. Biver, laying out his vision for the brand, coined the phrase. Mr. Guadalupe said that Mr. Biver recognized an opportunity: The house could respect tradition but, at the same time, distinguish itself from more traditional brands by integrating high-tech materials like ceramic, carbon fiber and its proprietary Magic Gold (a fusion of liquid gold and ceramic) into its watches.\u201cThat was the genius idea,\u201d Mr. Guadalupe said during a recent interview at Hublot\u2019s appropriately high-tech headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. \u201cNobody had done this before.\u201d It was a vision that has paid off.A little more than six months after that initial inspiration, Hublot had developed the first Big Bang for the 2005 Baselworld watch fair \u2014 and the watch remains its pillar timepiece today. That initial model took the form of a bold 44-millimeter watch with an innovative multilayered case construction that also stayed true to the brand\u2019s earlier combination of gold and rubber.In the first year of Big Bang production, Hublot almost doubled its sales, going from 20 million Swiss francs to 35 million Swiss francs, or what today would be $19.9 million to $34.8 million.\u201cThe year after, we did 80 million; the year after that, 150 million,\u201d said Mr. Guadalupe, 53. \u201cWe doubled every year at the beginning.\u201d LVMH acquired Hublot in 2008.In a later email, Mr. Guadalupe said that this year the company\u2019s sales would exceed 600 million Swiss francs.As well as innovation on the product side, Hublot has driven its considerable growth through marketing might, building a brand profile with partnerships and special editions for worlds as diverse as soccer, music, art and motorsport. \u201cEvent marketing is our strategy,\u201d Mr. Guadalupe said. \u201cWe make partnerships and we activate them through events.\u201dThere also is an in-house studio producing round-the-clock digital content for multiple platforms (Hublot boasts 3.4 million Instagram followers and almost 4.7 million on Facebook). Hublot constantly tries to engage its young customers, Mr. Guadalupe said, the 25- to 45-year-olds who now account for 70 percent of its sales. \u201cFor them, images and video speak more than any text,\u201d he added. \u201cOur job is to make them dream.\u201dFor example, the brand said that many (although it wouldn\u2019t confirm exactly how many) of the 210-piece limited edition Big Bang Meca-10 P2P sold out in presales even before details were released Nov. 6 in Hong Kong.As for marketing, what better platform could there be than the world\u2019s most popular sporting tournament?This year, for the third consecutive time, Hublot was the official timekeeper to the World Cup. For the occasion it debuted its first smartwatch, the snappily named Big Bang Referee 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, which was worn by all referees and 12 team managers, including Didier Deschamps of the winning French team. (Mr. Guadalupe wore it during his interview, too.) Although its $5,200 price is considerably more than that of many other smartwatches, including the $1,400 entry-priced model offered by TAG Heuer, the 2,018-piece limited edition sold out in two months.Mr. Guadalupe declined to share the cost of the tournament timekeeping role but he said the return on investment, as far as brand awareness was concerned, was worth every penny.He estimated that Hublot-branded boards were on TV screens for a total of 20 minutes during the tournament, which FIFA estimated to have attracted 3.4 billion viewers during the 2014 event in Brazil. In traditional advertising, he said, that kind of reach \u201cwould cost you hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d(The executive is a dedicated soccer fan himself, but he actually wouldn\u2019t be considered a core Hublot customer: Only 13 percent of its sales are made to clients older than 50.)Mr. Guadalupe was born in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, to Spanish parents. Unlike many Swiss children, it wasn\u2019t clear that his future lay in watchmaking \u2014 but he was working at Bulgari when he met Mr. Biver, then chief executive of Blancpain, at the 1994 Basel fair and went to work there afterward.Mr. Guadalupe, who is more reserved than his former colleague but demonstrates a strong drive and a ready wit, said their partnership endured for almost 25 years because their skills were complimentary. \u201cMr. Biver is a genius in ideas and vision about a brand,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a good person to interpret his vision and make the ideas happen.\u201d\u201cSometimes, I also have my own ideas,\u201d he added with a wry smile.Working in product development at Blancpain, Mr. Guadalupe said, gave him a complete eduction in watchmaking that has served his career well. \u201cMy strength is I\u2019m a generalist, like a doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cI know everything in every department, but I\u2019m not a specialist in any one thing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m good at what I do.\u201dThe approach has been valuable as chief executive of a brand that now boasts 90 stand-alone boutiques around the world and has plans to have 150 at the end of the next five years.Mr. Guadalupe said that he did not believe the time was right for Hublot to have a full e-commerce site, but that he hoped its new digital boutique service would appeal to people used to buying items with a few taps on their phones.When it comes to brick-and-mortar stores, the soccer fan was in his element in September, when he was joined by four members of the Hublot-sponsored Chelsea soccer team during London Fashion Week to open the brand\u2019s first independently operated boutique in that city.While he said that being a chief executive in the digital era means he is never entirely away from the business, he had to admit one thing: \u201cIt\u2019s a good life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Too Much Information About Disinformation?", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderWhat started as a one-off opinion video about Cold War-era Russian disinformation soon became two videos and then three as news of 2016 election meddling flooded in.This wasn\u2019t supposed to be a huge project. It began mostly as a curiosity. In the spring of 2017, a source gave me a State Department report from the 1980s that had exposed anti-American disinformation campaigns launched by Moscow. At the time, I was a senior video correspondent in the newsroom, and I started reading with low expectations. I had seen similar reports over the years. Many were unreadable and, given the passage of time, felt irrelevant. But this one read like a movie script \u2014 which inspired me to start reporting. I quickly hit a roadblock: Many of the people named in the report had died. So I put the project aside.In the fall of 2017, when I became director of opinion video, I picked it up again, along with our video archival researcher, Dahlia Kozlowsky. We hired foreign-language researchers to find the original fake newspaper stories, which had been published in dozens of countries. We also found old videos of K.G.B. agents who had defected to the West and divulged incredible details about their careers as purveyors of disinformation. It was stunning to watch these videos; it seemed as if the men being interviewed (yes, they were all men) were describing our 2018 political climate. Eventually, I located a few retired American government officials who had worked tirelessly countering Russian fake news in a pre-internet era. I also found a former Czechoslovakian disinformation director named Larry Martin (previously Ladislav Bittman) who had taken orders from Moscow. He was thrilled to receive my email \u201cafter several decades of total ignorance\u201d by society toward the subject of disinformation and \u201cactive measures,\u201d the broad Soviet political campaign to demonize the West and reshape the world order. Mr. Martin was 87, and he said his poor hearing made a phone conversation impossible. But he generously invited me to his home in a small town in Massachusetts. By this time, we were a small team that included Jonah M. Kessel, a Times videographer who had previously lived and worked in China; Leah Varjacques, an assistant producer; and Adam Westbrook, a co-director. When we arrived at Mr. Martin\u2019s house, I noticed my LinkedIn profile printed out on his desk. Clearly, he hadn\u2019t skipped a beat. He said he had taught disinformation at a college in Boston, but the topic lost appeal around the end of the Cold War, and his class was canceled. (I was crushed to learn that he died months after our interview, before our film debuted.) We produced a 12-minute video detailing the Cold War hoax claiming that the United States military had created the virus that causes AIDS to kill African-Americans and gay people. Over six years, the Soviets spread this conspiracy theory across 80 countries. A small task force within the American government exposed the lie, and a largely unreported cat-and-mouse game between Washington and the Kremlin ensued, ending with a shocking apology from the eighth and final leader of the U.S.S.R., Mikhail Gorbachev. (Never mind that the Soviets revived the lie again months later.)As we put the finishing touches on the video, the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, and the Justice Department indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies, accusing them of conspiring to interfere with \u201cU.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.\u201d Reading through the indictment gave me goose bumps. It resembled those old State Department reports chronicling Soviet active measures and disinformation. The technology had changed, as had the scope and pace of the campaigns. But the DNA was nearly identical. This mirrored how American officials discovered the AIDS lie, by detecting grammatical mistakes: An anonymous letter allegedly written by a \u201cwell-known American scientist and anthropologist\u201d in New York, and printed in an Indian newspaper, claiming that AIDS was \u201cbelieved to be the result of the Pentagon\u2019s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons,\u201d referred to the \u201cvirus flu\u201d instead of the \u201cflu virus.\u201d We felt it would be a major disservice to produce a deep historical account and leave audiences to connect the dots to indictments in 2018. So we began producing Episode 2, which outlines the seven time-tested commandments of Russian disinformation by overlaying the 1980s AIDS hoax with Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that falsely claimed that the hacked emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, contained coded messages connecting Democratic Party figures with an alleged child sex ring run out of the Comet pizzeria in Washington. At this point, the public conversation was evolving into a debate about solutions. Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, testified, and the complex challenge of regulating social media companies was consistently a top story. The Russia story was moving faster than our production. As Trump clashed with his own generals about these cyberattacks, interest in the topic spiked. Again we regrouped, feeling it would be shortsighted to spotlight the crisis over two episodes without assigning some responsibility for the problem. After all, we are an opinion journalism department. There is no silver-bullet solution to this crisis, but I found some hope in Eastern Europe. I previously lived and reported in Lithuania and the Czech Republic, and this summer I found a striking video of leaders from the Baltic States testifying in Washington about the realities of disinformation. When I lived in the Baltics back in 2002, the region deeply admired the United States and aspired to join the European Union and NATO. We were their mentors. This recent video startled me, as it was a stunning role reversal. Suddenly, Baltic leaders were the experts advising American officials, who kept asking elementary if not na\u00efve questions, at which they shrugged. For them, this is an old story about a government that has invaded them for generations \u2014 with everything from tanks to ideology to cybercrimes. As a result, many nations in Eastern Europe have installed progressive reforms to defend against disinformation, which they agree is a major threat to their young democracies. So our video team produced Episode 3, which includes solutions from Eastern Europe and calls on the United States government to consider more urgent and bold reforms. Because we were also busy covering the news and felt the urgency of this rapidly evolving story, Andrew Blackwell, an Op-Docs editor, volunteered to join the project as a co-director on that episode, in which we argue that Western governments are unequipped to grasp the crisis, let alone defend us from state-sponsored information warfare. After the United States was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, we were on the ground in Afghanistan in less than a month. When the warfare is digital, we drag our feet in ignorance, if not denial. The attacks on the 2016 election were first plotted in early 2014, and some of our leaders are still debating who was behind those attacks and if they were real.On the other hand, Russian leaders aren\u2019t politicians as we understand them. From Vladimir Putin on down, many are former generals and intelligence officers who have made K.G.B. stagecraft, including information warfare, a practice of the state. Last week, we decided to publish the series before the story takes yet another turn. Sadly, we are confident this project will remain relevant for quite some time.Advertisement"}

Lowey had some warm words for Representative Kay Granger of Texas, which would give Appropriations a rather historic twofer. It would also eliminate the possibility that she\u2019d have to work with a heavy-duty partisan like Tom Graves of Georgia, who\u2019s been competing like crazy for the job.But you have to figure the Kids and Grandkids would appreciate the thought.Meanwhile, best bet for keeping everything running is a super-compromise in which Congress tosses in a little more money for \u2026 something along the border.

I\u2019ll give up some comforts now if that means I will have a future into which I feel comfortable bringing children. It\u2019s going to take money, hard work, sacrifice and pain. But the sooner we start, the better we can control our destiny.Medicaid expansion is on the ballot in Nebraska, which would make life easier for thousands of people in this state. Kara Eastman, the Democratic candidate in Nebraska\u2019s second district, is running for Congress and I love that she doesn\u2019t accept corporate PAC money and that she supports affordable health care and education. I\u2019m fortunate because I can afford my health insurance and I\u2019m pretty healthy, but I know plenty of people who simply can\u2019t make insurance work.If I had to pick one issue that has always motivated me to vote, it would be entitlement reform. As someone with forty working years ahead of me, I don\u2019t want Social Security when I retire. Every year we sink an increasing portion of all federal spending into mandatory entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. This may sound a little Paul Ryan-ish of me, but it\u2019s a real problem and it\u2019s bad that both parties run away from this \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics. Today\u2019s Republican Party has essentially abandoned the principle altogether. The sooner we get young people saving for their own retirements, the better off we\u2019ll all be in the long run. Georgia\u2019s Hope Scholarship is the only reason I am in college and I work hard to keep the grades to maintain it. I would like to see an expansion of the scholarship so that more students have access, as well as more funds.Stacey Abrams, Georgia\u2019s Democratic candidate for governor, wants to expand access to Hope as well as add a need-based funding component to further help underprivileged students. I like that she is standing her ground as a progressive in a state that has been historically conservative. She pushes on even though the odds and the system are stacked against her. To me, that is the perfect representation of what it means to be a Georgian.We need individuals in office that recognize student debt as a top priority. I fear living a life where I cannot climb the economic ladder because of my student loan debt. My parents were able to save and become homeowners but I fear I won\u2019t be able to do the same.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running for re-election in New York, is the best fit for my beliefs. He has said that ignoring climate change is a gross negligence by the government and he has shown interest in rebuilding education in the state and making public college tuition free for many.As the son of a Cuban political exile I cannot sit back and watch the slander and defamation of immigrants continue. The rhetoric coming from the Trump administration is unacceptable. The most recent attacks on immigration \u2014 Trump\u2019s proposed executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship and his deployment of troops to the border \u2014 have left me shocked. These elections are simply a referendum on the Trump agenda. I\u2019m happy with the current job the president is doing. I don\u2019t agree with him on everything \u2014 his affinity for tariffs and trade wars, for instance, and his disregard of climate change and some social issues, like restrictions on abortion \u2014 but as a recent college graduate, I\u2019m happy with what he\u2019s done for the country\u2019s economic performance, particularly tax cuts. And I\u2019m in agreement about immigration issues. We need a secure border and to end chain migration and the lottery system. I want Trump\u2019s positions on these issues to continue full throttle and I don\u2019t want to see gridlock for the next two years if the Democrats regain power. There\u2019s a joke in Alabama that we rank next to last in everything except football. I\u2019d like that to change in my lifetime. I want candidates who espouse fundamental conservative values and have a record of bipartisanship. I\u2019m missing the voices of certain conservatives of integrity and moral courage on the national level, like John McCain, and am now searching for that representation in local races. There are some days where I see tax breaks, a growing economy and lowered unemployment rates and think \u201cHey, things are getting better.\u201d Then the president tweets a porn star and calls her \u201chorse face.\u201d It is challenging to separate some of the conservative policy from the abrasive and offensive language coming from the Oval Office.I\u2019m tired of people who don\u2019t look like me or share my experiences constantly making decisions for me. I\u2019m tired of old, rich white people, predominantly men, speaking for me and deciding what I do with my body and my life. It isn\u2019t fair that they make the decisions but don\u2019t have to live with the effects of those decisions. I just want to have a say in what happens to my body. I want to know that if I am sexually assaulted again, and I choose to come forward this time, I\u2019ll be treated fairly. The Supreme Court nomination process of Justice Kavanaugh left me panicked. Every single reason I had for not coming forward was validated during those hearings. I want to feel safe walking in my front door and not be worried that my little sister is going to be shot while at school. I want to be able to afford my student loans, and still have a few dollars left over. There have been days that I\u2019ve gone without eating just so I had enough gas to get to work. I\u2019m supporting any and all Democratic candidates. I need to have the tide turn blue so that I can keep living.I believe keeping taxes lower while cutting spending will help the economy grow. Treating drugs as a mental health issue and not a crime is necessary to keep nonviolent offenders from serving long sentences, which leads to broken homes. I\u2019ve voted in every major election since I became eligible in 2008. We get the world we deserve. Not voting, while certainly making a statement, does not move us forward, in most cases. But until a more moderate candidate emerges from either major party, I find it difficult to be inspired by either extreme.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Down Under, More Humane Private Prisons", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesAustralia and New Zealand contract with companies to design and manage facilities and reward the companies financially if their prisoners\u2019 recidivism rates fall.Ms. Eisen is the author of \u201cInside Private Prisons: An American Dilemma in the Age of Mass Incarceration.\u201d About 35 years ago, America began turning prisons over to the private sector. The idea was that private prisons would be better and cheaper than government-run ones. \u201cThe great incentive for us, and we believe the long-term great incentive for the private sector, will be that you will be judged on performance,\u201d Thomas Beasley said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 1984. Mr. Beasley was president of the newly created Corrections Corporation of America.Private prisons have come under tremendous political scrutiny because the more people they house, the more they profit. Most corrections contracts with the private sector merely ask the private operator to replicate what the government is doing.Given how entrenched the private sector is in American corrections, the private prison industry is here to stay. But there are ways to improve these institutions. Currently they are rewarded according to the number of prisoners they house. What if private prison contracts were structured so that they made more money if they treated prisoners humanely with policies that helped them stay out of trouble once released? Prisons exist to lower crime rates. So why not reward private prisons for doing that? Judge them on performance, as Mr. Beasley said.America doesn\u2019t use performance-based contracts. But Australia and New Zealand are experimenting with these models. Two relatively new private prisons have contracts that give them bonuses for doing better than government prisons at cutting recidivism. They get an even bigger bonus if they beat the government at reducing recidivism among their indigenous populations. And prison companies are charged for what the government deems as unacceptable events like riots, escapes and unnatural deaths.Although the contracts set specific objectives, they do not dictate how prison operators should achieve them. \u201cIf we want to establish a prison that focuses on rehabilitation and reintegration, we have to give the private sector the space to innovate,\u201d said Rachael Cole, a former public-private partnership integration director for the New Zealand Department of Corrections. \u201cIf we don\u2019t give them the opportunity to do things differently, we will just get back what we already have.\u201dI recently visited New Zealand\u2019s Auckland South Corrections Facility, a low-lying yellow and white brick structure in the shadow of the local airport. It houses 970 men and avoids many of the dehumanizing elements typical of prisons. Prisoners are called by their first names instead of by number, and corrections officers are called reintegration officers.Serco, a British company that operates prisons globally, manages the facility for the New Zealand Department of Corrections under the country\u2019s first public-private prison partnership. Men who follow the rules, complete educational and vocational programs, and keep a positive attitude can move from the more traditional housing units into six-room cottages designed to prepare them for life outside prison. The residences, which house almost a quarter of the prison\u2019s population, resemble dorm-room suites with desks and bookshelves in the bedrooms, carpeted living spaces, couches, windows without bars, microwaves, refrigerators, cooking utensils and a flat-screen TV. The men cook their own meals and do their own laundry.Even those who live in more conventional cells manage their own affairs through a computer system to schedule family visits, medical appointments and their daily responsibilities. Each prisoner has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and is expected to apply and be interviewed for jobs at the facility. The prison also responds to the job market. Noticing the growth in barista careers, Serco opened two cafes in the prison to provide on-the-job training.\u201cThe prison is designed for rehabilitation,\u201d said Oliver Brousse, chief executive of the John Laing Investment Group, a member of the consortium that built Auckland South. \u201cThe strength of these public-private partnerships is that they bring the best practices and innovation from all over the world, allowing local authorities to benefit from not only private capital but also from the best people and best practices from other countries.\u201dIn Australia, the Ravenhall Correctional Center near Melbourne is a 1,000-bed medium-security facility with 51 buildings spread across six acres. There is no razor wire. The prison is operated by the GEO Group, a global prison firm (with most of its facilities in the United States), under a partnership with the Victoria state government. Men live in five communities in small buildings similar to college dorms. Social workers and other clinicians meet with the men inside the communities; overall, the prison has more than 70 clinical programs. When I visited, a group of men whose good behavior had allowed them to progress to living in four-bedroom suites were making sandwiches for lunch and contemplating stir-fry for dinner.\u201cWhat makes Ravenhall different is that I didn\u2019t think of it much as a jail,\u201d said a man named Cameron, who was released in April and now works as a landscaper for Rebuild, a Y.M.C.A. program that trains prisoners in construction work and hires some of them when they leave the prison. \u201cIt is a place to be if you really want to change. You had to either be in a program or in education. You can\u2019t just stay in the cottage and do nothing.\u201dEven the men who haven\u2019t yet made it to these cottages live in more humane quarters than exist in most American prisons. Instead of bars on windows, there is thick glass, providing more natural light and a better view of the outside.The GEO Group decided that to cut recidivism, it needed to continue working with prisoners once they were out. At the Bridge Center, families meet with social workers to discuss what life could be like when their loved ones leave prison and return home. And those released from Ravenhall can meet with the same clinicians they might have bonded with while incarcerated, work with staff to find housing and in some cases receive vouchers to cover three months\u2019 rent.If the prisons in Australia and New Zealand prove successful, could a similar approach work in the United States? It would require getting beyond simplistic views of private prisons, recognizing that their failures could be a result of the incentives they receive. And it would involve a leap of faith to allow the private sector some flexibility in how it chooses to reduce recidivism.\u201cThis partnership is about moving away from the prescribed way of doing things,\u201d said Jeremy Lightfoot, deputy chief executive of the New Zealand Department of Corrections, told me in his office in Wellington in July. \u201cThis prison is in our network. If it is succeeding, then we are succeeding.\u201dIn America, the government tends to rely on the private sector only when it needs capital. In Australia and New Zealand, governments partnered with private industry to design the contracts themselves and fashion innovative practices to reduce recidivism.\u201cWhat you have to realize is that we are human beings as well,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIf you put the boys in the cage and treat the boys like an animal, they will think they are animals. But if you put them in an environment where things are peaceful and they are treated like humans, they can change.\u201dReporting for this article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Lauren-Brooke Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at the N.Y.U.

Liuba Grechen Shirley, Antonio Delgado and Tom Malinowski, endorsed by the Times editorial board, will be campaigning tirelessly from now until Election Day. They hope to be part of the wave that will help Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives. Ms. Shirley, a Democratic activist, successfully lobbied the Federal Election Commission to allow her to use campaign funds for child care, then took on the veteran incumbent Republican Representative Peter King, who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has whipped up anti-immigration sentiment. Ms. Shirley supports Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage. She says she is running to see more working people in Congress.Mr. Delgado is hoping to unseat Representative John Faso in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley and Catskill area. As he campaigns for expanding health care protections and bringing better jobs to the region, the National Republican Congressional Committee has sponsored racially charged attack ads against him, reminding voters of his brief career, years ago, as a rapper.A former director of Human Rights Watch and an assistant secretary of state under President Barack Obama, Mr. Malinowski is running against Representative Leonard Lance in New Jersey\u2019s 7th Congressional District.In Washington, Mr. Malinowski was a prominent supporter of the Magnitsky Act, meant to freeze the assets of Russian officials tied to human rights abuses around the world. When 11 people were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogue last weekend, Mr. Malinowski issued a blistering statement that went far beyond the words of most politicians: \u201cOur highest national leaders are legitimizing rhetoric once confined to the paranoid extremes of our society,\u201d he said. \u201cThese words are like sparks to the gasoline of disturbed minds.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Border Stunt Is a Profound Betrayal of Our Military ", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president used America\u2019s military not against any real threat but as toy soldiers, with the intent of manipulating a domestic midterm election. Still, we can think of many ways to put the funds to better use, like improving readiness.It\u2019s also not unusual for a president to ask the troops to deploy to the border in support of border security operations. Presidents of both parties have sent troops to the border, to provide support functions like engineering, logistics, transportation and surveillance. But those deployments have been generally in smaller numbers, usually the National Guard, and never to stop a caravan of refugees and asylum seekers.So, generously, some aspects of the deployment are at least defensible. But one is not, and that aspect is the domestic political use \u2014 or rather, misuse \u2014 of the military.Oh, some might say, presidents use troops politically all the time. And so they do, generally in the context of foreign policy decisions that have political implications. Think Lyndon Johnson sending more troops to Vietnam, fearing he would be attacked for \u201ccutting and running\u201d from that conflict. Or George W. Bush crowing about \u201cmission accomplished\u201d when Saddam Hussein was toppled. Those are not the same thing as using troops at home for electoral advantage.Electoral gain, not security, is this president\u2019s goal. Two of us served in the military for many years; while all troops must obey the legal and ethical orders of civilian leaders, they need to have faith that those civilian leaders are using them for legitimate national security purposes. But the border deployment put the military right in the middle of the midterm elections, creating a nonexistent crisis to stimulate votes for one party. When partisan actions like this occur, they violate civil-military traditions and erode that faith, with potentially long-term damage to the morale of the force and our democratic practice \u2014 all for electoral gain.The deployment is a stunt, a dangerous one, and in our view, a misuse of the military that should have led Mr. Mattis to consider resigning, instead of acceding to this blatant politicization of America\u2019s military.

{"Headline": "A Smarter Way to Think About Intelligent Machines", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe should be thinking more about how much A.I. has changed our lives already, and the future of human-algorithm collaboration.Dr. Finn is the director of the Center for Science and Imagination at Arizona State University.To thrive in the era of intelligent machines, we need to expand our thinking. Instead of worrying about godlike super-machines, we should tell better stories about all the everyday ways A.I. is already changing the world. The real A.I. future is already here, but the stories we watch in darkened theaters are nightmares about a distant future that might never arrive.Of course, the risk that machines will be more intelligent, or more competent, than humans is real, and already visible in arenas like chess and Go. But instead of treating that as a zero-sum competition, we could adopt a frame of collaboration. When Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM\u2019s Deep Blue in 1997, his response was to start exploring how humans and machines might play chess as teammates rather than opponents. He helped start the \u201cAdvanced Chess\u201d movement, where humans and machines form collaborative teams, sometimes called \u201ccentaurs.\u201d The best of these centaur teams outperform top chess-playing machines as well as human grandmasters.The most successful A.I. systems out there today are dependent on teams of humans, just as the humans depend on those systems to provide insights and perform tasks beyond their own abilities. Image-processing A.I. can outperform human radiologists at spotting tumors in X-rays, if medical personnel get patients in front of the right machine and ask the right questions. But teams of human doctors will be vital to marrying technology and empathy for the effective treatment of complex diseases.So how do we go about expanding our thinking? The best way forward is to commit to the goal of thinking more holistically about A.I. and then orchestrate activities and conversations to advance it. When you bring together science fiction writers, technologists and policymakers, you create a feedback loop in which interesting things tend to happen. People ask one another simple yet surprisingly profound questions. Leaders in these different fields occasionally realize they have been working with impoverished conceptions of what particular words or ideas really mean. New plans and stories get hatched. From the Science Fiction Advisory Council at the X-Prize Foundation to the value that entities like NASA have attached to science fiction, there is growing recognition in the power and potential of this feedback loop.A.I. is too interesting, too ubiquitous, and too poorly defined to be left to Hollywood mega-franchises or the same old cultural shorthand we\u2019ve been using for 60 years. The thinking machines we should be talking about are not super-intelligences or replicants but rather the just-smart-enough technologies already changing our lives. How will we deal with A.I. that is not alien or omniscient but just a few steps ahead of us, like a good tennis partner?  We have to tell new stories about \u201clittle\u201d A.I.: machines that aren\u2019t trying to take over the world but just get the job done. Most important, we need more stories about real people in these futures, and how we will adapt to a reality where we share intelligence, work and creativity with our machines.Ed Finn, the author of \u201cWhat Algorithms Want: Imagination in the Age of Computing\u201d and co-editor of \u201cFrankenstein: Annotated for Scientists, Engineers, and Creators of All Kinds,\u201d is the founding director of the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University, where he is an associate professor.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s good looking and fit. He\u2019s romantic and attentive. In the minus column, he\u2019s a felon serving a seven-year sentence for grand theft, grand theft auto, credit card fraud, selling stolen property, drug possession and burglary. But did we mention he\u2019s romantic and attentive?Those last two attributes were more than enough for Johnna \u2014 and for the viewers of \u201cLove After Lockup,\u201d the WE TV show on which Garrett was one of the first-season stars.Equal parts dating show and slice-of-life documentary, \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d follows six couples \u2014 one con and one \u201cnon-con,\u201d in the shorthand of the producers \u2014 as they contemplate weddings and post-release living arrangements. The show was the fastest-growing new cable series for 2018 and returns for a second season on Dec. 7. In many ways, its popularity hinges on our seemingly bottomless fascination with all things prison-related, even as the couples themselves try to move on and put all of that jailhouse nonsense behind them.When \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d debuted last January, it entered a crowded field of prison-themed reality programs. Over the past decade, there have been shows about jails (\u201cJail,\u201d \u201c60 Days In\u201d) and county jails (\u201cLockup: County Jails\u201d); maximum security prisons (\u201cHard Time\u201d) and megajails (\u201cLouis Theroux: Miami Mega Jail\u201d); female inmates (\u201cGirls Incarcerated\u201d) and their kids (\u201cBorn Behind Bars\u201d); hardened lifers (\u201cLockdown\u201d) and newbie guards (\u201cBehind Bars: Rookie Year\u201d). \u201cLocked Up Abroad,\u201d on Nat Geo, is still going strong, 12 seasons in. Even MSNBC\u2019s \u201cLockup\u201d franchise, which ran for 25 seasons and spawned a half dozen spinoffs before being canceled in 2017, is ubiquitous on Netflix.The popularity of these shows, for both producers and viewers, isn\u2019t tough to figure out: They\u2019re cheap to produce (no expensive sets to build, or professional actors to pay), and promise both voyeuristic thrills (violent prison riots! Blurred-out body cavity searches!) and reassuring morality tales where no felon goes unpunished, and then some.Elizabeth Barfoot Christian, a professor of media and communication at Louisiana College who has written about prison reality shows, believes that many of them, like \u201cLouisiana Lockdown,\u201d which was set in nearby Angola Prison, feed into and even promote negative stereotypes about the incarcerated. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s no accident that that show was on \u2018Animal Planet,\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cLove After Lockup\u201d is part of this larger trend toward kinder, gentler prison shows, with its sympathetic cons and lovestruck non-cons. The focus on families and friendships over rap sheets has resonated with viewers. The show\u2019s target audience of women ages 25 to 54 nearly doubled over the course of the season; the series finale, \u201cPrison Cells to Wedding Bells,\u201d drew nearly 725,000 viewers.And at first glance, the show seems very similar to a batch of other prison-based relationship shows, like Lifetime\u2019s \u201cPrison Wives Club\u201d and Investigation Discovery\u2019s \u201cPrison Wives.\u201d But the show has one key attribute the others lack: On \u201cLove After Lockup,\u201d the inmates actually get out (or at least most do). And unlike other prison reality shows, which rarely leave the lockups and tend to focus on the most unsavory aspects of prison life, \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d is all about, well, love or what passes for it under extraordinary circumstances like these. Will Garrett still want to marry Johnna, once he\u2019s experienced the charms of Florida\u2019s strip clubs? Will Andrea\u2019s friends still support her after they discover that her fianc\u00e9 has been in prison for the past 18 years, not, as she has told them, in Canada?\u201cI think the couples are all very relatable,\u201d said Kate Farrell, one of the show\u2019s executive producers. \u201cThey have to work out how they\u2019re going to live together. They look at wedding dresses, and buy cars. But still, in the back of your mind you\u2019re thinking, this person was in prison for 18 years.\u201dThe series began life in 2016 at WE TV\u2019s annual \u201cpitch fest,\u201d a mandatory event in which company employees split up into 10-person teams and brainstorm ideas for new shows. The winning pitch featured elements of some of the biggest shows on WE TV, whose bread and butter are reality series aimed at women ages 25 to 54: unrealistic wives-to-be (\u201cBridezillas\u201d); unlikely couples (\u201cMarriage Boot Camp\u201d); and personal transformations (\u201cMama June: From Not to Hot\u201d).As with a lot of reality shows, \u201cLove After Lockup\u201d lives or dies with the cast. To assemble the six couples, the producers looked at online support groups (Facebook\u2019s \u201cPrison Wives of Florida Inmates\u201d) and Instagram hashtags. According to Farrell, they were looking for non-cons who had compelling stories, wanted to get married (like, now), and were currently dating incarcerated felons, but not excessively violent ones. \u201cNo murderers, no rapists,\u201d she said.The first season was marked by unwise acts (over a period of three years, Scott sends Lizzie, one of the show\u2019s two female inmates, $90,000, which she spends on meth and heroin, among other things) and threats from jealous lovers (\u201cI will hurt a chick,\u201d says Andrea, \u201cand I say that in the name of Jesus Christ, amen\u201d). There are questions from nosy friends (\u201cHas he hurt any children?\u201d) and inquisitive family members (\u201cHave you ever gotten shanked?\u201d).This season stars four new couples, as well as two couples from last season whose romances were stymied by delayed prison release dates. One of the newcomers, Caitlin, is a 32-year-old administrative assistant in Washington who falls in love with Matt, a 28-year-old inmate she met through a \u201cstrictly platonic\u201d Craigslist ad. Most of Caitlin\u2019s family doesn\u2019t know about her new beau, who\u2019s in prison for possession of a firearm, stolen property and eluding the police. And although their prison meetings were limited to four visits \u2014 albeit all-day ones \u2014 she doesn\u2019t see her relationship as all that different from other couples.\u201cWe dated,\u201d Caitlin said in a phone interview. \u201cMaybe not to society\u2019s norms. But we spent five months communicating day in and day out. We took time to get to know each other.\u201d\u201cI get that it might not look normal to everybody else,\u201d she conceded.And who says normal is necessarily all that great? Farrell points out that prisoners can spend more time wooing the person on the outside. \u201cThey have a lot of time to write letters. Whereas someone that you or I might date, who has a job and responsibilities, they\u2019re not sitting there going, oh, I think I\u2019ll write Kate a poem today.\u201dOne of the two returning non-cons is Angela, 45, who was stood up by her boyfriend Tony on his supposed release date at the end of the first season, which left Angela wondering if she had been played. That\u2019s another not-uncommon element of the show: For many prison couples, it\u2019s the partner on the outside who\u2019s sweating things out, hoping their lover on the inside is telling the truth. \u201cHe is a manipulator,\u201d Angela said by phone from her home in Mississippi.And yet, there\u2019s something about the guy that charms. \u201cOne of the sweetest things he ever sent me was a half dozen roses he made out of toilet tissue, and colored with Kool-Aid from prison,\u201d she said.In the end, the producers insist, the series is really all about love stories and second chances. \u201cSometimes you do something stupid and you get a bad break,\u201d said Marc Juris, president of WE TV. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a good person and you don\u2019t deserve love.\u201dAnd that sentiment is one reason the non-cons say that they sign up for a show like this. It\u2019s certainly not for all the abuse they receive on social media from strangers calling them idiots and losers and worse. \u201cI did not do the show for fame and fortune,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI did it because people who are incarcerated are so stigmatized by society.

{"Headline": "Pip and Me: A Journey Into the World of \u2018Great Expectations\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFootstepsDickens began his novel in the marshes of the Hoo Peninsula, about 25 miles from London. More than 150 years later, a traveler retraces the path of that book\u2019s indelible characters.But it is here, near the Thames estuary, that Charles Dickens\u2019s 1861 novel \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d opens: \u201cOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea.\u201dOn this visit, having taken an early morning train to Lower Higham, a journey of no more than 80 minutes, my plan is to spend the day walking from St Mary\u2019s, across the marshes to an isolated inlet named Egypt Bay, before returning via a second church, St James\u2019s, in the village of Cooling. Both churches have been proposed as the setting for the opening scene of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d when the young boy Pip, visiting the graves of his parents and his brothers \u2014 \u201cfive little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long\u201d \u2014 encounters the convict Magwitch, who has escaped from a nearby prison ship. (\u201c\u2018Hold your noise!\u2019 cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. \u2018Keep still, you little devil, or I\u2019ll cut your throat!\u2019\u201d)I\u2019m carrying my favorite gazetteer, discovered in a book store in nearby Rochester on a previous foray: Colonel W. Laurence Gadd\u2019s \u201cThe Great Expectations Country,\u201d published in 1929 and long out of print. Colonel Gadd is forever \u201cstriking out,\u201d in his rather upright way, but there\u2019s a likable modesty to his guidance (\u201cI make no claim to infallibility\u201d) as we follow him from the Hoo Peninsula, via Rochester, to London, where the adult Pip is sent when he receives a fortune from an anonymous benefactor. But the colonel\u2019s starting point, like the novel\u2019s, is the marshes.The Hoo Peninsula divides the estuary of the Thames from that of the smaller Medway 10 miles to the east. To get a sense of its shape, take a seat on the churchyard bench and rest your right foot on your left knee: the Thames follows the curve of your heel and sole; the Medway the bony top of your foot. Both rivers open to the North Sea beyond your toes. The marshes occupy most of the northwest of the peninsula, which is to say your heel. A foot is apt for a place that offers such stimulating walking, but the terrain is not without its challenges. If you look at a UK Ordnance Survey map, you can see how wet it is: not only bounded by the two rivers and their mud flats, it\u2019s veined by hundreds of ditches, streams, dikes, fleets and runnels, most of which can only be crossed using infrequent footbridges. St Mary\u2019s, two miles north, was his local church, where his daughter Katey was married in 1860. In \u201cThe Great Expectations Country,\u201d Colonel Gadd maintains that the church in the novel must be this one, since its architecture matches that described by Pip.\u201cAll the other churches in the peninsula,\u201d he writes, \u201chave square stone towers, but [St Mary\u2019s] has a quaint timber steeple, shingled with tiles. Pip saw this steeple under his feet when the convict tilted him backwards on the gravestone.\u201d For Pip, the church is where life gives way to death, but also where the peopled world cedes to the marshes \u2014 \u201ca dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it.\u201d \u201cThe Great Expectations Country\" in hand, I strike out. Marshland is born of rivers: as silt is sluiced down from the land to the sea, the tides in turn lift it back onto the land. First there are the mud flats, covered daily by the tides. As silt accumulates on them, the mud flats rise until they stand clear of the sea for long enough to become colonized by salt-loving plants. Then they become salt marsh, the Thames estuary\u2019s richest habitat. When the salt marsh is drained and walled off from the tide it becomes grassland. In a field half a mile north of St Mary\u2019s, I wait at a railway spur for a freight train to shunt slowly by. It\u2019s bound for London, the driver yells from his window, carrying estuary sand from the Cliffe aggregate works. Once the train has passed, I follow the footpath over the railway and through the works with its churning conveyor belts and towering sand dunes. In \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d the adult Pip remembers fondly the summer afternoons he spent with his beloved Uncle Joe, the blacksmith who is the closest thing he has to a father, lounging beside the Thames at \u201cthat old battery over yonder.\u201d It is there, too, that Magwitch bids the boy to meet him, with a file and \u201cwittles\u201d (food), the day after their first encounter. Close to the former site of the battery, fenced off, flooded, and ringed by brambles, you can see the monolithic, derelict Cliffe Fort, sitting on the peninsula\u2019s heel like a wart. Built in 1870, less than 10 years after the publication of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d to counter the threat of French invasion, it is one of the Thames\u2019s oldest remaining defensive fortifications. River ThamesEgypt BayCliffe FortNorthward HillCliffeHoo PeninsulaSt. James\u2019s ChurchCoolingEnglandLower HighamGads Hill PlaceRiver MedwayA2RochesterEnglandChathamLondonM2Area of detail2 miles50 milesBy The New York TimesA narrow footpath path runs along an embankment between it and the river\u2019s exposed mud flats, which are littered with detritus washed down from the city \u2014 plastic bottles, wooden pallets, plastic ship\u2019s fenders, deflated soccer-balls, shoes. The black hull-ribs of ships scuttled long ago reach out of the mud. Gulls squabble noisily. It\u2019s not a pretty place, or a friendly one, so it\u2019s a relief when the footpath opens out onto the marshes. As the grinding and banging of the aggregate works are left behind, a cooling wind rises from the sea. Even in the sunshine, with the giant container ships plying the Thames, this is recognizably Pip\u2019s marsh country: flat, treeless, glinting with ribbons of water \u2014 a halfway place that is marine as much as terrestrial. The embankment follows the Thames\u2019s high-water line and will take me all the way to Egypt Bay, with the river on my left and the marshes on my right. \u201cIf you like solitude, and fresh air, and open spaces,\u201d writes Colonel Gadd, \u201cthe trip is worthwhile.\u201d The embankment was built in the 1880s to prevent the Thames from flooding the marshes during storms and high tides. It transformed life on the peninsula. As late as 1874, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspector for Schools described the area as \u201clow-lying, aguish, and unhealthy, where no one would live if they could help it.\u201d The \u201cague\" \u2014 malaria \u2014 had been one of the chief perils of living here; the marshes, Pip tells Magwitch, are \u201cdreadful aguish.\u201d When the embankment was built, standing floodwater where malaria-carrying mosquitoes bred was prevented and the disease largely eradicated. As the Thames widens toward the sea, the towering robotic cranes of the London Gateway container terminal dominate the river\u2019s far bank a mile north, but to the south the marshes are at their most exposed and expansive. Looking across them toward Northward Hill, two miles away, I feel my city eyes widening, adjusting to the open space. The environmentalist Wallace Stegner wrote in 1960 that we need \u201cwild country available to us, even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in.\u201d It may be hard to think of this landscape so heavily shaped by humankind as wild, but to know that it is here, just an hour or two from London, still intractable and sparsely populated 180 years after Dickens \u2014 it\u2019s a source of comfort. \u201cThe distance from Cliffe Creek to Egypt Bay is about three miles,\u201d Colonel Gadd announces. It takes him an hour, \u201cas the way is for the most part on slippery mud.\u201d The embankment path avoids the mud, but is more like six miles, and it\u2019s past 4 p.m. by the time I reach Egypt Bay. I arrive sunburned and windblown, my lips taut and salty. The provenance of the bay\u2019s name is unclear, though it has been suggested it\u2019s because a Phoenician coin was unearthed nearby. What is known is that this sandy inlet was an ancient landing place, and favored by smugglers in the 19th century. Beyond the mudflats, says Colonel Gadd, is where the prison hulk was from which Magwitch escaped before apprehending Pip \u2014 \u201cin the topographic sense,\u201d at least, for the vessel once anchored here was not a prison hulk, the colonel concedes, but a Coast Guard lookout. I rest on the sea wall and when I stand, a group of swans rises from a nearby dyke, five of them, passing over the marshes until they are no more than gleaming dashes against the dark woods of Northward Hill. Turning away from the river, I follow them south across the marsh, locating the wooden footbridges that cross the drainage ditches, and finally heading west, until the square stone steeple of St James\u2019s Church comes into view. According to the historian Edward Hasted, writing in the 1770s, Cooling was \u201can unfrequented place, the roads of which are deep and miry, and it is as unhealthy as it is unpleasant.\u201d On this late summer\u2019s afternoon the village has an air of tranquil prosperity, and is so still and unpeopled as to feel like a film set. I don\u2019t see a soul. \u201cClose by the south porch,\" Gadd writes of the church, \u2018are the gravestones of Pip\u2019s little brothers.\u2019 A meter in length and torpedo-shaped, the real gravestones \u2014 thirteen in total \u2014 belong to two branches of the Comport family, victims of malaria in the late 18th century. In Dickens\u2019s novel there are just five, but as his friend and biographer John Forster put it: \u201cwith the reserves always necessary in copying nature not to overstep her modesty by copying too closely, he makes the number that appalled little Pip not more than half the reality.\u201d No reader would believe thirteen. Colonel Gadd insists that the stones were imaginatively \u201cimported\" by Dickens to St Luke\u2019s at Lower Higham, where my walk began. But for me it is St James\u2019s, because of their presence, that will always be where Pip met Magwitch on that \u201cmemorable raw afternoon towards evening.\u201dEven today, in the warm raking light, I suppress a small shudder. A place might inspire fiction, but fiction in turn can shade your experience of that place. I remember my first reading of the novel, long before I set foot here. It was Pip who knew these \u201cdeath-cold flats,\" but that terrifying stranger who would transform his life \u2014 part magus, part witch \u2014 seemed to be the very marshes incarnate, a shackled golem formed of salt-mud and fog. (\u201cKeep still, you little devil, or I\u2019ll cut your throat!\u201d) Once I\u2019ve written my name in the church\u2019s visitor book, I return \u201cThe Great Expectations Country\u201d to my backpack, and start the four-mile walk back to Lower Higham and my train to London.

{"Headline": "Why the Google Walkout Was a Watershed Moment in Tech", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artOutsiders have little leverage to force the industry to change. The companies\u2019 own workers are another matter.However Google responds, little at the internet search giant \u2014 and, perhaps, little in Silicon Valley \u2014 will be the same again.For two years, regulators, lawmakers, academics and the media have pushed Silicon Valley to alter its world-swallowing ways. But outsiders have few points of leverage in tech; there are few laws governing the industry\u2019s practices, and lawmakers have struggled to get up to speed on tech\u2019s implications for society. Protests by workers are an important new avenue for pressure; the very people who make these companies work can change what they do in the world. But the Google walkout suggests something bigger could be afoot. The walkout\u2019s organizers told me that they were aiming to keep that movement alive \u2014 to ask the most important questions about how their company operates in the world, and to inspire those in other parts of the tech industry to take up similar arms.\u201cSomething we\u2019ve discussed as a group, something we\u2019ve locked arms over, is that we\u2019re assembled now,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at Google-owned YouTube who created the internal discussion forum in which organizers planned the walkout. \u201cWe have an incredibly engaged group of people, and we aren\u2019t going to stop escalating this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe group isn\u2019t really going to back down from this or a host of other things. The walkout was not like a blowing-off-steam exercise.\u201dThe walkout was sparked by a specific grievance: a report in The New York Times that Google gave a $90 million exit payment to Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, after he was accused of coercing a woman to perform oral sex in a hotel room (a charge that he denies but that the company found credible). The organizers said their aims were far larger, though, than sexual harassment and abuse.\u201cOur discussions expanded very quickly,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cWhat is it that we want the company to be, and what should we do with the power that we very quickly see we are harnessing? Is Google for good? Do we think that technology is toxic? Are we navigating through a host of complex issues online in a positive way?\u201dSpeaking to Ms. Stapleton and several of her fellow organizers, I was struck by their intoxicating optimism. They brimmed with confidence about their capacity to push for a new moral, ethical and social framework in tech. And because Google\u2019s culture is a model for the industry and much of corporate America, they saw the idea of changing the company as part of a larger social and political struggle to make a dent in the universe.\u201cI think what we did was disprove the myth that it\u2019s too hard to take collective action,\u201d said Celie O\u2019Neil-Hart, who works in YouTube\u2019s marketing department. She described the meticulous way that she and other organizers of the walkout distilled the thousands of discussions flowing through their group into a list of demands. Their secret? Google\u2019s own technology.\u201cI was getting hundreds of pieces of feedback on these demands, but ironically thanks to Google\u2019s products, like Google Groups and Docs and comments, I was able to get this constant stream of real-time feedback from a collective group of hundreds of Googlers, all while doing my day job,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neil-Hart said. She noted, too, that many Googlers had been hired for their work-endless-hours drive; now that drive was marshaled in the service of a movement.Stephanie Parker, a policy specialist at YouTube, described organizing the protest in a way that sounded to me like designing and releasing a new Google product, only with a group that was more passionate and personally invested.\u201cIt was really fun to see my fellow employees flex the skills that a lot of them had developed at Google \u2014 their program management skills, their marketing skills, their P.R. skills, but in the service of this movement,\u201d she said.A lot about the walkout was particular to Google\u2019s culture, which has always encouraged a more open form of debate than many tech peers. Companies more consumed with secrecy \u2014 Facebook, for instance, or Amazon or Apple \u2014 may be less tolerant of a large number of employees who use their tech skills to go rogue.But such a prospect is not out of the question. Tech workers have endless options when it comes to employment; the tight labor market gives them greater leeway in voicing their concerns, and the promise that their voices are valued gives them an expectation that they can effect change.\u201cI didn\u2019t think this would happen, but it\u2019s amazing to see,\u201d said Ellen Pao, a venture capitalist who sued her former firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for sexual harassment and now works at the nonprofit group Project Include. \u201cIt\u2019s another point of pressure \u2014 maybe the most powerful one yet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until recently, there really hasn\u2019t been much pressure at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Fight to Turn Red California Blue ", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig swaths of the Golden State remain conservative, and changing the political fabric and voting patterns of a community takes more than one election. Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \u201cThe Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.\u201dTURLOCK, Calif. \u2014 It started so small. Twenty people in Crystal Sousa\u2019s living room, traumatized by the election of Donald Trump, trying to channel desperation into constructive action. Be the Change, they called the group that coalesced in this small, conservative city in the Central Valley of California. Almost all the leaders were women. Most had never engaged in politics. But they had been PTA mothers, Girl Scout leaders and teachers. They knew how to get things done.Last weekend, almost two years after she hosted her first house party, Ms. Sousa stood on a flatbed truck dispatching wave after wave of volunteers to knock on voters\u2019 doors. So many hundreds of canvassers showed up that teams were sent back to revisit houses where no one had been home the first time. Their message was straightforward: The four-term incumbent, Representative Jeff Denham, was an ally of President Trump, loyal only to the Republican Party, betraying the interests of the people of the 10th Congressional District.Whether their argument proved persuasive enough may not be clear for days. On Wednesday, Mr. Denham was holding a slim lead over his Democratic challenger, Josh Harder, with many votes uncounted, including provisional ballots cast on Election Day and mail-in votes still in transit.Even absent results, Mr. Harder cast his campaign as part of the Democrats\u2019 larger success in retaking the House. \u201cOur real opponent was not somebody else on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was apathy and cynicism.\u201dA 32-year-old political novice who grew up in Turlock, Mr. Harder put together an old-fashioned campaign that drew on lessons from recent Democratic victories: Underdogs can topple incumbents only by organizing, not for months but for years, not after a candidate is chosen but before, not just by demonizing President Trump but by tying Republicans to issues that resonate with voters \u2014 reduced access to health care, attacks on immigrants.On paper, Stanislaus County, the bulk of the 10th district, has had a Democratic majority since April 2008. But as in much of California, party registration is not necessarily predictive of voting patterns. In a state that grew up fiercely committed to repudiating political machines, ticket splitting is a given. Stanislaus Republicans have long held a lock on local offices, even as the county has voted, until 2016, for every winning presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972.\u201cCalifornia with Southern hospitality and a Southern mind-set\u201d is how Ms. Sousa describes the community where she grew up, a legacy of the long-ago migration of Southern Democrats to the Central Valley. Democrats here historically refrained from advertising their beliefs; there were few lawn signs for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, though each carried the district.That changed after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, in ways that both enlarged and further polarized the electorate. A dozen groups like Be the Change sprung up \u2014 Our Revolution, Indivisible Manteca, Patterson Progressive Alliance. The groups came together as the CA 10 Progressive Alliance, united in their determination to flip the district. They reached out to engage the young and disenfranchised. And they registered voters; the total in the district increased 18 percent since the last midterm, almost double the statewide average.As in the rest of California, the biggest increase came in independent voters, whose numbers since the last midterm grew more than 50 percent; they now make up almost a quarter of the district\u2019s voters. That further complicates the political calculus, underscoring the degree to which personal beliefs and connections outweigh party loyalty.It will take weeks of analyzing votes that have not even been tallied to determine exactly who voted and how much of the race turned on support or opposition to President Trump versus the contest between Mr. Denham and Mr. Harder. That the Republican may have eked out another win is a testament to the strength of incumbency and the convictions of his conservative base, who vote far more reliably than the new and the disillusioned voters whom the Harder coalition worked to enfranchise.On the issues, Mr. Denham\u2019s alliance with the president increased his vulnerability. Growers have been among Mr. Denham\u2019s core supporters, but Trump policies on immigration and trade have hurt the walnut and almond growers and dairies that are bulwarks of the local economy. The congressman highlighted Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to help get more water for farms, although the promises have yet to translate to action. And on health care, a key concern for many in a district that relies heavily on Obamacare, Mr. Denham reneged on a promise to vote against cuts in the Affordable Care Act, joining Republicans\u2019 unsuccessful effort to repeal and replace.Mr. Denham\u2019s campaign script sought to distract attention from the issues and sow doubts about the values of the man he only referred to as \u201cBay Area Harder,\u201d often adding \u201cliberal\u201d as the ultimate pejorative. Like many young people, Mr. Harder had left the valley \u2014 in his case to attend Stanford and Harvard and work at a venture capital firm. He was not politically involved and did not even vote until he moved back to Turlock to run for Congress, galvanized by the election of Mr. Trump. The result was an unheard-of army of volunteers with clipboards and smartphones, traditional one-on-one organizing married with apps that tracked progress in real time. Some volunteers stayed with locals and built relationships that, like the Harder campaign, may lay the groundwork for future change.\u201cThis is not just one election,\u201d said Ms. Sousa, a teacher who was recently elected to her school board. The grass-roots groups will continue to meet regularly, regardless of the outcome of the congressional race. \u201cThis is going to change the whole make up of our district. It\u2019s been life changing, honestly.\u201dWhatever the outcome in this congressional contest, the Democratic campaign has laid the foundation for much-needed change in a district where fewer than 18 percent of the people have college degrees and 40 percent rely on MediCal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid. The Harder campaign marked a milestone here in the Central Valley, potentially an inflection point to empower a community badly in need of help. Advertisement"}

Pittman, the former chief operating officer of America Online.None of Zynga\u2019s games are particularly rare. For example, there are scores of versions of Texas hold \u2019em on the Internet, and when Zynga introduced its version in July there were already several others on Facebook. But the company develops its games with the interactive features of Facebook in mind. For example, users can invite their friends to play, or see who is already playing and join them in the middle of the game.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.Zynga has some aggressive plans to stitch together its various properties. Beginning this week, when users join one of its games, they will have access to a universal lobby where they can chat and interact with other users who are playing other Zynga games on other social networks.The company hopes to one day solicit traditional advertisers, but for now it makes money by selling ads to the creators of other applications who want to pull in more users. Zynga charges an advertiser 50 cents every time one a Zynga player installs the advertiser\u2019s application. It offers players incentives to do so; for example, blackjack players can get extra chips by clicking on a link.AdvertisementMr. Pincus says that players click on 50,000 such links each day, although many lead to other Zynga games. He says the company is already breaking even and has not yet tapped its venture capital.\u0095Zynga now has a dozen games and is rolling out four to eight new ones a month. All of them trail behind the popularity of Scrabulous, a Scrabble clone that is one of the most popular games on Facebook, with nearly half a million active users.But in at least one respect, Zynga does not want to copy Scrabulous. Last week, the Web site of Fortune magazine reported that the two brothers in India who created the game had received a legal notice from Hasbro, the toy company that owns the Scrabble brand. Hasbro did not return a request for comment, and Rajat Agarwalla, one of the brothers who created Scrabulous, said his lawyer had advised him not to comment on the matter.Mr. Pincus said he has been careful to avoid trademark problems. Zynga dubs its version of Risk \u201cAttack,\u201d and its version of Boggle is called \u201cScramble.\u201d Mr. Pincus said the company would be interested in licensing game trademarks or working with traditional game makers.Evan Wilson, a senior research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said the online game industry was rife with copycats, which does not generally pose a legal problem if the knockoffs have different names and altered mechanics.Mr. Wilson thinks that if companies like Zynga prove successful, game giants like Electronic Arts, which owns the digital license for Hasbro games, will move quickly to enter the arena.Mr. Pincus is counting on that. He believes his company\u2019s valuable real estate, at the top of the lists of \u201cmost popular applications\u201d on sites like Facebook, could become an essential asset.Other game makers \u201cwill be faced with an opportunity to launch a game in the directory next to 1,300 other games and hope it gets found, or to launch a game with us,\u201d he said.Go to Home Page \u00bb"}

Max Fisher, his tools in a trusty Patagonia bag, covers the trend as one of The Times\u2019s Interpreter columnists.You travel all around the world for your Interpreter columns. What is your tech setup while you\u2019re on the road?Lots of countries block or monitor certain sites, so I use VPNs, which route all traffic through an anonymous server in another country. And I tether my laptop to my phone so I can avoid sketchy Wi-Fi.In which country did you find the way people use technology the most surprising and why?I first went to Myanmar in early 2014, when the country was opening up, and there was no such thing as personal technology. Not even brick phones.People sometimes talk about this showing that Myanmar wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d to come online so rapidly. But it looked to me like the same distorting effect of social media I\u2019d seen in any other country. Maybe the change was just more obvious because it happened so rapidly and Myanmar was already pretty messed up.You\u2019ve lately been writing a lot about the effects of social media on the world. What have been some of your major takeaways?We think of any danger as coming from misuse \u2014 scammers, hackers, state-sponsored misinformation \u2014 but we\u2019re starting to understand the risks that come from these platforms working exactly as designed. Facebook, YouTube and others use algorithms to identify and promote content that will keep us engaged, which turns out to amplify some of our worst impulses.It made me think of the old \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, except instead of a killer robot sent to find Sarah Connor, it\u2019s a sophisticated set of programs ruthlessly pursuing our attention. And exploiting our most human frailties to do it.Facebook\u2019s terrorizing me into mourning a breakup hardly matters. But, for a lot of users, unhealthy-but-irresistible content can come in more consequential forms. Like a viral rumor or a statement of hate we might otherwise know to avoid.Where do you think this might all lead us?I spend a lot of my time asking people this. What is the aggregate effect of routing an ever-growing share of human social relations through engagement-maximizing algorithms?Maybe the effect is broadly negative. Maybe it\u2019s broadly positive. Probably it\u2019s mixed. But it is almost certainly profoundly disruptive in ways that we may spend the rest of our lives trying to understand.Whether they set out to or not, these companies are conducting the largest social re-engineering experiment in human history, and no one has the slightest clue what the consequences are.It\u2019s not that I fear some devastating privacy breach or misuse of my data. Rather, these platforms are incredibly sophisticated at learning our habits and keeping us engaged in ways that are not necessarily healthy for us or our communities. Most days, it\u2019s unhealthy only on the scale of a candy bar or secondhand smoke, but who needs it?Outside work, is there a gadget or software or some other tech tool that you or your family loves using? Why?I do a lot of cycling, for which the United Kingdom\u2019s rural quarters are a paradise, so my iPhone is stuffed with various weather and transit apps.

{"Headline": "Geoffrey Rush\u2019s Defamation Trial Becomes a #MeToo Reckoning for Australia", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rush, 67, is now suing the Australian tabloid that had splashed the allegations across two front-page articles last year, claiming he was defamed. The case has become a moment of reckoning for both the Australian entertainment industry and a #MeToo movement that has been muted here compared with its counterparts in the United States and elsewhere.Closing arguments began Wednesday in the trial, which pits Mr. Rush against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Nationwide News, publisher of the tabloid, The Daily Telegraph. \u201cWe are in the middle of this social movement, the middle of this social conversation and here is a case that is going to test how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d said Zahra Newman, 31, an actress who starred in a recent production of \u201cThe Book of Mormon.\u201dThe trial, she said, is exposing a generational shift that \u201cis challenging for older generations of artists who just think, \u2018Get over it, toughen up.\u2019\u201dGiven the nation\u2019s strict defamation laws, some experts believe the Rush trial is also having a dampening effect on #MeToo.\u201cThis case has done more than anything to slow down the #MeToo movement,\u201d said Michael Bradley, a Sydney-based media lawyer. \u201cThere were a lot of stories being prepared in various media organizations ready to run that got killed.\u201dIn the United States, public figures suing for defamation must prove that the allegations made against them are false and were published with malice. In Australia, by contrast, the onus is on the publisher to prove that the allegations are true.\u201cAustralian media is incredibly reluctant to make serious accusations against public figures because defamation laws can be used to stymie public debate,\u201d said Matt Collins, a Victoria-based defamation lawyer.The Daily Telegraph articles accused Mr. Rush of acting inappropriately toward an unidentified actress, later revealed to be Eryn Jean Norvill, during a 2015-16 Sydney Theatre Company production of \u201cKing Lear.\u201d One story was accompanied by a photograph of Mr. Rush in character and \u201cKing Leer\u201d as the headline. Mr. Rush claimed that the articles falsely depicted him as a \u201cpervert\u201d and a \u201csexual predator.\u201dThe case has attracted a large cast of supporting characters. Backing Mr. Rush is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the Australian theater aristocracy: The theater director Neil Armfield, the film director Fred Schepisi and the actors Robyn Nevin and Helen Buday have all testified in his defense. Mr. Rush conceded to the court that he may have called Ms. Norvill, who played King Lear\u2019s daughter Cordelia, \u201cyummy\u201d but said it was simply theater \u201cbanter.\u201dOne text message Mr. Rush sent to Ms. Norvill read, \u201cI was thinking of you (as I do more than is socially appropriate),\u201d and included an emoji of a winking face with a panting tongue. Mr. Rush told the court it was a \u201cthrowaway line.\u201dMs. Norvill, testifying before a packed gallery last week, said that Mr. Rush made \u201cgroping\u201d and \u201ccupping\u201d gestures toward her breasts during rehearsals, \u201craising his eyebrows, bulging his eyes, smiling, licking his lips.\u201dIn a critical scene, when King Lear grieves over Cordelia\u2019s dead body, Ms. Norvill stated that Mr. Rush \u201cdeliberately\u201d stroked her breast, a claim corroborated by another actor, Mark Winter, who was on stage.\u201cAt the time I was on stage with my eyes closed playing a dead body, so I probably felt very trapped because I couldn\u2019t do or say anything, or move,\u201d Ms. Norvill said.Asked why she did not raise a formal complaint, Ms. Norvill said that the consequences of speaking out as a junior member of the cast would have been \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\u201cI was at the bottom of the rung in terms of hierarchy, and Geoffrey was definitely at the top,\u201d she told the court. She added that \u201chis power was intimidating\u201d and that the other members of the production were \u201ccomplicit\u201d in turning a blind eye.Deb Verhoeven of the University of Technology Sydney, who studies gender inequity, said that the Australian theater industry was \u201ca small world, literally.\u201d \u201cIf you speak up,\u201d Professor Verhoeven said, \u201cyou will suffer the reputational consequences more severely than you might in other places or other similar industries.\u201d The legal implications in Australia add to an atmosphere of fear.\u201cWhy would I make an informal complaint or any kind of complaint if I feel I am going to end up having my reputation questioned in front of the court?\u201d Professor Verhoeven said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s silencing. The ultimate effect will be to shut down opportunities for women to voice their experience.\u201dMs. Norvill is, in many ways, a reluctant #MeToo figure. Off-the-record comments she made to a colleague about Mr. Rush were later repeated by a source to The Daily Telegraph. She was not interviewed for the articles.Ms. Norvill \u201chas been forced to recount her trauma in a fight between a rich old man & a rich old newspaper. Whoever wins, she loses,\u201d wrote Nic Holas, campaigns director for Change.org Australia, on Twitter.In a dramatic cross-examination, Mr. Rush\u2019s lawyer, Bruce McClintock, accused Ms. Norvill of telling a \u201cwhole pack of disgusting lies\u201d to \u201cblacken and smear\u201d his client\u2019s reputation. Key to the plaintiff\u2019s case is that she is only now speaking up. But Ms. Norvill told the court: \u201cI had the least power. What was I supposed to do?\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 90.Mr. Rabin had been in Florence for an exhibition of his work at the Florentine branch of the I. Repin St. Petersburg Art Academy. It opened the day after his death.The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said the cause was a heart attack. Mr. Smoljanski\u2019s Facebook post said Mr. Rabin had been under treatment at a Florentine clinic for a hip injury.Mr. Rabin painted still lifes and landscapes, often imbuing them with wry critiques of Soviet life, but his fame rested as much on his defiance as on his artistic ability.\u201cWhen they gathered in an open lot on September 15,\u201d Hedrick Smith, who was then a reporter in Moscow for The New York Times, wrote in his 1976 book \u201cThe Russians,\u201d \u201cthey were brutally dispersed by plainclothes police dressed as workers and operating bulldozers and dump trucks.\u201dThe international reaction was so strong that a few months later the Soviets allowed another show by the nonconforming artists, but the tensions remained. Mr. Rabin continued to incur official wrath and endure the occasional arrest.In 1978 officials encouraged him to make a trip to Paris; while he was there they stripped him of his citizenship. He lived in Paris the rest of his life, even though he became celebrated in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.\u201cThe Russia-themed pictures that I sometimes paint even now are not nostalgic,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThree Lives,\u201d a 1986 memoir. \u201cThese are pictures-cum-recollections \u2014 just a memory about the past. For no matter what sort of past it was, you cannot erase it from your heart.\u201dOskar Yakovlevich Rabin (whose name is, variously, also given as \u201cOscar\u201d and \u201cRabine\u201d) was born on Jan. 2, 1928, in Moscow. His parents were both doctors, and both died of illnesses when he was a boy; an orphan, he spent the years of World War II living in children\u2019s dorms.In 1944 he was sent to live with an aunt in the Latvian city of Riga. He trained at an art academy there, then studied at, but was expelled from, the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow.It was in the mid-1950s that he fell in with a group of artists and intellectuals who were creating artworks and writings that were outside the sanctioned parameters. By 1958 he and his wife, Valentina Kropivnitskaya, also an artist, were living in a camp barracks in the Lianozovo District near Moscow, their home a frequent gathering spot for the renegades, who became known as the Lianozovo Group.\u201cIts participants were united not by some common artistic ideology,\u201d the art collector Alexander Glezer wrote in 1995, \u201cbut rather by their uncompromising stand in the fight for freedom of expression and the right to display their works to their compatriots.\u201dMr. Rabin\u2019s paintings tended toward the expressionistic and were decidedly unheroic, putting him at odds with the official definition of art.One work from 1968, \u201cStill Life With Fish and Pravda,\u201d featured a glass and a dead fish atop crumpled pages of Pravda, the official Communist Party newspaper, a provocatively ambiguous fragment of a headline showing.In his book, he expressed mock indignation that such a painting was deemed not to fit the sanctioned realism of the time.\u201cI was reproached for my still lifes, for vodka bottles, and for a herring sitting on a newspaper,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut haven\u2019t you ever drunk vodka with a herring? At all the feasts, including the official ones, one drinks vodka.\u201dSuch cheeky works, and his outspokenness, made Mr. Rabin a prominent figure among the nonconforming artists.\u201cMiddle-aged and essentially hairless, Rabin developed the incongruous status of a bald rock star,\u201d John McPhee wrote in his book \u201cThe Ransom of Russian Art\u201d (1994).Mr. Rabin\u2019s wife died in 2008. A son, Alexandre, died in 1994.Ms. Kolodzei said that though Mr. Rabin\u2019s paintings could be grim, many had a subtle ray of hope.\u201cLight, which plays an important spiritual role in much of Rabin\u2019s work, can be seen as symbolizing the warmth of the cultural gatherings in the Rabins\u2019 home,\u201d she said.The light ultimately prevailed.\u201cArtists like Oskar Rabin can be said to have contributed to the ideological erosion and ultimate failure of the Soviet system,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a system where everything was defined as political, it was impossible to escape politics even in art; thus some nonconformist art movements became imbued with political meaning from their very inception no matter what the artist(s) may have intended.\u201dMr. Smoljanski, who worked on his documentary for eight years, said Mr. Rabin led by example.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

For many here it seemed like a good day. The country\u2019s highest court had finally delivered justice and released a woman whose life has already been destroyed by years in solitary confinement. The court decision quoted Islamic scriptures, bits of letters by the Prophet Muhammad and a smattering of Shakespeare. A great wrong was righted.And that\u2019s why Pakistan\u2019s new religious right, which has rebranded itself as the protector of the Prophet\u2019s honor, has threatened to bring the country to a halt.Bibi probably didn\u2019t even know what blasphemy was when she was accused of committing it. There are many versions of what led to the charges against her, but all revolve around a verbal altercation with Muslim neighbors in Punjab, an eastern province, about drinking water from the same vessel. Some Muslims won\u2019t share utensils with non-Muslims, a belief that has more to do with (Hindu) casteism than (Islamic) scripture. We can never know what she may or may not have said because repeating blasphemy is also blasphemy, and writing it down may be even greater blasphemy.

{"Headline": "Founder\u2019s Big Idea to Revive BuzzFeed\u2019s Fortunes? A Merger With Rivals", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Supported byBut efforts to re-establish its fortunes have already begun. The company expects to surpass $300 million in revenue this year, the three people said. To get there, BuzzFeed now sells cookware at Walmart and accepts banner ads on its web pages. It runs a morning show on Twitter, a weekly one on Facebook and another on Netflix, all of which are paid for by the platforms. Its newsroom and its entertainment studio churn out thousands of videos and articles each week, to an audience of 690 million people every month. The company also gets a commission when a reader buys a product on Amazon or other commerce sites after clicking through from one of BuzzFeed\u2019s recommended product links, known as affiliate marketing. And on Monday, BuzzFeed News announced a membership model that provides exclusive access to newsletters and behind-the-scenes content for $5 a month. A $100 donation gets you a tote bag. (BuzzFeed\u2019s website will remain free.)\u201cYou have Vice and Vox Media and Group Nine and Refinery,\u201d Mr. Peretti said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of them that are doing interesting work.\u201d He extolled the logic of combining forces: A larger entity could lobby for a higher percentage of the ad dollars Facebook and Google share with publishers whenever their content, videos in particular, runs on the platforms. In turn, publishers can supply them with content that is safe for users and friendlier for advertisers.\u201cHaving some bigger companies that actually care about the quality of the content feels like something that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said. Though initial discussions involving a few companies have taken place, they were all very preliminary, according to five people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. BuzzFeed has spoken to at least one other company, while other publishers have had separate discussions, these people said. Mr. Peretti declined to name which companies he has talked to regarding any potential mergers. Any deal would be difficult to pull off given the number of investors involved and the compounding losses that would result from combining several money-losing start-ups. Staff cuts would be inevitable.Still, publishers have been getting squeezed by the tech platforms as online advertising rates continue to level off. \u201cIf BuzzFeed and five of the other biggest companies were combined into a bigger digital media company, you would probably be able to get paid more money,\u201d he said. A natural camaraderie exists among the digital publishers, which could make a potential partnership more palatable, said Benjamin Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my competition is BuzzFeed or Vox or Vice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe compete on a day-to-day basis for business, but the ultimate competition here is us against traditional TV and also protecting ourselves against the big platforms.\u201dMr. Lerer and Mr. Peretti have been friends for over a decade, and Mr. Lerer\u2019s father, the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer, is the chairman of BuzzFeed. He also sits on the board of Group Nine. But the younger Mr. Lerer stressed that any business deal between the two would not include his father to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201cConsolidation in digital media is something that is going to happen,\u201d he added.Money for a merger wouldn\u2019t be an issue, according to Mr. Peretti. The sticking points would center on who would run a combined entity as well as how each business would be valued in a merger. The combined valuation of the companies Mr. Peretti mentioned exceeds $7 billion.Other publishing executives acknowledged the seeming inevitability of consolidation. \u201cWe\u2019ll always consider ways to better serve our audiences and strategically grow our business through building, partnering and acquisition,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media. Philippe von Borries, a co-chief executive of Refinery29, said that in the next year or so there might be \u201can opportunity for the leading media and entertainment companies that emerged over the past decade to come together,\u201d provided all parties could settle on a shared culture and vision.Vice Media did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Peretti, 44, started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a kind of experimental project while working at The Huffington Post, an early giant of web publishing that he founded with Arianna Huffington and Kenneth Lerer. In many ways it was a return to his first media obsession: what makes something go viral. In 2001, while a graduate student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, Mr. Peretti got in a heated email exchange with customer service representatives at Nike. The company allowed buyers to customize their shoes with a word or phrase. Mr. Peretti chose \u201csweatshop.\u201dThe request was denied. Mr. Peretti insisted \u201csweatshop\u201d had not violated Nike\u2019s criteria, but the company wouldn\u2019t fulfill his order. He forwarded the email thread to several friends who sent it on to several others. It eventually reached millions of people. Mr. Peretti ended up appearing on the \u201cToday\u201d show debating labor issues with a Nike executive.The story has become the stuff of internet lore, but it also represents the heart of BuzzFeed. The early chat bot became a website, which led to original content and then the formation of a newsroom, which now boasts a huge monthly audience.As BuzzFeed\u2019s audience has grown, so has the diversity of its content. Hard-hitting investigative journalism lives alongside listicles, quizzes and cooking videos.\u201cBuzzFeed has always been very experimental,\u201d he said. The ethos that led to its viral content and mining of memes to explain the day\u2019s news is now being applied on the business side, he said, \u201cto consider commerce and advertising and even donations.\u201dThe company is positioning its membership model as a way of supporting its journalism, despite being a for-profit company. BuzzFeed had experimented this year by soliciting donations from readers for its news division. The high level of interest spurred the creation of memberships, which sound similar to fund-raising drives by nonprofits like PBS.Last year, native advertising slowed down considerably, so BuzzFeed started accepting banner ads. After President Trump was elected, a lot of brands didn\u2019t know what they wanted to say, Mr. Peretti said.\u201cSome of them got scared to say anything because everything seemed polarized,\u201d he said. That prompted the move to accept traditional ad formats.This year, BuzzFeed started selling cookware based on the popularity of its Tasty cooking videos. The company licensed the name to a manufacturer that sells the branded pots and pans at Walmart, a deal worth more than $20 million to BuzzFeed, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Making sure the business can thrive is important to Mr. Peretti, even if it comes in the form of bakeware and banner ads.At a staff meeting in Los Angeles a few years ago, someone asked Mr. Peretti what he would do if he won the lottery.He responded: \u201cI already won the lottery when we sold HuffPost to AOL. After that, I went out and bought a Honda Odyssey.\u201dMr. Peretti acknowledges the anecdote but said it shouldn\u2019t be characterized to mean he doesn\u2019t care about money, or its importance to BuzzFeed.\u201cA company that doesn\u2019t generate money isn\u2019t a company that gets to do very much,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, money is a means to an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Photos That Lifted Up the Black Is Beautiful Movement", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensFor over 50 years, the photographer Kwame Brathwaite captured African-American beauty and fashion, giving visual power to black power.The intersection of West 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in Harlem was, for decades, a center of black nationalism. Street orators \u2014 that\u2019s what they were called \u2014 climbed onto stepladders and made impassioned calls for African liberation.Kwame Brathwaite documented them all.Black Power has been considered the more militant race reform effort, emerging as a splinter group from civil rights, and aligning more closely with black nationalism. \u2018Black is beautiful\u2019 became its slogan, widely hailed in the mid-1960s by its artists-activists belonging to the Black Arts Movement. A lot of the early influences on the Black Arts Movement, like Mr. Brathwaite\u2019s, got lost in this parsing of ideologies. But scholars have now positioned the black power movement alongside the civil rights movement, noting their overlapping concerns and shared visions.Even some black nationalists among them didn\u2019t wholeheartedly support AJASS\u2019s efforts, particularly the Naturally fashion shows. \u201cThere were black men at the time, who could believe the teachings of Marcus Garvey, but still preferred blackness to show up in the form of straight hair on a black woman,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThen there would have been other men in that community who would have said, \u2018These are the most beautiful women walking.\u2019\u201dAJASS leveraged its relationships with jazz greats and black nationalists Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach to get more attention for the group\u2019s work with the Grandassas. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of how the \u2018Black is Beautiful\u2019 message got out to the public,\u201d Philip Martin, the gallery\u2019s owner, said. \u201cIt became a household phrase before people even knew where it originated.\u201dThe Naturally show became so popular it went on the road, traveling to the Midwest to affirm a \u201cblack is beautiful\u2019 message that was barely evident there. The Grandassas appeared on jazz album covers and booked ad campaigns for African and Caribbean magazines.And Kwame Brathwaite helped start it. He and his brother understood back then, years before hair and beauty became strongly associated with black politics, that people, sometimes even black people themselves, were blind to how black is beautiful.Mr. Brathwaite encouraged these messages for more than fifty years. They have even more potency today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Beginning to Lose His Grip", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt isn\u2019t just white suburban women who switched to Democrats. Parts of rural and white working class America peeled off too. Mr. Greenberg is a Democratic pollster.America\u2019s polarized citizenry took a break from intense partisan bickering to produce the highest off-year turnout in a midterm election in 50 years on Nov. 6. Is it possible that all that effort actually nudged us forward a bit?Because the votes were counted so slowly across the country, we were also slow to realize that Democrats had won the national congressional vote by a margin greater than that of the Tea Party Republicans in 2010. In fact, Democrats overcame huge structural hurdles to win nearly 40 seats.At first, the results looked like something of a stalemate. The Republican Party retained and even strengthened its hold on the Senate. President Trump\u2019s approval rating was at 45 percent, one percentage point below his percentage of the popular vote in the 2016 election. Analysts said that Mr. Trump still knew how to get Republicans \u201cexcited, interested and turn them out\u201d and that he had \u201cdeepened his hold on rural areas.\u201dIn the days that followed, though, it became clear that Democrats had made substantial gains. Analysts I trusted concluded that this was because suburban and college-educated women issued \u201ca sharp rebuke to President Trump\u201d that set off a \u201cblue wave through the urban and suburban House districts.\u201d At first, I also believed that was the main story line.But the 2018 election was much bigger than that. It was transformative, knocking down what we assumed were Electoral College certainties. We didn\u2019t immediately see this transformation because we assumed that Mr. Trump and the polarization in his wake still governed as before.First of all, Democrats did not win simply because white women with college degrees rebelled against Mr. Trump\u2019s misogyny, sexism and disrespect for women. Nearly every category of women rebelled.Change in women\u2019s vote, by party, from 2016 (vote for president) to 2018 (vote in House races).AllwomenWhite unmarriedwomen5960%5454%DEMOCRATIC5048REPUBLICAN46404341%4030Shift toward Democrats, in percentage points:20+6+1010\u201916\u201918'16\u201918White women witha college degreeWhite working-class women6159565144423934Shift toward Democrats, in percentage points:+13+13\u201916\u201918'16\u201918AllwomenWhite unmarriedwomenWhite women witha college degreeWhite working-class women61595960%565454%51DEMOCRATIC5048REPUBLICAN464044434241%4039303420Shift by these groups toward the Democrats, in percentage points:+6+10+13+1310\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918By The New York Times | Source: Greenberg Research; women with degrees have at least four years of collegeThese conclusions are based on Democracy Corps\u2019 election night survey for Women\u2019s Voice Women\u2019s Vote Action Fund and a study of the exit polls conducted for Edison and Catalist.Yes, House Democrats increased their vote margin nationally among white women with at least a four-year degree by 13 points compared with the Clinton-Trump margin in 2016. But Democrats also won 71 percent of millennial women and 54 percent of unmarried white women (who split their votes two years earlier). In 2018, unmarried white women pushed up their vote margin for Democrats by 10 points. In fact, white women without a four-year degree (pollster shorthand for the white working class) raised their vote margin for Democrats by 13 points. Overall, white women split their vote between Democrats and Republicans, but it is clear which way they are moving. Interestingly, the white college women who were supposed to be the \u201cfuel for this Democratic wave\u201d played a smaller role in the Democrats\u2019 increased 2018 margin than white working class women, because the former were 15 percent of midterm voters and the latter 25 percent. Will this shift of white women be durable? Mr. Trump is the leader of the Republican Party as it heads toward 2020. Like Mr. Trump, Senate and House Republicans were animated about white males being victimized by the P.C. police. The new Republican House caucus is 90 percent white men; nearly half of the new Democratic members will be women.Second, Mr. Trump and his party maintained their principal base with white working class voters, the shift among women notwithstanding, and Democrats still need to do better. Nonetheless, Democrats got their wave in part because a significant portion of male and female white working class voters abandoned Mr. Trump and his Republican allies.In 2016, the white working class men that Mr. Trump spoke most forcefully to as the \u201cforgotten Americans\u201d gave him 71 percent of their votes and gave only 23 percent to Hillary Clinton. This year, the Republicans won their votes with a still-impressive margin of 66 to 32 percent. But what was essentially a three-to-one margin was deflated to two-to-one, which affected a lot of races.Change in men\u2019s vote, by party, from 2016 (vote for president) to 2018 (vote in House races).All menWhite working-class men7170%666052%51REPUBLICAN504041%47DEMOCRATIC30322023Shift toward Democrats, in percentage points:10+7+14'16'18'16'18By The New York Times | Source: Greenberg ResearchThe Democratic Senate candidates in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania called out the president on these issues and won by more than double digits.There is a long way to go, but 10 percent of 2016 Trump voters supported Democrats this year, and 40 percent of moderate Republicans either voted Democratic or stayed home. For Mr. Trump, this setback will be corrosive, unless he decides to acknowledge the \u201cshellacking\u201d and starts to actually \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Don\u2019t hold your breath.Third, Democrats made big gains because Mr. Trump declared war on immigrants \u2014 and on multicultural America \u2014 and lost. His ugly campaign succeeded in making immigration and the border a voting issue for the Republican base, according to the postelection survey I did with Democracy Corps, which asked those voting Republican why they did. \u201cOpen borders\u201d was the top reason given for voting against a Democratic candidate. But it backfired among other voters.On Election Day, a stunning 54 percent of those who voted said immigrants \u201cstrengthen our country.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s party lost the national popular vote by seven points, but he lost the debate over whether immigrants are a strength or a burden by 20 points. Mr. Trump got more than half of Republicans to believe immigrants were a burden, but three quarters of Democrats and a large majority of independents concluded that America gains from immigration.For their part, the Democrats embraced their diversity. They supported comprehensive immigration reform and the Dreamers, opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall and opposed the separation of children from their families. They nominated African-American candidates for governor in Georgia and Florida and fought the suppression of minority voters. When it was over, the Democrats got more votes and created a new House majority that is nearly half women, and a third people of color. It also has more LBGTQ members than ever before.In short, the Republicans lost badly in the House by running as an anti-immigrant party, while the Democrats made major gains as a self-confident multicultural party.Fourth, Democrats could not have picked up as many House seats as they did in 2018 without raising their share of the vote by four points in the suburbs, which have grown to encompass 50 percent of voters. Mrs. Clinton won many of these districts in 2016, so it was clear that any further shift in the Democrats\u2019 direction would prove consequential. But Democrats made their biggest gains not there, but in the rural parts of the country. That was the shocker.Democrats cut the Republicans\u2019 margin in rural areas by 13 points, according to the Edison exit poll and by seven points in one by Catalist. Democrats still lost rural America by somewhere between 14 and 18 points so that left Democrats in a pickle there. That had implications for the Senate, but it shouldn\u2019t conceal the fact that Democrats actually made progress in rural areas.In the senate races, Mr. Trump looked like a giant killer because he took out at least three incumbent Democrats. But he mainly campaigned in states that he won by large margins in 2016. The Democratic wave exposed Mr. Trump\u2019s vulnerability and suggests a less polarized country. In the face of his divisive campaign, parts of rural and working class America peeled off.I thought it would take Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020 for America to be liberated from this suffocating polarization, but it may have already begun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Democrats Can Deliver on Health Care", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew Jersey shows the way. You got a problem with that?Opinion ColumnistSo what did the campaigns that led to a blue wave talk about? Above all, health care, which featured in more than half of Democrats\u2019 ads. Which raises the question: Now that Democrats have had their big House victory and a lot of success in state-level races, can they do anything to deliver on their key campaign issue?Yes, they can.On the other hand, with Republicans still controlling the Senate and White House, major new federal legislation on health care isn\u2019t going to happen. Democrats may debate about their future agenda, which seems likely to include offering some form of Medicare buy-in option for Americans under 65. And it\u2019s important that they have this debate: One reason they were able to achieve major health reform in 2009-2010 was that, unlike 2017 Republicans, who had put no thought into the actual implications of repeal, they had hashed out key issues over the previous two years. But for now, at least, Washington will be gridlocked (which is better than where we were!).There can, however, be action at the state level.The A.C.A. didn\u2019t, strictly speaking, create a national program. Instead, it set rules and provided financing for 50 state-level programs. States were encouraged to create their own health insurance marketplaces, although they had the option to use healthcare.gov, the federal site. A 2012 Supreme Court decision also let states opt out of Medicaid expansion, and many did choose to refuse federal dollars and deprive their own residents of health care.What made the difference? Solid-blue California, with a Democratic governor and Legislature, did all it could to make Obamacare work: It expanded Medicaid, operated its own marketplace and made major efforts to get people signed up. North Carolina, under Republican rule, did none of these things.And the importance of state-level action has only increased in the past two years, as the Trump administration and its congressional allies, unable to fully repeal the A.C.A., have nonetheless done all they can to sabotage it. They eliminated the individual mandate, which pushed people to sign up while they were still healthy; they eliminated reinsurance that helped insurance companies manage their own risk; they cut back drastically on outreach.All of these measures acted to drive premiums up and enrollment down. But states can, if they choose, fill the Trump-size hole.Now that Democrats have won control of multiple states, they can and should emulate New Jersey\u2019s example, and move beyond it if they can. Why not, for example, introduce state-level public options \u2014 actuarially sound government plans \u2014 as alternatives to private insurance?The point is that while the new House majority won\u2019t be able to do much beyond defending Obamacare, at least for now, its allies in the states can do much more, and in the process deliver on the agenda the whole party ran on this year. As they say in New Jersey, you got a problem with that?Advertisement"}

That communal spirit infused his upbringing.He called his parents and sister. Once they were safe at his house, he hopped in a truck with his brother-in-law and a buddy. They got to a ridge and peered out at their little town.\u201cI looked down into the canyon, and it looks like something out of Dante\u2019s Inferno,\u201d Mr. LaRocca, 47, said. \u201cIt\u2019s dark out, but all you see is fire.\u201dDespite knowing better, Mr. LaRocca got to work trying to save Helltown. The three people in his group, and one other man who was driving around the town, sweated through the night digging fire breaks with an excavator and plunging shovels into the smoldering dirt to put out hot spots.The next day, he said, friends relieved them, though he was not sure how they managed to get in. \u201cBy that time, the whole canyon was burned,\u201d he said. \u201cHelltown was the only sliver that survived.\u201dHis boots were melted and holes were burned into his sweatshirt, but the houses were still standing.Scott McLean, a Cal Fire spokesman, had empathy for Mr. LaRocca\u2019s desire to save his hometown, but was not pleased to hear about his efforts.\u201cI understand why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not advisable \u2014 you will die.\u201dAnd the fires this year have moved with a speed and ferocity that can\u2019t be overstated, Mr. McLean said.Mr. LaRocca said he didn\u2019t know if he would make the same decision again.

{"Headline": "A Celebration Designed Specifically for the Groom, Each of Them", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsWhen Dr. Amit Patel and Martin Fulton met through Facebook almost eight years ago, neither of them had ever dated online. They didn\u2019t live in the same state. Neither of them had ever said \u201cI love you\u201d to a boyfriend, and they had never introduced a significant other to their parents. Dr. Patel had not even come out as gay to his own family.Last month, all of that was a distinct memory as the two grooms rode down Wall Street on white horses to exchange vows in a multicultural, dual-ceremony wedding that included 290 guests, a seven-foot-tall cake and several pairs of shoes.\u201cDespite us being gay, we\u2019re marrying in a traditional Hindu wedding and having a Christian ceremony the way any other couple would,\u201d said Dr. Patel, 40, an oncologist in Jersey City. \u201cIt will be a little different, but we want everyone to see that. We are surrounded by so much support and love, we want to celebrate that.\u201dTheir story started when Mr. Fulton, 31, saw the Facebook profile of Amit Patel through a mutual Facebook friend. \u201cI requested him because I thought he was hot,\u201d Mr. Fulton said. \u201cBut it took three or four months for me to actually send him a message.\u201dWhen Mr. Fulton finally did send a note, Dr. Patel responded. At the time, Mr. Fulton lived in Michigan, where he was studying biology at the University of Michigan. Dr. Patel lived in New York, working on his fellowship after medical school. Despite the distance, the pair continued to send messages to each other. Eventually, they began almost daily video chats on Skype.\u201cWe decided a few months later we should probably meet to see if we actually do have chemistry together that\u2019s not through a computer screen,\u201d Mr. Fulton said of booking a flight to La Guardia Airport. \u201cThese were the days before it was socially acceptable or even practiced to meet online, so I was super nervous.\u201dUpon landing, Mr. Fulton headed to baggage claim where Dr. Patel waited. \u201cI walked up and gave him a big hug from behind,\u201d Dr. Patel recalled. \u201cIt was just all so easy \u2014 there was no hesitation and no doubt.\u201d Both men remember this as a moment when they realized they were each a special man in their lives. \u201cWhen he hugged me, it was a completely different experience than I\u2019d ever felt before,\u201d Mr. Fulton said.The couple dancing before the ceremonies began. \u201cWe are surrounded by so much support and love, we want to celebrate that,\u201d Dr. Patel saidFor the next four and half years, the couple traveled between Michigan and New York City, then upstate New York and Jersey City, to spend time with each another while they each pursued their professional paths. Mr. Fulton had his sights set on business school (he recently graduated with an M.B.A. from Metropolitan College of New York), while Dr. Patel (who is now a partner in Hudson Hematology Oncology in Jersey City) completed his medical training in hematology and oncology. Mr. Fulton, who is originally from Plattsburgh, N.Y., moved closer to his parents for the remainder of his schooling. It was during this time when Dr. Patel forged his relationship with Mr. Fulton\u2019s family.Mr. Fulton had come out as gay to his parents and siblings two years before and had support and acceptance from his family. Dr. Patel, however, had not yet opened up about his sexuality to his traditional Hindu parents. \u201cI just envisioned this having a negative outcome,\u201d Dr. Patel said. \u201cI was prepared that when I did, I may not speak to my family if their reaction was what I thought it would be.\u201dHe said he cherished his time upstate with Mr. Fulton\u2019s parents, Steven and Erena Fulton. They treated him like a son and often talked about the couple\u2019s future. They asked about Indian culture and what different holidays meant. At the same time, though, Dr. Patel admits he felt guilty that Mr. Fulton didn\u2019t have that kind of relationship with his Houston-based family.Dr. Patel decided it was time to come out to his parents, Ashok and Geeta Patel, and to his brother and sister-in-law, who had long been trying to set him up with a woman. He was now ready to explain why he always declined the dates. He first called his brother, Dipul, who immediately responded, \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d Dr. Patel then flew home to tell his parents.\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m gay.\u2019 This is the reason I\u2019m not married yet,\u201d Dr. Patel recalled, noting that he also told them about Mr. Fulton and his committed relationship of four years.He then waited for his parents to respond. His father spoke first.\u201cThis is you, and we accept it,\u201d Dr. Patel remembers his father saying. \u201cHe said, \u2018You can have money and wealth, but our family is our real worth. Family stays united, and as long as we\u2019re united, I don\u2019t care what the rest of the world thinks or what they say.\u2019\u201d Relief and shock set in. \u201cEverything I feared for years and years about this scenario was not the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind, I was going through so many emotions.\u201dDr. Patel then shared that Mr. Fulton would arrive in Texas the next day to meet them. From there, the couple says, it felt easy. \u201cI had always wanted to date someone who had a different culture than I did, because I was so interested,\u201d said Mr. Fulton, who grew up going to a Methodist church on Sundays and traveling around the world with his parents. \u201cI wanted to learn about the clothes, the music, the food and the traditions. They were just so welcoming and happy that I was so interested.\u201dA short time later, the pair introduced their parents during Diwali, the Hindu holiday known as the \u201cfestival of lights,\u201d and then they began wedding planning. The couple knew they wanted two ceremonies, one presided by Dr. Patel\u2019s uncle and Hindu pandit, Shri Sureshbhai M. Bhatt, and another, legally officiated by Mr. Fulton\u2019s great-aunt and Methodist minister, the Rev. Catherine Aiken Cadieux. As if planning two events in a day were not complicated enough, the grooms realized that pretty much the entire Hindu ceremony focuses on the bride. They didn\u2019t have a bride.\u201cIt would not be one of us as the bride and the other identified as the groom,\u201d Dr. Patel said of adapting the format with the help of their officiants and their event planner, Sonal Shah. \u201cWe have two grooms, and we changed it as we needed to.\u201dThe result? The grooms donned custom sherwani jackets and safas from the Indian designer Tarun Tahiliani with Salvatore Ferragamo and Christian Louboutin shoes. Together, they rode white horses during a mutual baraat procession in New York from the Andaz Wall Street hotel to Cipriani Wall Street, where both ceremonies were held. Bollywood songs blasted on the back of a moving truck and all the wedding guests, everyone was the groom\u2019s side, danced in the street with smoke bombs. Even passers-by snapped Instagram photos and waved their hands to join in the celebration.Both grooms\u2019 mothers stood waiting for her respective future son-in-law to arrive at the wedding location. Each blessed her future son-in-law with a series of prayers that ended with glitter streamers showering the grooms.Then it was off for a costume change into Tom Ford tuxedos as guests snacked on Indian street food dishes.

{"Headline": "This Is the Way the Paper Crumples", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a ball of paper, scientists discover a landscape of surprising mathematical order.While working on his doctoral thesis at Harvard over the last few years, Omer Gottesman spent a lot of time at his desk crumpling sheets of paper, especially when he was stuck. He\u2019d crumple a sheet, uncrumple it, stare into its depths, and think, \u201cThere must be something that would make all this mess look a little less messy.\u201dCrumple, uncrumple, crumple. Sheet after sheet landed in the recycling bin, each one blank but for its chaotically creased geography. In time, a semblance of order emerged.The dynamics of crumpling are in play everywhere: in the initial unfolding of an insect\u2019s wing; in the way DNA packs into a cell nucleus, in the challenge of how best to cram a giant solar sail into a small satellite so that it unfurls successfully. Scientists, in turn, devote considerable energy to deciphering, and trying to reduce, this complexity and disorder. Paper is an ideal model.\u201cOne of the key assumptions physicists make is that there are some universal properties that are shared between many disordered complicated systems,\u201d he said recently. \u201cStudying one complicated system could teach us a lot about other systems as well.\u201dThe British conceptual artist Martin Creed once said, \u201cI feel like you can have a microcosm of the world in a work.\u201d He achieved as much with his 1995 creation, \u201cWork No. 88,\u201d a single piece of A4 paper crumpled into a ball. Within that crinkled sphere \u2014 like a tectonically wonky planet seen from afar \u2014 Creed wrangled complexity and chaos, deformation and disorder.As did, that same year, two French physicists at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, Martine Ben Amar and Yves Pomeau, with a three-page journal article, \u201cPapier froiss\u00e9.\u201d In it they introduced the atom of paper crumpling, the d-cone: the tip of the cone that forms when you place a piece of paper over a cup and press into it with a pencil. (A crumpled ball is a collection of d-cones connected by ridges.)\u201cPapier froiss\u00e9\u201d was followed by a 26-page English version, \u201cCrumpled paper.\u201d The authors concluded by wondering if the same topological ideas about curvature might apply to general relativity.So began an early chapter in the physics and mathematics of crumpled paper. And now the latest advancement arrives with Mr. Gottesman\u2019s recent contribution, \u201cA state variable for crumpled thin sheets,\u201d which proposed that crumpling dynamics may not be hopelessly complex after all.\u201cThe surprising thing about the result is that it\u2019s very, very simple,\u201d said Shmuel M. Rubinstein, a physicist and the study\u2019s principal investigator, although he emphasized that Mr. Gottesman did most of the work. \u201cWhat Omer showed is that perhaps the most important aspect of a phenomenon that\u2019s considered to be really chaotic \u2014 a paradigm of disorder and complexity and uncertainty, like the butterfly-flapping-its-wings metaphor \u2014 is remarkably predictable, deterministic and simple.\u201dThe methodology was straightforward, anyway. In the lab, Mr. Gottesman crushed hundreds of sheets of paper in a cylindrical container. This was scientific paper, elastoplastic Mylar sheets, which were less likely to inflict paper cuts, or to wilt into a tissue when subjected to repeated crumpling.Like a palm reader intuiting a life line, Mr. Gottesman analyzed the creases of the crumpled paper and sought to tease out a variable, an equation, a law \u2014 something that predicted what would occur with the next crumple.He toyed with a number of variables: the range of individual crease lengths; the distances between creases; the largest patch without creases; the sharpness of creases, and the amount of energy needed to cause crumpling.From one crumple to the next, he observed that a piece of paper never stopped forming new creases, although the rate of their formation slowed logarithmically. With each new crumple, the paper creased along some of its existing scars, but there always came a point when new creases were needed for crumpling to continue.\u201cIn the lab, I crumpled as many as 70 times,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. \u201cUsually after four or five times you can\u2019t really easily see a difference between one crumple to the next.\u201dHe did, however, notice a trend involving the cumulative total length of all creases on a sheet after each crumple. In the lab, this variable was called \u201cthe mileage.\u201dAs Mr. Gottesman crumpled, he scanned each sheet into his computer, and then, with an algorithm, he measured the sum total of all the creases. He found that if he crumpled two separate sheets, each sheet would, as expected, accumulate damage in a unique way. But the total crease lengths of the two sheets stayed remarkably similar. Length seemed to be a deterministic variable, a so-called state variable, predicting how the network of creases would evolve.\u201cThe detailed history of the crumpling dynamics is written into the intricate pattern of creases,\u201d Mr. Gottesman and his co-authors wrote. \u201cNo two crumpled sheets are identical.\u201dAnd yet the paper is effectively devoid of memory. At each state of crumple, the intricate crease patterns, and the events that led to them, are irrelevant. All that is needed to predict the paper\u2019s next state is the total length of creases in the current one. \u201cYou just care about the current state,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. The news that crumpled paper obeys a state variable \u2014 or a crease law, or a damage law \u2014 has been received in the academy with wonderment and delight, since, as the authors noted, it represented \u201ca remarkable reduction in complexity.\u201d\u201cThe idea that crumpling can be characterized by as simple a quantity as the length of creases is extremely interesting,\u201d said Dr. Ben Amar. \u201cIt will be marvelous if this experimental work is continued by a theoretical treatment\u201d \u2014 that is, with equations derived from the laws of elasticity.Thomas Witten, a physicist at the University of Chicago, found the result striking and puzzling. \u201cIt could prove very exciting,\u201d he said. Witten\u2019s research has shown that every material crumples in roughly the same way \u2014 a tectonic plate, a cell membrane, the graphene in a Buckyball, the fabric of Mona Lisa\u2019s right sleeve as depicted by Leonardo da Vinci, which, for Dr. Witten, folds in a way reminiscent of the human ear.For Dr. Rubinstein, the damage law is inspiring. It suggests that other complex phenomena might reveal themselves in a comparable way \u2014 \u201csystems that are more mysterious, where you can\u2019t so easily see the scarring and the breakage,\u201d he said. For instance, why do different proteins fold so reliably into similar shapes, and under what conditions do they fail to fold?With paper, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re doing something very arbitrary. We\u2019re crumpling, flattening, crumpling, flattening. Basically, we are just cycling the system.\u201d Many systems, including the human body, work the same way, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how damage and defects are accumulating, and that is a big question in materials science and in engineering. When will something break? How it will break? These are the most uncertain statistical things in nature. We are helpless against them. But at least for the crumpled paper, it seems like nature is transcending this uncertainty.\u201dThe demise of paper has been predicted for some time now, but paper, it seems, may not be done with us. Paper defies history, in more ways than one. Its scars and creases may even hold a potential philosophy.\u201cIt\u2019s a good metaphor,\u201d Dr. Rubinstein said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s really hard to imagine that the future depends only on the current situation. We are such a strong function of our history \u2014 personal history, global history, whatnot. It is really counterintuitive to say, Well, our future really only depends on our current state of mind, and not how it developed, how we got to this point.\u201cWe have the same intuition for any complex system: that its evolution is something very strongly dependent on many points in time, many degrees of freedom, and you have to know so many of them. Finding out that you don\u2019t is a pretty big deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Fight, Not Spread, Fear and Lies", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow can the media avoid the misinformation trap?Opinion ColumnistSomething continues to nag at me about the midterm elections.It\u2019s the way we in the news media too often allowed ourselves to be manipulated by President Trump to heighten fears about the immigrant caravan from Central America so as to benefit Republican candidates. Obviously there were many journalists who pushed back on the president\u2019s narrative, but on the whole I\u2019m afraid news organizations became a channel for carefully calculated fear-mongering about refugees.The problem is that too often we in the media engage in the same kind of profit chasing. The news business model is in part about attracting eyeballs, and cable television in particular sees that as long as the topic is President Trump, revenues follow. So when Trump makes false statements about America being invaded by Central American refugees, he not only gets coverage, but also manages to control the media agenda.\u201cThere has not been a great deal of soul searching in the traditional media on their role in this,\u201d Stamos told me. \u201cThere is no easy answer for what legitimate journalists should do when newsworthy information is strategically leaked, but there might be some options to cover these stories without providing massive amplification.\u201dSolutions are complicated, for there may well be a public interest in seeing purloined material; if Trump\u2019s tax returns showed up in my mailbox, I would report on them even if I thought that China had stolen them and was using me to undermine the White House. Likewise, we do have to cover what a president says, even if it\u2019s false, bigoted or demagogic \u2014 but I think we can try harder to make crystal clear the efforts at manipulating the public.One challenge is that fact-checking doesn\u2019t work very well. Social psychology experiments have found that when people are presented with factual corrections that contradict their beliefs, they may cling to mistaken beliefs more strongly than ever. This is called the \u201cbackfire effect.\u201dConsider the statements, \u201cMillions of illegal votes were cast\u201d and, \u201cExperts dispute Trump\u2019s claim that millions of illegal votes were cast.\u201d The former is false, the latter correct, but Professor Persily says that the cognitive impact on news consumers is roughly the same, seeding doubts about illegal voting.This presents the media with a dilemma. How do we cover lies without compounding them? My answer is that we have to try harder, relying on evidence about what kind of fact-checking seems more successful. There\u2019s an emerging literature on this topic, and not surprisingly it appears to be more effective to quote Republicans than Democrats in correcting a G.O.P. narrative. Mocking people for their worldview is counterproductive.We\u2019ve managed effective fact-checking at crucial junctures in the past: The great Edward R. Murrow deflated Joseph McCarthy, and some heroic news reporters (often from the South) covered the civil rights struggle in ways that changed attitudes rather than reinforcing prejudices.So let\u2019s start asking ourselves the tough questions we ask of Facebook and others. We must try harder to avoid becoming a channel to spread disinformation, hatred or lies.*Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scouring for Stacey Abrams Votes, Georgia\u2019s Democrats Keep on Campaigning", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The allies of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate trailing in the Georgia governor\u2019s race, hit the streets and the phones on Friday in a vigorous last-minute push to get anyone who cast a provisional ballot to ensure that their vote would count, in the hopes of forcing the close, bitter and expensive contest into a runoff.It was a dramatic and unorthodox political effort, a kind of post-campaign campaign to give Ms. Abrams the chance to go into a Dec. 4 overtime round with Brian Kemp, her Republican adversary.Earlier this week, Mr. Kemp declared victory in the race and argued that no math could bring his total to less than 50 percent, which would automatically force a runoff. Mr. Kemp currently has 50.3% of the 3.9 million total votes cast, leading Ms. Abrams by about 63,000 votes.It is not clear whether there are enough uncounted votes to help Ms. Abrams. She needs to amass about 24,000 votes to prompt a recount, and is just shy of 26,000 votes to pull Mr. Kemp below a bare majority and force a runoff next month.The office of the secretary of state \u2014 which was occupied by Mr. Kemp until he resigned on Thursday \u2014 said on Wednesday night that it believed fewer than 25,000 votes remained to be tabulated across the state, including fewer than 22,000 provisional ballots.Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign questioned those statistics, contending that with military and overseas ballots facing a Friday deadline for return, there was no way for the state to know how many ballots were pending.The suspicion about Mr. Kemp\u2019s motives run deep in Georgia. He has overseen legal purges of more than 1.5 million inactive voters, and moved more than 50,000 voters to \u201cpending\u201d status because their registration forms did not precisely match personal information on government databases. He has also basked in the support of Mr. Trump, who has made numerous unsupported voter fraud allegations.\u201cWhat Georgia and the country is witnessing in this election is blatant and callous voter suppression,\u201d said State Senator Nikema Williams, state director of Care in Action, an advocacy group for domestic workers that also arranged much of the postelection phone banking. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to defend democracy in the cradle of the civil rights movement.\u201dLate Friday, a pair of groups, including Care in Action, said that at least 12 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties had \u201cprematurely certified election results.\u201dCandice Broce, a spokeswoman for the Georgia secretary of state, did not immediately respond to a message on Friday.Mr. Kemp has called accusations of voter suppression a \u201cfarce,\u201d and noted that registrations rose about one million statewide after he took office in 2010.There was also widespread mistrust about his office\u2019s claims about the number of uncounted ballots. \u201cI don\u2019t trust anything he says around the numbers,\u201d Ms. Williams said in an interview. \u201cWhat I do want to make sure is that every vote is counted.\u201dThe effort to lock down the provisional votes unfolded Friday as an end-of-day deadline approached. The activists\u2019 main target on Friday were those Georgia voters who had showed up to vote but had some kind of issue proving their identity at the polls.Such voters were allowed to vote with a provisional ballot on Tuesday, but their ballots would not be counted unless they returned to their county elections boards with a valid ID to rectify any outstanding problems.We\u2019re tracking the votes as they are tallied in two races for governor and two for Senate that have slim margins.In Fulton County, which covers much of Atlanta, those problems had to be addressed before a 5 p.m. deadline.And so a call for help went out among grass-roots liberal groups around the state. At a maze of cubicles at an office space in Atlanta\u2019s Candler Park neighborhood, individual volunteers showed up after heeding calls pinging around online grass-roots networks, and began dialing as part of an effort overseen by Care in Action.In front of them computers gave names of voters who were thought to have voted provisionally \u2014 lists that activists had demanded from elections officials in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties.Marisa Franco, a 27-year-old volunteer and a psychology professor, called a voter and, reading from a script, said, \u201cThe Georgia election isn\u2019t over yet.\u201dShe continued: \u201cYou need to go to your county election office ASAP to verify your ID. Once you go, ask them to give you proof that your vote has been counted.\u201dProfessor Franco saw the call for volunteers on Facebook. \u201cI feel like there is a lot of despair around a lot of the voter suppression things going on in Georgia,\u201d she said.She also held out hope that the votes could be found somewhere, and that Ms. Abrams would be able to fight on. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think she had a chance,\u201d she said.The campaign also extended to cities in Georgia\u2019s south, like Albany and Savannah, where Ms. Abrams performed well, and in Atlanta\u2019s vote-rich suburbs, former bastions of Republican power that have undergone immense demographic changes and increasingly vote for Democrats in statewide races.Around midday on Friday at the suburban Gwinnett Place Mall, volunteers shuffled into a Democratic office wedged between a shoe store and a vacant space to contact voters who had cast provisional ballots.\u201cI really want Stacey to win, and I think that the whole process with Kemp has been unethical,\u201d said Deb Morelli, a retired paralegal, who drove from neighboring DeKalb County to volunteer after receiving a Thursday night text message asking for her help. \u201cThis is amazing for Georgia that we could come close to having a Democrat.\u201dIn a lawsuit filed Thursday, Democrats argued that circumstances like Hurricane Michael had kept Dougherty County voters from receiving their ballots quickly. On Friday, a judge agreed, allowing the county to accept ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday and received by Friday. But it was unclear how many ballots would be added to the tally as a result.A few hours before the Fulton County deadline, a group of canvassers with the New Georgia Project, a get-out-the-vote group Ms. Abrams founded, fanned out across the Atlanta University Center, home to a cluster of historically black colleges.This was a sea of voters that had been well fished. Ms. Abrams is a graduate one of the famed schools, Spelman College. A week ago former President Barack Obama went to Morehouse College to stump for her.Still, canvassers asked young people walking by if they had voted provisionally. Patrick McCaskey, a New Georgia Project employee, found one such voter, after many unsuccessful tries.He was a slim young man burdened with a large backpack. \u201cYou know, you\u2019ve got to get to the county before 5 o\u2019clock,\u201d Mr. McCaskey said.The young man said something about having to get to class. Mr. McCaskey gave him a flier with instructions, and hoped for the best.\u201cIt\u2019s good to put the literature in their hands,\u201d Mr. McCaskey said. \u201cAt least it reminds them.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Atlanta, and Alan Blinder from Duluth, Ga.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tracing a Meme From the Internet\u2019s Fringe to a Republican Slogan", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "Advertisement\nSince President Trump\u2019s election, his loyalists online have provided him with a steady stream of provocative posts and shareable memes, often filtered up from platforms like Reddit through media channels like Fox News. In return, Mr. Trump has championed many of their messages as his own, amplifying them back to his larger base.This feedback loop is how #JobsNotMobs came to be. In less than two weeks, the three-word phrase expanded from corners of the right-wing internet onto some of the most prominent political stages in the country, days before the midterm elections.\u00a0\u00a0On Oct. 11, a video went viral on Twitter. The clip alternated between footage of angry protesters and clips of cable news anchors discouraging the use of the word \u201cmobs\u201d to describe those activists.The \u201cmob\u201d depiction is rooted in the right-wing talking point that Republicans are the rational alternatives to violent left-wing protesters, like the so-called anti-fascists who clashed with far-right groups last year.Soon after the \u201csupercut\u201d video went viral, the phrase \u201cjobs not mobs\u201d began gaining momentum.The \u201cjobs\u201d part of the phrase refers to the record low unemployment and job growth in the United States, for which Mr. Trump has taken credit.Scott Adams, the creator of the \u201cDilbert\u201d cartoon strip, quickly endorsed \u201cjobs not mobs\u201d as a potential slogan. Because of the cartoonist\u2019s popularity among the pro-Trump crowd online, this was a key moment.A screenshot of Mr. Adams\u2019s tweet was posted to Reddit, followed by a meme with the phrase laid over an image of factory workers at the top and a violent protest at the bottom.\u201cThis meme can go far,\u201d one Reddit user wrote.Users on Reddit and Twitter continued to push the slogan, as popular pages on Facebook began to pick it up. The transfer of a message across social networks is one way a meme like this becomes amplified.\u00a0\u00a0Over the following days, #JobsNotMobs was used in reference to everyone from liberal protesters to Central American migrants trying to come into the United States.The phrase was pushed by a series of increasingly prominent conservatives who have often railed against anti-fascist protesters. James Woods, the actor, tweeted it on Oct. 13. The next day, Charlie Kirk, a pro-Trump activist with a large internet following, sent it out. Women for Trump Movement, a Facebook page, wrote about it in a post that was shared 1,200 times.Conservative media outlets routinely pick up stories that are gaining traction on the pro-Trump internet, and #JobsNotMobs was no exception. On Oct. 15, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d aired a segment on the phrase, saying: \u201cThe Trump administration is focusing on what Americans really care about. Not mobs, but jobs!\u201dSoon, Republicans around the country were racing to feature #JobsNotMobs in campaign materials.\u00a0\u00a0By Oct. 18, the slogan had spread across the internet.That evening, Mr. Trump tweeted, simply, \u201c#JobsNotMobs!\u201d Reddit erupted with glee.#JobsNotMobs had now entered the mainstream.Mr. Trump returned to the idea, tweeting out the hashtag several more times. It had quickly become a message the Republican Party would carry into the midterm elections.With this meme, the far-right internet had found an opening for a new Republican talking point, molding it into a compact slogan and seeding it with the most powerful conservatives in the country.Some who were online could hardly believe their success. \u201cCan you guys believe that we, this domreddit, did this though?\u201d one Reddit user wrote, referring to the r/the_donald forum, inserting an expletive. \u201cLife imitates memes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sources: CrowdTangle, Dataminr and Reddit.

I didn\u2019t have a lot of political experience. What I did have was a cause I believed in \u2014 keeping the local nursing home open \u2014 and the willingness to work really hard. My opponent in the race, an older male incumbent, derisively referred to me as \u201cthat young broad.\u201d That young broad beat him.I\u2019ve had a number of firsts in my life, including becoming the first woman from Michigan to be elected to the United States Senate. I won my own re-election last week, but what happened on the rest of the ballot in Michigan was especially exciting for me.Women ran for governor, secretary of state and attorney general, and all won. That means four of our top statewide offices will now be held by women, all of them Democrats.That\u2019s a big deal. But what makes Michigan\u2019s 2018 election results new and important is that our being women wasn\u2019t the story.We didn\u2019t win because of the novelty of an all-female slate of candidates. We didn\u2019t win thanks to some kind of \u201cpink wave.\u201d We didn\u2019t win because we focused on \u201cwomen\u2019s issues,\u201d because every issue is a women\u2019s issue.Instead, we won because we had strong, highly qualified candidates who each earned their nomination. We each ran forward-looking, positive campaigns focused on issues that are crucial to Michigan families \u2014 good-paying jobs, clean water, fixing our roads, strengthening our public schools and ensuring that everyone has affordable health care.People were not talking about our gender and whether it was O.K. to have women in all of these top positions. Instead, they were talking about our qualifications and who was the best candidate. That, to me, was truly historic.Think back to 1992, which many people called \u201cThe Year of the Woman.\u201d That year, two women, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, won the nominations to represent California in the Senate. It was so extraordinary to have both senators be women that The New York Times ran an item about them at the top of its front page.Fast forward to this week and halfway across the country. In Minnesota, two women \u2014 my friends Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith \u2014 both won their races. Minnesota is one of a growing number of states represented by two women in the Senate, including Washington, New Hampshire, Nevada and yes, California.And just as in Michigan, it simply wasn\u2019t a big deal that they were both women. They were the best candidates, and they both won. Voters trusted them to get the job done.Michigan\u2019s next governor, Gretchen Whitmer, says she\u2019s going to \u201cfix the damn roads,\u201d and voters believed her: She won by more than nine points. We can expect our next secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, to value the time and money of Michiganders and to work just as hard as they do. We can look forward to Dana Nessel being a passionate advocate for justice as our new attorney general. And, by the way, Michigan is sending three new highly qualified representatives to Washington: Elissa Slotkin, Haley Stevens and Rashida Tlaib.As for me, I\u2019m looking forward to serving alongside these incredible women. Even more so, I\u2019m looking forward to serving alongside these incredible leaders. We\u2019re committed to getting things done for Michigan.Debbie Stabenow is a Democratic senator from Michigan.Advertisement"}

There are four kinds of Maxes in the fleet, numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10. The 8 series, which was involved in the crash in Indonesia, has been flying the longest; the first one entered service in May of 2017. Max 9s are also now flying passengers, but the 7s and 10s are still in development phases.The 737 Max is mostly used for short- and medium-distance flights, but a few airlines also fly it between Northern Europe and the East Coast of the United States. It is more fuel efficient and has a longer range than earlier versions of the 737.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Colts Neck Murders, Two Brothers and Troubled Business Ties", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lives of Paul and Keith Caneiro had always been entwined. Born just a year apart, the brothers created businesses together, moved to the New Jersey suburbs to raise families, and appeared to be savoring the fruits of their shared labor, from handsome homes to luxury cars.But lately, there had been signs that the relationship was unraveling, and on Thursday, Paul J. Caneiro, the older of the two, was charged with killing his brother, his sister-in-law and their two young children and setting fire to their $1.6 million home in upscale Colts Neck, N.J., just days before Thanksgiving.\u201cThis one is the most brutal case that I\u2019ve seen in my experience here,\u201d Christopher J. Gramiccioni, the Monmouth County prosecutor, said in announcing the charges.The bodies were discovered on Nov. 20, after Mr. Caneiro went to his brother\u2019s house, armed with a knife and a gun, a complaint charged. After the family was dead, he set fire to the house to try to conceal evidence, Mr. Gramiccioni said.Officials said they believed the motive was \u201cfinancial\u201d and are probing the brothers\u2019s business ventures and financial dealings as part of the investigation.In a court appearance Friday, Paul Caneiro pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyers had said earlier that he was a loving brother and uncle who cherished his family and was intimately involved in the lives of his young niece and nephew.\u201cThere is absolutely no reason in the world for Paul Caneiro to have committed the crimes he is alleged to have committed,\u201d his lawyers, Robert A. Honecker, Jr., and Mitchell J. Ansell, said in a statement. \u201cHe would never hurt any member of his family.\u201dThe Caneiro brothers came from modest beginnings in New York City and together rode the internet boom to what appeared to be suburban affluence. But their relationship had begun to fray, friends said in interviews.Raised in Brooklyn and Staten Island, they were the oldest of three boys in what was described by friends and neighbors as a warm, working-class family with immigrant roots. Cesar Caneiro, the men\u2019s father, immigrated to New York from Spain.\u201cIt was Paul and Keith all the time,\u201d said a family friend, Demetris Potamianos. \u201cIt was the perfect helpful brother relationship.\u201dWhen Paul Caneiro got married in 1991, Keith Caneiro was his best man, according to a wedding announcement in the Staten Island Advance. And when Keith Caneiro married in 2000, Paul Caneiro was in his wedding party, too, a photo on Ms. Caneiro\u2019s Facebook page showed.As technology boomed, the brothers thrived. They moved to leafy Monmouth County, and the company headquarters went from a warehouse in Gowanus, Brooklyn, to a large brick building on a main street in Asbury Park, N.J.Their company, renamed Square One, provided services to clients such as Citibank, Prudential and Ogilvy & Mather, according to a website that has been taken down. \u201cWe are plain spoken, common sense people who take pride in their work,\u201d the site said. They also took over a pest extermination company.While Keith Caneiro and his family continued to do well \u2014 traveling and attending New York Yankees games, a Billy Joel concert and the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton,\u201d according to Ms. Caneiro\u2019s Facebook page \u2014 Paul Caneiro was struggling.About five years ago, he was seriously injured in a car accident and had several surgeries, according to co-workers and family friends. \u201cI remember the family would complain sometimes about his behavior,\u201d said the family friend, Mr. Potamianos, who is a hair stylist in Manhattan. \u201cHe was frustrated, but not to the point to hurt his family members.\u201dAt his court appearance after charges were filed, Mr. Caneiro limped through the courtroom. His lawyers attributed his difficulty walking to chronic back pain.Paul Caneiro told co-workers he was a licensed gun owner and was known to visit a local shooting range. New Jersey does not publicly disclose gun permits, but Mr. Potamianos said that in 2015, Mr. Caneiro showed him and Keith Caneiro a collection of close to a dozen firearms he kept locked up in his garage in Ocean Township. It included several handguns and a few assault weapons, Mr. Potamianos recalled.\u201cBut the last thing I can ever picture is Paul doing something like that. Paul was like a father to all of them,\u201d Mr. Potamianos said. \u201cShocking is not the word.\u201dSeveral people said Paul Caneiro had recently been living apart from his family in another house in Ocean Township, though he had returned home. Meanwhile, tensions mounted between the brothers over business matters, the family friends said. Paul Caneiro had mainly been running the exterminating company, EcoStar Pest Management, while Keith Caneiro ran Square One.Keith Caneiro was openly discussing the possibility of ending their business partnership, friends said.Keith Caneiro had recently gone back to school, earning an undergraduate degree in history from Columbia University in 2014 and a master\u2019s degree in technology management from the school earlier this year. Ameet Chaudhury, a classmate in the master\u2019s program, said Keith Caneiro often mentioned his desire to try something new, potentially aiming to be a chief information officer at a large company.\u201cHe would just mention it to everyone,\u201d Mr. Chaudhury said. \u201cHe wanted to try something different.\u201dMr. Chaudhury said Mr. Caneiro did not mention what he would do with the two companies he owned with his brother.Keith Caneiro had begun pursuing jobs elsewhere and gone on interviews in the last few weeks, a family friend said.There was no warning that tension between the brothers over the businesses, or anything else, had reached a crisis point, the family friends said.On Nov. 19, days before Keith Caneiro and his wife planned to host a Thanksgiving feast in their Colts Neck home and the last day they were seen alive, Keith Caneiro attended his usual workout session at Aspire Fitness in the morning, his trainer, Brian Bott, said. Paul Caneiro went to work at the exterminating company and left at about 3 p.m., a co-worker said.Before dawn on Nov. 20, Mr. Caneiro shot Keith Caneiro at his Colts Neck property, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office. He then shot and stabbed Ms. Caneiro and stabbed the children before setting a fire in the basement of the house in \u201can effort to conceal\u201d the evidence, said Mr. Gramiccioni, the prosecutor. Paul Caneiro returned home and set his own house on fire, the prosecutor said, planning to destroy evidence of his earlier crimes in Colts Neck.\u201cAnd to also create the illusion that the overall Caneiro family was somehow targeted or victimized,\u201d Mr. Gramiccioni said. \u201cWe allege that it was a ruse.\u201d\u201cHe always seemed like a really nice guy,\u201d Kevin Harrington, a neighbor, said. \u201cI never before witnessed anything that turned your eyebrow up.\u201dMiles away, in Colts Neck, when the school bus passed their home at about 8 a.m., Keith Caneiro\u2019s children, Jesse and Sophia, did not appear.Just after noon, a neighbor went to the Caneiro home after his landscaper spotted rising smoke. The neighbor said he opened a side door and was hit by a wall of thick, gray smoke. As he called 911, he saw Mr. Caneiro in the lawn, lying facedown in a hooded sweatshirt. Blood seeped from a gunshot wound in the back of the hood.The family of Ms. Caneiro declined to comment. They released a statement earlier this week saying they were mourning their daughter and son-in-law and their \u201cprecious, innocent, wonderful\u201d grandchildren. A funeral is planned for Sunday in Holmdel, N.J.Ms. Caneiro was remembered on Facebook by her sister, friends and former sorority sisters at the University of Albany, who changed their profile photos to include her, paying tribute to nights out and her love for her family and for the Yankees.Mr. Caneiro was remembered fondly by his morning exercise companions. \u201cHe made new people feel comfortable,\u201d his trainer, Mr. Bott, said. \u201cHe liked to joke around about the food he ate over the weekend.\u201d Mr. Bott posted a video of Mr. Caneiro doing push-ups with his daughter on his back, and a photo of a chicken parmigiana pizza, purchased in Mr. Caneiro\u2019s honor.The family was also mourned on the small Greek island of Aegina, where Ms. Caneiro\u2019s father, Vlassis Karidis, was born. He left in his youth to become a professional soccer player, before he met his wife, Bette Goldsmith, and moved to New York. \u201cWe cannot believe it on Aegina,\u201d a friend, Nikos Ioannidhs, said.The Caneiros spent many happy vacations on the island. There, they eschewed the comforts they had grown used to, preferring to live in a simple, inherited house, their Greek friends recalled, and to spend tranquil summer days at the beach. Their dream, the friends said, was to move there one day themselves and leave it all behind.Nate Schweber contributed reporting. Susan Beachy and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

These days it\u2019s just another word for giving lots of money to Donald Trump.Now, this may seem like a trivial story. But it\u2019s a reminder that the Trumpian attitude toward truth \u2014 which is that it\u2019s defined by what benefits Trump and his friends, not by verifiable facts \u2014 also applies to virtue. There is no heroism, there are no good works, except those that serve Trump.The same worldview explains Republicans\u2019 addiction to conspiracy theories. After all, if people keep insisting on the truth of something that hurts their party, it can\u2019t be out of respect for the facts \u2014 because in their world, there are no neutral facts. It\u2019s worth pointing out, by the way, that this rejection of objective facts and insistence that anyone insisting on inconvenient truths must be part of a left-wing conspiracy dominated the Republican psyche long before Trump. Most notably, the claim that the overwhelming evidence for global warming is a giant hoax, the product of a vast plot involving thousands of scientists around the world, has been G.O.P. orthodoxy for years.True, the party\u2019s presidential candidates used to be mealy-mouthed about rejecting facts and endorsing conspiracy theories, rather than being full-throated crazy. But Trump is only going where many of his party\u2019s senior figures have been for a long time.Oh, and this, too, predates Trump. Remember how Republicans denigrated John Kerry\u2019s war record?As with so much about the current political scene, it\u2019s essential to realize and acknowledge that this is not a symmetric, both-sides-do-it situation. If you say something along the lines of \u201ctruth and virtue are now defined by partisanship,\u201d you\u2019re actually enabling the bad guys, because only one party thinks that way. Democrats, being human, sometimes have biased views and engage in motivated reasoning. But they haven\u2019t abandoned the whole notion of objective facts and nonpolitical goodness; Republicans have.What all of this means is that what\u2019s going on in America right now isn\u2019t politics as usual. It\u2019s much more existential than that. You have to be truly delusional to see the Republicans\u2019 response to their party\u2019s midterm setback as anything but an attempted power grab by a would-be authoritarian movement, which rejects any opposition or even criticism as illegitimate. Our democracy is still very much in danger.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Going Back. The G.O.P. Is Trump\u2019s Party. ", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president has reclaimed the formula that made the landslide victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. McCarthy is editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Quarterly.Donald Trump\u2019s conservative critics have one last hope: defeat. If Republicans suffer humiliating defeats in the midterm elections, they suggest, President Trump will get the blame. Influential donors and grass-roots Republicans will turn on him, and the party will get back to normal. Not so long ago this was the party of Paul Ryan and free trade. This was the party of George W. Bush and compassionate conservatism. This was a party whose self-performed autopsy after the 2012 election called for more minority outreach. After Mr. Trump, why can\u2019t the Republicans be that party again?The ranks of anti-Trump Republicans grow thinner by the day. They\u2019re retiring from Congress. They\u2019re writing memoirs blasting their former friends. But they hold out hope for the future. If the Republican Party could undergo such a profound change in personality and policy thanks to just one man in a mere three years, who\u2019s to say it can\u2019t change back? The Trump coalition seems so impermanent, after all, a motley mix of Southern evangelicals, businessmen who think like the Chamber of Commerce and disaffected white voters from the Rust Belt. Throw in foreign-policy hawks and anti-interventionist America Firsters, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party looks like an impossible contradiction. It can\u2019t last. Can it?Yes, it can. In fact, the party that President Trump has remade in his image is arguably less divided and in a better position to keep winning the White House than it has been at any time since the 1980s. What Mr. Trump has done is to rediscover the formula that made the landslide Republican Electoral College victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. Trump\u2019s signature themes of economic nationalism and immigration restriction are only 21st-century updates to the issues that brought the Republican Party triumph in all but one of the six presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.Some of the parallels are obvious. President Trump talks about crime and left-wing agitation in much the same way that Richard Nixon once did \u2014 and Ronald Reagan, too, especially during his time as governor of California. Mr. Trump\u2019s combination of force with an aversion to large-scale military interventions and nation-building also bears a resemblance to the policies of Republican presidents past. Dwight Eisenhower and Mr. Reagan also preferred to build up military strength without engaging in the kinds of prolonged wars for which Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush are remembered. And while Mr. Nixon was mired in Vietnam, he ran as a candidate eager to find an exit.But the most important ways in which Mr. Trump recapitulates the winning themes of earlier Republicans are less direct. Throughout the Cold War, Republicans presented themselves as the party of greater nationalism in the struggle against a global threat. If the United States was to survive in a world that seemed increasingly subjugated by international Communism, the country would have to embrace the party that was most anti-Communist.The Soviet Union is long gone, but our national distinctiveness \u2014 the American way of life \u2014 is perceived to be under threat by new global forces, this time in the form of competition from China and international economic and regulatory bodies that compromise national sovereignty. Many voters see immigration as part of this story. They want America to control its borders by political choice, not to admit more immigrants because a global labor market insists that more must come for the good of all.Even in the area where Mr. Trump seems most different from Republicans past, on trade, he has really returned to an older style of politics. Mr. Reagan was an economic nationalist, too, not just because he protected a company like Harley-Davidson against competition from Japan but more important because his pro-growth policies of deregulation and tax cuts were themselves the appropriate forms of economic nationalism for the 1980s. In the decades before the rise of China as an industrial superpower, economic nationalism was chiefly a matter of keeping the American economy entrepreneurial \u2014 defending it against red tape and business-unfriendly policies at home rather than the predatory economic strategies of foreign governments.By the early 1990s, the Reagan economic strategy \u2014 a mix of entrepreneurship, tough bargaining and limited protection \u2014 had succeeded against stiff competition from Japan. That victory was squandered, however, by Republicans and Democrats starting later in that decade who pursued economic policy not in terms of national industry but as an exercise in global ideological consumerism.The business side of President Trump\u2019s coalition still puts its bottom line ahead of its theoretical commitments: Mr. Trump has produced a very good environment for business, no matter what the business executives think about his tariffs. They want to win elections so that they can continue to prosper, and if that means electing more protectionists after Mr. Trump, that is a price they are readily willing to pay.Grass-roots evangelical Christians and Rust Belt workers, meanwhile, both find something to like in an America that reaffirms its economic exceptionalism and sovereignty. That, no less than Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalty to Christian conservatives on abortion and other issues, is why evangelical voters have not abandoned him. And it\u2019s why Mr. Trump won states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that had eluded other Republican presidential nominees since 1988.Few Republicans running this year seem to understand what gave Mr. Trump his edge in 2016 \u2014 it was not that he was simply combative and rhetorically right-wing. It was that he had a vision of what it meant to make American great again, by making the Republicans a party for the nation again.Advertisement"}

In many states, American voters cast their votes for ballot measures that resolved questions about raising the minimum wage, expanding access to health care, or expanding or contracting energy production. Voters in some states may also have scrambled the 2020 political landscape, largely by changing the mechanics of who can cast ballots, and who gets to draw state and congressional district lines.

Some ballot initiatives had several provisions; only the main ones are listed here. Some percentages do not add up to 100 because of rounding. The vote on a Utah ballot question that would establish a redistricting commission is too close to call.In 2017, Maine voters were the first to approve a citizen initiative expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. Last week, Idaho, Nebraska and Utah voters approved their own expansion plans. Montana voters narrowly defeated a similar measure that would have extended the state\u2019s already expanded Medicaid coverage and increased tobacco taxes to help fund the state\u2019s portion of costs. (Tobacco companies spent $17.5 million against the measure.)Voters have shown they support expanded coverage in states where elected officials haven\u2019t. Fourteen states remain without expanded coverage, and at least six of them have some sort of process for citizen-initiated measures \u2014 and Medicaid expansion proponents may view their best way forward is through that process, not the legislature.Proposal 1 legalized the recreational use of marijuana and created a framework for regulating the drug\u2019s production and sale. It also placed an emphasis on industrial hemp, allowing farmers to cultivate and sell low-THC cannabis.But marijuana advocates weren\u2019t as successful elsewhere. In North Dakota, a legislation effort called Measure 3 was defeated. There were key differences between the two proposals. Michigan\u2019s successful Proposal 1, much like previous ballot initiatives, aimed to regulate marijuana as alcohol is. North Dakota\u2019s Measure 3 would have left details on possession and other matters up to the state legislature. Several states with the initiative process have not addressed marijuana legalization, such as Missouri and Montana. A campaign is already underway in Ohio to get an initiative on the 2019 ballot.Josh Altic is the editor of the Ballot Measures Project at Ballotpedia, where Ryan Byrne is a staff writer focusing on statewide ballot measures.

{"Headline": "Mueller Has a Way Around Trump and His Minions ", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA road map from the Watergate prosecution shows a potential route for the special counsel to send incriminating evidence directly to Congress. Mr. Ben-Veniste and Mr. Frampton worked on the Watergate cover-up task force of the special prosecutor\u2019s office.In a stunning move on the heels of the midterm election, President Trump has forced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointed an outspoken critic of the Mueller investigation \u2014 Matthew Whitaker \u2014 as acting attorney general, shunting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to the sidelines. This raises the specter of a fearful president attempting to muzzle Special Counsel Robert Mueller or hinder him from revealing whether his 18-month-long grand jury investigation has turned up evidence of criminality implicating Donald Trump or his immediate family.The recent decision by Washington\u2019s Federal District Court chief judge, Beryl Howell, to release the document from the National Archives provides a historic legal precedent that could be a vehicle for Mr. Mueller and the grand jury assisting him to share the fruits of their investigation into possible criminal conduct within the Trump presidential campaign and subsequent administration.In all the discussion about Mr. Mueller\u2019s options when he concludes his investigation, little attention has been paid to the potential role of the grand jury. Chief Judge Howell\u2019s decision unsealing the Watergate road map brings new focus on the role the grand jury might play in the dynamics of the endgame. Although the grand jury is a powerful tool for federal prosecutors, it has historic and independent power and operates under the supervision of the federal judiciary. Following the Oct. 20, 1973, \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d \u2014 in which President Nixon forced the Justice Department to fire the original special prosecutor, Archibald Cox \u2014 the Watergate grand jury played a critical role in forcing the president to back down, hand over the subpoenaed tapes and appoint a new special prosecutor. In the face of Congress\u2019s inability to obtain evidence that the grand jury well knew incriminated the president, we prepared the grand jury report to Judge Sirica and requested that he use his plenary authority to transmit that evidence to the House Judiciary Committee, which had already commenced a proceeding to consider Mr. Nixon\u2019s impeachment. It was carefully written to avoid any interpretations or conclusions about what the evidence showed or what action the committee should take. The report contained a series of spare factual statements annotated with citations to relevant transcripts of tapes and grand jury testimony. Copies of those tapes and transcripts were included as attachments. Judge Sirica was convinced that the materials contained in the report should be made available to the House Judiciary Committee. His decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This evidence formed the gravamen of Article I (obstruction of justice) of the impeachment resolution adopted by the Committee.Much note has been made of the fact that the Justice Department regulations under which Mr. Mueller was appointed actually require him to submit a report to the attorney general. Importantly, nothing in the department regulations prohibits Mr. Mueller\u2019s Department of Justice superior, now Mr. Whitaker, from refusing to release the report.What if Mr. Mueller concludes that the president has committed a crime? The question of whether a sitting president can be indicted remains a subject of vehement debate among scholars. But assuming that Mr. Mueller follows what many regard as \u201ccurrent Justice Department policy\u201d based on several past internal legal opinions that an indictment is inappropriate, then the appropriate place for consideration of evidence that the president has committed crimes rests definitively and exclusively with Congress.If Mr. Mueller has obtained such evidence, his responsibility and the correct operation of our system of government compel the conclusion that he and the grand jury can make that evidence available to Congress through a report transmitted by the court. With the fox now guarding the henhouse, there is sufficient precedent for the grand jury and Special Counsel Mueller to seek the chief judge\u2019s assistance in transmitting a properly fashioned report to Congress.Richard Ben-Veniste, an attorney in Washington, was the chief of the Watergate cover-up task force of the special prosecutor\u2019s office and was a member of the 9/11 Commission.

{"Headline": "Twitter Says It Is Ready for the Midterms, but Rogue Accounts Aren\u2019t Letting Up", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter created a team to automatically seek out suspicious activity, like thousands of messages intended to suppress the vote. It began coordinating closely with the Department of Homeland Security. And it recently introduced a tool to help people more easily report misleading tweets.Ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday, \u201cwe are more prepared than we have ever been,\u201d said Del Harvey, Twitter\u2019s head of trust and safety.Yet over the last few months, Twitter has also grappled with a profusion of accounts masquerading as state Republican officials, and accounts pushing memes that falsely claimed immigration officials would be patrolling polling stations. Last week, researchers at Oxford University said Twitter now had 5 percent more false content than it did during the 2016 American presidential election.\u201cNever has it actually reached this threshold that we\u2019ve seen now,\u201d said Lisa-Maria Neudert, one the Oxford researchers.A close look at Twitter also suggests that disinformation and election interference are far from under control. Even as the company has taken steps to reduce problems, new instances of misinformation campaigns continue to surface.\u201cOur work on this issue is not done, nor will it ever be,\u201d Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, told Congress in September. He said that the company had learned valuable lessons since the 2016 election and that it was now removing 214 percent more accounts a year for violating its policies against manipulation.In the fall of 2017, the data science team led a study of 2016 election interference campaigns on Twitter. The findings, released in November 2017, included 50,000 Russia-linked accounts that were automated and tweeting election-related content. Twitter said it used the discoveries to home in on how to prepare for the midterms, like improving its ability to find a high volume of automated tweets.\u201cUnless we really build out our enforcement capacity and have teams that are focused on identifying and patterning these behavior models, we\u2019re not going to be successful,\u201d Ms. Harvey said.Twitter said it also began asking for more help. In 2016, the company was not in regular contact with the Homeland Security Department or other government agencies, Ms. Harvey said. Over the summer, it began coordinating more with Homeland Security and is now also in regular contact with the F.B.I. and secretaries of state for various states, as well as Democratic and Republican campaign committees and nonprofits that track misinformation, Ms. Harvey said.The F.B.I. and Homeland Security Department did not respond to requests for comment.Over the past week, another series of memes on Twitter falsely said that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement would be patrolling voting stations on Tuesday. The company removed the posts.Last week, the Oxford researchers released their study that concluded political news from conservative news outlets and right-wing sites like Breitbart, Gateway Pundit and The Daily Caller were circulating on Twitter more than articles from traditional sources. The researchers said they classified stories from those outlets as \u201cjunk news.\u201d In addition, the researchers said, an increasing number of liberal groups were also spreading false news.The researchers, who had been tracking 200 accounts that promoted the hashtag #VoterFraud, said those accounts posted a surge of tweets calling for violence and civil war that garnered more than 112 million impressions from Friday through Sunday, compared with about 37 million impressions in the previous seven days. There may be more such misinformation campaigns, the researchers added.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a proliferation of a lot of voter fraud conspiracies that all spun up in the last 24 hours,\u201d said Brett Horvath, a co-founder of Guardians A.I.A Twitter spokesman said that because researchers pull data en masse from the service, they sometimes collect tweets that are caught by the company\u2019s automated filters \u2014 meaning that some examples of misleading content are never viewed by regular users.On election night, Twitter intends to follow a template it developed during recent international elections: It plans to monitor its service for automated activity and will rely on partners like the Homeland Security Department as well as users to report misleading content. The company also said it planned to have hundreds of employees around the world working to make sure nothing goes wrong.\u201cWe\u2019ll be in various places looking at our computers, mostly,\u201d Ms. Harvey said. \u201cThe team is always on and working on this.\u201dKate Conger reported from San Francisco and Adam Satariano from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Blue Wave in Kansas? Don\u2019t Be So Surprised ", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Electoral College is the barometer, this state is deep red. But it\u2019s the only one that has elected three female Democratic governors. Ms. Smarsh is the author of \u201cHeartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth.\u201dThe Republican candidate for governor, Kris Kobach, and the independent, Greg Orman, had strong support in the packed bleachers. But the loudest cheers, to my ears, were for the Democrat, State Senator Laura Kelly. She fed off the approval, delivering zingers and carrying her small stature with swagger.The loudest boos were for Mr. Kobach, the secretary of state, who earlier in the year had been found in contempt of federal court for failing to notify unlawfully suppressed voting registrants of their eligibility. \u201cYou\u2019re a criminal!\u201d one man shouted several times. Mr. Kobach paused for a beat and shook his head with a laugh.The heckler was my partner, a white, male construction worker who is the most radical progressive I know. Soon, someone behind us took up the call. \u201cYou\u2019re a criminal!\u201d she shouted. I turned, and a middle-aged white woman wearing a pro-teachers T-shirt smiled sweetly at me. \u201cSo he can take a break,\u201d she said, nodding at my mate.So, liberal Laura Kelly \u2014 how? One reason is that there never was a \u201cTrump country\u201d at all. Rather, like many \u201cred\u201d states, Kansas is a gerrymandered, dark-monied place where election outcomes may have more to do with who votes and how those votes are counted than with the character of the place. In such states, Fox News and conservative talk radio have artfully prodded white fears to great effect, but about 40 percent of voters routinely reject the Republican Party. In Kansas, Mr. Trump won the general election, but Bernie Sanders won far more votes than Mr. Trump during the state\u2019s caucuses. Party tribalism has increased here, in recent years, but a legacy of independent, unpredictable politics runs deeper.To be sure, if the Electoral College is our barometer, Kansas is deep red. It hasn\u2019t gone for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. My home congressional district, a mix of rural counties and the city of Wichita, has been represented by a Republican for 23 years.Nonetheless, as of election night, exactly one state has elected three female Democratic governors: Kansas \u2014 and all in the last 28 years.Ms. Kelly\u2019s win is notable not for being out of keeping with the political spirit of the state but for representing the end of what many Kansans woefully call \u201cthe Brownback era\u201d \u2014 after the former governor Sam Brownback \u2014 when religious conservatism and free-market extremism made the state synonymous with far-right politics in national headlines.Mr. Kobach ran ads that turned \u201cliberal\u201d into a pejorative and pledged to shield Kansas from outside forces like the federal government and immigrants. Ms. Kelly said she\u2019d put political labels aside and work to build a better Kansas from the inside out.Kansas\u2019s big Democratic wins, it turned out, were by women with less bold platforms who emphasized working across the aisle. It seems that if Midwestern states are bound for a return to their democratic-socialist roots \u2014 prairie populism, it was once called \u2014 they will first require a return to center in female form.Laura Kelly, whose campaign emphasized public schools, Medicaid expansion and infrastructure, does her job with the same steadiness. So did Kansas\u2019 last Democratic governor, Kathleen Sebelius, the former Department of Health secretary and an Affordable Care Act architect. Kansas elected Ms. Sebelius twice, not so long ago, along with a lieutenant governor she poached from the Republican Party for the sake of getting things done.If this be Trump country, it seems the only thing more compelling to its voter majority than a far-right Republican man is a no-nonsense Democratic woman, albeit not one named Clinton.My white construction-worker dad, who can be found razzing fellow workers on job sites that they\u2019re \u201csocialist and just don\u2019t know it,\u201d voted for Ms. Kelly in his first-ever midterm participation. The \u201cI voted\u201d sticker symbolically placed on the left side of his hard hat tells the overlooked story of Kansas and the nation: More people are paying attention than at any point in our lifetimes, and this bodes poorly for far-right factions propped up in recent decades by impassioned religious and ideological bases.Yet Hell wasn\u2019t torn down in a day. Moderates and progressives in conservative strongholds who lost close, hard-fought battles \u2014 competitive races largely owed to a political awakening on the left all of two years ago \u2014 know that correcting the nation\u2019s course will take time. Like Mr. Thompson, whose campaign made a special effort in rural and small-town communities, they have lost a race yet changed culture along the way such that a future race might be won. There remains across the nation a rural-urban political split that newly elected Democrats such as Ms. Kelly must seek to bridge. Both sides of the aisle remain a hot mess of diverging ideas and realignments. But moderates and progressives beyond this place might take heart: Kansas just held the gubernatorial version of Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, and more people were with her.Advertisement"}

Their daughter, Jayme, vanished. And a town is on edge.Front doors are being locked. F.B.I. agents have descended. Yet after three weeks, residents are left with a terrifying mystery that goes beyond the shocking deaths: Not only have the authorities publicly identified no suspect, no murder weapon and no motive, but the Closses\u2019 13-year-old daughter, Jayme, has been missing ever since.\u201cWe have a double murder and a missing 13-year-old girl, there\u2019s not much more to tell than that \u2014 and that\u2019s the frustration,\u201d said Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald of Barron County, whose force of 78 ballooned at one point with 200 federal, state and local law officers joining an intensive, round-the-clock hunt.More than 2,100 tips have turned up nothing. Law enforcement officials have turned a courtroom in a municipal building on the outskirts of town, about 90 miles northeast of the Twin Cities, into a nerve center for the investigation. Thousands of volunteer searchers have combed cornfields and cow pastures. And still nothing \u2014 no clues and no Jayme.\u201cWe have exhausted every lead,\u201d Sheriff Fitzgerald said. \u201cThere is no stone that has been unturned.\u201dAt just past 1 a.m. local time on Oct. 15, a 911 call came in to the sheriff\u2019s office. No one spoke, but muffled shouting could be heard. The police traced the call to Denise Closs\u2019s cellphone, and arrived at the house on Highway 8 four minutes later. They found the front door open and the couple dead. Mr. Closs\u2019s body was in the doorway; his wife\u2019s, inside the house. According to the sheriff, evidence indicated that Jayme was home at the time of the attack, though he would not describe the evidence. When deputies arrived, though, only Jayme\u2019s dog, Molly, was there.\u201cHer body hasn\u2019t been recovered, so there is no reason to say she is not alive,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThat\u2019s where you build your hope from.\u201dJayme likes jazz dancing, ice-skating and volleyball at Riverview Middle School, where she is an eighth grader, social media accounts show. She adores shopping and Starbucks Frappuccinos, her aunt, Jennifer Smith, said during a news conference on Oct. 25. Ms. Smith clutched Molly, the dog, as she made an impassioned plea, addressing her niece as if she might be watching.\u201cMolly is sleeping in one of your sweatshirts,\u201d her aunt said.Mr. Closs, 56, and Mrs. Closs, 46, worked at the Jennie-O plant for 27 years, according to an obituary posted on the website of the Rausch and Steel Funeral Home. It read: \u201cJames loved the Green Bay Packers and the Wisconsin Badgers and getting into conversations on the \u2018glory days\u2019 of his high school sports career. Denise loved working with her flowers, feeding her birds, she loved angels and helping everyone, any way she could.\u201dMrs. Closs taught religious school at St. Peter\u2019s Catholic Church in a nearby town, Cameron. \u201cShe was the planner for her family, a birthday, or a marriage, she makes everything happen,\u201d said the Rev. Balaraju Policetty, who gave eulogies at the couple\u2019s funeral. \u201cYour heart breaks,\u201d Father Policetty said.Around Barron, where Jayme\u2019s sunny face and strawberry hair peers out from checkout counters from Duane\u2019s Collision Repair Center to Dollar General, endless speculation has filled the void of hard information.Over cups of black coffee and fudge-covered mini doughnuts, a group of welders who meet for breakfast daily at the A&W truck stop traded theories on a recent morning. At night, patrons sipped Spotted Cow ale and threw out hunches at ER Bar: Maybe there was a boyfriend? Maybe it was a hit? Maybe it was an inside job?\u201cSomething like this makes you sketchy about everyone,\u201d said Lisa Kosbab, 25, who works in a group home, as she sat at the bar.In the past decade, there have been a total of four killings in Barron County, according to the sheriff. Barron is the kind of town where screen doors are left unlatched in summer; in winter, few lock their front doors. Those days are over, several residents said.\u201cIt\u2019s the not knowing,\u201d said Kelle Jenderny, 48, as she stood at the Holiday gas station on Day 17 of Jayme\u2019s disappearance. Down the street, black lettering on a white billboard spelled out \u201cBring Jayme Home.\u201dSince the murders, Ms. Jenderny said she spent $700 on a new alarm system and new outdoor lights that stay on all night. Her 8-year-old son now sleeps with her older son, 13. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid to use the bathroom at night,\u201d Ms. Jenderny said.Not long after the killings and Jayme\u2019s disappearance, members of the Somali community delivered trays of East African food to the sheriff\u2019s office; the food was part of a flood of meals donated by residents and businesses to the officials working on the case.\u201cWhen we see in the U.S.A. the same things that we had back in our home, you fear,\u201d said Kaltuma Hassan, 44, who was born in Somalia. She sat in the cafe she owns, Amin Restaurant, sharing dinner from a communal bowl with two of her children. \u201cWhat if my children are next?\u201dAs she spoke, her daughter, Najma Rashid, 10, stopped eating, clutched her stomach and cried out. \u201cI\u2019m scared!\u201d she said. Her mother grabbed her hands. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201dIn recent days, the operation scaled down some; many federal and state agents who had filled local motels headed home.Inside the sheriff\u2019s headquarters, an office is being converted into a permanent operations center where local and outside law enforcement will continue working on the Closs case. \u201cThey\u2019re not giving up,\u201d Sheriff Fitzgerald said, adding that the number of tips wasn\u2019t enough to keep so many officers here.\u201cI go to bed every night hoping my phone rings in the night saying, \u2018We have her.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Criminals?\u2019 Hardly. That\u2019s Who the Caravan Flees. ", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe would-be immigrants to the United States traveling from Central America are trying to escape rule by authoritarian governments tied to gangs, organized crime and other criminal enterprises. Professor Sanford is the author of \u201cBuried Secrets: Truth and Human Rights in Guatemala.\u201d As thousands of Honduran migrants seeking asylum in the United States trek northward through Mexico, President Trump has pledged to stop them at the border by militarizing it with armed federal troops, under the guise of protecting Americans from \u201ccriminals\u201d and an \u201cinvasion.\u201dWhat he fails to recognize is that cruelty won\u2019t solve the current refugee crisis. Neither will buddying up with authoritarian leaders in Central America. Instead, those two strategies only deepen the crisis, because criminality and misrule are exactly what the caravan is fleeing.What Mr. Trump calls an invasion is actually the visible face of a deadly crisis of governance and violence in almost all of Central America \u2014 a retreat from the rule of law in favor of rule by corruption and criminality abetted by officials with impunity.For example, Mr. Trump supports President Jimmy Morales, his authoritarian counterpart in Guatemala. Mr. Morales is under investigation for possible corruption by the United Nations Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. He has fought back by revoking the visas of many of the commission\u2019s investigators.Currently, violence reigns in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador; the three countries have the world\u2019s highest homicide rates, and the pattern they have set \u2014 daily killings, forced gang recruitment, extortion, gender attacks and kidnapping for ransom \u2014 may be creeping into Nicaragua.The criminal groups behind this are a legacy of civil wars fought in the 1970s and 1980s, and of past military regimes that left 75,000 dead in El Salvador and 200,000 dead in Guatemala. Honduras, which has been a base for American military operations in Central America for decades, is now considered the most violent. Unlike Guatemala and El Salvador, it has never even had an official counting of the dead.In those three northern Central American countries, military units are entrenched in a complex web of organized crime, drug trafficking, gangs, political parties and corrupt clandestine police groups.The gangs have ties to the police \u2014 who hunt gang members if they don\u2019t pay their quota or become liabilities because they know too much after colluding with corrupt police officers. The gangs also have ties to organized crime and drug traffickers who, in turn, have their own ties to the military and the police.In the 1980s, gang members informed the police about factory workers, union organizers, teachers and students involved in political protest. In exchange, the police granted the gangs neighborhood territory for illicit activities. In Guatemala, after peace accords in the 1990s ended a decades-long civil war, clandestine groups with ties to police and army officials used army routes, landing strips and heliports to transport weapons and drugs.Guatemala\u2019s networks illustrate how tightly interwoven those systems can become. For example, gangs pay the police to ignore the gang operations in their territories. Those payments flow upward: Local police officers pay their boss, who in turn pays off his boss. At the higher levels, drug traffickers might buy the services of a very senior police officer, who in turn might then send payments downward, to individual officers.Narcotraffickers and crime syndicates also pay off gang members to support illicit trafficking and to assert their power; the jobs vary from hit man, kidnapper, extortionist, arsonist, carjacker and recruiter of low-level supporters of criminal activities.The interlocking power structures of violence, bribes, threats and patronage make everyday life extremely dangerous for Central Americans. Any interaction between gang members and ordinary citizens carries two meanings. The first: \u201cWill you give me that money?\u201d Answering \u201cno\u201d is seen as a direct challenge to the gang\u2019s power. The second: \u201cDo you accept my control over your life?\u201d Refusing to give up even one dollar can designate a person an enemy of the gang, which is a very dangerous position to be in.Central American governments know all this. Their responses range from turning a blind eye to crime, to corrupt acceptance, to active complicity. Members of the elite work within and dominate these violent power structures. And many of these clandestine groups have ties to Mexico\u2019s horrifically violent drug cartels.This dark picture of what Central Americans seek to escape is not a new experience in American immigration. It recalls other horrors that forced human waves \u2014 Irish, Italian, Greek, Jewish, Hungarian, German, Polish and more \u2014 to flee parts of Central and Southern Europe for America rather than endure violence, crime, discrimination, misgovernment and hunger in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Did America lose by welcoming them? Think about just how much those grateful newcomers have added to the fabric of American society.Like the great majority of those masses, today\u2019s Central Americans seek merely to live in safety, to work hard and to provide for their families. They are not criminals, as Mr. Trump would have it. They are the victims of criminal enterprises that only pretend to govern.If President Trump, nevertheless, insists on stemming the flow of refugees, he must at least show America\u2019s compassion for them and insist that their home countries adopt reforms that produce honest and law-abiding governments. He should support the efforts of the anti-impunity commission for Guatemala. And he should answer the call of citizens of Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua who have sought to expand the commission to a regional United Nations Commission Against Impunity.The Honduran caravan is a call for help in ending violence and impunity, and replacing it with the rule of law. Those are the commission\u2019s goals for Guatemala. Mr. Trump and Congress must strengthen those efforts and help them become a regional campaign to rein in rule by criminal cliques and murderous gangs that make daily life intolerable for the average citizen.Ensuring fair elections is also needed, of course. But elections are meaningless without rule of law.Advertisement"}

In the meantime, he watched as it grew and grew.When he took the Los Angeles Metro to work every morning, people would stare.\u201cI wore big jackets to try to cover up, but it was very noticeable,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday.And when he sat at his desk, where he did billing for an information technology company, \u201cmy stomach would just lay between my legs,\u201d he said.Some assumed he was overly fond of beer.One day a man approached him at a Circle K convenience store near where Mr. Hernandez lives in Downey, Calif., rubbed his stomach and told him he shouldn\u2019t drink, because \u201cit\u2019s not good for you,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said.\u201cAnd I just laughed and said, \u2018You know what, I don\u2019t drink,\u2019\u201d he said.He also doesn\u2019t overeat, but Mr. Hernandez tried a plant-based diet, hoping it would make a difference.It didn\u2019t.His stomach kept growing until it became so voluminous, it resembled \u201ca beach ball\u201d and he couldn\u2019t bend over to tie his shoelaces.But while his stomach kept expanding, the rest of his body was getting thinner.Testing revealed that Mr. Hernandez had liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer that originates in fat cells and had developed into a large tumor in his abdomen.Although the tumor itself wasn\u2019t painful, Mr. Hernandez had high blood pressure and was experiencing shortness of breath, constipation and constant heartburn, all symptoms that could now be attributed to the sarcoma.\u201cI was kind of in shock,\u201d he said.During a six-hour operation in July, Dr. Tseng removed the tumor, which weighed in at 77 pounds.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Dr. Tseng, one of a few doctors in the United States who specialize in removing large soft-tissue sarcomas. Typically, he added, tumors like these are 20 to 30 pounds.Fortunately, the \u201cslow-growing giant beast\u201d hadn\u2019t spread to other parts of Mr. Hernandez\u2019s body, Dr. Tseng said, but the surgical team did have to remove one of his kidneys.\u201cThe tumor swallowed it up, basically,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said of the kidney. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t functioning anymore.\u201dDoctors don\u2019t know why such sarcomas form or how to stop them.\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that can prevent it at this point,\u201d Dr. Tseng said.Unfortunately, Mr. Hernandez has been told the liposarcoma will most likely return.And if that happens, the cancer could become more aggressive. The only solution is more surgery, Dr. Tseng said, adding that he hoped this type of disease \u2014 while unusual \u2014 would be subject to more research.\u201cWe desperately need something better than surgery,\u201d he said.Mr. Hernandez will undergo CT scans every four months to monitor his condition.

Here\u2019s how Kate Conger, a tech reporter, reduces that exposure.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kate Conger, a technology reporter for The Times in San Francisco, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You cover breaking news about all things tech \u2014 from Google to Facebook to Twitter to Uber. What are your most important tools for staying quick on your toes?I use a note-taking app called Bear, which lets me sort and filter my notes using hashtags. It makes it really easy for me to keep my notes orderly while I\u2019m running around between interviews, and makes it possible for me to quickly return to a conversation months or even years later if I need to refer to it again. I\u2019m always a bit stressed about the security of tools I use for reporting, but Bear syncs through Apple\u2019s CloudKit, a framework that lets the app developers store my data on Apple\u2019s servers, so I feel relatively comfortable with it.For me, the most important way to stay quick is to stay focused \u2014 so I ultimately end up relying on pen and ink more than tech tools. It feels as if my half-baked thoughts are constantly getting bumped down my news feeds, so I keep a paper to-do list. I have disappearing messages turned on in most of my Slack, Signal and WhatsApp conversations, so sometimes I also need to write down important points so I don\u2019t forget them. I\u2019m paranoid, and keeping paper notes feels safer to me.What app do you use most? The app I use more than any other is Spotify. I\u2019m playing music constantly from the minute I wake up until I go back to sleep, which helps me keep track of time. If I\u2019ve played a whole album through and not finished writing a paragraph, I know it\u2019s time to buckle down. But I have such a love-hate relationship with Spotify. I do really like the Daily Mixes, which help me discover new music. I wish I could pin or save them. Sometimes I get mixes based on artists I haven\u2019t listened to in ages, and I just want to go back to the mix I had on repeat the day before.I\u2019m horribly cheap, but Spotify is one of the few apps I pay for. Since I\u2019m paying, my expectations are sky high, and yet the app is buggy and slow, and it crashes regularly. I expect it to read my mind and know exactly what I want to hear at all times, but it doesn\u2019t, so I\u2019m disappointed.I also love that more and more messaging apps are adding options for ephemeral conversation. I\u2019m increasingly convinced that the default of digitally hoarding all conversations forever was a terrible idea, and I like that I can get my conversations to disappear from most of the chat apps I use now.You\u2019ve written a lot about security. How do you keep your own tech setup secure? I got interested in security out of necessity. When I was a kid using social media for the first time, I was also in the process of extricating myself from an abuser. I had to figure out how to use things like Myspace \u2014 it felt very important at the time to have a vibrant Myspace life! \u2014 in ways that would protect my anonymity, my location data and other sensitive information. I\u2019d constantly be messaging my friends, asking them to take down certain pictures or posts that could help my abuser find me. This isn\u2019t a concern for me anymore, but the situation forced me to think about what kinds of personal data I was sharing online from the moment I started doing it, and I\u2019m grateful for that. A lot of people don\u2019t think about their online privacy until they\u2019re dealing with a compromising situation in which their data is already out there.What about protecting conversations with sources?I approach security as a journalist in much the same way that I\u2019ve approached security as a person. The first thing I think about is limiting my exposure \u2014 what kind of data are my source and I generating? How do I minimize that footprint, or at least minimize how long my devices retain it? The second step is securing the data we do end up generating, which often means encrypting it.Encrypted chat apps like Signal have made security and ephemerality so much easier. But because they require a phone number, there\u2019s still what\u2019s called the first contact problem \u2014 how does someone who doesn\u2019t have your phone number initiate a secure conversation with you? I\u2019ve tinkered around with a few different approaches: using burner SIM cards, setting up secondary numbers with Google Voice or Twilio, or using apps, like Wickr, that don\u2019t force me to publish my phone number. But I haven\u2019t settled on a solution that feels totally seamless yet.All this security tech can get overwhelming. I still believe that sometimes the most secure, ephemeral conversation you can have is an in-person one.What tech product are you personally obsessed with? I\u2019m honestly a bit slow about adopting new technology. I think I ought to be more adventurous as a tech reporter, but I tend to find things I like and stick with them. For example, I\u2019m refusing to upgrade my iPhone because I like Touch ID \u2014 I haven\u2019t even tried Face ID yet.Oh, and portable battery packs! I don\u2019t know how I ever survived without them. They are perfect lifesaving angels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What an Italian Donkey\u2019s Fate Tells Us About the Future of Europe", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA fable about Italy, bond yields and politics in the European Union.Dr. Rubinelli is a research fellow in the history of political thought at Robinson College, University of Cambridge. When asked about the little donkey\u2019s peculiar name, he answered that it would help us all to laugh a little about Italy\u2019s troubled economy and years of instability. \u201cLo spread\u201d had become shorthand for everything that was wrong. The yield on a bond reflects how much interest a borrower \u2014 in this case, the government \u2014 has to pay to borrow money. Germany, with its booming economy, is considered an excellent credit risk. So its bond yields are very low. Italy, by comparison, is seen as an overspender, so its yields are much higher.The difference is, in effect, encapsulated by that one number, \u201clo spread,\u201d an object of respect and fear that tells us a lot about the messy state of European politics.\u201cLo spread\u201d soon took center stage not only in politics but also in everyday life. I saw it in graffiti condemning the European Central Bank. On a trip to the Dolomites, I heard it in casual conversations at the bar. \u201cLo spread\u201d even made it to pop music, including a song called \u201cIl ballo dello spread,\u201d or \u201cThe Dance of the Spread.\u201d The chorus says it all: \u201cWhile lo spread goes up, up, up, Italian citizens go down, down, down.\u201d You\u2019re supposed to dance to it by mimicking the oscillations of the spread.These various attempts to desacralize \u201clo spread,\u201d to make fun of it and demystify it, served partly to make sense of its sudden and inescapable presence on the scene of Italian politics and partly to blame Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s government for getting us there in the first place.The spread reigned sovereign. It was constantly scrutinized and regularly on the front page of Italian newspapers. The government approved or rejected policies depending on its movements. Lo spread seemed to have the final word on Italy\u2019s future.In 2013, when Italy\u2019s economic situation began to stabilize, the phantom of the spread retreated.It reappeared in March, when a new coalition government came to power \u2014 one elected on an anti-austerity, euroskeptic agenda. The gap between Italian and German bond yields again started to grow, and with it, the spread made its reappearance in the headlines.In other words, Italy\u2019s leaders have discovered what so many Italians realized long ago: Mockery is a powerful tool, particularly when applied to the European Union\u2019s rigid rules. Apocalyptic predictions about what would happen if \u201clo spread\u201d became too large have not come to pass, at least for now. The government no longer accepts an abstract bond finance term as the unappealable judge of Italian politics, and there is a widespread sense that it is time to challenge not just the commission\u2019s fiscal rules but also the E.U. in general.Instead of a symbol of Italy\u2019s weakness relative to Germany and the rest of Europe, \u201clo spread\u201d has become a symbol of all that is frustrating about the E.U.My grandpa figured this out a while ago. When Angela Spread was fully grown, he sold her.Lucia Rubinelli is a research fellow in the history of political thought at Robinson College, University of Cambridge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "God\u2019s Red Army", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican Party hopes to beat back the Democrats on Tuesday with a big push from the Christian right.Ms. Stewart writes regularly about the political activities of evangelicals and other religious groups.If Democrats fail to realize their dream of a blue wave in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, perhaps the biggest factor will be the organizing power of the Christian nationalist movement. \u201cIf we do our jobs,\u201d Ralph Reed of the Faith & Freedom Coalition boasted at the Values Voters Summit in September, \u201cthey are going to be more shocked than they were the last time.\u201dAmong leaders of the Christian right, conversations about 2018 tend to begin with happy memories of 2016.Political commentators may argue that some combination of racism and economic anxieties of the white working class put Mr. Trump over the top, but leaders at the Values Voters Summit took a different view.\u201cIf you back the evangelicals out of the white vote, Donald Trump loses whites,\u201d Mr. Reed told the crowd. \u201cIf the rapture had occurred, Donald Trump would have lost by the worst landslide since George McGovern.\u201dMr. Reed and other conservative evangelical leaders are convinced they can do it again in 2018. \u201cFrom an overall perspective of where the voters are, I am very bullish,\u201d Chris Wilson, the C.E.O. of the political consulting firm WPA Intelligence, told Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, in an October radio segment.Evangelical policy groups have been investing serious money in turning out votes to shore up a red firewall. Mr. Reed\u2019s coalition, for instance, is putting $18 million into this cycle, up from $10 million in 2016 and $5 million in the 2014 midterms. \u201cThe only thing that matters is who comes out on Election Day,\u201d Mr. Reed said.The Christian nationalist turnout machine relies heavily on an extensive network of conservative pastors. The Family Research Council, for example, runs \u201cpastor briefings\u201d through its organization Watchmen on the Wall, which claimed 28,000 members in 2014. At a Watchmen pastors briefing in Unionville, N.C., on Oct. 4, Mr. Perkins said: \u201cThe members of your congregation need to vote. As pastors, you need to \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say \u2018challenge them\u2019 \u2014 you need to tell them to vote.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much doubt about how he and other speakers expected their people to vote. At the same event, J.C. Church, Watchmen on the Wall\u2019s national director of ministry engagement and a founder of the Ohio-focused get-out-the-vote initiative Awake88, said, \u201cthe No. 1 thing\u201d anybody can give you is \u201cthe supreme Christ.\u201d But \u201cthe second greatest thing we can give this generation,\u201d he swiftly added, \u201cis the Supreme Court.\u201d\u201cWe can build a firewall for our children and grandchildren that they just might scale the seven mountains of influence,\u201d Mr. Church continued. \u201cSeven mountains\u201d alludes to an aspect of Christian dominionist ideology, according to which God has commanded true Christians to gain control of seven areas of civilization \u2014 including government, business, education and the media.Unionville, not coincidentally, sits in one hotly contested congressional district and in driving range of two others, all three currently in Republican hands. \u201cIf we lose those three seats to progressives,\u201d Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition, told the audience at the pastor briefing, \u201cthe whole Congress could be lost.\u201dThe Republican Party candidate in one of those districts, Mark Harris, was on hand in Unionville with a speech that sounded a lot like a sermon \u2014 unsurprising given that he is also a pastor. \u201cThe greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion,\u201d he said. It was a reminder that at this conference, there was no easy place to draw the line between preacher and politician, just as there seemed to be little or no space between church and political party.A glance at the schedule of pastor briefings across the country suggests that they are precisely targeted according to the needs of the Republican Party. The same is true of the itinerary of the Family Research Council\u2019s \u201cValues Bus\u201d initiative, which is sending buses as mobile get-out-the-vote units to evangelical churches and events to key congressional districts.The Family Research Council offers pastors comprehensive tool kits, including a 36-page ivotevalues.org resource guide and instructions for establishing \u201cCulture Impact Teams\u201d within churches, which aim to turn out congregants to vote their \u201cbiblical values.\u201d Mr. Church\u2019s Awake88 group offers a \u201cChurch Voter Lookup,\u201d which essentially marries a church database with a voter database. The Faith & Freedom Coalition is working with 30,000 churches and aims to distribute millions of voter guides by Tuesday.To comply with tax and campaign finance rules, the voter guides put out by these groups are all ostensibly nonpartisan. But that doesn\u2019t mean their message isn\u2019t clear: One party is \u201cpro-life\u201d and supports \u201creligious freedom.\u201d The other party is presumably against life and wants to oppress believers.After pipe bombs were mailed to over a dozen Democratic leaders, Tony Perkins did make calls to end the rhetoric of division. \u201cThe path forward is a civil one,\u201d he wrote on Oct. 24. But in his appearances before Christian nationalist audiences, he takes a different tone. \u201cAre the growing reports of left-wing violence random, or is there is an intentional effort to intimidate conservative-leaning voters?\u201d he asked in the Oct. 18 radio segment with Mr. Wilson, a theme he returned to multiple times. At the Unionville pastors\u2019 event, Mr. Perkins asserted, \u201cWe are in a spiritual war.\u201d He left little room for doubt that, in his view, \u201cthe rulers of darkness\u201d and \u201cthe spiritual host of wickedness\u201d are to be found on the Democratic Party\u2019s side of the aisle.Alongside the mobilization of pastors, Christian nationalist organizations are pursuing a data-driven strategy. The Faith & Freedom Coalition reportedly plans \u201cto micro-target around 125 million social conservative voters across 19 different states through door-to-door interactions, digital ads, phone calls, and mailers,\u201d according to an article in The Christian Post.\u201cFaith & Freedom monitors voters\u2019 databases to see which of the people they have interacted with vote early,\u201d Lance Lemmonds, the communications director of the coalition told The Christian Post. \u201cFor those that haven\u2019t voted early, the organization will send out about 28 million digital ads encouraging them to vote in the last weekend and Monday.\u201d The coalition, he added, \u201cwill inundate Christian conservative voters in the last weekend. We will send those ads directly to their cellphones.\u201dThe Faith & Freedom Coalition and the Family Research Council have also teamed up with United in Purpose, a data-mining operation that seeks to \u201ctransform culture\u201d in \u201cwhat some people call the seven mountains,\u201d according to the president of United in Purpose, Bill Dallas. According to a 2012 article on NPR\u2019s website, the organization assigns citizens points for certain characteristics, such as membership on anti-abortion lists or an interest in Nascar. If a voter\u2019s score \u201ctotaled over 600 points,\u201d Mr. Dallas said, \u201cwe run that person against the voter registration database.\u201d If not registered, \u201cthat became one of the key people we were going to target.\u201dIn a 2016 interview on Daystar TV, Mr. Dallas was even clearer: \u201cWe have a ministry consultant who will work with each church to help them get their people out to vote on Election Day.\u201dIt would be inaccurate to assume that Christian nationalists are targeting only white evangelicals. Conservative Catholics are very much part of the focus, as are nonwhite evangelicals. Latino pastors and churches are targeted with messages about abortion, \u201creligious freedom\u201d and economic self-sufficiency.At the same event, a businessman named Craig Huey, speaking through a translator, told the assembled pastors: \u201cYou need to be able to explain to your fellowship these issues. When we talk about abortion, for example, what is more important, talking about the minimum wage or about life?\u201d Mr. Huey volunteered to host election forums at the pastors\u2019 churches. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it for you. And if you want to do it, we have a PowerPoint that you can use to go straight down the ballot. It\u2019s not Republican, it\u2019s not Democrat. But where do they stand on abortion?\u201dLeaders of the Christian nationalist movement appear to be aware that their political activity may raise questions about their compliance with the legal and tax guidelines intended to prevent churches from engaging in direct campaigning for political candidates and parties. At the Unionville pastor briefing, Tami Fitzgerald instructed pastors on how to thread the needle: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can talk about issues all day long as a pastor, you can tell people who you\u2019re going to vote for,\u201d she said. But \u201cyou must not publish that information in a church newsletter or state it from the pulpit.\u201dIn his first months in office, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the Johnson Amendment, a federal law barring houses of worship, charitable nonprofits and private foundations from endorsing or financially supporting political parties and candidates. But it\u2019s unclear what a repeal of the Johnson Amendment would accomplish. In Unionville, San Diego and elsewhere across the country, it\u2019s all but impossible to separate pastors from political operatives, parties from houses of worship, and the redemptive messages of theology from the slogans of partisan placards.Still, the narrative that government is stomping all over the rights of conservative churches to enter the public square is one of the best ways to get the base to the polls. With so much at stake on Tuesday, it seems too useful to set aside just because it\u2019s not true.Advertisement"}

We had every right to get married.\u201dSo they challenged the denial and filed an amparo lawsuit, which guarantees the protection of an individual\u2019s constitutional rights, with the civil federal court in Mexico.On Oct. 19, the court ruled in their favor, disagreeing with the Foreign Ministry\u2019s argument that the couple could only marry by traveling to Mexico City or one of Mexico\u2019s states where marriage equality laws are in place.As a result, the federal government of Mexico granted a marriage license to the couple, and their union, now legally recognized throughout Mexico, opens the door for other Mexican same-sex couples living abroad to be married in embassies and consulates under Mexican law, a significant development as there are 12 million Mexicans living abroad, according to the Mayor\u2019s Office for International Affairs.\u201cIt felt like after months and months of getting so many noes and rejections, we were finally able to do what should have taken a week to get done,\u201d Mr. Berezowsky said. \u201cNeedless to say, we were both thrilled with the ruling.\u201dMr. Berezowski added that the ruling may actually serve a dual-purpose: \u201cIt will take the same-sex marriage discussion back to Mexico, where recently, presidential candidates kept saying it was not a national issue and that it belonged to individual states and local governments.

{"Headline": "Brownies for Those Who Live to Lick the Bowl", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteOlive oil and a touch of sea salt make this recipe both gooey and slightly savory.This recipe is particularly suited to the task because, unlike others of its ilk, it skips the butter, relying instead on olive oil and the natural cocoa butter in chocolate to enrich the batter. The result is moist in the center, crisp at the edges and perfectly smooth but for the occasional crunch of a chocolate chip. Closer to ganache than to cake, these dense, dark treats are not for anyone who prefers a lighter, feathery type of brownie. They\u2019re for people who live to lick the icing bowl.Because there\u2019s no butter to soften its intensity, the flavor of the olive oil here matters a lot. Don\u2019t use the grassy, sharp, highly aromatic stuff you\u2019d drizzle on lettuce leaves. Choose something milder and more neutral. I use the same extra-virgin oil I cook with \u2014 a good-quality, midpriced workhorse.The olive oil gives these brownies a slightly savory quality, highlighted by a sprinkle of flaky sea salt that\u2019s added right after baking. Make sure to sprinkle the salt while the brownies are still warm, which helps it stick. While showering them with salt before baking works with other, frothier brownie batters, it fails here, with the flakes sinking in and disappearing without a trace. Adding it at the end gives each bite a salty snap and a gentle crunch.For an even more pronounced crunch, add chopped, toasted nuts to the batter along with \u2014 or instead of \u2014 the chocolate chips. Or for an ultra-satiny batch of brownies that are just on the solid side of pudding, skip both nuts and chips, and let the salt provide the only textural contrast.Because these brownies are so deeply fudgy, a tester won\u2019t come out clean even when they\u2019re done. Instead, bake them until the batter looks and feels solid when gently pressed in the center. The brownies firm up enough to cut as they cool, but without losing their essential olive-oil gooeyness, which is a fitting tribute on Hanukkah \u2014 and utterly compelling during the rest of the year.Advertisement"}

And medical marijuana may be just the latest example of this shift.The proposition to have Utah join the dozens of other states allowing medical marijuana got more than 200,000 signatures, the most of any ballot initiative this year. The other measures are Proposition 3, which would expand Medicaid for the poor and children under the Affordable Care Act, while Proposition 4 would help restrict gerrymandering by creating an impartial redistricting committee. Both initiatives, favored heavily by Democrats, have a good chance of passing.Support for the proposition has dropped to around 50 percent from 70 percent in the spring as the Mormon Church has become more vocal in its opposition. In August, the church headquarters sent members an email warning that adoption would create a \u201cserious threat to health and public safety, especially for our youth and young adults.\u201d A high-ranking Mormon leader said that the proposal lacks \u201cproper controls\u201d to ensure only legitimate use of medical marijuana. Prominent Mormon politicians have also spoken out against it, including the popular Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for an open Senate seat, and the Republican governor, Gary Herbert.In another, a woman recounts her two-decade battle with multiple sclerosis, which has left her housebound or in a wheelchair. \u201cCannabis has given me the ability to be part of life again,\u201d she writes. Stories abound of Utah families who moved to California or Colorado to get marijuana treatment for loved ones. I have a good friend whose daughter left Utah for Southern California, where she is able to treat a severe back injury with prescribed cannabis.The vote on Tuesday is fundamentally about the degree to which all the political positioning among vested interests will be guided by popular will. A close vote, or outright vote down, will likely prolong debate and delay future medical cannabis treatments for Utah residents. As a fourth-generation Utahn and the descendant of Mormons (I no longer am a member of the church), I often remind friends and colleagues that the people\u2019s business is not always the church\u2019s business. A victory for Proposition 2 would not just potentially open medical alternatives to many suffering people. It would also send a signal to local politicians who often act as unofficial Mormon Church proxies. A little electoral disobedience from the Latter-day Saint faithful might strengthen the separation between church and state.And the Mormon Church\u2019s often well-meaning leaders, whose offices fill a Salt Lake City skyscraper, might also realize that sometimes it is the flock that leads the shepherd.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Past Is Present: Strategies for Bringing Current Events Into the Social Studies Classroom", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Studies SkillsWhy do we insist that students study history?Perhaps because the study of history promotes critical thinking, creates a shared cultural literacy or encourages responsible citizenship. Certainly one of the most important reasons is because history continues to matter.Why has North Korea developed a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States? Why are thousands of Hondurans camped out on the southern border of the United States? Why have many athletes decided to kneel during the national anthem? To answer any of these questions \u2014 or the myriad others posed by the news every day \u2014 students will need to understand what happened in the past.In this teaching resource, we suggest different methods teachers can use to easily facilitate these connections. Each method is illustrated with two examples, one from global history and another from United States history, and each ends with a classroom challenge. The goal is to help this kind of thinking become a habit of mind for your students._________Essential questions are, by definition, open-ended and big-picture, and using them in the history classroom encourages students to relate history to current events.Here are two examples.Global | How do geography and climate affect human life?Let\u2019s say you\u2019re studying the significance of geography in shaping the development of civilizations, perhaps in relation to the rise of ancient river valley civilizations._________If students are connecting the role of past presidents such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson or Franklin D. Roosevelt to our current president, there is a constant stream of related Times articles for them to explore. These lesson plans link to some of the best:_________Like essential questions, themes in the history classroom encourage students to make connections across time periods and places. They are also relatively easy to use to identify related current events. Here are two examples you might consider using.Global | Human Rights Violations (or Religious Conflict)If you\u2019re studying 20th-century human tragedies like the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, students learn that human rights violations are unfortunately an enduring issue. The current persecution of the Rohingya clearly highlights that reality._________U.S. | ImmigrationOnce they find a piece that interests them, they can identify what argument the writer is making and then decide if they agree or disagree. For balance, they can look for another opinion piece that argues a different position, either in The Times or elsewhere, and decide which point of view they agree with most and why. What issues that we\u2019re still debating today were issues in the era they are studying? What images, quotes, data or other kinds of information can they find that might make interesting paired texts to link the two eras?_________Global | World War IThe world just commemorated the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Katrin Bennhold writes about the unsettling similarities between 1914 and today:Now as then, Europe\u2019s political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments._________U.S. | ReconstructionReconstruction has long been misrepresented, or simply neglected, in our schools, and unlike Confederate generals and founders of the Ku Klux Klan, few if any monuments exist to the black and white leaders of that era._________Since social studies students spend a great deal of time exploring historic places, one easy way to make that study relevant to them is to have them discover what those places look like today, and how life there has either changed or stayed the same. What remnants of the past are still present? Why?Global | China (Silk Road)China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.China envisions a vast global network of trade, investment and infrastructure that will reshape financial and geopolitical ties \u2014 and bring the rest of the world closer to Beijing._________U.S. | HarlemFor nearly a century, Harlem has been synonymous with black urban America. Given its magnetic and growing appeal to younger black professionals and its historic residential enclaves and cultural institutions, the neighborhood\u2019s reputation as the capital of black America seems unlikely to change soon.But the neighborhood is in the midst of a profound and accelerating shift. In greater Harlem, which runs river to river, and from East 96th Street and West 106th Street to West 155th Street, blacks are no longer a majority of the population \u2014 a shift that actually occurred a decade ago, but was largely overlooked._________Historians\u2019 understanding of the past is typically grounded in what they glean from analyzing texts and artifacts. How are these still relevant today? Regular readers of The Times know that works of art, texts and structures created long ago are often featured in stories from the Politics, Travel or Arts sections as new generations discover them or reconsider their power and significance.Global | The Ruins of Ancient RomeIslamic State propagandists considered Palmyra a bonanza for promoting their vision of a strictly religious caliphate devoid of homage to other cultures or religions. They publicized the work of their demolition teams with graphic photographs._________U.S. | The Constitution_________Global | Fascist LeadersEven though the rise of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini pulled the world into the most destructive conflict in human history, World War II, the end of the war marked the end of fascism.Right?_________U.S. | Robber BaronsAmerican industrialists and business magnates in the late 19th century, like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D.

{"Headline": "Winning the House Is Not Nothing", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bumbling, exasperating Democratic Party claws back one branch of government.Mr. Baker is a novelist and historian.To borrow from Churchill, election night 2018 was not the end of the Trump phenomenon. It was not even the beginning of the end. But it was, perhaps, the end of the beginning.If the blue tsunami that Democrats were hoping for did not quite materialize, the party did manage to retake the House of Representatives and claw back at least some hold on our national government. It will enable them both to promote their own ideas and initiatives \u2014 and to provide some real oversight of the Trump White House, even if impeachment is not on the table. Much more important, it will also enable Democrats to save health care for millions of Americans (myself included), though President Trump will doubtless now continue his Ahab-like pursuit of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy in the courts and the federal bureaucracy.Have no doubt about it: the 2018 elections were a referendum on Mr. Trump, and he must own it. Since it is not the president\u2019s wont to accept responsibility for anything, you will hear much in the weeks (and months and years) ahead about how rare it is for any incumbent president\u2019s party to gain or hold seats in a midterm race.This is true. It has happened only three times since the Civil War, and then every time in the wake of a national trauma of one sort of another: in 2002, when the Republicans managed it a little over a year after the 9/11 attacks; in 1998, when a nation fed up with the endless hunting of President Bill Clinton enabled Democrats to keep from losing any seats in the Senate and pick up five in the House; and in 1934, when Americans, finally managing to pull themselves up at least partly from the nadir of the Great Depression, rewarded President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s Democrats with a remarkable nine seats in each house.The field was set for Republicans to pull off the same trick in 2018. Whatever his responsibility for either, Mr. Trump could boast of a red-hot economy and a campaign that drove ISIS from its last major citadels. Toss in a summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un that proved more comical than scary, a shaking up of both our more complacent allies and China, and Mr. Trump might have fashioned a reasonable case that his methods, crude and unsavory though they might be, were accomplishing something. A sudden switch in tone and tactics, a commitment to building something (something more inspiring than a border wall, that is), and a few high-minded, kumbaya speeches might have thrown the opposition completely off balance and provided Mr. Trump, for once, with something that really was a historic accomplishment.He couldn\u2019t do it. What we got instead were simply more displays of churlishness and solipsism, running from his oblivious response to the horrible massacre of Jewish Americans at a Pittsburgh synagogue (it was somehow the fault of the \u201cfake news media\u201d which is \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d and hey, they should have had better security), to his implication that pipe bombs sent to his enemies were a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation, to his incessant pillorying of the \u201ccaravan\u201d of desperate refugees fleeing Central America, right down to a final ad considered so racist that it was even pulled from Fox.\u201cA lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times, so you know,\u201d was Mr. Trump\u2019s comment on this, nearly his last comment of the campaign.He drew the reaction he deserved. The former congressman Steve Israel told me that he divided this strange, often frightening election season into three parts: an initial blue wave of anger, followed by a countering red wave of anger over the Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 but then another blue wave of anger, as Mr. Trump injected himself into the race again.\u201cMidterm voters, especially, vote on visceral emotions, fear and anger,\u201d Mr. Israel said. \u201cRepublicans tried running on fear. This is the first time I have ever seen Democrats voting in the midterms motivated by anger.\u201dIt was a mood reflected in much of Manhattan. At my polling place \u2014 appropriately enough, the Alfred E. Smith School on the Upper West Side, named for New York\u2019s original \u201cHappy Warrior\u201d \u2014 lines were longer than I had seen them on any Election Day save for the Obama-McCain election of 2008. This time the feeling in the lines was entirely different from that day ten years ago, and not just because the balmy sunshine had been replaced by rain. My fellow voters seemed grimly determined, quietly set on delivering a message even though there were no competitive races (or competitive Republicans) on the ballot.So where are we and where do we go from here?A tip that Mr. Trump should take from a much better politician than himself, the man who did pull off the impossible, is that there are times to get off the stage. Even when things were going well, Franklin Roosevelt liked to say, periodically, that it was time for him to disappear \u2014 to keep a low profile, get out of the public eye and go fishing, even in that much less media-freighted era. No one wants a president in her face all the time, and no TV show is on every night.It is not advice Mr. Trump will take. Even on election night, he was giving himself full credit in his tweets for what he called a \u201ctremendous success\u201d and retweeting what the writer Ben Stein had said about him, namely that \u201cMr. Trump has magic about him. He has magic coming out of his ears. He is an astonishing vote-getter and campaigner.\u201dWell, the magical Mr. Trump has become a permanent low-pressure system hovering over us, dominating our conversation, filling our airwaves, distracting us from exercising our great right to be left alone. But he is constitutionally incapable of giving up the tweet-glow, and so will likely exhaust even his most devoted followers in the end.Regarding those followers: we have all been told, over and over again, by one expert after another from nearly every possible spot on the political spectrum that none of us must ever, ever talk down to these, our fellow Americans, or criticize their choice of Mr. Trump in any way, lest we further alienate them.Fine. I will say this then: listen to yourselves. Listen to your experience, to that little voice in your heart or in your head, to what you can recall of what used to be acceptable presidential behavior in this country. It will tell you that this is not a fit man to be president, in any way whatsoever. It will tell you that this is not what you have to settle for, that you yourselves can do better in choosing someone else, no matter how often you have been disappointed in the past.For Democrats, this campaign had its own heartbreaks: Beto O\u2019Rourke, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum losing to three of the most obnoxious candidates in the race. The wrenchingly narrow failure to knock the likes of Steve King or Chris Collins out of the House. And of course, Republicans keeping the Senate means not only that Mr. Trump will have something to brag about (when does he not?) but that he can jam through as many appointments \u2014 particularly judicial appointments \u2014 as he likes, perhaps starting with a replacement for Justice Clarence Thomas at a politically convenient moment like, say, 2020.As is our wont, we liberals bombarded ourselves \u2014 and our candidates \u2014 with endless litanies of advice on what we should and should not say. In one October week, I had a close friend rage to me that Nancy Pelosi had spoiled everything by daring to say, months before, that the proposals of the Democrats\u2019 newly minted star from the Bronx, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, would not always reflect those of House Democrats going forward \u2014 only to have another friend email me angrily that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was going to spoil everything by proposing that we spend $36 trillion dollars on her socialist ideas!As it worked out, Ms. Pelosi, one of the most consistently and unfairly maligned politicians of our time, will now become the first congressperson to regain the speakership of the House since Sam Rayburn did it back in 1955. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will join her in the House, and judging by how intelligent, tough and savvy both women are, they will no doubt learn a great deal from each other.This is something that would have been all but impossible just thirty years ago, and unthinkable fifty years ago: the Italian-American woman Speaker of the House mentoring the Hispanic woman representative of a chunk of Mr. Trump\u2019s old borough \u2014 both of them part of a group of what is now more than one hundred women in the House. The bumbling, exasperating, sometimes corrupt, often oblivious Democratic Party \u2014 always the party of immigrants and (however belatedly) the party of people of color \u2014 is the party of inclusion, and its win this year, in the face of relentless demagoguery and racism, makes it truer than ever to say it was a good night for our democracy.Kevin Baker is a novelist and historian and the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica the Ingenious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One day he was visited by a clever god called Theuth.Theuth was an inventor of many useful things: arithmetic and geometry; astronomy and dice. But his greatest discovery, so he believed, \u201cwas the use of letters.\u201d And it was this invention that Theuth was most eager to share with King Thamus.The art of writing, Theuth said, \u201cwill make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.\u201dBut Thamus rebuffed him. \u201cO most ingenious Theuth,\u201d he said, \u201cthe parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them.\u201dThe king continued: \u201cFor this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners\u2019 souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember themselves.\u201dWritten words, Thamus concluded, \u201cgive your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things but will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.\u201dWelcome to Facebook.To which one can only say: About time.The story of the wildly exaggerated promises and damaging unintended consequences of technology isn\u2019t exactly a new one. The real marvel is that it constantly seems to surprise us. Why?But the deeper reason that technology so often disappoints and betrays us is that it promises to make easy things that, by their intrinsic nature, have to be hard.Tweeting and trolling are easy. Mastering the arts of conversation and measured debate is hard. Texting is easy. Writing a proper letter is hard. Looking stuff up on Google is easy. Knowing what to search for in the first place is hard. Having a thousand friends on Facebook is easy. Maintaining six or seven close adult friendships over the space of many years is hard. Swiping right on Tinder is easy. Finding love \u2014 and staying in it \u2014 is hard.That\u2019s what Socrates (or Thamus) means when he deprecates the written word: It gives us an out. It creates the illusion that we can remain informed, and connected, even as we are spared the burdens of attentiveness, presence of mind and memory. That may seem quaint today. But how many of our personal, professional or national problems might be solved if we desisted from depending on shortcuts?To read The Times\u2019s account of how Facebook dealt with its problems is to be struck by how desperately Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg sought to massage and finesse \u2014 with consultants, lobbyists and technological patches \u2014 what amounted to a daunting if simple crisis of trust. As with love and grammar, acquiring and maintaining trust is hard. There are no workarounds.Start over, Facebook. Do the basics. Stop pretending that you\u2019re about transforming the state of the world. Work harder to operate ethically, openly and responsibly. Accept that the work will take time.

{"Headline": "Behind Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Rise, Two Loyal Enforcers", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents has focused attention on their roles as enablers of the crown prince\u2019s impulsiveness and aggression, and Saudi watchers consider the men\u2019s fate a bellwether of the royal court\u2019s direction as it grapples with the international outrage over the killing.\u201cThey are the closest people to the crown prince,\u201d said Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cThey are his political enforcers and the face of the brash new \u2018Saudi first\u2019 posture at home and abroad, and those opposed to the hypernationalist, thuggish direction in Saudi foreign policy would be happy to see them cut down to size.\u201dBut the kingdom has already assigned some blame for the killing to Mr. Qahtani, the social-media czar. He lost his title as an adviser to the royal court because he contributed to the vitriolic rhetoric toward the kingdom\u2019s critics that led to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, a Saudi official said. It is unclear which of his many duties Mr. Qahtani has relinquished.Mr. Sheikh, the sports commissioner, was in New York for medical treatment during the killing, according to Saudis who know him, and has since avoided the spotlight.Mr. Qahtani did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Sheikh did not respond to a request for comment sent to the sports commission.Both men run portfolios \u2014 social media and sports \u2014 that resonate with the large population of young Saudis whom Prince Mohammed has courted as his base. Both have sought to fire up the fierce nationalism that the prince has encouraged by pouring money into battles against rivals in stadiums or on the internet.Although neither portfolio relates to foreign affairs, foreign envoys often seek out the two men because of their influence, said Dennis Horak, the former Canadian ambassador to Riyadh who was expelled in August after other Canadian diplomats called for the release of detained rights activists.Mr. Sheikh was approachable while Mr. Qahtani \u201chad a much fiercer reputation,\u201d Mr. Horak said. The pair, he said, was \u201cnot so much good cop-bad cop, more bad cop and lesser-bad cop.\u201dLike Prince Mohammed, neither was well known before the prince\u2019s father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015. Both were educated inside the kingdom with scant experience abroad.But each man had skills the prince treasured.He also appears to have developed an interest in hacking. As early as 2009, someone using credentials associated with Mr. Qahtani was trawling amateur hacking forums to learn about surveillance software, according to images of the posts captured by other forum members.In 2012, someone using Mr. Qahtani\u2019s government email address solicited services from the Italian spyware company Hacking Team, according emails later released by WikiLeaks. In one email, the writer sought a visit by people with \u201chigh technical knowledge\u201d to \u201cexplain the solutions you offer and training and costs.\u201d\u201cWill bear all the costs of the trip from A-Z,\u201d the author of the email added.In an extension of his royally financed campaign to build a sports empire, Mr. Sheikh became the honorary president of one of the most successful and popular soccer teams in Egypt, an honor widely believed to reflect heavy investments of money from the crown prince. But Mr. Sheikh resigned in a dispute with the board after just a few months and instead bankrolled his own rival franchise, Pyramid. He recruited three star Brazilian players and launched a sports channel dedicated to his team, reportedly pouring in as much as $33 million.But he complained publicly that Egyptian referees, fans and commentators were failing to appreciate his investments, and said he had asked Egypt\u2019s president to intervene. In September, a stadium of Egyptian soccer fans broke out in vulgar chants denouncing Mr. Sheikh and the Saudis, and he responded by abandoning the team.\u201cStrange attacks from everywhere, and a new story every day,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cWhy the headache?\u201dMr. Sheikh also splurged last September on a $4.8 million limited edition Bugatti Chiron sports car, according to a sales contract obtained by The New York Times. The seller, the Emirati businessman Saeed Mohammed Butti Alqubaisi, declined to comment.When an entertainment program on the Saudi-owned satellite network MBC last year seemed to hint at a rumored affair between Mr. Sheikh and an Egyptian singer, Mr. Sheikh ordered the network to fire the production team, according to industry executives familiar with the case. The show remains off the air.Both men played signal roles in Prince Mohammed\u2019s rise. In June 2017, Mr. Sheikh and Mr. Qahtani were among a handful of Prince Mohammed\u2019s loyalists who forcibly detained the previous crown prince and interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, holding him overnight and threatening him until he agreed to give up his claim to the throne, according to members and associates of the royal family.In a video made the next day, Mr. Sheikh can be seen hovering behind the ousted prince as he pledges allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman. A social media campaign spread rumors that a cocaine addiction had made the ousted prince unfit to rule, and people close to the royal family said Mr. Qahtani fueled the rumors.Both men sprang into action again when Saudi Arabia led a blockade of its tiny neighbor Qatar in June 2017, over its support for political Islam. They unleashed insults and promoted hashtags bashing Qatar, and Mr. Qahtani forced MBC to stop airing Turkish soap operas because of Turkey\u2019s support for Qatar, costing the network millions in losses, according to industry executives.A Qatari-owned network, BeIN Sports, had acquired the exclusive rights to broadcast this year\u2019s World Cup in the Arab world. So Mr. Qahtani helped promote BeoutQ, a bootleg operation beamed from Riyadh-based Arabsat. BeoutQ ripped live events from BeIN\u2019s feed and broadcast the games without paying for rights, spurring international lawsuits. The Saudi government has denied any relationship to the pirate network.Both men also played key roles again last fall when Crown Prince Mohammed arbitrarily detained hundreds of the kingdom\u2019s richest businessmen and several of his royal cousins in a Ritz-Carlton hotel in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption \u2014 just a few weeks after Mr. Sheikh had picked up his $4.8 million Bugatti.Both men acted as interrogators, demanding that the captives confess to corrupt self-enrichment and pledge to surrender vast sums, according to relatives and close associates of several detainees. Although blindfolded during some interrogations, detainees told relatives that they saw the two men or recognized their voices from broadcast interviews. Others said that through hotel room windows, they saw Mr. Sheikh coming and going surrounded by armed guards.Several former detainees have reported physical mistreatment during the interrogations, including beatings, electrical shocks and suspension upside down for long periods.Some have shown their family members lasting scars from the beatings and shocks, and in one case photographs of the bruises and scars have been shared with The New York Times; some of the pictures included the electronic monitoring bracelet that the government has forced released detainees to wear to track their movements. One was forced to make his consent to a forced confession with only a thumb print because he was too incapacitated to write out his signature, according to a relative informed by the detainee.Although no evidence has emerged that either man directly abused the captives, both questioned detainees who had been abused.The government of Saudi Arabia has called the allegations of physical abuse \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201dNeither Mr. Qahtani nor Mr. Sheikh have commented publicly on the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. But Mr. Qahtani, who lost his title as a royal court adviser, appears to believe his days of serving the prince are not over.After his dismissal, he tweeted his thanks to the king and crown prince for \u201cthis great opportunity to have the honor to serve the homeland.\u201d\u201cI will remain a loyal servant of my country forever,\u201d he added.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and David D.

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Hear It (Quickly) for the Half-Hour Drama", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe new Amazon drama \u201cHomecoming\u201d has a lot going for it. Julia Roberts in her first starring TV role. Bravura directing from Sam Esmail of \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d A top-notch supporting cast, taut writing and a mind-bending military-corporate thriller plot.With today\u2019s expansive TV drama installments typically running an hour (or more), each episode of \u201cHomecoming\u201d felt like a gift certificate for 30 extra minutes of sweet, unencumbered life. Thirty more minutes to work, to sleep or \u2014 why not? \u2014 watch a second episode.They were no less captivating for being short. They may have even been better.Somewhere in its history, TV formalized the idea that drama is a marathon and comedy a sprint. Network schedules established sitcoms at 30 minutes, with commercials; dramas \u2014 with early exceptions like most seasons of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d \u2014 settled in at 60.Only a hypocrite would praise the short installment at great length. So I\u2019ll be brief.First, short dramas are just practical. One could argue that only a TV critic frets about episode length: It\u2019s a first-world problem in a first-world job. But look, I\u2019m paid to do this. I\u2019ve got plenty of time.People with actual productive jobs, on the other hand, have ever more TV to fit in their limited free time. Epic drama means greater investment: You have to put in six or eight hours to get to the point where, your friends swear to you, \u201cOzark\u201d really gets good. (It doesn\u2019t. Saved you a day.)Short dramas are economical. Longer series have to serve a bigger roster of characters, spinning off subplots for each. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is an hour; the portion I want to follow any given week is maybe 20 minutes.\u201cHomecoming,\u201d likewise, has two timelines but one story. There isn\u2019t A, B, C and D plot, nor should there be; it would distract from the thriller\u2019s stage-like technique of building suspense through conversation.The half-hour drama also reflects where the real creative energy is in TV today. Some of the best work is happening in half-hour hybrids \u2014 \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cBetter Things,\u201d \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cBarry,\u201d to name a few \u2014 that are \u201ccomedies\u201d for awards purposes but half drama, or more, in substance.Then there\u2019s rhythm and velocity. Bingeing a lengthy drama can feel like sinking into quicksand; I\u2019m not so much absorbing the story as it absorbs me.

It\u2019s bracing; it\u2019s a changeup; it\u2019s narrative syncopation.Of course, neither is \u201cshorter is better\u201d an absolute rule. Wasted time is the problem rather than time itself, and there is certainly value to series like \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d that take advantage of the silent frame and the extended pause, allowing momentum to build and detail to accrete in such a way that, though their episodes might run past the usual length, they appear to fly by in a fraction of the usual time.But since when does length equal seriousness? \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d? \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d? \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d?

{"Headline": "How Cheap Labor Drives China\u2019s A.I. Ambitions", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldSome of the most critical work in advancing China\u2019s technology goals takes place in a former cement factory in the middle of the country\u2019s heartland, far from the aspiring Silicon Valleys of Beijing and Shenzhen. An idled concrete mixer still stands in the middle of the courtyard. Boxes of melamine dinnerware are stacked in a warehouse next door.Inside, Hou Xiameng runs a company that helps artificial intelligence make sense of the world. Two dozen young people go through photos and videos, labeling just about everything they see. That\u2019s a car. That\u2019s a traffic light. That\u2019s bread, that\u2019s milk, that\u2019s chocolate. That\u2019s what it looks like when a person walks.\u201cI used to think the machines are geniuses,\u201d Ms. Hou, 24, said. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re the reason for their genius.\u201dMost importantly, this thinking goes, the Chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data, thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement. Beyond what Facebook, Google and Amazon have amassed, Chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop, pay for meals and buy movie tickets.But the ability to tag that data may be China\u2019s true A.I. strength, the only one that the United States may not be able to match. In China, this new industry offers a glimpse of a future that the government has long promised: an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing.\u201cWe\u2019re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,\u201d said Yi Yake, co-founder of a data labeling factory in Jiaxian, a city in central Henan province. \u201cBut we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can\u2019t build the skyscrapers.\u201dWhile A.I. engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations, they lack cognitive abilities that even the average 5-year-old possesses. Small children know that a furry brown cocker spaniel and a black Great Dane are both dogs. They can tell a Ford pickup from a Volkswagen Beetle, and yet they know both are cars.A.I. has to be taught. It must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that a black cat and a white cat are both cats. This is where the data factories and their workers come in.Taggers helped AInnovation, a Beijing-based A.I. company, fix its automated cashier system for a Chinese bakery chain. Users could put their pastry under a scanner and pay for it without help from a human. But nearly one-third of the time, the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement, which made images more complex. Working with photos from the store\u2019s interior, the taggers got the accuracy up to 99 percent, said Liang Rui, an AInnovation project manager.\u201cAll the artificial intelligence is built on human labor,\u201d Mr. Liang said.AInnovation has fewer than 30 taggers, but a surge in labeling start-ups has made it easy to farm out the work. Once, Mr. Liang needed to get about 20,000 photos in a supermarket labeled in three days. Colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only a couple thousand dollars.\u201cWe\u2019re the assembly lines 10 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Yi, the co-founder of the data factory in Henan.The data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities, often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap. Many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities. But work is drying up, wage growth has slowed and many Chinese people prefer to live closer to home.Mr. Yi, 36, was out of a job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned A.I. tagging. After online searches, he decided it wasn\u2019t super technical but needed cheap labor, something Henan has in abundance.In March, Mr. Yi and his friends set up Ruijin Technology, which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for $21,000 a year. It was previously the park\u2019s Communist Party committee\u2019s event space, so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles.Ruijin, which means smart gold, now employs 300 workers but plans to expand to 1,000 after the Chinese New Year holiday, when many migrant workers come home.Unlike workers and business around the world, Mr. Yi isn\u2019t worried that A.I. will take his job.\u201cThe machines aren\u2019t smart enough to teach themselves yet,\u201d he said.Hiring is a bigger worry.Ruijin\u2019s pay of $400 to $500 a month is higher than average in Jiaxian. Some potential job candidates worry that they don\u2019t know anything about A.I. Others find the work boring.Jin Weixiang, 19, said he would quit Ruijin after the Chinese New Year and go to sell furniture in a physical store in southern city Guangzhou.\u201cI\u2019m a people\u2019s person,\u201d said Mr. Jin. \u201cI\u2019m doing labeling for the money.\u201dBut for some former migrant workers, the job is better than working on assembly lines.\u201cIt was the same work, same movement, day after day,\u201d said Yi Zhenzhen, a 28-year-old Ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company. \u201cNow I have to use my brain a little bit.\u201dMost of the time, customers don\u2019t tell these data factories what the task is for. Some are obvious. Labeling traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving. Labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines.Once Ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths. Mr. Yi said he wasn\u2019t sure what it was for. Maybe facial recognition?Roughly 300 miles to the north, in the Hebei city of Nangongshi, Hou Xiameng runs her data factory out of her in-laws\u2019 former cement factory. Her first job out of college was labeling faces for Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company with a $2 billion valuation that\u2019s most famous for its technology platform called Face++. To this day, some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because, she says, \u201cmy face is in the original database.\u201dBut life in Beijing was too tough and expensive. She and her then-fianc\u00e9, Zhao Yacheng, decided to move back to their hometown and start a data factory. Ms. Hou\u2019s parents would pay for computers and desks. They are renovating the warehouse next door to hire 80 more people.Like Mr. Yi, Ms. Hou doesn\u2019t spend time thinking about the implications of her work. Are they contributing to a surveillance state and a dystopian future that machines will control human?\u201cCameras make me feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in control of the machines for now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rapid Cure Approved for Sleeping Sickness, a Horrific Illness", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthParasites transmitted by tsetse flies travel to the brain, causing paranoia, fury and death. Until now, killing them required hospitalization and harsh drugs.The first treatment for sleeping sickness that relies on pills alone was approved on Friday by Europe\u2019s drug regulatory agency, paving the way for use in Africa, the last bastion of the horrific disease.With treatment radically simplified, sleeping sickness could become a candidate for elimination, experts said, because there are usually fewer than 2,000 cases in the world each year.The personalities of the infected change. They have terrifying hallucinations and fly into rages; they have been known to beat their children and even attack family members with machetes. They may become ravenous and scream with pain if water touches their skin. Only in the end, do they lapse into a long coma and die.The new drug, fexinidazole, cures all stages of the disease within 10 days.Previously, everyone with the parasites found in a blood test also had to undergo a spinal tap to see if the parasites had reached their brains. If so, patients had to suffer through a complex and sometimes dangerous intravenous regimen requiring hospitalization.An oral treatment that can safely be taken at home \u201cis a completely new paradigm \u2014 it could let us bring treatment down to the village level,\u201d said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, founder and executive director of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, which was started in 2005 by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders to find new cures for tropical diseases.The current intravenous drug, eflornithine, must be given over many days with intravenous fluids that weigh about 125 pounds, a big burden in the supply chain for rural hospitals, Dr. Pecoul said.Melarsoprol, the intravenous treatment used until a decade ago, contains an arsenic derivative. It corroded veins, triggered convulsions and killed 5 percent of the patients who got it.\u201cAn all-oral treatment has been a dream of mine for decades,\u201d said Dr. Victor Kande, an adviser to the health ministry of the Democratic Republic of Congo who oversaw clinical trials of the drug. \u201cThis is a huge leap in how we can tackle this disease.\u201dThe drug was created in the 1980s by Hoechst, a German drug company, but later abandoned.In 2009, seeking new anti-parasitic medicines, the initiative asked Sanofi, which held the patent, to reformulate it for sleeping sickness.Ultimately, the drive for approval cost $63 million and involved clinical trials including 750 patients in Congo and the Central African Republic. Two million villagers were screened.The costs were paid by seven European countries, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Doctors Without Borders and other donors.About 65 million people live in regions in west and central Africa where the most common strain of sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, circulates. A less common form circulates in southern Africa, and the harsh, older treatments are still needed to cure it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Golden Age for Cider Production in New York", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourOnce the Northeast was a center of America\u2019s cider industry. Now, producers are rediscovering what made ciders great 200 years ago.Because dwarfing rootstocks send out only shallow root systems, they need to be staked, so the trees don\u2019t collapse under their own weight. The trees need to be sprayed for pests and rot, because their immune systems are weak. Surrounding ground must be cleared because the trees, robbed of genetic diversity through years of cloning, cannot compete with grasses, weeds and other trees.That\u2019s how most modern American orchards are managed.\u201cThese trees can\u2019t survive in the wild,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why apples are the most sprayed crop in America.\u201dStill, Mr. Brennan, an avid hiker, discovered something peculiar about his area: Sullivan County, despite what Cornell said, was full of apple trees. Some, judging by their orderly arrangements, had once been cultivated in orchards. But others were just as clearly wild, most likely grown from seeds deposited, as nature intended, by animals that had eaten apples.Mr. Brennan\u2019s story is one of many in the fascinating rebirth of cider production within a couple of hours of New York City. Some producers, like Mr. Brennan, are foraging in unlikely areas.More cideries are in the Hudson Valley, a historic apple-growing area east of the Shawangunk Ridge, which separates the valley from the Catskills to the west. Most are focusing on heirloom varieties and European cider apples from established orchards rather than foraging.All share a deep-seated desire to understand the traditions, nuances and complexities of apples and ciders. They are the latest wave of a great cider revival in the Northeast, reaching through New England, out to the Finger Lakes in western New York, and down through the Appalachians.Mr. Brennan prefers the term \u201clocational\u201d to terroir. He makes 12 different locational ciders, though not all of them every year. \u201cWe let the elements of the locations express themselves through the ciders,\u201d he said, as we walked a grassy path curling up a ridge above his farmhouse.Each of the 300 trees he planted in his original effort 10 years ago has now been grafted over to the sort of wild apples he has foraged. He has also strewed an estimated 100,000 seeds over his ridge, confident that they will in a decade produce the sort of tannic, tart apples that once made great cider.\u201cI\u2019m trying to create not an orchard, but an apple hillside,\u201d he said.The trees grown from seed, he hopes, will be well adapted to survive in the area. The apples from such trees are a gnarly bunch, small and oddly shaped with lumps and discolored spots. The skins are astringent with tannins, and the fruit powerfully tart. Mr. Brennan minces no words. \u201cThese apples are disgusting to eat, and the cider is disgusting to drink, at least for the first six months or so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they age, and get better and better.\u201dA cider made from apples gathered in Mamakating Hollow in 2017 is intense and pure, herbal and lightly tannic, with a gentle, minty aftertaste. A slightly older Shawangunk Ridge cider \u2014 \u201ctwo miles away by crow,\u201d Mr. Brennan said \u2014 is completely different, with an almost piercing apple flavor, tempered by an underlying umami, almost cheesy element.Needless to say, these ciders and almost all the ciders I tasted would go beautifully with the fall harvest dinner otherwise known as Thanksgiving. Most range from roughly 7 to 9 percent alcohol, much less than the typical 12 to 14 percent of wine, for those concerned with overdoing it.\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the soils,\u201d he said, \u201cvery old, very rocky, decent natural pH and drainage. Apples like them, and the climate is right.\u201dWith the English apples they were able to harvest in 2017, Orchard Hill made Bitters and Sharps, which is still aging at the cidery, but is taut, tart and lip-smacking, with great freshness and energy. Another cider, Gold Label, is gently sweet but well-balanced and refreshing. Orchard Hill also makes Ten66 Pommeau, a blend of apple brandy and juice that tastes like a buttery caramel apple. Mixed with tonic, it would make a fine Thanksgiving aperitif.Coincidentally, Mr. Brennan, too, has a famous forebear, William J. Brennan Jr., who was an associate justice of the Supreme Court from 1956 to 1990, but with little apparent interest in farming.He started to make commercial cider in 2016, after two spring frosts in the last five years killed off a sizable portion of his crop, which Mr. Morgenthau said buds earlier than it once did.\u201cIf we were going to have the crop wiped out periodically, I thought we could take a bumper crop like 2015 and make cider with extra apples to tide us over,\u201d he said. He named his cider Treasury in homage to his grandfather.All the Treasury ciders are made from blends of apples. They all come from the estate orchard, yet each is quite different. The 2016 Onda is bone dry., with lush, ripe apple aromas and a citrus edge. The Burr Knot seems more spicy and exotic, while the Farmer\u2019s Motel is savory, pure, rich and deliciously austere.Like many cider producers, Mr. Morgenthau believes that a diversity of apples makes a better, more interesting cider than would a single variety.\u201cMost apples just take to a blend better,\u201d he said. \u201cDiversity is part of the tradition.\u201dA little like Mr. Brennan, Mr. Morgenthau recently gathered seeds from some of his favorite cider apples and planted 2,000 in a field. He plans to let them grow and see what develops, hoping they will turn into hardy, well-adapted trees. Each one growing from a seed rather than a cutting will be different, and perhaps from this greater genetic diversity, Hudson Valley cider will truly be reborn.\u201cGreat cider is not about the variety,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about a tree making its way in the world. That\u2019s what you taste.\u201dGreat ciders are now made all over the Northeast. These five small producers all work in New York State.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of cider produced by Treasury Cider. It is Farmer\u2019s Motel, not Farmer\u2019s Hotel. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified Josh Morgenthau\u2019s cidery. It is Treasury Cider, not Orchard Hill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Komodo Dragons Haven\u2019t Conquered the World", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe razor-toothed predators are fierce, but scientists found that they\u2019re real homebodies. A decade of observations at 10 sites on four islands has revealed that the dragons essentially never leave the valley where they were born. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t. They are capable of traveling many miles and through rough terrain, if necessary. They just don\u2019t seem to feel like it.Many island species, as it happens, show a marked tendency to stay close to home. It feels like a bit of a paradox: Their forebears may have arrived on that island through some great feat of survival or exploration, but the present generation prefers familiar comforts.\u201cOnce they colonize an island, despite these incredible feats of long-distance dispersal, they decide, \u2018Enough is enough!\u2019\u201d said Tim Jessop, the professor of ecology at Deakins University in Australia who led the study.The causes of this behavior are likely to differ depending on the species and the situation. But it is puzzling: If animals stay in one place for many generations, they run the risk of inbreeding, facing resource scarcity and other dangers that moving elsewhere could allow them to avoid.Is the problem that komodos are not confident navigators? Over the course of the study, researchers moved seven adult dragons away from their home territory. Some were transported as much as 13.7 miles away on the same islands, while others were ferried across a slip of water just over a mile wide to another island.Within four months, the Komodo dragons transplanted overland all turned up again at home, clearly capable of making a journey. The dragons on the new island \u2014 much closer to where they started, and capable of swimming back \u2014 stayed put. Swimming home just didn\u2019t seem to be worth the effort, apparently.One explanation for this sedentary behavior, Dr. Jessop proposed, is that once you\u2019re isolated on an island, any mistakes could be extremely costly. Having a whole continent to move across, with a landscape that changes relatively slowly, would make exploration less risky. But a Komodo dragon that moves to a new island or a new island valley might find that it\u2019s out of luck if, for instance, it\u2019s unable to mate with any of the locals it encounters in its new home. There may also be survival benefits to being intimately familiar with one\u2019s surroundings, like knowing exactly where to find prey.That said, DNA data indicates that dragon populations show signs of inbreeding, and they are vulnerable to local shortages of food and natural disasters.\u201cThey stay put almost irrespective of how bad it gets,\u201d Dr. Jessop said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit bewildering.\u201dAnd yet Komodo dragons have their ways of making this life work.\u201cThey are quirky animals,\u201d Dr. Jessop continued, noting that the juveniles have a habit of climbing trees to escape cannibalism from their elders. They may look like ruthless top-level predators, but their goals as island creatures are considerably more modest that you may realize.\u201cReally what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Dr. Jessop said, \u201cis not rock the boat.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hard Road to Conservative Reform", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistLike all small sects, reform conservatism had its share of internal divisions, but the basic idea was to claim a middle ground between left-wing pessimism about the post-1970s American economy and right-wing faith in the eternal verities of Reaganomics. The left looked at the years from Reagan to the younger Bush and saw an ascendant plutocracy and an immiserated working class. The official orthodoxy of the right \u2014 embodied most notably by the Wall Street Journal editorial page \u2014 saw a long period of solid post-stagflation growth that only lacked for more supply-side tax cuts to be truly turbocharged.The reform conservatives aspired to a more nuanced take. Reaganomics had been a relative success in its own time, we thought, part of a necessary turn toward deregulation and freer trade and lower taxes that had pulled Western economies out of their 1970s malaise. Inequality had increased, but middle- and working-class Americans had enjoyed gains nonetheless; even when wages had stagnated, tax cuts and transfer payments had helped boost most Americans\u2019 incomes, and they had shared in the benefits of lower prices and ample consumer goods.That was the story we wanted Republican politicians to tell. Instead Donald Trump came along and told a darker one. \u201cSadly the American dream is dead,\u201d he announced after that escalator ride, and proceeded to campaign on a radically pessimistic message about the post-Reagan economic order, in which bad trade deals and mass immigration were held responsible for what he called \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in working-class communities.But I could also have called it \u201creform conservatism\u2019s more politically successful twin,\u201d because of course Trump won \u2014 twice over, in fact, triumphing over both the Republican politicians (Rubio, Jeb!) who tried to borrow some of reform conservatism\u2019s themes and a Democratic nominee linked, through her husband\u2019s record, to the post-Reagan economic consensus.And while Trump was winning, a certain amount of evidence emerged to confirm his darker view of the American situation \u2014 the surging opioid epidemic, the rise of what Anne Case and Angus Deaton called \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d among lower-income white Americans, growing evidence that the opening to China had worked out far better for Beijing\u2019s government than for the American worker, and more.All of this has left conservative policy wonks, the erstwhile reformocons and others, with a dilemma. Should they defend the post-Reagan economic order against Trump\u2019s blustering, blundering assault \u2014 defend the benefits of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d and free trade and global openness, warn against the sclerosis that protectionism and industrial policy often bring, champion the innovative culture of Silicon Valley against its populist despisers? Or should they take Trump\u2019s success as evidence that even reform conservatism was ultimately too sanguine and too moderate, and that there are deeper problems in the economic order that require a more-than-moderate conservative response?Cass\u2019s bracing tone reads like (among other things) an attempt to fix reform conservatism\u2019s political problem, as it manifested itself in 2016 \u2014 a problem of lukewarmness, of milquetoast wonkery, that Trumpism\u2019s more sweeping promises simply steamrolled in political debate.The critics\u2019 concerns vary, but a common thread is that Cass\u2019s diagnosis overstates the struggles of American workers and exaggerates the downsides of globalization, and in so doing risks giving aid and comfort to populist policies \u2014 or, for that matter, socialist policies, from the Ocasio-Cortezan left \u2014 that would ultimately choke off growth.But the argument over Cass\u2019s book also raises a larger question that both right and left are wrestling with in our age of populist discontent: Namely, is the West\u2019s post-1980 economic performance a hard-won achievement and pretty much the best we could have done, or is there another economic path available, populist or social democratic or something else entirely, that doesn\u2019t just lead back to stagnation?A great deal turns upon the answer. Economic growth since the 1970s has disappointed relative to what many optimists imagined in 1965; at the same time it has been stronger than what many Carter-era pessimists feared we could expect. If you emphasize the disappointment, then experimenting with a different policy orientation \u2014 be it Cass\u2019s work-and-family conservatism or an Ocasio-Cortezan democratic socialism or something else \u2014 seems like a risk worth taking; after all things aren\u2019t that great under neoliberalism as it is.But if you focus on the possible fragility of the growth we have achieved, the ease with which left-wing and right-wing populisms can lead to Venezuela, then you\u2019ll share the anxieties of Cass\u2019s conservative critics \u2014 who are willing to tinker with work-and-family policy but worry that to make any major concession to globalization\u2019s critics puts far too much at risk.Perhaps the best reason to bet on Cass\u2019s specific vision is that the social crisis he wants to address is itself a major long-term drag on growth \u2014 because a society whose working class doesn\u2019t work or marry or bear children will age, even faster than the West is presently aging, into stagnation and decline.At the same time it might well be, as some of his critics think, that the working class\u2019s social crisis is mostly or all cultural, a form of late-modern anomie detached from material privation. In which case political-economy schemes to \u201cfix\u201d the problem won\u2019t have social benefits to match their potential economic costs.So the decision for Cass\u2019s kind of conservative reform would be, necessarily, a real policy gamble, based on the hope that a greater human flourishing and a more mid-20th-century style of growth is still possible in rich societies like ours. And if the first iteration of reform conservatism was defined and limited by its moderation, his version 2.0 may succeed or fail based on the right\u2019s appetite for trying something else immoderate, even radical, after the Donald Trump experiment has run its course.

{"Headline": "Before the Claims of Crispr Babies, There Was China\u2019s One-Child Policy", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Chinese government has a long history of using technology to control and manipulate reproduction.Ms. Fong is the author of a book about China\u2019s one-child policy.China excels in most kinds of technology, but when it comes to gene editing and designer babies, it has an extra advantage: a population that has been conditioned to manipulating reproduction as a tool for progress. I\u2019m referring, of course, to the three decades of family-planning rules known as the one-child policy.Behind the science of what\u2019s doable is the mind-set of what\u2019s desirable. China\u2019s unprecedented reproductive experiment, officially ended in 2015 although many restrictions continue, has created a people accustomed \u2014 in many cases, forcibly so \u2014 to controlling the number and gender of their offspring. The one-child policy was established ostensibly to curb population growth, but China\u2019s leaders were not shy about exhorting the country\u2019s people to reduce quantity to improve quality, shading the policy with eugenic undertones.From all this to \u201cdesigner babies\u201d is not so great a leap. An openness to gene editing\u2019s worst excesses may prove to be the one-child policy\u2019s most unfortunate legacy.In China, many people have already ventured into that terrain. Even before Crispr, it has been possible to create so-called designer babies using in vitro fertilization and selecting egg donors with desirable genetic enhancements, such as looks and intelligence. That\u2019s what many wealthy Chinese have been doing for years. The practice is fairly standard among rich consumers of any nationality, but I was told by fertility clinics and doctors in California that Chinese customers were frequently the most upfront and demanding, driving up prices of East Asian donor eggs to twice and even triple market rates.Wendie Wilson-Miller, who runs an egg donor agency in Southern California, told me that her Chinese clients \u201calmost always want taller, at least 5 foot 5. And they have questions about eyelids; they want to see baby pictures to see if the donor\u2019s had eyelid surgery.\u201dMuch is still unknown about the so-called Crispr babies.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.But familiar questions remain unanswered: How much did Facebook know, and when?Even before the Mueller indictments exposed the extent of a coordinated Russian misinformation campaign, suspicions ran high. Many people had questions; few people were in the position to demand answers. Mr. Zuckerberg was one of those few, and for some reason he did not.Russian influence operations and viral false reports should have been anticipated byproducts of Facebook\u2019s business model, which is based on selling advertising on the back of user engagement. In short, Facebook capitalizes on personal information to influence the behavior of its users, and then sells that influence to advertisers for a profit. It is an ecosystem ripe for manipulation.Facebook is not the only tech company that demands regulatory scrutiny. But Facebook has, perhaps uniquely, demonstrated a staggering lack of corporate responsibility and civic duty in the wake of this crisis.Meaningful oversight of the tech industry from the executive branch is equally absent.That\u2019s why the incoming House, newly in Democratic hands, should make serious oversight a priority. If the House is looking to set the agenda for the next two years, Facebook should be near the top. What ambiguities remain about what Facebook knew and when are prime subjects for hearings. As Representative Cicilline\u2019s tweet suggests, a sense of urgency is growing around the idea Facebook should be regulated, but there\u2019s no consensus on exactly how. The answers can only come if the right questions are asked. Congressional hearings are an obvious start. We can only hope the House doesn\u2019t pull any punches.Advertisement"}

Will restricting the devices for teenagers put former adult smokers who vape at risk to start again?Supported byTry as she might, Brittany Kligman couldn\u2019t free herself of a pack-a-day cigarette habit, eight years in duration. And she ached to.She was mortified the time that a taxi driver sniffed as she entered his cab and remarked, \u201cYou\u2019re a smoker, huh?\u201d (And she had just showered!) She was getting more sinus infections. Because her chest felt uncomfortably tight when she exercised, she stopped high intensity interval training. Then SoulCycle classes. Finally, she quit working out.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to sell an adult product, you have to be prepared to secure it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it also seems like they\u2019re making a lot of steps and loops for people like me. They\u2019re taking away a flavor I used for smoking cessation. \u201dShe not only intends to stock up on mango at her corner smoke shop, but is working up a Plan B: \u201cI\u2019ll switch to Juul\u2019s tobacco flavor. I can get around this. Just like the kids will \u2014 they can always find a way.\u201dNicotine, the chemical in tobacco cigarettes that creates the addictive stranglehold that is so difficult to break, is most likely a signature reason that Juul and other e-cigarettes help former smokers like Ms. Kligman quit. In making the switch, smokers can satisfy their nicotine hunger without inhaling the dozens of cancer-causing carcinogens released by a burning cigarette.And while these products were conceived as smoking alternatives, the Food and Drug Administration has not yet formally approved them as smoking cessation aids, and research is mixed about their effectiveness.Now regulators are struggling with how to address competing concerns \u2014 weighing the benefits of e-cigarettes for tobacco smokers against the risks for cigarette-naive adolescents, whose developing brains are especially vulnerable to nicotine. The overwhelming majority of smokers start as teenagers, but Ms. Kligman began smoking at 25, when she was a graduate student in biomedical science. Still, the moment of induction seemed purely adolescent: She and her sister wanted an escape during a soporific visit to their grandparents.\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d Ms. Kligman\u2019s sister assured her. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll make you skinnier.\u201dAfter smoking one cigarette, Ms. Kligman felt sweaty and nauseous. So she tried a second.She began smoking every chance she got. It swiftly became a soothing oral fixation. When she felt nervous at parties or bars, cigarettes gave her an excuse to step outside. Moving to New York from Atlanta, she found that the people she was befriending were smokers. Defiantly, they stood in solidarity when nonsmokers made withering remarks.Of course she was well aware of the health risks. She\u2019s a medical researcher. Doctors have been in her family for generations. One boyfriend announced that she couldn\u2019t smoke around him. \u201cIt caused me stress,\u201d Ms. Kligman recalled, \u201cbecause I craved the nicotine when I was with him and I couldn\u2019t get it. \u201dShe tried so many ways to quit: Rationing cigarettes. Cold turkey. Nicotine gum. A boyfriend even bought her an unwieldy, old-school vape. It leaked and didn\u2019t fit in her purse \u2014 a nonstarter. Then, a prescription for a smoking cessation medicine. But she never had a strategy \u2014 chewing straws? doing push-ups? \u2014 to substitute when the urge to smoke came on. Each time she abstained, the irritability overwhelmed her.\u201cWhen it\u2019s bad, you\u2019re supposed to hang in there for 20 minutes,\u201d Ms. Kligman said. \u201cBut I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m so done with this feeling. I\u2019ll have just one cigarette. Or two.\u2019 \u201dShe told herself: \u201cAt least it\u2019s nicotine and not heroin.\u201dLast January, at a dinner party, she asked a good friend to join her outside for a smoke after the meal. Four people at the table said, \u201cWe don\u2019t smoke anymore. We Juul.\u201dEmbarrassed that she was still smoking, she tried a hit of someone\u2019s Juul. She was underwhelmed, but allowed that it sort of worked. The next day she bought one. She used it for four days, then put it in a drawer and went back to cigarettes.A month later, for a weekend visit to her friend Amy\u2019s cottage upstate, she packed the Juul. It was seriously cold outside. When she needed a cigarette break, another guest, a runner, intervened, saying, \u201cJust Juul inside!\u201dShe spent that weekend indoors, juuling nonstop to get a constant \u201cnic fix.\u201d \u201cI began to think, \u2018This is working. It\u2019s really working!\u201d And it was so easy. Back at home, she tried a cigarette. Gross.So she continued to vape. For weeks she coughed up murk and muck that had attached to her airways. And then \u2026 it stopped.Now her eyes are clear. Teeth gleam. Skin looks rejuvenated. And the money! The cigarette brand she smoked daily was about $17 a pack; a package of four cartridges could run about $17. Making the switch put back about $85 a week in her pocket. With the savings, she recently bought a celebratory pair of running shoes.She now vapes about the same amount that she had smoked \u2014 a cartridge a day, roughly the nicotine equivalent to a pack. Soon she plans to try Juul\u2019s new lower-nicotine cartridges, hoping someday to be completely weaned. The device has overtaken her life much as cigarettes had. \u201cI\u2019m a hard-core Juuler,\u201d she said.\u201cAfter 18 years of smoking cigarettes,\u201d Amy said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly worried about nicotine addiction.\u201dOnly one friend has quit vaping. He was going through three pods a day and landed in the hospital with a rapid heartbeat. Doctors said the cause was excessive nicotine.\u201cHis husband smashed the Juul with a hammer and told him never to vape again,\u201d Ms. Kligman said.\u201cSo he went back to smoking cigarettes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Destination for Chinese Food: Not Flushing, but Forest Hills", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA corner of Queens better known for delis and pizza parlors has added a critical mass of new (and creative) Chinese restaurants.Then he turns to other dim sum items under his purview: tender minced chicken and onion dumplings tickled with curry powder; rolls of blistered scallion pancakes with wisps of braised beef peeking through; and sweet sesame-topped hand pies called shaobing, baked from dough stretched thin and painted with oil and lard, and folded into hot pockets that spray bits of crust, like confetti, with every bite.But Memories of Shanghai isn\u2019t in a well-established Chinese-food destination like Flushing, Queens, or Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Rather, the Zhang family is part of a small cadre of pioneers building an entirely new Chinatown in unlikely territory: Forest Hills, Queens.Each of these businesses has opened in the last two years, a sea change in a neighborhood better known for its decades-old pizza parlors and Jewish delis.Her great-grandfather Jimmy Lum was the owner of Lum\u2019s, a Cantonese restaurant that was a Flushing fixture from the 1950s until it closed in the \u201980s. Her father, Wally Lum, grew up in Whitestone but settled in Forest Hills in 1987, as did many Chinese-Americans soon afterward. The 1990 census recorded just over 1,500 Forest Hills residents who identified as Chinese. By 2000, that number had grown to more than 7,000, and by 2016 to more than 11,000, with one-quarter of residents reporting Asian ancestry, according to the most recent estimates. \u201cIt\u2019s a good starter neighborhood for families,\u201d Ms. Lum said. \u201cPlus it has a great school district.\u201dNow, in a space of his own, he said through a translator, he is able to prepare the intricate, creative dishes he has always wanted to do, while introducing non-Chinese diners to a world of flavor beyond beef with broccoli.Newcomers can make do with the printed menu\u2019s Hunan-style fish fillets and soft tofu, which have none of the muddiness you find at many Sichuan and Hunan restaurants in New York, and leave a slow, tangy burn that rewards spoonful after spoonful.Thomas Lo, an anesthesiologist and Forest Hills resident who studied at the International Culinary Center in Manhattan and interned at high-end restaurants, said he fell in love with Spy C after tasting Mr. Lei\u2019s cucumber salad. \u201cIt seems like such a simple dish, but it\u2019s actually not so easy to do well,\u201d Mr. Lo said. \u201cWhen I took one bite my eyes lit up. It was so crisp, refreshing and perfectly balanced.\u201dTo make it, Mr. Lei steeps Sichuan peppercorns in heated oil to draw out their camphor and numbing citrus buzz. Then he combines that oil with Chinkiang vinegar, soy sauce, cilantro, minced garlic, sesame seeds, touches of salt and sugar, and bits of dried red chile, and uses it to glaze seeded cucumbers that have been slivered into immaculate curls to deliver a satisfying crunch.Like Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lei, Mr. Yan has consulted extensively for Chinese restaurants. The Bund gives him a stage of his own to lend his spin to popular new dishes from the Chinese mainland. David Kong is a jeweler by training, but after living in Forest Hills for nearly 30 years, he was frustrated by the lack of quality Chinese cooking nearby. \u201cChinese food in New York is getting better every year,\u201d he said, \u201cand migration has done great things for Sichuan food. But Shanghainese food is more difficult. The preparation is more involved, with marinades and sauces specific to each dish.\u201d When a space opened up near his condominium, he and his childhood friend Jim Nguyen took a leap of faith.\u201cMy father has been making dim sum for a long time,\u201d she said, \u201cand he\u2019s set up a lot of restaurants for success. But this is a chance for our family to do something for ourselves.\u201d\u201cIf I work for other people, my role is narrow,\" she said. \u201cBut if I open this restaurant with my family, we face a wide road ahead.\u201d Advertisement"}

And we don\u2019t have sufficient safeguards in place yet to prevent them. But there are things that can be done now.First, courts should make clear that government officials may not use their offices to interfere in races in which they are a candidate. They can start by doing that in the case we just filed against Mr. Scott.Second, Congress should hold hearings this year on ways the federal government can be misused to interfere in an election and enact appropriate legislation to guard against such behavior. Among other things, Congress should consider how best to codify longstanding internal Justice Department rules that limit what investigative and prosecutorial steps may be taken and announced about a candidate in the window leading up to an election.Third, states should pass laws requiring government officials to recuse themselves from any role overseeing elections in which they are also candidates.It will probably come as a surprise to many that we\u2019ve tolerated these sorts of obvious conflicts of interest for as long as we have.

{"Headline": "Photo of More Than 60 Students Giving Apparent Nazi Salute Is Being Investigated", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolice and school officials in a small town in Wisconsin are investigating a photograph taken last spring of about 60 male high school students, many of them making what appears to be a Nazi salute.The image went viral after it was posted on Twitter Sunday night.In a letter sent to parents on Monday, the school district superintendent, Lori Mueller, said that administrators were \u201cextremely troubled by the image.\u201d\u201cClearly, we have a lot of work to do to ensure that our schools remain positive and safe environments for all students, staff and community,\u201d Ms. Mueller wrote. \u201cIf the gesture is what it appears to be, the district will pursue any and all available and appropriate actions, including legal, to address the issue.\u201dThere is one black student in the group, who is partly obscured. When an anonymous Twitter account, which is believed to be run by two members of the school\u2019s senior class, shared the photo on Armistice Day, the message said, \u201cWe even got the black kid to throw it up.\u201dBaraboo is a town of 12,000 people 40 miles northwest of Madison, and the seat of Sauk County. The population is 94 percent white, according to the 2010 census.Each year, members of the junior class at Baraboo High School pose on the courthouse steps for parents and other residents. More than one professional photographer usually attends the event, according to Alisyn Amant, 19, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who graduated from Baraboo High last year. The junior prom is held each year in the school gymnasium; there is no senior prom.Some of the students in the picture have since graduated, Ms. Amant said, but most are now seniors at the school. Ms. Amant said she knows several of the students in the photograph but would not give their names.She said that there was a clique of boys at the school who often made offensive remarks. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by them doing this,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m surprised that there\u2019s so many of them doing this. Photographers were there; the parents were there; community members were there.\u201dShe added that she was disappointed that the photograph had been taken months ago and that no one seemed to mind until now, or seek punishment for those involved.

{"Headline": "Tech C.E.O.s Are in Love With Their Principal Doomsayer", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "The futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari thinks Silicon Valley is an engine of dystopian ruin. So why do the digital elite adore him so?Supported byThe futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari worries about a lot.He worries that Silicon Valley is undermining democracy and ushering in a dystopian hellscape in which voting is obsolete.He worries that by creating powerful influence machines to control billions of minds, the big tech companies are destroying the idea of a sovereign individual with free will.He worries that because the technological revolution\u2019s work requires so few laborers, Silicon Valley is creating a tiny ruling class and a teeming, furious \u201cuseless class.\u201dBut lately, Mr. Harari is anxious about something much more personal. If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?\u201cOne possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?\u201d a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s more worrying. Maybe I\u2019m missing something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are \u2014 it\u2019s insane he\u2019s so popular, they\u2019re all inviting him to campus \u2014 yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,\u201d said Tristan Harris, Google\u2019s former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: \u201cUtopia and dystopia depends on your values.\u201dHe followed up with \u201cHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\u201d which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari\u2019s future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals\u2019 strange delight. \u201cIf you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\u201d he told me, sounding weary, \u201csome of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\u201dMr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X\u2019s offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look \u2014\u00a0like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get. At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn\u2019t a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. \u201cPart of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re chimpanzees. They\u2019re sapiens. This is what they do.\u201dHe was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him. An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari\u2019s team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution. He said he had resigned himself to tech executives\u2019 global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. \u201cI\u2019ve met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they\u2019re good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.\u201dSome of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. \u201cSome may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,\u201d Mr. Harari said. Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don\u2019t want to frighten them,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cThey can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.\u201dC.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari\u2019s acumen are indeed not hard to come by. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.And Mr. Hastings wrote: \u201cYuval\u2019s the anti-Silicon Valley persona \u2014 he doesn\u2019t carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.\u201d He added, \u201cHis thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.\u201dA few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term \u201cuseless class.\u201dHe told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d and \u201cfollow your heart,\u201d and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world\u2019s people are not even needed enough to be exploited. \u201cNow you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don\u2019t need me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.\u201dThe useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. \u201cIf a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can\u2019t shoot all of us because they need us,\u201d he said, citing army service and factory work.Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. \u201cYou\u2019re totally expendable,\u201d he told the audience.This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. But we are nice, so we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\u201cIf humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don\u2019t reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow do you live when you realize \u2026 that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.\u201dMr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.\u201cSilicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.\u201d He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav\u2019s mother is their accountant.Most days, Mr. Harari doesn\u2019t use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea.

What is real? What is untrue? Why is everyone so creepy and annoying?But this isn\u2019t just a case of art reflecting current political and humanitarian issues, which can be applied to virtually any era as history keeps repeating itself. How often do we get the \u201cShakespeare is so contemporary\u201d routine \u2014 400 years later, yes, people fall in love and tyrants are jerks. But these Pinter morsels are not just pertinent. They almost feel like cries of desperation from beyond the grave about humanity\u2019s immediate future.As presented in its world premiere in the first batch of one-acts, \u201cPinter One\u201d was hysterically funny but shockingly real \u2014 a spot-on depiction by a playwright who seemed to foretell the rise of a geographically challenged loose cannon of a president. Jon Culshaw plays the president as a Trump look-alike (perhaps too obvious a choice by the director Jamie Lloyd). \u201cPinter Five\u201d and \u201cPinter Six\u201d (running mid-December through Jan. 26) features rarely performed works like \u201cFamily Voices\u201d and \u201cParty Time\u201d and include the actors Martin Freeman and Jane Horrocks, and \u201cPinter Seven\u201d (Jan. 31 to Feb. 23) pair \u201cThe Dumb Waiter\u201d and \u201cA Slight Ache,\u201d two of Pinter\u2019s better known one-acts.Thirteen years after Pinter\u2019s videotaped speech from Britain (he was too ill to attend the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm) and 10 years after his death from cancer, it\u2019s astonishing to watch his acceptance speech. He begins with the words he wrote in 1958: \u201cThere are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal. Nor between what is true and what is false.\u201dPinter clarifies that as an artist, he stands by his assertion. But as a citizen, he cannot.\u201cTruth in drama is forever elusive.

The search is your task.\u201dWith these words, and this ambitious staging of his shockingly relevant body of one-acts as 2018 nears its finale, the search for truth feels more immediate \u2014 and harder to grasp \u2014 than ever.

A few diseases, like H.I.V., so far have outwitted both the immune system and scientists.Vaccines are among the most ingenious of inventions, and among the most maddening. We have children\u2019s vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, chickenpox, polio, hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae and meningococcal disease.They have changed our expectations of mortality \u2014 and of parenthood. In 17th century England, one-third of all children died before age 15. Today, thanks largely to those vaccines, less than 1 percent of English children do.In tropical countries, there are vaccines against yellow fever, cholera, Japanese encephalitis, meningitis A, typhoid, dengue and rabies. But there is still \u2014 despite 30 years of effort \u2014 no AIDS vaccine. None for parasites like Chagas, elephantiasis, hookworm or liver flukes. None for some viral threats that could become pandemic, like Nipah, Lassa and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. None for some that already have, including Lyme, West Nile, Zika and hepatitis C.None for respiratory syncytial virus, which kills infants, nor even for the dozens of causes of common colds.Vaccines are among the world\u2019s greatest medical advances, like clean water, soap, bleach, sewage systems and antibiotics. In a rational world \u2014 one where budgets are built on lives saved per dollar \u2014 spending on vaccine research would rival that on defense research.And as with weaponry, fear changes everything. In epidemiologically quiet times, the anti-vaccine lobby sows doubts; when Ebola or pandemic flu strikes, Americans clamor for protection.There are two obstacles to faster progress, said Dr. Gregory A. Poland, director of the vaccine research group at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cOne is scientific, and one is embarrassing,\u201d he said.While defense research is driven by one mega-customer, the Pentagon, vaccine researchers face a confusing hodgepodge of potential backers.Private industry largely pursues high-priced vaccines for American children, militaries and adventure tourists. Potential bioweapons like anthrax, plague and rabbit fever attract bioterrorism funds.But vaccines meant to protect only poor people in faraway countries usually must wait for donor governments and philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, even though we know these plagues cross borders.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussThe scientific obstacles, though more intractable, are relatively rare. Many pathogens are genetically farther apart than rhinoceroses and bees: A defense against a horn does not protect against a sting, and vice versa.Most vaccines work by creating antibodies \u2014 Y-shaped proteins \u2014 that block the disease agent\u2019s own proteins. While viruses have only handful of target proteins, bacteria have up to 6,000 and parasites even more, noted Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of vaccine education at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. And even some smallish viruses, including H.I.V., flu and hepatitis C, mutate so rapidly that their surfaces change shape before antibodies can lock onto them.As a rule, if a disease normally leaves even a few survivors who are completely disease-free and immune for life, a vaccine against that disease is possible. \u201cNatural infection is the mother of all vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Smallpox meets the criteria; H.I.V., malaria and tuberculosis do not. H.I.V. mutates as fast in one day as flu does in a year; it also survives by splicing its DNA into the very immune cells that hunt it.TB bacteria can survive even when \u201cwalled in\u201d by white blood cells.And malaria, a shape-shifting parasite, never triggers lifetime immunity. People who survive repeated bouts get less sick each time, but that immunity disappears if they move out of the malarial region. If they return, the first mosquito bite may kill them.Other diseases are complex, with many subtypes. For example, Pneumovax 23, the anti-pneumonia shot given to middle-aged people, negates 23 strains of one bacterium.Nonetheless, many diseases now rampaging at large are relatively easy targets, according to interviews with half a dozen experts. They could be beaten with vaccines if the world committed more money.Thus far, the coalition has raised about $630 million, but its ambitious plans \u2014 including DNA and RNA platforms that will cut vaccine-making time to weeks instead of months \u2014 will require billions of dollars.\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me 18 months ago whether a TB vaccine was possible, I\u2019d have said no,\u201d said Dr. Penny Heaton, chief executive officer of the new Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute. \u201cBut I think the field is now very promising.\u201dSome candidate vaccines rely on startling mechanisms for defeating the dizzyingly complex parasites \u2014 including injecting humans with a gene that produces an antibody that destroys a worm\u2019s gut when it sucks blood.But, like all the other projects in the works, that one needs more money \u2014 and not just from the usual suspects (the United States, Britain and the Gates Foundation).\u201cIn this multi-trillion-dollar economy,\u201d Dr. Hotez said, \u201cit\u2019s a little discouraging that we can\u2019t raise the funding.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a vaccine against pneumonia. The shot that protects against 23 strains of one bacterium is Pneumovax 23, not Prevnar 23.Advertisement"}

And yet late at night, I still listen. Contributing Opinion Writer It was not a perfectly integrated picture, Elton John and Eddie Kendricks notwithstanding. Soul radio \u2014 XPRS, KDAY \u2014 was the black counterpoint to the more mainstream Top 40 stations that were racially restratifying after the great pop music commingling of the \u201960s. Still, AM remained a common geography, its stations places we all visited. It was the campfire we sat around.At home, the kitchen-counter radio was always tuned to KABC. It aired restaurant shows, call-in psychologist shows, news shows, all featuring sophisticated discussions of things I had only vague ideas about. My mother listened while she ironed or cooked or sat at the table paying bills. The radio was her company, and because I admired her (but didn\u2019t quite know how to talk to her), it became mine, too.To my ears the hosts \u2014 people like Michael Jackson, Dr. Toni Grant, Geoff Witcher \u2014 sounded like my mother: impassioned but thoughtful, often witty, opinionated but not obnoxiously so. They were mostly white, I knew, but they still seemed knowable; if not exactly friends, then certainly kindred spirits. Since this was radio, color didn\u2019t intrude or intimidate the way it usually did. I could forge relationships with unlikely people in the same way Top 40 allowed me to forge relationships with unlikely music. Talk radio was a campfire, too, a community built on a shared understanding of the world shaped by regular listening.I listened to everything \u2014 even Ray Briem, whose late-night show prefigured conservative talk radio and whom I barely comprehended \u2014 and I expected to be heard in return, even if I didn\u2019t agree with every point made and even though I never actually called in. There was always a back and forth, a sense that hosts and listeners were on the same plane. That was the pact I had with AM.More than 40 years later I am still trying to hold AM to that pact. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. The encompassing AM radio of my youth is long gone, sacrificed to the media infrastructure the hard right starting building in earnest in the 1980s. Its talk shows have become synonymous with unrepentant conservatism and uncivil conversation mediated mostly by loud white guys, and no one is invited in who doesn\u2019t already subscribe. Even the music played on AM \u2014 from country to perfectly good jazz \u2014 feels tainted by association.The de-evolution of radio is of course the de-evolution of America, as the atmosphere has shifted from potentially inclusive to proudly noninclusive. The shift \u2014 or rather, the reassertion of racial isolation that has always been with us \u2014 has been angering, sometimes bewildering. I feel like someone cut me off from my own past without my permission. Still, I listen.I never stopped listening, because I refuse to give up my stake in a world that formed me. I hate how the relationship has deteriorated through the years, but I won\u2019t agree to the divorce. Not yet.Crazy, sure, but it\u2019s an imaginative crazy that I much prefer to the current political craziness that is bitter and mean and can imagine nothing outside of itself. Of course morning comes, drive time starts and divisions loudly reassert themselves.

Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate.

This is very hard if you are a marketer.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Facebook.

{"Headline": "A Slow-Motion Coup in Tennessee", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterThe Party of Reagan no longer shares this particular ideal, at least not here in the South. In Tennessee, transparent voter suppression efforts have included an array of tactics:\u201cThe State of Tennessee has over $28 million dollars left over from federal funds provided to the states after the \u2018hanging chad\u2019 fiasco in Florida in 2000,\u201d Lisa Quigley, Mr. Cooper\u2019s chief of staff and someone who has made a specialty of studying voter suppression in this state, said in an email. \u201cThese funds can be used only for improving our election system, and Tennessee sits on that money year after year.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s because most of the dozen or so identified cyberattacks of the midterm so far have been directed against Democratic candidates.Of course, one of the most burdensome requirements of voting in Tennessee is the state-issued photo ID itself. The necessary documentation to register to vote includes two proofs of residence, two proofs of identity, a Social Security number and proof of citizenship or lawful residence \u2014 all of which can be hard to come by for anyone without a steady job, stable housing and internet access. It\u2019s almost like Tennessee doesn\u2019t want the poor to vote.All of this explains why a new state-by-state analysis in the September issue of Election Law Journal ranked Tennessee No. 48 in ease of voting. Only Mississippi and Virginia made voting harder for their own citizens.You might be forgiven for believing that elected officials here have been trying to stage a coup. What is voter suppression anyway but an attempt to thwart the will of the people? And what is democracy itself if not a government formed by the will of the people and designed to protect their rights \u2014 the rights of all of them, whether they are in the majority or the minority? In its baldest terms, any attempt to prevent people from voting, or to dilute the governing force of those who do manage to vote, is really nothing less than an act of treason.Is it fair to blame Republicans for voter suppression in our state? Democrats are certainly not immune to the temptation to take advantage of all available avenues to power. Gerrymandering and dark money offer bipartisan appeal. Nevertheless, Democrats can\u2019t hold a candle to Republicans in erecting barriers to voting. Statehouses held by Democrats tend to pass laws that encourage voting; when Democrats are in charge, the barriers to voting typically fall.But here in Tennessee Republicans are in charge. Our governor and both of our senators are Republicans; our state Congressional delegation is made up of seven Republicans and two Democrats. On an electoral map of Tennessee, the entire state is red but for two lonely blue districts: Nashville and Memphis. That\u2019s why Republicans hold a supermajority in both houses of the Tennessee General Assembly. If elections are messed up here, it\u2019s the Republicans\u2019 fault.Advertisement"}

There exists a universe for every good or bad dream you\u2019ve ever had, each with its own set of so-called fundamental particles, forces, laws and dimensions.String theory unites gravity, which curves the cosmos, with quantum mechanics, which describes the randomness that lives inside it, by envisaging the fundamental constituents of nature as tiny strings of energy vibrating in 11 dimensions.The theory has been described as a piece of 21st-century physics that fell into the 20th century by accident \u2014 and which might require 22nd-century mathematics to understand.The result is a mathematical labyrinth with 10\u2075\u2070\u2070 solutions, each one a different potential universe. In principle, one of those universes is ours \u2014 but nobody knows, because the math and physics are so horrendously complex.Or so the story goes. \u201cIf our world is but one of many, how do we deal with the alternatives?\u201d Dr. Dijkgraaf wrote. \u201cThe current point of view can be seen as the polar opposite of Einstein\u2019s dream of a unique cosmos.\u201dReached in Princeton, Dr. Dijkgraaf said that the article\u2019s headline, which he hadn\u2019t written, perhaps was an overstatement. Probably there is some fundamental principle, he said, perhaps whatever it is that lies behind string theory.But nobody, not even the founders of string theory, can say what that might be.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussThis dark energy bears all the earmarks of a fudge factor, called the cosmological constant, that Einstein inserted into his equations a century ago, and later rejected as a blunder. But the amount of this dark energy is smaller than the predicted value of the cosmological constant by a factor of 10\u2076\u2070.Physicists can only explain the discrepancy by assuming that the value of Einstein\u2019s constant is random across all potential universes; we live in one with the right amount of dark energy to allow stars and galaxies to form.In short, we live where we can.For some physicists, the landscape is a logical extension of the Copernican revolution. Just as the Earth is not the center of the solar system, nor the only planet, so our universe is not the only universe.For other physicists, the idea of other universes is an epistemological absurdum, a dead end of unprovable speculation and a betrayal of the Einsteinian dream of a unique cosmos.Even in our one universe, Einstein\u2019s pilgrims are in trouble, their path to ultimate knowledge blocked or perhaps nonexistent.But the model works too well. Particle physicists have now sifted the debris from trillions upon trillions of subatomic collisions in the Large Hadron Collider, the immense machine in which the Higgs was discovered. So far they have confirmed that the Higgs behaves as the Standard Model predicted.But supersymmetry might always have been an illusion, according to Sabine Hossenfelder, a theorist at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Study. She emerged last year as one of the most vocal critics of modern physics, with a provocative new book, \u201cLost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.\u201dDr. Hossenfelder argues that physicists have gone off course by exalting mathematical elegance. \u201cThey believed that Mother Nature was elegant, simple and kind about providing clues,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey thought they could hear her whispering when they were talking to themselves.\u201dParticle physicists contend that they merely have been following time-honored and successful principles. They chased the Higgs boson for half a century, and nearly gave up before nature finally coughed it up.According to them, atoms \u2014 the stuff of you, me and the stars \u2014 account for only 5 percent of the cosmos by weight. Dark matter, of which we know nothing except that its collective gravity sculpts and holds the galaxies together, amounts to 25 percent.The remaining 70 percent is dark energy, pushing everything apart; we don\u2019t know anything about that, either. We only know that this \u201cdark sector\u201d exists because of the effect of its gravity on the luminous universe, the motions of stars and galaxies.A theory that leaves 95 percent of the universe unidentified is hardly a sign that science is over.If scientists want any gift for the holidays, it\u2019s some new physics that would break the stalemate of these \u201cstandard models\u201d and provide new clues to our existence.Maybe that breakthrough will come from finally figuring out what dark matter is, or from the Large Hadron Collider, which will continue banging together subatomic particles for the next 20 years in search of new forces and phenomena. Every collision recorded is another step into the unknown.For now, the universe might have 11 dimensions, or it might be somebody\u2019s dream. Life might have started on Mars or in a boiling ocean vent, or maybe we\u2019re all bits in somebody\u2019s computer simulation. The search for who we are and how nature is put together is one of the flagship human endeavors, like art or music. It will continue.Dr. Hossenfelder, for all her skepticism, ends her book on a hopeful note.\u201cThe next breakthrough in physics will occur in this century,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt will be beautiful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

HELENA, Mont. \u2014 A wild wolf known as 926F, dear to the hearts of wolf watchers who visit Yellowstone, was killed by a hunter as it wandered just outside the park last weekend.A member of the Lamar Canyon pack in the national park\u2019s northeast region, 926F was the daughter of 832F, an alpha female that had become a celebrity, famous for her hunting prowess and for her frequent appearances along the road traveled by tourists in the park\u2019s Lamar Valley.While wolf biologists called the mother 832F, the she-wolf was famously known as \u201c06\u201d for the year she was born. The subject of the book \u201cAmerican Wolf: A True Story of Survival and Obsession in the West,\u201d she was killed by a hunter as well.Wolf watchers called 06\u2019s daughter Spitfire.The shooting occurred near cabins and was within hunting laws; Montana has permitted hunting of wolves since 2011, and a few hundred are killed each year. \u201cA game warden checked with the hunter and everything about this harvest was legal,\u201d said Abby Nelson, a wolf management specialist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.But the killing has renewed calls for a buffer around the park so wolves that live within the safe harbor of Yellowstone and that have little fear of humans cannot be shot if they wander beyond the park\u2019s invisible boundary. While Montana lawmakers have passed legislation forbidding creation of a buffer zone, there is a hunting limit of two wolves in each of two districts adjacent to the northern boundary of the park. Still, wolf hunting near Yellowstone has been extremely controversial, highlighting the clash between the New West\u2019s ecotourism and the Old West\u2019s hunting to protect game and livestock.Wolves were restored to the park in the 1990s and quickly grew in number. About 100 wolves belong to 10 packs in Yellowstone, which is considered the ideal park for sightings of the animals as they hunt elk, feed on carcasses and play with their pups. Some 1,700 wolves live in the Northern Rocky Mountain states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.Leo Leckie, a guide for Yellowstone Wolf Tracker, a group that offers to take visitors to see the wolves, keeps a family history of Yellowstone wolves on Ancestry.com. He believes the hunting of wolves has made it harder to see them. The killing of Spitfire \u201cwill undoubtedly hurt our business,\u201d he said.And there are questions about how sporting it is to hunt animals that have learned that humans are safe. \u201cWolf hunters talk about seeing a pack of park wolves outside the boundary and being able to pick the one they want,\u201d said Doug Smith, the park\u2019s wolf biologist. \u201cThey just stand there and have no fear.\u201dSpitfire, or 926F, was killed just a few miles outside the park in Montana near the northeast entrance to the park, between the tiny communities of Silver Gate and Cooke City, Mont.She left behind a daughter that wolf watchers have named Little T, so-called because of a small white marking. Another wolf, Small Dot, is the male, and for the first time in three years a litter of five pups was born to the Lamar Canyon pack. With the matriarch gone, Dr. Smith said, the famed pack could be in trouble. Even though the breeding pack is intact, its seven-member size may not be as resilient as bigger groups. \u201cIts survival is an open question,\u201d he said.And there is still one wolf tag to be filled in the hunting district where Spitfire was killed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saying Goodbye to the Man Who Brought Australia\u2019s Cafe Culture to Life", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe killing of Sisto Malaspina, which is being treated as terrorism, leaves Melbourne grappling with the loss of two lives that capture Australia\u2019s greatest hopes and fears around immigrants and what they bring to our shores.Before the police shot and killed Mr. Ali, he managed to kill one man and seriously injure two others.The man he killed was Sisto Malaspina. He was 74, and the longtime owner of Pellegrini\u2019s, a cafe unlike any other in Melbourne, and perhaps all of Australia.Two days later, I went and stood outside Pellegrini\u2019s along with hundreds of other mourning customers and friends. The Red Cross was on hand with therapy dogs. Flower bouquets were piled around the building, and handwritten tributes papered the windows.One note written in wobbly scrawl read: \u201cSisto, you are truly a Melbourne icon. Our hearts are broken.\u201dBut the death of Mr. Malaspina is especially cruel and his life is worth contemplating.The answer to that question might well be: Pellegrini\u2019s.In my ode to Melbourne, I told the story of the place. It was the city\u2019s original espresso bar and when it opened in 1954, it paved the way for the incredible cafe culture for which the city (and this country) is now known. I quoted my father, who remembers the cafe\u2019s opening as being \u201cthe beginning of Melbourne becoming what it is.\u201dThe story of Pellegrini\u2019s really is the story of Melbourne, the story of wave after wave of immigrants giving the city its multifaceted vibrancy. It helped build Melbourne\u2019s European-style devotion to pleasure, where good food came from casual cafes as often as from fancy restaurants, where coffee and wine and conversation flowed across well-worn counters.Pellegrini\u2019s counter was long and narrow, a wooden ribbon between customer and creator. In almost every photo you see of it there is conversation between a customer and a smiling gesticulating Sisto. Usually, he is the photo. He was Pellegrini\u2019s.Mr. Malaspina was born in Italy in 1944, and came to Australia in the 1960s, one of hundreds of thousands of Italians who migrated here during the 20th century. Like many of his countrymen, Mr. Malaspina fell into the restaurant business, and in 1972 he and business partner, Nino Pangrazio, bought Pellegrini\u2019s, the iconic espresso bar on Melbourne\u2019s Bourke Street, just steps from Victoria\u2019s Parliament House.The cafe has barely changed since its opening. Its red sign is heritage listed. Its menu of simple pastas might as well be heritage listed as well \u2014 and for the last half century, the person likely to greet you when you entered was Mr. Malaspina.Because of this, and because a visit to Pellegrini\u2019s was such a rite of passage, Mr. Malaspina interacted with an uncommon number of locals and visitors. It\u2019s hard to imagine one person in Melbourne who touched more lives. Whenever I returned to Melbourne, an espresso at the counter of Pellegrini\u2019s was a necessity, and Mr. Malaspina\u2019s hospitality and jaunty colorful kerchief were like beacons of home.Much of Melbourne, a city deeply loyal to its own though less well known to the world than Sydney, felt the same way.At the state funeral held for Mr. Malaspina on Tuesday, I sat with more than 1,300 attendees, who included dignitaries, state government leaders, and the wife of the prime minister. The city\u2019s Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral provided overflow seating outside, and the service was broadcast on screens in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square.A state funeral for the owner of a cafe might seem unlikely, but it gives you an idea of the love Melburnians have for this one restaurant and this one man, and the reverence Australians have for this particular type of immigrant story.\u201cSisto Malaspina\u2019s story is an Australian story,\u201d said Victoria\u2019s governor, Linda Dessau, during her welcoming remarks at the funeral. \u201cHe came to a country of new promise for himself and for his future family. He appreciated the opportunities that were offered to him, and he prospered from those opportunities because he worked so very hard.\u201dThroughout the ceremony, the violent circumstances of Mr. Malaspina\u2019s death were only touched on in passing. Speakers focused on Mr. Malaspina\u2019s love for his customers, and his wild sense of fashion was discussed extensively.Harold Mitchell, a television executive who was one of several friends to provide eulogies, went so far as to tear off his black tie and jacket and don colorful alternatives in homage to Mr. Malaspina\u2019s love of vibrant clothing.Only Ms. Dessau, the governor, spoke directly of the attack.\u201cThe mark of the man is that so much high praise had already been written about him well before last week\u2019s terrible tragedy could ever have been imagined,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, indeed it was a tragedy, and one that we need every voice to condemn, to condemn such a wicked act and the perpetrator of it.\u201d\u201cBut these are the times when we need to stick even closer to one another, to seek unity not conflict, and to hold to our hopes much more closely to our fears, even when it\u2019s hard.\u201dIn contrast, Mr. Malaspina\u2019s son, David Malaspina, struck a tone of inclusivity during his remembrance. He stressed that his father made sure to treat every customer the same, regardless of race, religion, or social standing.\u201cDad is an example of what makes Melbourne the best city in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople bring their culture and their dreams with them. Melbourne is a melting pot of these cultures, and that\u2019s what makes Melbourne magical.\u201dMany Melburnians who knew and appreciated Sisto will remember that forever.Advertisement"}

If Democrats want the chance to pass health reforms that will build on the Affordable Care Act and fix its defects, they need to start planning now.The bill should go beyond simply fixing the A.C.A., though much certainly needs fixing. The insurance marketplaces are a godsend for 12 million people, particularly those with low incomes or chronic illnesses. Yet in many ways, the marketplaces proved disappointing. Middle-class families face high premiums and punishing out-of-pocket costs. One thing we won\u2019t see: a leap to a single-payer system. Many Democrats have embraced Medicare for All. I\u2019m sympathetic to that. A single-payer health system would be more functional, more economical and fairer than what we have. America may someday have a single-payer system, but we won\u2019t get there in a single bill that phases out private health insurance, rewires our byzantine health care delivery and finance systems and markedly cuts payments to hospitals and other providers. So what can Democrats do, when tweaking the Affordable Care Act is insufficient, and when leaping to Medicare for All is unrealistic?Employers could provide Medicare Extra for their workers alongside their private offerings. Compared with single-payer, these plans appear reasonable and realistic. By providing competition and better options for near-retirees and those with costly conditions, such an approach could also improve private marketplace coverage. It would include valuable disability components, too.The next round will be different. Given all that\u2019s happened, Democrats have an angrier, more partisan edge than they did then. The Democratic Party is also more unambiguously progressive. Ten years ago, conservative Democrats insisted on protracted negotiations and opposed the public option. For better and worse, these bridge figures are almost all gone. Progressive voters will be demanding a single-payer bill, and will be disappointed when they don\u2019t get it. They are entitled to a feasible alternative they can genuinely be proud of.Harold Pollack is a professor of social service administration and public health science at the University of Chicago.Advertisement"}

Then, as the season rolled on, we would just as dutifully record their losses next to accounts of the exploits of the university\u2019s real star athletes: the field hockey team.And that was all right, that was O.K., because nobody went to Northwestern for its football prowess.

Trump wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.As the Democratic Party made gains in the House and Republicans did the same in the Senate, Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke, succinctly described Tuesday\u2019s outcome as an expression of our increasing division:While the Democrats did well, the results of the election illustrate how deeply divided the nation is around issues of race and immigration. Many hoped that Democrats would have huge wins because voters would reject Trump\u2019s appeals to white identity politics and his anti-immigrant and nativist rhetoric. Impressive turnout among Democrats suggests that many were in fact mobilized in opposition. But enough Republican voters appeared energized to prevent the sweeping Democratic victories that some were predicting.In states like Florida and Georgia, Jardina continued,Republican gubernatorial challengers Ron DeSantis and Brian Kemp did well despite their racially charged campaign messages.

They voted against Brett Kavanaugh. This fact will become a major problem for Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority leader, when he tries to round up votes in opposition to Trump court and administration nominees next year or perhaps even more crucially, during the presidential campaign season the following year.Compounding Schumer\u2019s difficulty: Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, was the one red-state Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh, and he won re-election easily.Looking forward toward 2020, Democratic prospects of wresting control of the upper chamber are bleak. At the moment, only one Republican incumbent up for re-election in 2020, Cory Gardner of Colorado, looks vulnerable. And Gardner\u2019s chances look better than those of Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who may find himself running against former Senator Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General Trump forced to resign on Wednesday.The 2020 Senate election is shaping up to be the moment when the organic Republican majority within the Senate falls into place. Trump won 46 percent of the popular vote in 2016 but 60 percent of states, and states like Idaho and Wyoming get just as many senators as California. Unless a whole bunch of red states suddenly turn blue, Democrats will be stuck where they are: in the minority.Voters cast 44.7 million votes for Democratic Senate candidates and 32.9 million votes for Republican Senate candidates \u2014 in other words 57 percent of Senate votes went for Democrats.\u201d Despite this huge gap \u2014 Democrats won 11.8 million more votes than Republicans \u2014 \u201cthere will be at least a two-seat gain for Republicans.\u201dThis pattern outraged Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, who emailed me:If there is one thing the election underscores it is how malapportioned America\u2019s representative institutions are. President Trump, of course, won the presidency while losing the popular vote by millions in 2016. Democrats in 2018 managed to eke out a 35-seat pickup while winning a national popular vote margin that is apparently going to be over 7 percentage points. A 7-point victory almost always produces a wave election type margin when translated into seats. But not this year.Hetherington cited the House election in North Carolina:In 2018, the GOP maintained their 9-3 majority despite the fact that the Democrats won roughly 100,000 more votes than Republicans did in these 12 contests combined.\u201cDemocrats in red states felt good about increased turnout. They fielded good candidates in a lot of places,\u201d Hetherington said:And they came up exactly 0 Senate seat wins from the Great Plains to the Atlantic Ocean. Democrats need to figure out a way to win in places they haven\u2019t been winning, and it is not clear that they got a template for that on Tuesday.Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State, also wrote to me along similar lines:The Senate looks harder than ever as a long-term prospect for Democrats: without Red State senators, winning and holding the chamber will be near impossible.Grossmann argues that the ideological positioning of candidates this year had consequences, particularly in contested districts:Liberal insurgent House nominees who beat establishment alternatives in swing district primaries went 0 for 3 (NE-2, PA-1, CA-45) whereas establishment picks who defeated liberal alternatives went 3 for 3 (PA-7, KS-3, TX-7).The same factors were at play for the Republicans, who \u201calso paid for extremism,\u201d Grossmann wrote: \u201cKris Kobach for governor in Kansas and Scott Walker for Wisconsin governor,\u201d but Republicanswon both of the direct gubernatorial conflicts between candidates from the far left and right: Brian Kemp vs. Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Ron DeSantis vs. Andrew Gillum in Florida.(Abrams is not conceding defeat and still hopes to force Kemp into a runoff; she campaigned as a progressive, as did Gillum, not as someone on the \u201cfar left.\u201d) In addition, Schaffner wrote,college-educated white women voted 2-to-1 in favor of Democratic House candidates over Republican House candidates, a margin that is larger than we\u2019ve ever seen it. There was a lot of talk about how Trump\u2019s abrasive rhetoric, attack on health care, and aggressive immigration enforcement might drive away this group, and it certainly has.The Democratic strategy of targeting women, minorities and the young was vindicated with the new House majority. We saw record liberal turnout in many suburbs.The Republican strategy of targeting men, whites and rural voters was vindicated with the larger Senate majority. We saw record conservative turnout in rural Trump country.As for President Trump, the election put a dent in his armor both by exposing weaknesses in the Midwest and assuring sustained congressional investigations over the next two years.Democrats scored significant wins Tuesday in 2018 legislative elections \u2014 but it was hardly a blowout. Republicans continue to have a robust advantage in legislative and state control, as they have since 2010. Democrats won five legislative chambers from Republicans as well as moving the Connecticut Senate from tied to their column. That\u2019s a shift of only six chambers, well below the average chamber switch of 12 in election cycles all the way back to 1900.Democratic gains at the state legislative level will have little influence over redistricting, which Republicans have used to their advantage in the 23 states where they controlled the legislature and governors\u2019 mansions.Democratic victories in governor races, however, in Wisconsin, Kansas and Illinois will give the party crucial leverage in redrawing congressional and legislative districts after the 2020 census.Voters said they were casting their ballot to show opposition rather than support for Trump, by a 12-point margin, 38 to 26 percent. That left a third for whom Trump was not a factor \u2014 and they voted Republican for the House by 52-44 percent, sapping some force from the blue wave.Exit polls, Langer noted, show the growing importance of minority voters.Nonwhites accounted for 28 percent of voters, highest ever for a midterm and 1 point from the record in any election, set in 2016. Consider the change: Nonwhites accounted for 9 percent of voters in the 1990 midterms.Gary Jacobson, emeritus professor of political science at the University of California-San Diego, wrote in an email that the centrality of Trump in an election without his name on the ballot was clear everywhere:The election continued a long-term trend toward more nationalized, partisan, and president-centered midterm elections. Trump\u2019s person and behavior extended all of these trends into new territory.As a result, Jacobson continued, \u201ca remarkable 91 Senate seats in the 116th Congress will be held by the party that won the state in 2016.\u201d Senate elections, in other words, have been nationalized, with the vast majority of states picking presidential and senate candidates from the same party, instead of splitting tickets between the parties.In addition,the level of congruence between presidential approval and the House vote (for the president\u2019s party if approving, for the other party if disapproving) in both pre-election polls and the one postelection poll now available is the highest on record, over 90 percent.Put all this together and what do you get?Overall, the election exacerbated partisan divisions and ratcheted up polarization to an even greater level than before. The demographic realignment continues.Looking toward the 2020 presidential election, the most favorable development for Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s election was the fact that Trump has failed to convert his Midwest victories into a firm Republican base in the region.\u201cAll the swing states, even Iowa and Ohio but especially Pennsylvania and Michigan, are back on the table,\u201d Grossmann told me.If Democrats can come up with a compelling presidential candidate \u2014 a candidate who can carry the Midwest \u2014 they will be as, or more, competitive than Trump and his Republicans.The scenarios in this report suggest that there are paths for both parties to win the Electoral College in 2020 and beyond. For Republicans, future success is tied to mobilizing their strength among whites without college educations \u2014 a still-substantial but shrinking portion of the electorate \u2014 while attaining gains among at least some growing demographic groups. A narrow Republican reliance on noncollege-educated whites would lead, at best, to continued popular vote losses and ever smaller Electoral College wins, which would eventually peter out.While Democrats appear to have the advantage in future popular vote contests, their success in the Electoral College will likely require some combination of intensifying their support among voters of color and improving their margins among white, particularly white noncollege-educated, voters. This delicate balancing act will provide a challenge for the party that cannot be met by simply waiting for demographic change to reshape the electorate.Put another way, even as this balancing act preoccupies the Republican and Democratic parties, race and immigration will retain their salience at the hot core of American politics. And Trump is certain to continue his vicious exploitation of both.An earlier version of this column misstated how Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly and Bill Nelson voted on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. They voted against him, not for him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Macedonian Leader Seeks Asylum in Hungary to Avoid Prison", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it was somewhat awkward this week when the former prime minister of Macedonia \u2014 Nikola Gruevski, who was supposed to begin a two-year prison sentence on Monday after being convicted of abuse of power \u2014 announced on Facebook that he had fled his homeland and was in Budapest seeking asylum.After more than 24 hours of silence, the Hungarian government confirmed late Wednesday night that Mr. Gruevski was in the country and seeking asylum but provided few other details, including how a convicted politician managed to get into the country considering that both his personal and diplomatic passports had been confiscated.Mr. Gruevski\u2019s flight stoked outrage in Macedonia, which issued a warrant for his arrest and demanded that he be extradited. It has also highlighted the competition between the European Union and Russia over the values and allegiances of countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.At the same time, Mr. Orban has sought to strengthen his ties with Russia and find allies in the countries on the eastern fringes of the bloc of nations, including rulers in the western Balkans that aspire to join the union.When Mr. Gruevski was in power, Mr. Orban cast aside concerns about corruption to embrace the Macedonian leader.Istvan Hegedus, the chairman of the Hungarian Europe Society, said that Mr. Orban has tried to have it both ways for years \u2014 reaping the benefits of membership in the European Union while cozying up to Russia and other nondemocratic nations for support when needed.\u201cThis sort of dance between east and west, between dictators and Brussels, it cannot work forever,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a leader, you are forced to make decisions.\u201dIn this case, it is Macedonia that again finds itself in the middle.Mr. Hegedus and other outside observers said that they would not be surprised to see Mr. Gruevski disappear from Hungary only to re-emerge in Russia or some other country from which it would be harder to have him extradited.\u201cIt would be incredibly cynical, but Orban might make a human rights argument, saying that other asylum seekers have chosen to leave the country and that is their right,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich would be incredibly unfair given that most of those seeking asylum are stuck in shipping containers on the Serbian border.\u201dMs. Pardavi, whose group has been a frequent target of the Orban government, said that technically, Hungary\u2019s interior minister has the discretionary power to grant asylum even if someone can\u2019t be considered a refugee under normal circumstances.\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical that this extraordinary exception is only made for somebody who is a great ally of Prime Minister Orban,\u201d she said.The Hungarian government denied that it played any role in facilitating Mr. Gruevski\u2019s flight from Macedonia.\u201cNikola Gruevski has submitted an asylum request to the competent Hungarian authority,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cGiven that he was prime minister of his country for 10 years, for security reasons the Hungarian authorities have allowed Mr. Gruevski to have his asylum request submitted and heard at the headquarters of the Immigration and Asylum Office in Budapest.\u201dPressed on why Mr. Gruevski was not forced to go to one of the transit centers created by Mr. Orban to seek asylum, the Hungarian leader replied dismissively, telling reporters to \u201cask the lawyers.\u201dEarlier, however, Balazs Hidv\u00e9ghi, the communications director of Mr. Orban\u2019s party, Fidesz, pointed to a familiar figure to explain why the former Macedonian leader might deserve asylum.\u201cNikola Gruevski is persecuted and threatened by the current Macedonian government, which is under the influence of George Soros,\u201d he said.There is no evidence to suggest the Hungarian-born, American philanthropist has anything to do with Mr. Gruevski\u2019s legal troubles.In fact, the United States government played an instrumental role in helping establish the office of the special prosecutor in Macedonia that eventually brought charges against Mr. Gruevski. The State Department, in a statement, said that Mr. Gruevski had been convicted after a \u201cthorough and transparent legal process.\u201d\"We believe it is appropriate for the Macedonian legal process to proceed and for Mr. Gruevski to be held accountable within the Macedonian justice system,\u201d the department said.The trials were viewed as a big step forward in a country that has been plagued by corruption since it declared independence from the former republic of Yugoslavia in 1991.While Mr. Gruevski still faces a variety of charges, he was recently convicted of abuse of power in a case having to do with the purchasing of a new armored vehicle for official use while he was prime minister. He lost his final appeal on Nov. 9 and was scheduled to start his jail sentence Monday.He never showed up.The reaction in Skopje was swift. Public shock and anger were stoked by rumors and suspicions that quickly took on a life of their own online.Social media \u2014 where most people in the country get their news \u2014 was rife with anonymously sourced speculation about plots and conspiracies. Some people said that Mr. Gruevski escaped by dressing as a woman and traveling with false papers. Others saw the hand of Russia.The Albanian Ministry of Interior said late Thursday that Mr. Gruevski escaped through Albania, somehow making his way to the Hungarian Embassy in Tirana, where he was then driven in a diplomatic vehicle to Montenegro. It remained unclear how he was able to exit Macedonia and how he made it from Montenegro to Budapest.Some in Macedonia said they suspected the complicity of the Macedonian government itself, claiming without evidence that the administration of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev had secretly agreed to let Mr. Gruevski escape in order to secure the votes needed to reach an agreement on renaming the country.Mr. Zaev said such speculation was nonsense.\u201cI strongly reject all speculations about some kind of political deal with Gruevski. Nothing such has been done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will investigate how he escaped, but I am convinced that Gruevski will be returned and he will face his sentence.\u201dHe then said he was confident in the core values of the European Union.\u201cWhat kind of motivation would other countries have to join the E.U. if an E.U. country allows convicted criminals to escape from justice?\u201d he asked.Reporting was contributed by Helene Bienvenu in Budapest, Hungary; Aleksandar Dimishkovski in Skopje, Macedonia; and Gardiner Harris in Washington.Advertisement"}

Each is only a drop in the ocean.\u201d He and Hasan find comfort in helping their fellow refugees, in their friendships, and in exploring the island.Between my days meeting with them and other refugees, I, too, explored. Samos is a diamond-shaped island less than a mile from Turkey, ringed by beaches and dominated by two major mountains, both of which offer spectacular hikes. June and early fall are ideal times to visit, when the water is warm and the air cool.\u201cWhat I love about Samos,\u201d Costas said, \u201cis that it is quiet and full of nature. People say the refugees have driven away tourists, but I don\u2019t think so. It is a beautiful island for everyone.\u201dBetween my explorations, I continued to drop by Alpha Center. More refugees were arriving every day, and the camp had grown so overcrowded that people had to wait in line for hours to get a meal, only to find that the food had often run out. When I returned in October, many volunteers were concerned that people would soon be starving, and freezing to death in their tents during the winter.The day before I left, Ayad, Hasan and I talked about the overcrowding and the increased police harassment. \u201cI understand this is their country, and they don\u2019t want us here,\u201d Ayad said. \u201cWe all wish we could go home.

{"Headline": "The Story of America, Told Through Mark Twain\u2019s Favorite Foods", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a new audio series, the actor Nick Offerman explores political, cultural and ecological shifts through the author\u2019s palate.But in 1879, on a book tour through Europe, he craved the simplest foods from home, with agonizing specificity. Twain wanted Early Rose potatoes, a Vermont-bred heirloom, roasted in the ashes of a fire. Mussels from the waters around San Francisco. And hot broiled Virginia bacon. He compiled a list, an extensive fantasy of a meal, which he imagined sitting down to enjoy right off the steamship when he got home. That list is now a snapshot of some of the most cherished regional American foods of his time.Mr. Offerman, who is best known for his role as the meat-loving municipal worker Ron Swanson in the television show \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d is a longtime fan of Twain\u2019s work.Mr. Offerman\u2019s voice was shaped by Minooka, Ill., a small village outside Chicago where his family farmed corn and soybeans, and raised pigs. They caught lake fish: perch, speckled crappies, flat bluegills and largemouth bass with shimmering, olive-green backs. In Minnesota, where his family went on fishing trips, they occasionally caught snapping turtles and turned them into soup.Working out of a small food truck parked on the lawn of Twain\u2019s house, Mr. Anderson produced an eight-course meal. It started with raw oysters with a frothy sherry-maple cream, and moved on to smoked raccoon sausage wrapped in caul fat. The fifth course was sheepshead, a tough, bony fish he poached in olive oil and served with potato pur\u00e9e.Twain, who had worked as a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi, looked forward to eating sheepshead whenever he got to New Orleans. \u201cWhen he liked food it was very much contextual for him,\u201d Mr. Beahrs said. \u201cIt was all about the food itself, but also the people he was with and places where he ate it.\u201d Each episode of the series focuses on a different ingredient that Twain loved. Raccoons, like sheepshead, are still plentiful, but the recipes for its meat that were published in the original edition of \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d have since been edited out. Tastes change.Todd Whitney, a producer of the show, visited the small town of Gillett, Ark., which holds an annual raccoon dinner. The episode takes twists and turns, exploring Twain\u2019s complicated relationship with African-Americans, in both his life and his fiction, as well as the racist language that he used in his work.The definition of American food, since Twain outlined it, has broadened, while the country\u2019s wild ingredients have dwindled. One episode zooms in on prairie chicken \u2014 a small, curvy grouse with brown stripes that was displaced by the corn industry. \u201cThe foods Twain loved, we took for granted as American classics,\u201d Mr. Beahrs said. \u201cBut these things that are part of the richness of everyday life \u2014 they can vanish very, very quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Full-Throated Defense of Traditional Indian Cooking", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.New York hasn\u2019t seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties \u2014 we\u2019ve seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce.There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don\u2019t really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won\u2019t land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are.I hadn\u2019t given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper.Once I\u2019d found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I\u2019d been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention.They\u2019ve taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don\u2019t resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking.Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it\u2019s gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens.Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you\u2019d hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates.Anything that passes through Adda\u2019s tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that\u2019s coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it.My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin \u2014 plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India \u2014 that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join.He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, \u201cThis is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.\u201d It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I\u2019ve ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions.Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India\u2019s more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It\u2019s very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians.It would, however, be the place I\u2019d send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don\u2019t yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious.And Adda is the first restaurant I\u2019d tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. \u201cLike soft scrambled eggs,\u201d our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Long Before Trump Destroys the Rule of Law?", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe only thing blocking his plan to prosecute Hillary Clinton was Don McGahn. Think about that.Mr. Litman is a former United States attorney and deputy assistant attorney general.The story prompted a new level of stunned outrage among Trump critics, even those already jaded by the president\u2019s weekly onslaughts against the rule of law. Former Department of Justice officials in particular responded with variants of \u201cHe\u2019s got to be kidding.\u201d But others claimed that the idea, which was shot down by Don McGahn, the White House counsel, shows that the system is working.In fact, Mr. Trump was deadly serious \u2014 and this latest story illustrates just how fragile the system has become in less than two years since he took office.Mr. Trump\u2019s attempted move here was positively Putinesque, using the legal system, and the executive branch\u2019s extensive legal power, to punish his enemies. What kept him from getting away with it was not the laws on the books \u2014 Russia\u2019s legal protections are no less extensive and high-minded than ours, but they don\u2019t prevent Vladimir Putin from laying waste to his political opponents \u2014 but shared political norms developed and stabilized over time.Mr. McGahn apparently was able to dissuade Mr. Trump from issuing the order to prosecute political enemies by telling him that the plan was so antithetical to American political values that it could trigger impeachment proceedings. (One sympathizes with Mr. McGahn trying to get his head around the order in the first place and attempting to explain to his boss, with the patience due an errant schoolchild, how profoundly out of line he was.)Mr. McGahn is hardly a Lincolnesque figure, but he is sufficiently steeped in American legal and political culture, and sufficiently experienced, to be able to rebuff the president. The screaming question here is what could have happened \u2014 or might happen in the near future \u2014 if the order had been issued to Trump crony Matt Whitaker, now the acting attorney general, through the incoming White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, a far more callow figure than Mr. McGahn. After all, both Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Whitaker were most likely chosen in large part for their moral malleability \u2014 a quality Mr. Trump has repeatedly and loudly demanded from his branch\u2019s lawyers.I hope and believe that the order to prosecute \u2014 without even a predicate of criminal activity \u2014 would have prompted a raft of resignations at the Department of Justice. But not everyone would have left, and if the attorney general commanded it, it probably would have been put in motion. Presumably the prosecution would have been halted before Mrs. Clinton was led away in handcuffs. But possibly not, given doctrines of deference to the executive branch, which typically leave defendants scant room to question indictments based on improper prosecutorial intent. In any case even the mere initiation of the prosecution would have been a severe injury to American democracy.It\u2019s the sort of injury, moreover, that would have been near-inconceivable before 2016. The principle that the president may not simply prosecute political enemies is part of the DNA of American political culture, but Mr. Trump is the heedless radioactive force indifferent to the nature of the bonds he is breaking.And it\u2019s not just the president. Mr. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, has evinced a similar threat to first principles in his idiotic dismissal of Marbury v. Madison, the source of the Supreme Court\u2019s power of judicial review and arguably the most important and influential judicial decision ever rendered. Mr. Whitaker has called Marbury one of the worst decisions in the Supreme Court\u2019s history.What makes Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Whitaker\u2019s positions so wrongheaded and dumbfounding? It is surprisingly difficult to say. In fact, in 1803, when Chief Justice John Marshall issued the opinion, it could have been seen as a power grab by the court, arrogating to itself the final power to \u201csay what the law is.\u201d Over 200 years later, the principle seems stable beyond all attack, and the core of a judicial system and fidelity to the rule of law that are the envy of the world.But that stability is ultimately built on a foundation of shared political cultural norms, not laws. Especially today, it is entirely conceivable that an attorney general armed with a jackhammer might in fact come to destabilize it. It sounds like a sort of bad joke, but it also did when candidate Trump announced in the debate that if he were president, Mrs. Clinton \u201cwould be in jail.\u201d Now that joke seems like it\u2019s on us. Were it not for the coincidence of Mr. McGahn, she might well be.The crazy and terrifying lesson of the order to prosecute Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Comey is not that our legal norms can withstand a despot; rather, it\u2019s that within a matter of months we can find ourselves praying that they hold, and with little recourse if they don\u2019t. Repairing the damage to our basic political culture will require many years and shared resolve across the political spectrum.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Though these are good goals, some of the proposals are flawed.Ballot Proposal 1: YesThe first proposal would lower limits for contributions to candidates who participate in the campaign finance system, while increasing the funding match given for candidates in the program. Its goal is to boost the impact of smaller donations, to pave the way for more competition in the city\u2019s elections. The contribution limit for citywide candidates would be lowered to $2,000 from $5,100. Matching funds would increase under the proposal, to an 8-1 match from a 6-1 match now.Combined, these changes would be likely to help blunt the impact of large donations, and encourage more candidates to run for office.The new rules wouldn\u2019t become binding until 2022. Some critics of the proposal have said making the new rules optional for candidates running in the city\u2019s 2021 elections \u2014 in which voters will choose a new mayor and a plethora of new City Council members \u2014 is a reason to vote against the initiative. This conclusion seems shortsighted, given the potential long-term benefits for the city.Ballot Proposal 2: NoSome of the initiatives the commission would be tasked with overseeing are worthy, such as expanding translation services at poll sites.

State legislatures are where real progressive action is most likely to happen.Ms. Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Democrats pulled off a significant victory on Tuesday night. No, it wasn\u2019t taking back the House in Congress. It\u2019s what they did in state legislatures around the country.These victories arguably hold the same, if not more, heft than the inroads Democrats made in Congress. At the federal level, legislative achievements have ground to nearly a complete halt in recent years. So while Democrats in the House will now most likely act as a bulwark against a number of Republican policy goals, the real action will continue to be at the state level. Democrats should push further to raise wages and benefits for American workers. If the Supreme Court weakens Roe v. Wade, Democratic-controlled legislatures can enshrine women\u2019s reproductive freedom in their own laws. They can address climate change through carbon pricing and renewable energy mandates. States can also protect voting rights, through automatic voter registration and other reforms, reduce mass incarceration by getting rid of cash bail and needlessly punitive policies and curb gun violence with gun control legislation.All of these priorities, which Democrats struggle to advance at the federal level, can still make headway in the states.State legislatures will also be in charge of redrawing congressional districts after the 2020 census. With their 2010 state-level Republican victories, the party was able to gerrymander a number of districts in ways that still keep Democrats at a political disadvantage. Having gained legislative ground will give Democrats the power to potentially undo some of the harm or at least give them more of a say in how districts are drawn. Democrats still have a lot of work to do. Republicans still hold 56 percent of state legislative seats and control 65 chambers. But Tuesday\u2019s victories show that Democrats have the power to change those numbers if they put their money and effort into these races. It\u2019s crucial that they continue to do so. Republicans are certainly paying close attention to who holds control of the country\u2019s statehouses. If Democrats don\u2019t do the same, they cede enormous policy power to the other party.Bryce Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanksgiving Wines: A Last-Minute Checklist", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuggestions for when you have no time to think (or agonize) about what bottles to buy for the feast. It\u2019s that time again \u2014 practically the last minute before the Thanksgiving guests arrive, and you\u2019ve got everything under control. Except the wine.Perhaps you planned it that way. Leaving the wine until the very end eliminates the agonizing. You must act, and act swiftly. And we are here to help.What follows is a last-minute guide to choosing wine for Thanksgiving. We assume you will not have an opportunity to visit a boutique shop. You will have to find the nearest store, possibly the only one still open.Our suggestions include widely produced brands that may lack some of the distinctive nuances of wines made by hand. But these mass-market selections will have the virtue of being available.The fundamental rules of shopping for a Thanksgiving feast still apply:If you would like to add ros\u00e9s or sparkling wines, go ahead, but not at the expense of the reds and whites.You want wines that are versatile enough to go with many different foods and lively enough to refresh over the course of a long afternoon and evening. That means bottles with good acidity, which are not particularly tannic, oaky or heavy in alcohol. I\u2019m looking specifically for wines that are under 14 percent alcohol, a perhaps arbitrary line that makes perfect sense to me.You want wines that are reasonably priced, around $25 a bottle at most.Above all, you want to select wines that you will enjoy. If you are happy, your guests will be happy, too.Here is a set of suggestions, which you can mix and match anyway you like.You may have better luck with other sources. I would highly recommend the tart and delicious Frog\u2019s Leap sauvignon blanc, from Rutherford in the Napa Valley (about $21). And from the Marlborough region of New Zealand, Huia makes an excellent sauvignon blanc, which sells for around $20.Matthiasson, a terrific California producer, makes inexpensive yet delicious blends, in both red and white, under the Tendu label. They could grace any Thanksgiving table. One-liter bottles sell for around $20.Dry Finger Lakes rieslings would be great additions. Look for labels like Ravines, Hermann J. Wiemer, Anthony Road, Forge Cellars, Red Newt, Heart & Hands, Silver Thread and Bloomer Creek. Each of their basic cuv\u00e9es should sell for under $25.Foxglove is the value label from Varner, which makes very good wines in the Santa Cruz Mountains in California. The Foxglove Central Coast chardonnay (around $15) is rich and ample, yet lively and juicy. A step up is the Russian River chardonnay from Jordan (about $25) which is focused, energetic and understated.From New Zealand, Momo, from Seresin Estate, is quite a good pinot noir for around $20 a bottle, but not always easy to find. Other good New Zealand pinot noirs tend to be more expensive.Otherwise, you will need to step over my alcohol line. Ridge, which makes such fine single-vineyard zinfandels, also has an entry-level bottle, Three Valleys, which sells for $25 to $30. It\u2019s dry, delicious and well-balanced, at 14.3 percent. Dashe, another very good zinfandel producer, offers its fine Dry Creek Valley zin for around $25 to $30 as well. It, too, is 14.3 percent.You have your work cut out for you, now. Don\u2019t just stand there \u2014 get going!Advertisement"}

This is how I feel about my marriage.\u201dHe also chided the publication for not asking him for comment before publishing its story. Zach Stafford, the editor in chief of Into, said the reporter had asked for comment through a Grindr spokesman but didn\u2019t receive a response.Here is Mr. Chen\u2019s full post, translated from Chinese:Some people think that marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman, I think so too, but that\u2019s your own business.Some people think that the purpose of marriage is to bring up children with your own DNA, but that\u2019s your own business.But there are people who aren\u2019t the same as you, and desperately hope that they can also get married; they have their own reasons for wanting that.Getting married is personal.

Why do you spend so much money to prevent people in love from getting married?

{"Headline": "Everyone Wants to \u2018Influence\u2019 You", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsThere are two contradictory truisms about people under the influence of alcohol. One is that, intoxicated, they become their real selves: mean or weepy, loving or angry, violent or desperate. (According to the Roman historian Tacitus, ancient Germanic tribes would hold wartime negotiations drunk, reasoning that it made all parties incapable of hiding anything.) But the other thing we like to say about drunks \u2014 often while shepherding someone apologetically out of a party or a bar \u2014 is that \u201che\u2019s not himself\u201d or \u201cthis isn\u2019t like her.\u201dSo which is it: Are we always ourselves, or are our selves tenuous, warped by company and context? \u201cInfluence\u201d suggests some alchemy between the two \u2014 between an internal self and an outside pressure \u2014 and makes no claims about which is stronger. Power is overtly coercive, but influence is wily: It can slip into your consciousness without your noticing and start renovating.Last year, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which coordinates findings from across multiple agencies, concluded that Vladimir Putin had ordered an \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d to swing the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Bots and sock puppets \u2014 Russian operatives pretending to be ordinary Americans \u2014 spread disinformation and prejudice online, while Russian intelligence agents harvested emails from D.N.C. networks to fuel embarrassing news stories before the election. Playing on racism, sexism and partisan resentment, the campaign \u2014 which domestic intelligence says is ongoing \u2014 raises the same questions we ask about intoxication: Did it merely bring forth what was already present, or did it make those attitudes worse, leading some of us to behave (and vote) in ways we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have?Americans are, at the moment, preoccupied with Russia\u2019s capacity to manipulate us; a poll last year showed 63 percent of Democrats and 38 percent of Republicans saw \u201cRussia\u2019s power and influence\u201d as a significant threat to the United States. But Russia is just one influence in a whole ecosystem of modern pressures: lobbyists, drugs, Facebook, covert agents, dark money, foreign agendas, dupes and double agents, fake news, bribes, threats. In the midst of all these contradictory influences, the world of politics can seem illegible, a chaotic mass of swirling powers. \u201cThere\u2019s a war on for your mind!\u201d as the slogan for the conspiracy website Infowars says. So how are we supposed to know what we think?Along with this belief came a certain anxiety about its spiritual implications. The medieval Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas accepted that the planets and stars could affect our physical bodies, but he rejected the idea that they could control our minds, which would mean the end of free will. C.S. Lewis summed up medieval attitudes in his 1964 book \u201cThe Discarded Image\u201d: The belief, he wrote, was that influence \u201cgenerates, not a necessity, but only a propensity, to act thus or thus.\u201d And this propensity could be resisted: \u201cThe wise man will over-rule the stars. But more often it will not be resisted, for most men are not wise.\u201dOver time, as astrology was discarded as junk science, influence gradually became the work not of celestial bodies but of governments and advertisers. Propaganda became easier with the printing press; influence became a bona fide business with the rise of behavioral marketing. Lewis complained that this 20th-century use of \u201cinfluence\u201d had a \u201cwithered senility\u201d in comparison to its powerful original meaning. But that astrological sense of influence as a malign, opaque and distant force \u2014 something that tempts us against our characters or better wisdom \u2014 still lingers in the way people talk about the dark orbits of global power and wealth. Just as kings were once thought to rise and fall by the power of the heavens, we now wonder which influence broker might have been responsible for a president\u2019s election: the Russians or the Mercers?For much of the 20th century, America\u2019s dark planet was the Soviet Union. The Soviet brain, said the director of central intelligence Allen Dulles in a 1953 speech, is \u201ca phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control.\u201d Soviet brainwashing, he said, might come through indoctrination or some kind of \u201clie serum,\u201d but whatever it was, it was \u201cabhorrent.\u201d (Never mind that, the same year, Dulles started a program to conduct secret mind-control experiments on unsuspecting Americans and Canadians.) At least, he said, the Soviets didn\u2019t have the manpower to do it on a grand scale.But the internet now means influence can come from anyone, anywhere; it can be visible or invisible, paid for by any power, approaching you any of myriad ways. Influence used to be understood as a top-down phenomenon, with governments, advertisers, donors or other powerful figures holding sway over the masses. These days we understand that the most powerful influences aren\u2019t the distant ones but the most immediate and social \u2014 so the powerful tend to exert their influence by pretending to be ordinary people. Marketers, for instance, work harder and harder to obscure the distinction between ads and real life. The last decade featured the rise of the professional \u201cinfluencer\u201d \u2014 someone paid to use their personal magnetism to promote specific agendas online. Instead of the top-down influence of a commercial or a billboard, these ads are embedded, shared by someone who seems, on some aspirational level, like a peer. The companies paying teenagers to hawk diet tea on Instagram are using the same tactics the Chinese government did when it recruited commenters to post hundreds of millions of pro-Communist Party messages online.The power of these campaigns still comes, of course, from the top down: The forces behind them are merely pretending to speak for the public. It\u2019s an act made feasible mostly by social media, where communication can be aimed, quietly and privately, at carefully selected subjects. When Cambridge Analytica, the political-consulting firm tied to Stephen K. Bannon and funded by conservative donors, wanted to maximize its impact on the 2016 election, it exploited social media data to target users with a precision impossible to Cold War brain warriors. \u201cWe just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,\u201d said Mark Turnbull, a former Cambridge Analytica executive, in a secretly taped recording. \u201cAnd so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands, but with no branding, so it\u2019s unattributable, untrackable.\u201dWhat\u2019s unclear is how effective any of these campaigns actually are. Russian disinformation reached 126 million people on Facebook, but were any of them really swayed? One recent book \u2014 \u201cNetwork Propaganda,\u201d by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts \u2014 uses data to show convincingly that most of the disinformation circulating during the 2016 campaign was actually spread by the good old-fashioned right-wing American media: Breitbart and Fox News. Why should Russia seem more ominous than Sean Hannity? It might have to do with the sheer obviousness of our domestic pundits; Hannity, for instance, is so explicit about his biases that he recently participated in a Trump campaign event. It\u2019s the invisible influence that\u2019s more unnerving, even when its effectiveness is still in question. Turnbull\u2019s analogy is a telling one: Influence, as its liquid origins suggest, seeps and saturates, intoxicates and inspires. The remote control, at least, gives us the illusion of choice.Advertisement"}

Mr. Katyal and Mr. Conway are lawyers.It means that Mr. Trump\u2019s installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid. Much of the commentary about Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment has focused on all sorts of technical points about the Vacancies Reform Act and Justice Department succession statutes. But the flaw in the appointment of Mr. Whitaker, who was Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff at the Justice Department, runs much deeper. It defies one of the explicit checks and balances set out in the Constitution, a provision designed to protect us all against the centralization of government power.If you don\u2019t believe us, then take it from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, whom Mr. Trump once called his \u201cfavorite\u201d sitting justice. Last year, the Supreme Court examined the question of whether the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board had been lawfully appointed to his job without Senate confirmation. The Supreme Court held the appointment invalid on a statutory ground.What goes for a mere lawyer at the N.L.R.B. goes in spades for the attorney general of the United States, the head of the Justice Department and one of the most important people in the federal government. It is one thing to appoint an acting underling, like an acting solicitor general, a post one of us held. But those officials are always supervised by higher-ups; in the case of the solicitor general, by the attorney general and deputy attorney general, both confirmed by the Senate.We cannot tolerate such an evasion of the Constitution\u2019s very explicit, textually precise design. Senate confirmation exists for a simple, and good, reason. Constitutionally, Matthew Whitaker is a nobody. His job as Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff did not require Senate confirmation. (Yes, he was confirmed as a federal prosecutor in Iowa, in 2004, but Mr. Trump can\u2019t cut and paste that old, lapsed confirmation to today.) For the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.In times of crisis, interim appointments need to be made. Cabinet officials die, and wars and other tragic events occur. It is very difficult to see how the current situation comports with those situations. And even if it did, there are officials readily at hand, including the deputy attorney general and the solicitor general, who were nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Either could step in as acting attorney general, both constitutionally and statutorily.We must heed those words today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Thanksgiving Learning Curve", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Irish woman\u2019s foray into this American tradition.Contributing Opinion WriterIn the first year of my life in the United States, I used \u201cbeing new\u201d as an excuse for everything. Being new, coupled with my Irish accent, helped smooth over a number of faux pas, including one time when I pronounced the x in \u201cfaux pas\u201d and my co-worker thought I was cursing at him.I entered into this American adventure happily, learning as I went, comfortable in the knowledge that I\u2019d arrived in a nation of immigrants and really, aren\u2019t we are all just figuring it out?So four years ago, giddy at the prospect of a brand-new holiday, I prepared for my first Thanksgiving dinner at a friend\u2019s house. Was it true there would be sugar in the potatoes? Should I mutter \u201chut hut hut\u201d continuously throughout the football game or just every now and then? And what to bring? I meandered into Paper Source and picked up some table decorations, a cute do-it-yourself tepee pack and some funny paper headdresses, some shaped like pilgrim\u2019s hats, some shaped like feathers.Turned out the potatoes were fully candy, nobody says \u201chut hut hut\u201d ever, and making tepees and feather headdresses together was a great icebreaker. That afternoon of crafts and food turned strangers into friends. Much like, I imagined, the very first Thanksgiving, when white settlers and Native people put aside their differences to collaborate on cranberry sauce recipes and generally had such a blast that all was forgiven, perhaps even forgotten.You already know that I was mistaken, and as my newness gradually wore off, I came to understand that too. In 2016, I was making a podcast about immigration and devoted one episode to how immigrants spend Thanksgiving. Researching that episode got me thinking that we\u2019re not really a nation of immigrants after all, since there were Native people here for many thousands of years before those first European settlers, and Native people are, of course, still here.I spoke to Gyasi Ross, a writer and attorney from the Blackfeet Nation, and told him about my first Thanksgiving, with those paper tepees and headdresses. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said, and explained. \u201cThe problem with images like that is they capture a particular time and keep us in that time.\u201d Now she feels her anger rise when her little cousins bring the same artwork home. \u201cI get angry about all the injustices and atrocities that my people, and all Native people, have gone through, and that\u2019s not changing,\u201d she said. I felt so dopey, an oblivious trespasser, not a clue about where I really was. As an immigrant, I chose to live here, so I want to understand as much as I can about this place I call home.I had never heard about that part of our history, but now there was a sculpture to mark this extraordinary gesture of kindness. It\u2019s stunning; a circle of 6-foot-tall feathers that make the shape of an empty bowl, symbolizing the hunger suffered by the Irish.Charles Trevelyan, the British administrator in charge of relief, famously said, \u201cThe judgment of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated.\u201d Our colonizers saw us as expendable, but others knew better. Ahead of the unveiling in June of last year, Chief Gary Batton of the Choctaw told Irish journalists: \u201cYour story is our story. We didn\u2019t have any income. This was money pulled from our pockets. We had gone through the biggest tragedy that we could endure, and saw what was happening in Ireland and just felt compelled to help.\u201dI make jokes about the Irish famine sometimes, at dinner with my English friend. I tell him he\u2019s hogging the potatoes. Still, when I looked at the statue, this empty bowl and the steel gray sky behind it, my eyes filled up and I got a sort of ache of memory in my heart. This feeling makes sense in the same way the Choctaw, separated by an ocean, felt a tug of love for strangers and did whatever they could to alleviate their pain. I\u2019m thankful they did that. I\u2019m thankful to live in their country. I\u2019m thankful I get to blunder around and learn as I go and thankful for the education I\u2019m receiving.Advertisement"}

On airlines from American to Qantas, premium economy offers travelers bigger seats and improved amenities for a price that is somewhere between regular economy and business class. Here\u2019s a guide on what to expect (and what not to) if you decide to upgrade on your next flight:Premium economy was first introduced by Eva Air and Virgin Atlantic in 1992 as a new travel option for long-haul passengers who wanted a bit of extra comfort. The cabin was successful for both airlines and in the years since, more companies like Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand have introduced their own versions. Here\u2019s the breakdown for a sample New York-London itinerary, leaving Kennedy International Airport on Dec. 6 and returning from Heathrow Airport on Dec. 13, based on a 30-day advance purchase.

On Tuesday, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith won a hard-fought runoff election over her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy. That Mississippi is sending a Republican back to Washington is hardly a surprise, but Ms. Hyde-Smith gave the opposition hope in the closing weeks of the campaign as she careened from one gaffe to the next \u2014 each one emphasizing both that she was tone deaf and that she found humor in her state\u2019s history of racial violence and voter suppression.Barely a week later, the candidate again found herself facing a round of questioning when during a visit to Mississippi State University she remarked that laws that make it just a little more difficult for some college students to vote are great because \u201cthey remind me that there\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d That was a joke too, she said. But who exactly is laughing with her?Racist violence, segregation and voter suppression are not shared historical jokes. They are our present. Unless we change course, they will define our future. Ms. Hyde-Smith claims not to have realized there was anything wrong with what she said. She has steadfastly refused to apologize. Perhaps most important, since her comments came to light, she has yet to publicly engage in conversation with constituents of hers for whom hanging is not a joke and voting is a hard-fought, continually challenged right. During the campaign, she did not acknowledge there was even a dialogue worth having. Perhaps this is because for much of her life she has been hearing only one side of an argument and doesn\u2019t know or care that there is a larger conversation to be had. If this is the case, it may have something to do with where Ms. Hyde-Smith went to school and where she chose to send her daughter to school.The most notable thing about the South\u2019s segregation academies isn\u2019t that they were racially segregated. Racially and economically segregated schools remain across all parts of the United States. What is notable is that taxpayer dollars financed these all-white schools at the cost of simultaneously creating poorly funded all-black public-school systems in the South. To put it simply, as the financial drain of taxpayer dollars from whites attending segregation academies decimated school systems educating black children, black communities, students and teachers paid a terribly high price to ensure that whites were educated with other whites.Unsurprisingly, then, when schools in Mississippi were finally forced to integrate, the black children who did so often faced violence at the hands of their white classmates. That is part of the educational history of the defeated Democratic candidate in the race for the Senate in Mississippi, Mike Espy, who integrated Yazoo City High School in 1969. \u201cSo, that\u2019s a Mississippi I want to be a part of \u2014 one of diversity, one of inclusion, one of different experiences,\u201d he added. \u201cI decided to use that very difficult time to learn from and try to reach out to people of all races. So, if you compare me and that experience to Cindy Hyde and her experience, I\u2019d rather have my experience.\u201dMr. Espy knows that racist violence is no joking matter. We know that his opponent cannot say the same.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Admits It Was Used to Incite Violence in Myanmar", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has long promoted itself as a tool for bringing people together to make the world a better place. Now the social media giant has acknowledged that in Myanmar it did the opposite, and human rights groups say it has a lot of work to do to fix that.\u201cWe agree that we can and should do more,\u201d the executive, Alex Warofka, a Facebook product policy manager, wrote. He also said Facebook would invest resources in addressing the abuse of its platform in Myanmar that the report outlines.The report, by Business for Social Responsibility, or BSR, which is based in San Francisco, paints a picture of a company that was unaware of its own potential for doing harm and did little to figure out the facts on the ground.The report details how Facebook unwittingly entered a country new to the digital era and still emerging from decades of censorship, all the while plagued by political and social divisions.But the report fails to look closely at how Facebook employees missed a crescendo of posts and misinformation that helped to fuel modern ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.The report recommends that Facebook increase enforcement of policies for content posted on its platform; exercise greater transparency with data that shows its progress; and engage with civil society and officials in Myanmar.Some Facebook detractors criticized the company on Tuesday for releasing the report on the eve of the midterm elections in the United States, when the attention of the news media and many of Facebook\u2019s most vocal critics was elsewhere. Human rights groups said Facebook\u2019s pledge needed to be followed up with more concrete actions.\u201cThere are a lot of people at Facebook who have known for a long time that the company should have done more to prevent the gross misuse of its platform in Myanmar,\u201d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a nonprofit human rights organization that focuses on Southeast Asia.\u201cThis assessment is encouraging and overdue, but the key to any assessment is implementation,\u201d Mr. Smith added.Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said Facebook\u2019s actions in Myanmar would be \u201cthe acid test\u201d to see if it became \u201ca responsible platform manager with its own enforceable code of conduct.\u201dIn response to a question about the timing of the release of the report, Facebook said it had previously committed to publishing the report at this time. It also said the report was in line with the company\u2019s commitment to respond to growing concerns in Myanmar.Two years after the 2016 election in the United States put the company under heightened scrutiny, Facebook has introduced a series of experiments meant to address the problem of misinformation on its platform. It has also set up fact-checking groups and altered its advertising practices to bar those who seek to spread false news.In Myanmar, Facebook essentially is the internet \u2014 and, by extension, the only source of information \u2014 for some 20 million people, according to BSR\u2019s estimates. Mobile phones sold there already have Facebook installed.As Facebook\u2019s presence in Myanmar grew in recent years, the company did not address what the BSR report calls a \u201ccrisis of digital literacy\u201d in a country that was just emerging from a military dictatorship and where the internet was still new.Many citizens in Myanmar, the report says, still do not know the basics of the internet \u2014 from using a browser to setting up an email account \u2014 and are not equipped to distinguish real information from rumor. The report warns that this could continue to be a problem for Facebook, especially during the country\u2019s general elections in 2020.New problems could also arise related to WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook that is becoming popular in Myanmar.In Myanmar, the prevalence of hate speech, disinformation and bad actors on Facebook \u201chas had a negative impact on freedom of expression, assembly and association for Myanmar\u2019s most vulnerable users,\u201d the report says. This has led to the suppression of free speech; violence and hate campaigns; and self-censorship by women, minorities and other vulnerable members of society.Facebook took down the official accounts of military leaders in August. But some activists said the company still had not done enough.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a significant change,\u201d said Ye Wai Phyo Aung, the founder of Athan, a free-speech organization. Facebook should do more to prevent fake accounts from being created, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s still easy to sign up for a Facebook account with fake names,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Facebook team should have worked on that.\u201dNot everyone in Myanmar agreed with the blame placed on Facebook. Ye Myat Thu, the managing director of Alpha Computer Mandalay, an information technology firm, said the government needed to take action to enforce better behavior online and prevent violence.\u201cFacebook is just the platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is no Facebook, people will use another platform. I see Facebook just as a product.\u201dRichard C. Paddock and Saw Nang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The caller, who claimed to be from \u201cthe Raman government,\u201d asked if she had benefited from government programs and urged her to vote for Mr. Singh\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party. When she complained about her pay and work conditions, she recalled, \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019ll carry your concerns to Raman.\u2019\u201dBut this election season, many of the 2.9 million people who have received the phones have found themselves targeted by the B.J.P.Working out of a government-owned building near the capital, about 350 contractors, originally hired by the state but now paid by the B.J.P., have been calling people who received the phones. Reading from a script that pops up on their screens, the callers ask the recipients if they are happy with the device and the mobile service, and also poll them on their satisfaction with other government programs championed by Mr. Singh.The callers then ask people whether they plan to vote and which party they intend to vote for, according to half a dozen people who made or received the calls.The state B.J.P. uses the data to steer party activists to visit voters who said they intended to vote for the opposition Indian National Congress or abstain, according to a longtime B.J.P. worker briefed on the strategy. \u201cThey are misusing state machinery for personal gains,\u201d said the worker, who requested anonymity before discussing confidential party matters. \u201cWhen we are in the government and have done so well, why do we need to do this?\u201dThe phones themselves also actively promote Mr. Singh, who has run the state for 15 years and is seeking a fourth term.His smiling face is set as the background image on the home screen, prompting some to nickname it the \u201cRaman mobile.\u201dThe phones come loaded with two campaign apps: one for Mr. Singh that features his news releases and speeches, and a similar one for Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, who also hails from the B.J.P. and is up for re-election next year. When phone users first open the apps, they are asked to grant full access to contacts and to share other personal information with the B.J.P.The Congress Party has filed complaints about the B.J.P.\u2019s tactics to the Election Commission of India, arguing that if the state is giving one party access to the database of phone recipients, other parties should also be given the data. Congress officials also accused the call-center operator, Magnum Group, of violating laws that prohibit election work by the government.Subrat Sahoo, the chief electoral officer for the state, said in an interview on Saturday that the B.J.P.\u2019s use of Magnum to make calls was legal as long as the party paid the bills. But he said that commission officials in New Delhi were examining whether the B.J.P. was given improper access to the list of phone recipients. Mr. Sahoo wrote the Chhattisgarh agency in charge of the data on Nov. 1 and told it not to share it.Sunil Soni, a B.J.P. vice president in Chhattisgarh, said that the phone program was intended to help the poor in this central Indian state, where settlements sometimes consist of just a few homes and roads are often just a single lane. \u201cThose who are too poor to buy a mobile must not be kept out of development,\u201d he said. He added that there was nothing wrong with urging people to vote, which Magnum and many other entities were doing.Magnum, an Indian outsourcing firm that does call-center work for both private companies and government agencies, has ties to Mr. Singh\u2019s government and the free-phone program, which is formally known as Sanchar Kranti Yojana.In September 2017, the state hired Magnum to survey residents on their overall satisfaction with government programs. The company leased space in a state building and opened a new call center to handle the work. At the televised ribbon-cutting, Mr. Singh donned a headset to make one of the first survey calls.After the SKY program was started in July, the phones\u2019 manufacturer, Micromax, hired Magnum to manage customer service. Separately, the state asked the company to interview about 200,000 recipients about the quality of the SKY phones and the service.The state-paid research stopped about two months ago to comply with routine Indian pre-election rules that forbid the use of government resources to promote a political party. \u201cAt the present time, we are calling on behalf of the B.J.P. party,\u201d Qadir Baksh, the deputy manager for operations at the Magnum call center, said in a brief interview in the lobby on Friday. \u201cI cannot disclose the questions we ask of the people to you.\u201dIn a follow-up phone interview, Syed Adil Hussain, Magnum\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that there was now political activity occurring at the call center, which is in a tree-lined, manicured district near the airport.Mr. Hussain said that a single client had hired the entire call center after the state stopped its surveys. He said that the deal had been struck by his boss, the company\u2019s managing director, and he claimed not to know the identity of the client or the specifics of the contract. \u201cWe have rented out the manpower and the infrastructure to another company,\u201d he said. \u201cHow and what they are doing is not my business.\u201dAlex Paul Menon, the chief executive of the Chhattisgarh Infotech Promotion Society, which runs the SKY program, said India was keen to spread digital literacy. In a state like Chhattisgarh, where simple access was a problem, mobile phones were an obvious first step. In 2016, Mr. Menon\u2019s agency began to seek a mobile carrier to build towers in sparsely populated areas.The contract, which will be worth more than $100 million when completed, went to Reliance Jio, a fast-growing carrier run by a billionaire supporter of Mr. Modi, Mukesh Ambani, and to Micromax, a financially struggling Indian phone maker. The first batch of phones, which each cost the state about 2,500 rupees, or $35, was distributed over the summer.\u201cIt\u2019s not like someone woke up this morning and said, \u2018Oh, this is going to get votes,\u2019\u201d Mr. Menon said. \u201cIt\u2019s nation building.\u201d He said his agency kept a tight leash on user data and had not shared it with anyone.Mr. Menon said a committee of top state officials was appointed earlier this year to choose apps for the phone and decided to load the Singh and Modi political apps along with government apps that help users tap national and state services.The state says that its research shows that customers are using the phones to speak with family members, surf the web and send WhatsApp messages. But about a dozen recipients interviewed last week in Rajnandgaon said they were barely using the phones. They complained of poor battery life, apps that crash, and a tiny monthly allocation of free data \u2014 concerns that also popped up in the state surveys conducted through October. Micromax and Jio said no one was available to answer questions about the program.Ms. Sahu and her fellow cooks at the village school said that rather than spend millions of dollars on phones that do not work, the government should raise their daily wage of 40 rupees, about 56 cents, and give the school a gas stove so they do not have to cook over a smoky wood fire.Standing at the door of the school kitchen clad in a purple sari, Ms. Sahu said that when she got the phone call urging her to vote for the B.J.P., she gave a quick response over the scratchy line: \u201cI told them, \u2018You should raise our income or we will not vote.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Hits the Barrier of Meaning", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMachine learning algorithms don\u2019t yet understand things the way humans do \u2014 with sometimes disastrous consequences. Ms. Mitchell is Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University.You\u2019ve probably heard that we\u2019re in the midst of an A.I. revolution. We\u2019re told that machine intelligence is progressing at an astounding rate, powered by \u201cdeep learning\u201d algorithms that use huge amounts of data to train complicated programs known as \u201cneural networks.\u201d Today\u2019s A.I. programs can recognize faces and transcribe spoken sentences. We have programs that can spot subtle financial fraud, find relevant web pages in response to ambiguous queries, map the best driving route to almost any destination, beat human grandmasters at chess and Go, and translate between hundreds of languages. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve been promised that self-driving cars, automated cancer diagnoses, housecleaning robots and even automated scientific discovery are on the verge of becoming mainstream. The lack of humanlike understanding in machines is underscored by recent cracks that have appeared in the foundations of modern A.I. While today\u2019s programs are much more impressive than the systems we had 20 or 30 years ago, a series of research studies have shown that deep-learning systems can be unreliable in decidedly unhumanlike ways.I\u2019ll give a few examples. \u201cThe bareheaded man needed a hat\u201d is transcribed by my phone\u2019s speech-recognition program as \u201cThe bear headed man needed a hat.\u201d Google Translate renders \u201cI put the pig in the pen\u201d into French as \u201cJe mets le cochon dans le stylo\u201d (mistranslating \u201cpen\u201d in the sense of a writing instrument). These are only a few examples demonstrating that the best A.I. programs can be unreliable when faced with situations that differ, even to a small degree, from what they have been trained on. The errors made by such systems range from harmless and humorous to potentially disastrous: imagine, for example, an airport security system that won\u2019t let you board your flight because your face is confused with that of a criminal, or a self-driving car that, because of unusual lighting conditions, fails to notice that you are about to cross the street.Even more worrisome are recent demonstrations of the vulnerability of A.I. systems to so-called adversarial examples. In these, a malevolent hacker can make specific changes to images, sound waves or text documents that while imperceptible or irrelevant to humans will cause a program to make potentially catastrophic errors. What would be required to surmount this barrier, to give machines the ability to more deeply understand the situations they face, rather than have them rely on shallow features? To find the answer, we need to look to the study of human cognition. A.I. programs that lack common sense and other key aspects of human understanding are increasingly being deployed for real-world applications. While some people are worried about \u201csuperintelligent\u201d A.I., the most dangerous aspect of A.I. systems is that we will trust them too much and give them too much autonomy while not being fully aware of their limitations. As the A.I. researcher Pedro Domingos noted in his book \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d \u201cPeople worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they\u2019re too stupid and they\u2019ve already taken over the world.\u201dMelanie Mitchell is Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

{"Headline": "From Gene Editing to A.I., How Will Technology Transform Humanity?", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "Five big thinkers \u2014 Regina Barzilay, George Church, Jennifer Egan, Catherine Mohr and Siddhartha Mukherjee \u2014 puzzle over the future of the future.\u201cA geneticist, an oncologist, a roboticist, a novelist and an A.I. researcher walk into a bar.\u201d That could be the setup for a very bad joke \u2014 or a tremendously fascinating conversation. Fortunately for us, it was the latter. On a blustery evening in late September, in a private room at a bar near Times Square, the magazine gathered five brilliant scientists and thinkers around a table for a three-hour dinner. In the (edited) transcript below \u2014 moderated by Mark Jannot, a story editor at the magazine and a former editor in chief of Popular Science \u2014 you can see what they had to say about the future of medicine, health care and humanity.But the ones that involve gene editing are on their way, they\u2019re in the pipeline. There\u2019s a lab at Stanford that\u2019s doing gene editing on blood stem cells for sickle-cell disease. Then you can transplant those blood cells and replace the diseased cells, and the sickle-cell disease should be cured. We\u2019ll get comfortable with it, and by comfort I mean not just becoming comfortable with technically how to do it, but realizing it doesn\u2019t all of a sudden cause some horrible cancer, or some terrible disease, which, if you ask me, I think is quite unlikely. But at some point the decision will come down to the F.D.A. and other organizations; they\u2019ll have to say, let\u2019s go forward. Bottom line, our capacity to become more comfortable with the consequences of gene editing will come from diseases where the stakes, as it were, are more simple and higher \u2014 especially with a disease like acute myeloid leukemia, where there\u2019s an extremely high mortality rate \u2014 and then we\u2019ll backtrack our way into reproductive technology.I learned this in a very personal way. When I was 43, I went in for a routine mammogram, and all of a sudden I was diagnosed with breast cancer. This was a big shock because, to the best of my knowledge, nobody in my family had ever been diagnosed with cancer. At every point in my treatment, I had many more questions than my doctors had answers to. I remember I did my mammogram, and they said, \u201cYour cancer is really tiny.\u201d I said \u201cGreat!\u201d Then we went to M.R.I., and suddenly they see cancer all over. Then they did a biopsy, and they discovered it\u2019s actually small; the M.R.I. was a false positive. How can we have this high-resolution M.R.I. modality and still not know that this is a false positive?For me as a computer scientist working in artificial intelligence, it seemed obvious to train a machine to make these kinds of predictions. If you look at what was happening in computer vision, A.I. systems could already identify very subtle distinctions between images, at a level of detail that\u2019s hard for the human eye to differentiate. Why do people need to undergo unnecessary procedures and live with months of uncertainty while the technology that can fully resolve the situation already exists?And this was just one of many steps in the treatment pipeline where I saw how artificial intelligence could transform cancer diagnosis and treatment. As an A.I. researcher, I was stunned to see all these opportunities to help patients squandered. From a patient\u2019s perspective, it felt cruel. We\u2019re talking about well-understood technology commercially deployed in other industries, not brand-new research. And this is a general trend. It doesn\u2019t matter what your disease is; today, A.I. is not yet part of clinical treatment.Ultimately that brought me to two areas. One of them relates to something very basic in clinical research \u2014 extracting relevant information from patients\u2019 electronic records. Even though every hospital sits on a gold mine of data, it\u2019s severely underutilized by care providers and clinical researchers, because the records are mostly in text. Unless they\u2019re specifically trained, machines cannot read these stories; they expect a database where information is properly structured. And so, today, if you as a patient want to know how patients like yourself responded to treatment in your hospital, you can\u2019t find the answer. Even in the most prestigious journals, almost all the studies that use past patient data do that data extraction by hand, which is expensive and slow and dramatically limits the scope of these studies.In my core field of research, natural language processing, we\u2019ve developed lots of tools that can automate this task. And so we applied those tools to create a database of more than 100,000 patients with breast disease from Massachusetts General and other partner hospitals that spans decades. Now with one simple query you can find a cohort of patients with the same disease features and study it over time.Another thing I\u2019m working on relates to reading mammograms. Today the risk models used in clinical practice are very imprecise. Our ability to predict who is going to get cancer is very, very low. Our idea was to let the machine algorithm look for patterns in the raw mammographic image: If it looks at the mammogram, from five years earlier, of a woman who went on to develop cancer, can it detect patterns?We are now thinking of expanding our work to prescreen for lung and pancreatic cancer. Imagine how it can change the game if these diseases, which are now diagnosed late, when they are largely uncurable, could be detected early \u2014 how many lives can be saved. That is the way that A.I. can transform medicine. It will identify patterns far too subtle for humans to identify.In surgery, we\u2019re also starting to use the same sorts of tools that Regina is applying to radiology images and natural language analysis of medical records, but we\u2019re doing it with surgical videos and data from operations, data that we can readily harvest from surgical robots. These are machines that surgeons operate as extensions of themselves, enabling them to perform extremely delicate surgeries, through small incisions, and watch what\u2019s going on inside the patient\u2019s body via a video feed. They can actually see better than if they had cut the patient open. And the machine records every movement made and captures that video of the operation.It is amazing how much a trained human can tell from just looking at a single frame of a surgical procedure. A well-trained surgical resident can walk into an operating room where a surgery is underway, and can glance up and with one look at the screen know what kind of procedure it is, what step you are at in the procedure \u2014 they know what\u2019s going to happen next, and they can tell if it\u2019s going well or not, using clues like if you\u2019ve got a lot of blood in the field, or from looking at the body language of all the people in the operating room. Is the surgeon stressed out? Has the music been turned down? Are people still talking? What are they saying? There\u2019s all kinds of clues.We can use the data in those videos, use machine learning and natural language processing to train an A.I. to be able to pick up on all these same clues and to be able recognize the same things the resident can, and then ideally to be able to help you with what might be the best next step. It would be like providing every surgeon with the perfect surgical resident.To achieve this, it isn\u2019t just recognizing what is in the picture or the sounds; these algorithms need to understand the context, where you are in the procedure, what\u2019s going to happen and what should ordinarily happen next. To do all that, we need to train them on a lot of data, looking at how a thousand different surgeons do exactly that same step, and what best practices are, and maybe clustered into five different styles of doing this particular surgery so you can tell which step to recommend next. The key is that by turning surgery into data, we can now start to use these remarkably powerful machine-learning tools to analyze and learn from these data. But first you need data. We\u2019re lucky with our robots, but in many areas of medicine it is hard to get your hands on the kind of data you need.One implication is that 25, 50, 250 years from now, we become a kind of clinical-trial society in which empirically driven decisions are constantly popping up. But by clinical-trial society, I mean all sorts of questions, because the information net becomes so rich \u2014 and the capacity to understand or deconvolute that information, because of computational power and because of A.I.-dependent algorithms, becomes so rich \u2014 that we begin to subject aspects of human behavior, human selves, that were previously considered outside the realm of assessment to a kind of deeper clinical assessment.Advertisement"}

Help You?", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "Intelligent chatbots could automate away nearly all of our commercial interactions \u2014 for better or for worse.\u201cTwo-thirds of people will never get in front of a clinician,\u201d says Darcy, who talks in an exuberant flow. \u201cAnd that\u2019s in the United States! The rest of the world? More than half the world doesn\u2019t even have access to basic health care. The idea of mental health care is just completely out of reach.\u201dDarcy happened to be a former computer programmer, so she was able to dream up a very unusual solution to this problem: Woebot, a text-chatbot therapist. Working with a team of psychologists and Andrew Ng, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, Darcy wrote a set of conversational prompts that walks users through the practice of C.B.T. In a chipper style, the bot helps users challenge their \u201cdistorted thinking\u201d; it coaxes users to describe their moods more clearly. Since Woebot is just software, it could be made freely available worldwide, and it could, in Silicon Valley terms, \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 or converse with thousands of people simultaneously. It could check in and nudge users with superhuman diligence; it would be available at all hours. \u201cWoebot can be there at 2 a.m. if you\u2019re having a panic attack and no therapist can, or should be, in bed with you,\u201d Darcy says.Woebot does not pretend to be human; it appears as a cartoon robot when it chats with you on Facebook Messenger, and it acknowledges its own artifice (as when it declares, for example, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about how I like to work with humans\u201d). But its personality is otherwise upbeat, its conversations peppered with emoji and animated gifs (like the cheering Minions from \u201cDespicable Me\u201d) to congratulate you for doing psychological work.In a study with 70 young adults, Darcy found that after two weeks of interacting with the bot, the test subjects had lower incidences of depression and anxiety. They were impressed, and even touched, by the software\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cWoebot felt like a real person that showed concern,\u201d one of them told Darcy\u2019s team. Last spring, when Darcy put Woebot online, free to all, its use immediately exploded; in the first week, more than 50,000 people talked to it. (\u201cDo you realize,\u201d Ng told Darcy, \u201cthat Woebot spoke to more people today than a human therapist could in a lifetime?\u201d) Nowadays, Woebot exchanges between one and two million messages a week with users, ranging from divorc\u00e9es to the bereaved to young men, a population that rarely seeks treatment. Many tell Darcy that it\u2019s easier to talk to a bot than a human; they don\u2019t feel judged.Darcy argues this is a glimpse of our rapidly arriving future, where talking software is increasingly able to help us manage our emotions. There will be A.I.s that detect our feelings, possibly better than we can. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see robots for weight loss, and robots for being more effective communicators,\u201d she says. It may feel odd at first; indeed, when people email her to say Woebot helped them feel better, nearly every one begins the note by sheepishly explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this would be helpful.\u201d But there\u2019s something about talking to software that is powerful, they discover, when it responds and seems alive.\u201cIt\u2019s conversation,\u201d Darcy says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been conversing for, what is it, 200,000 years?\u201dThe rise of \u201cconversational agents\u201d is the next great shift in computer interfaces \u2014 one arguably as significant as the \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d interface that emerged in the \u201980s. Before the Apple Macintosh, the first computer to popularize point-and-click, people using home computers had to familiarize themselves with abstruse text commands. The advent of the visual interface opened up computing to the masses, producing a generation fluent in word processing, email and, eventually, web surfing. The next great shift, the mobile phone, put computing \u2014 and nonstop internet access \u2014 into our pockets, and unleashed a tsunami of social media. These sorts of changes don\u2019t come along very often, and when they do, they create new and unexpected behaviors.Talking software gives us computers that not only ride along with us but also socialize with us. Being humanlike \u2014 saying \u201chi,\u201d telling self-deprecating jokes \u2014 is their interface metaphor, much as the first point-and-click computers used the trappings of office life (a wastepaper basket, a tiny pad of paper) to help orient us to the screen. Meaghan Keaney Anderson, a vice president of HubSpot, a marketing and sales software firm, has seen firsthand how voice commands have become second nature in her household, particularly for the next generation: \u201cMy daughter is 22 months old now. At 9 months she said her first word, which was the dog\u2019s name, and then at 13 months she learned to walk, and then by 15 months she started giving Alexa commands.\u201d She added: \u201cI think my daughter is growing up in a world where you just speak what you want into the universe and it provides.\u201dFor years, A.I. programmers fixated on passing the Turing Test \u2014 the famous challenge floated by Alan Turing in 1950 to produce a machine that can fool a human into thinking it is also human. Sci-fi has made dystopic hay of this in movies like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cEx Machina.\u201d But the world that\u2019s emerging is simultaneously more mundane and stranger. None of this software is trying to fool us. Bots like Siri or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are, like Woebot, openly artificial, even proudly so. (When I asked Alexa \u201cAre you alive?\u201d it responded: \u201cArtificially, maybe, but not in the same way that you\u2019re alive.\u201d) We are thus heading into a post-Turing world, one in which we\u2019ll banter all day to software, always aware that it is software.Emma Coats, the \u201ccharacter lead\u201d for Google Assistant, describes the emotional affect of her company\u2019s artificial life form as \u201ca friendly companion that is trustworthy.\u201d She and her team strenuously avoided giving the Assistant even a hint of snark. \u201cYou\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to ask a stupid question if it\u2019s going to give me a hard time about it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Coats says. Some of their personality writers have backgrounds in improv. Coats herself worked at Pixar on the animated film \u201cBrave.\u201d \u201cPixar is all about finding an emotional reality in a car or a fish,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that\u2019s something we\u2019ve really used with the Assistant. We don\u2019t want it to ever be a human being, right? That\u2019s not what it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean that A.I. or software can\u2019t have a perspective on the world.\u201dAs a literary endeavor, the field of bot creation is booming. The bots need to be equipped to answer the wide variety of weird, playful queries that people lob at them, which requires lots of writers. Coats and her co-workers have found that people like to simply shoot the breeze with their devices \u2014 probing their personalities, searching for the puppet strings. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you fart?\u2019 is always a popular question,\u201d Coats says dryly.There\u2019s another reason botmakers are embracing a post-Turing mind-set: They\u2019ve realized that the public tends to feel wounded when someone (or something) tries to fool them. This spring, Google gave a demonstration of Duplex, a new voice-chat A.I. When Duplex called a hair salon to book an appointment, it sounded so human \u2014 it even said \u201cum\u201d a few times \u2014 that the salon receptionist apparently never realized it was A.I. The reaction online was harsh. \u201cPeople value authenticity,\u201d says Kate Darling, a researcher who studies the ethics of robotics at M.I.T. \u201cIt matters a lot. It matters hugely.\u201dThis is how computers have always made themselves at home: by offering improved efficiency, vanquishing dull tasks. At TD Bank, coders are building experimental bots \u2014 using tech created by the A.I. firm Kasisto \u2014 to encourage customers to probe their financial life. Rizwan Khalfan, the company\u2019s chief digital and payments officer, told me he imagines customers asking a bot something like, \u201cO.K., tell me about my expenses last weekend.\u201d A question this specific isn\u2019t easy to answer on a website, where the customer might need to hunt through a database. But, Khalfan hopes, a person could one day ask this bot conversationally: \u201cI want to go out to the theater this weekend. Can I actually afford it?\u201dThere are some things audio can\u2019t handle as effectively as screens \u2014 long lists of data, for instance. But in a world where people worry that they\u2019re staring at their phones too much, chat might offer a respite. In \u201cHer,\u201d the voice assistants murmur in people\u2019s ears as they move through the world, functioning as something like E.S.P. The chatbot designer Emily Withrow, who is the director of the Quartz Bot Studio, imagines conversational A.I. working that way soon. \u201cYou turn on N.P.R. midinterview, but you can\u2019t for the life of you figure out who Terry Gross is talking to. You could say out loud: \u2018Who\u2019s she talking to? Who is it? What book are they talking about?\u2019 You can extend it to even seeing someone at a dinner party and saying privately, \u2018Remind me what Jill\u2019s husband\u2019s name is.\u2019\u2009\u201d The elderly might find these efficiencies particularly appealing, because aging eyes and reduced mobility can make screens harder to use. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease might find A.I. voice assistants happy to endlessly answer repeated questions, in a way that few human attendants could.There\u2019s another allure for businesses, of course: Talking bots don\u2019t need to be hired and then paid. Once coded, your bot can handle millions of customers simultaneously. We\u2019re already seeing this in customer service, when text chatbots answer rote questions or take orders. Yamato Transport, one of Japan\u2019s largest courier firms, uses a chatbot to schedule deliveries and answer questions about where packages are. Domino\u2019s Pizza runs a chatbot to take delivery orders online. American Eagle Outfitters has a bot that customers can converse with to figure out the perfect gift to buy for someone.Conversational bots thus could bring on a new wave of unemployment \u2014 or \u201creadjustment,\u201d to use the bloodless term of economics. Service workers, sales agents, telemarketers \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to imagine how millions of jobs that require social interaction, whether on the phone or online, could eventually be eliminated by code. Some economists argue that this might not necessarily result in a net loss of jobs, pointing to the example of automatic-teller machines. When A.T.M.s took off in the \u201980s, many predicted that bank-teller jobs would be decimated; indeed, individual bank branches did begin employing fewer tellers. But with those savings in pocket, banks greatly expanded the overall number of branches, so that the total population of tellers nationally rose for years. Of course, as economic history shows, the profits of automation are seldom shared with workers. Even if individual humans keep their jobs, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be paid more. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d TD Bank\u2019s Khalfan told me, before adding that the company has committed to retrain workers when their jobs become redundant.Whatever impact talking software has on the labor market, it will surely extend the reach of algorithms more deeply into our lives. Ask Alexa or Siri a question, and you don\u2019t get a page of search results; just one Solomonic answer, selected by the A.I. After all, this is how spoken communication works: Just as nobody wants to listen to a voice mail message, nobody wants to hear a chatbot recite three minutes of data. Algorithms must narrow the field. So for anyone who has watched the inscrutable algorithms of Facebook or YouTube narrow our feeds by \u201crecommending\u201d outr\u00e9 conspiracy theorists, the notion of A.I. finding a new toehold in our cognitive life can be disturbing.\u201cI will literally buy whatever option Alexa puts first for me for paper towels,\u201d Keaney Anderson, the HubSpot V.P., told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to search through a million of them. I ask her for paper towels, she delivers. And that may be fine for paper towels, but is it fine for music? Is it fine for news sources?\u201d Talking to bots will also mean new opportunities for tech firms to collect data on what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re doing, all day long. That includes our feelings: Researchers are working on \u201caffective\u201d sensing that enables chatbots to recognize our emotions. These are the familiar trade-offs that tech exacts in return for convenience; they\u2019re never value-free, as Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, notes. \u201cWhere are these things now appearing? They\u2019re appearing in our homes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe home has traditionally been the locus of privacy, right? This is where I shut out the rest of the world. This is where I look for my breathing room. This is my sanctuary, you know?\u201dIndeed, the home is where life happens, and that includes its traumas. Those have sometimes caught the large A.I. botmakers \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 off guard. They expected their bots to be asked for jokes; they didn\u2019t, apparently, expect so many different cries for help. In 2016, a study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that, though most popular voice assistants responded to suicidal thoughts by providing help lines and other appropriate resources, when they were told \u201cI am being abused\u201d or \u201cI was raped,\u201d they generally replied with some variant of \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Human conversation being what it is, the list of personal crises one might confide is massive, likely outpacing the ability of botmakers to keep up.One person who bought a Jibo was Erin Partridge, an art therapist in Alameda, Calif., who works with the elderly. When she took Jibo on visits, her patients loved it. They laughed at its jokes; they asked it to sing tunes from the past. One man with advanced dementia called his daughter to describe Jibo in great detail. She found this remarkable, because he could rarely remember any single event so well and rarely initiated calls. Somehow Jibo had made an impression on him. Another resident declared that she \u201cloved\u201d Jibo, and put her arms around the robot. \u201cJust talk to me, don\u2019t talk to anybody else,\u201d she\u2019d tell it, asking, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201dTalking bots connect to us in ways that point-and-click software doesn\u2019t. For some technology critics, including Sherry Turkle, who does research on the psychology of tech at M.I.T., this raises ethical concerns. \u201cPeople are hard-wired with sort of Darwinian vulnerabilities, Darwinian buttons,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd these Darwinian buttons are pushed by this technology.\u201d That is, programmers are manipulating our emotions when they create objects that inquire after our needs.The precursor to today\u2019s bots, Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s ELIZA, was created at M.I.T. in 1966. ELIZA was a pretty crude set of prompts, but by simply asking people about their feelings, it drew them into deep conversations. Ordinary household appliances can now pull off the same trick. \u201cYour fridge will know if you\u2019re eating H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and if you sound sad, it\u2019ll say, \u2018Sherry, what\u2019s really going on?\u2019\u2009\u201d Turkle says. \u201cIs that what we want?\u201dWorse, she argues, talking bots could become a social crutch. Rather than pay humans to help the poor and powerless \u2014 students in overcrowded schools, elders in understaffed facilities, customers looking to speak to someone in huge institutions \u2014 we might instead provide software that pretends to care. \u201cThese places are so deprived that it\u2019s easy to argue that putting in some robots is better than nothing,\u201d Turkle says. \u201cThe harder thing is offering actual human support.\u201dA future in which only the wealthy have the luxury of being attended to by actual humans, while everyone else makes do with bots, would certainly be a dystopia. But botmakers themselves \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 are more sanguine. Cynthia Breazeal thinks the coming A.I. wave will actually help level the playing field between the well-off and everyone else. \u201cThe social-justice angle of this wave,\u201d she says, \u201cis that everyone will be able to afford a fabulous personal tutor because it\u2019s an A.I. tutor.\u201d Bots that help the elderly control their home and their lives will let them \u201cage in place\u201d at their own house, something that most older Americans would far prefer to a retirement home. \u201cWhen we talk to assisted-living facilities, they will tell us point blank, there is no way we can build enough facilities and hire enough people to meet the demand,\u201d Breazeal adds. \u201cThey call it the \u2018Silver Tsunami.\u2019\u2009\u201dPerhaps interacting with A.I.s will mean atrophy for our social muscles. If they\u2019re just machines, why bother with pleasantries? The scientific research on that is still unclear: Some studies have found people can actually be remarkably cordial to robots, while other research suggests we\u2019re liable to be rude and curt when we know our conversational partner isn\u2019t human. We could get used to bossing things around, a behavior that could bleed into everyday life. (Amazon, after fielding precisely these concerns from parents, created a politeness mode for its Echo devices that gently reminds its users to say \u201cplease.\u201d)Yet dealing with bots could also make life less prickly for humans on all sides of these small interactions. After all, today\u2019s customer-service calls are pretty bleak, even when you do talk to a live person. Call tech support for your laptop, and odds are you\u2019ll be talking to an employee who\u2019s required to read only from scripts \u2014 a human who is thus, paradoxically, forced to behave exactly like a bot.\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d says Steve Worswick, who worked for years providing I.T. support, talking people through problems like \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten my password.\u201d To keep himself engaged, in the evenings he taught himself to create bots, using an online tool made by an A.I. company called Pandorabots. Over 13 years, he coded a bot called Mitsuku, and wrote fully 350,000 lines for it; Mitsuku has won the annual Loebner Prize competition for the most \u201chumanlike\u201d bot four times.Soon enough Worswick had a new job: In 2018, he was hired by Pandorabots. Now Worswick, as a senior A.I. developer, imagines a world where the bots take over the spirit-crushing sort of conversational work that he used to do, releasing human beings to do something better with their time. Let the bots fix people\u2019s passwords. Real people, he says, have more interesting questions to answer.Clive Thompson is a contributing writer. His book \u201cCoders: The Making of a New Art and the Remaking of the World\u201d will be published in March.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Fake Australian Accent Is Terrible, Mate", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans and the British love to mock how we talk. But they can\u2019t imitate it. Contributing Opinion WriterSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Running out of gas is one of the most foolish things you can do, but I was guilty of it several times when I was a lean-living university student. That changed, though, when Hugh Jackman was hired as the attendant at my local gas station. He was older than me, clean-cut and hot, an improbably nice star of local high school musicals who was known to date unassuming women. I tried not to stumble over my feet \u2014 or, say, into his arms \u2014 as he greeted me with a big grin when my Volkswagen Beetle sputtered in: \u201cJules!\u201dThat year, I never ran out of gas.Today, Mr. Jackman, the star of films like \u201cWolverine\u201d and \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d is widely adored in Australia, even by those who never saw him behind a cash register. He holds a special place in Australian hearts because international success has not made him pretentious. Most crucially, his accent is still intact.Australians have a strong, often irrational suspicion of people who leave the country, succeed and change. Even Paul Hogan, the comedian and actor who played that most iconic Australian caricature, Crocodile Dundee, belied his working-class image after he found global stardom and dumped his wife for his more glamorous \u2014 and American \u2014 co-star. Occasional grumbling is heard about the model Elle Macpherson or the singer Kylie Minogue, both of whom have acquired \u201cglobal\u201d accents.By shifting accents, Australian expatriates are seen to be shifting class and status, indicating a sense of superiority to those who remain in Australia. The quickly acquired faux-British accent in particular has been associated with pretension, or a snootiness that reveals desperation to cover a humble antipodean past, to disown a sunburned, bikini-clad family. Part of our fight against a long-held cultural cringe has been the insistence that we do not need to erase our accents to, say, host a TV show or radio program.But given that it is so hard to mimic, perhaps we should be proud of its uniqueness.What Americans \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, the British \u2014 fail to recognize is that as much as they mock us, they are almost constitutionally incapable of imitating the Australian accent, no matter how often they repeat \u201cG\u2019day, mate!\u201d Even the great Meryl Streep failed to capture it when she portrayed Lindy Chamberlain in the 1988 movie \u201cEvil Angels,\u201d about a woman whose baby is killed in the Australian outback. The line remains famous for its melodrama \u2014 \u201cThe dingo\u2019s got my bay-bee!\u201d \u2014 but in Australia it\u2019s also famous as a reminder that even Hollywood\u2019s greatest stars cannot master our way of speaking.But the people best placed to mock Australian accents are Australians. Self-parody is a national sport. On Twitter, we lampoon our country by calling it #Straya. We shorten \u201cGood on you\u201d to \u201conya\u201d and we stretch out the greeting \u201cmate\u201d to \u201cmaaaaaaaate,\u201d the length depending on the depth of affection and time of day. These kinds of joyous subtleties are lost on outsiders, though. And that\u2019s what American television and movie producers need to understand. Next time, hire Australian actors to do Australian accents. Like, say, my mate Wolverine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tungrus and the Chicken From Hell ", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsA cautionary tale about the epic power struggle between humans and poultry.Rishi Chandna is a filmmaker. Mumbai, India, where I live, is a constant clash of contradictions. You have elders who grew up in villages living with their cosmopolitan children, villagers who have moved to work in the city, and city folk who crave rustic weekend getaways. Different perspectives collide and breed tension, even within households. In this cross section of humanity, few things are considered too bizarre to be off limits, and the mundane parts of daily life can intersect with the insane.Case in point: A friend told me about her colleague, whose family was living with a rooster as their pet in a tiny apartment in the heart of the city. Even by Mumbai standards, it seemed absurd. I had to find out more.I grew up in a city, in a meat-eating family, where we ate chicken at least three times a week. For us, chickens were food. But for the family I profile in this documentary, it was more complicated. The father grew up in a village where they raised the chickens they slaughtered and ate, and his children grew up more like me. Each of their unflinching pragmatism toward their new roommate drew me in. Who would have thought that the chicken, a staple food for the millions of households and restaurants in a country of a billion people, could become an agonizing inconvenience for an ordinary family in this city. And yet, problematic as his presence was, he became part of their household, as a pet.This is less a story about a chicken than it is about the people around him, because we use animals as reflections of human consciousness. We see that play out in this film; through their pet chicken, each family member must probe the nature of affection, loyalty and even the ethics of eating another creature. When it comes to animals, where do we draw the line between food and family? Can you eat your own pet? The answer is more complicated than we might think. Rishi Chandna is a Mumbai-based filmmaker. This is his first independent short film.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alas, the Blockchain Won\u2019t Save Journalism After All", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHype around the technology has led to incomprehensible applications of it.Civil Media Company was introduced earlier this year as both a media platform and a network, to be owned and operated by journalists and concerned citizens in tandem. It was an exciting proposal. Its technology (powered by the blockchain!) would churn under dozens of independent newsrooms, its machinery creating a new, utopian model, free from the clutches of miserly businessmen or politically compromised publishers threatening to gum up the works.Civil\u2019s representatives said they could help fix two crises that afflict the media: one of trust and another of financial sustainability. Both, they posited, were within the power of the blockchain to heal.\u201cDo we think that by launching Civil, somebody that thinks that the press is the enemy of the people, are those people suddenly going to go, \u2018Oh, I see the light\u2019? Of course not,\u201d Ms. Schiller said before the token sale began. \u201cBut here\u2019s what we can do: If Civil is successful, it will allow people who are interested in trustworthy journalism, it will be a signal to them for what news organizations meet the criteria.\u201dSo it would be like Facebook, but journalism, but on the blockchain?\u201cAll cryptoeconomic public blockchains are effectively social applications,\u201d Mr. Iles said. \u201cYou need a crowd of people to agree to run it.\u201dWait. What?People who are in a strong position to understand what Civil is doing \u2014 either because they are experts on blockchain technology or because they work for one of its newsrooms \u2014 have openly admitted that they don\u2019t understand how the organization works. The rate of such statements only increased as Civil\u2019s token sale got underway in September.The collective confusion might have something to do with how the Civil token (called a CVL) is meant to work. In essence, that means: Buying CVL isn\u2019t meant to make you money.Or, as Mr. Iles put it: \u201cWe even think that we are going to be able to show people that it\u2019s more fun, it\u2019s more rewarding, to pay for the news using CVL tokens as opposed to cash.\u201d\u201cLook, we sometimes get asked, are we too early?\u201d Mr. Iles said. \u201cAnd the answer is absolutely yes.

It just means we potentially overshot now.\u201dIt is still unclear how Civil plans to alleviate people\u2019s confusion in order to achieve its mission. But the company is retrenching, thanks to an additional $3.5 million in funding from its original investor, the blockchain software company ConsenSys. (Civil will also offer refunds to frustrated individuals who want to return their tokens.) A new token sale is in the works, though details have not yet been released.Still, a problem remains: People don\u2019t buy into blockchain applications unless they can make money. There is no evidence that people want to use it to \u201cfix\u201d journalism. There is also no evidence that anyone really understands how that would even work. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rock-Your-World Moments Fill New Music Memoirs From Tina Turner and a Disillusioned Hit Maker", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionPart of the problem is that people have short memories. That may be why Turner has written a second memoir 32 years after the bombshell revelations of \u201cI, Tina.\u201d Ostensibly, \u201cMy Love Story\u201d is occasioned by recent events in the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll icon\u2019s life: her 2013 marriage to her longtime partner Erwin Bach, and her subsequent health problems, including kidney failure and cancer. But more than a third of this book is about the first 27 years of her life, from the time Anna Mae Bullock was born in a hospital near her hometown, Nutbush, Tenn., through her transformation into the soul dynamo Tina Turner, to the day that she finally had the strength to leave her husband, Ike Turner.One question goes unanswered in both of Turner\u2019s books. Many people must have known what was happening between Ike and Tina, who frequently had black eyes and visible bruises. Did no one intervene? Why did record labels, promoters and performers tolerate seeing a talent clearly and repeatedly abused? Were they all like the pinball wizard in \u201cTommy\u201d \u2014 the rock opera in which Turner portrayed the Acid Queen \u2014 deaf, dumb and blind?\u201cAnything for a Hit: An A&R Woman\u2019s Story of Surviving the Music Industry\u201d goes a long way toward explaining the culture of misogyny that, at best, looked the other way as women were mistreated and, at worst, cultivated abuse. Dorothy Carvello worked for pretty much all the major labels beginning with Atlantic in 1987, and her experiences range from sad to horrific. She got her start as a secretary for the Atlantic co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, an industry legend. It was a seemingly great opportunity that she basically never got over. In Carvello\u2019s telling, Ertegun was a sex fiend and coke addict who tried to grope her on a couple of occasions and at one point fractured her arm. Of course, like any skilled predator, he could also be charming and hilarious. They remained friends until his death in 2006.Carvello doesn\u2019t throw herself a pity party; instead, \u201cAnything for a Hit\u201d is an indictment of a sleazy and corrupt industry. It\u2019s not news that sex and drugs went hand in hand with rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, but what this book reveals is how damaging the power dynamics of that party atmosphere could be even for a woman who was willing to play along. Carvello names names fearlessly, taking aim at some of the biggest men in the business, showing us where the (naked) bodies are buried.One thing missing from this memoir, which could provide some light in all the darkness and strengthen our trust in the narrator, is music. Carvello never shows any sense of wonder at hearing a great song or discovering a beautiful voice. Her greatest claim to fame as a woman who has spent most of her career scouting talent is bringing the hair metal band Skid Row to Atlantic. O.K., that and her affair with the INXS singer Michael Hutchence. Having good ears is essential to A&R; Carvello\u2019s book convinces me she has good eyes.Evelyn McDonnell edited \u201cWomen Who Rock: Bessie to Beyonc\u00e9, Girl Groups to Riot Grrrl,\u201d which was published in October, and edits the Music Matters series of books.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Up the Spontaneity Quotient on Your Next Trip ", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPredictable vacations are so, well, predictable. Here are five tips on how to increase your chances of unexpected encounters and surprising moments. Nothing against relaxing on beachfront daybeds or doing the cathedral-monument-museum circuit, but for travelers like me (and, I\u2019m guessing, like some of you) the ideal vacation is one that combines relaxation and sightseeing with unexpected finds down narrow streets, lively conversations with surprising locals and wrong exits leading to hidden treasures.Alas, such experiences are not sold online. It takes good fortune to stumble across the Montana farm stand with the juiciest peaches imaginable, a Swedish farmer who invites you to his Beatles-loving friend\u2019s home for music and whiskey, or the Albanian seaside restaurant owner who dares you to come back at 6 a.m. to fish for the next day\u2019s catch.Those are my serendipity-aided stories and you can\u2019t have them, but it\u2019s easy enough to create your own. Serendipity is essentially a synonym for good luck, but it\u2019s hardly random. \u201cThe harder you work, the luckier you get,\u201d golfers like to say. Good news for globe-trotters: No need to put in hours at the tourism range to lower your travel handicap. A few largely effortless adjustments can up your serendipity game.You can\u2019t force a local to chat, as I\u2019ve found out on many an uncomfortable bus ride. But you can stack the odds in your favor by visiting countries, regions or cities where you don\u2019t have to. My top travel axiom: The fewer visitors a place gets, the more eager locals are to talk with them. To put it another way, you\u2019re unlikely to befriend a Parisian who lives a block from the Eiffel Tower. (Unless he\u2019s got skin in the tourism game: souvenir sellers worldwide are more than happy to be chummy.)Where crowds are sparse, or at least not Venice-level oppressive, locals are often just as curious about visitors as visitors are of them. So wherever you\u2019re itching to go, consider alternatives that may not be as flashy, but have just as much to offer, minus the crowds. Sardinia over Tuscany; Ku\u00e9lap, Peru, over Machu Picchu; Algeria over Morocco.You can apply the same principle within a popular destination. As a New Yorker, I instinctively flee from sidewalk-clogging clumps of tourists in Midtown Manhattan. But across the East River in my culinarily blessed neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, it\u2019s a different story. When I recently spotted a youth group from the Midwest gawking at the South Asian shops and food stands on 74th Street, I practically pounced on them. Where are you all from? Why are you here? Where are you going next? How may I help?Planning is crucial, I agree. But a tightly scheduled day does not preclude spontaneity. Consider your itinerary a rough draft, ready for modification if something piques your interest. I once abandoned a day trip to the Turkish city of Sanliurfa when I realized I was driving through pistachio orchards to get there and decided to turn off the highway and spend the day in a village seeking a farm tour. It worked.You hardly need to risk a day, though. Imagine you\u2019re off to lunch at a fancy place that got raves in your guidebook when, on the way there, you pass a spot humming with locals. Time to ditch your plans. Even if the chef at the new place is not Michelin-starred (or perhaps not even a chef), sometimes a simple meal you don\u2019t know is coming is better than a fancy meal for which you have sky-high expectations.Another strategy: For every five days of your trip, set aside one for planned spontaneity. In the city? Bury your phone in your backpack and explore a neighborhood blind or with a paper map, asking for advice along the way. In the country? Take a drive down a local road and stop whenever you see something interesting: a high school baseball game, a yak farm, a bait shop. (Don\u2019t fish? Then ask for directions.)To give some structure to your adventuring, come up with a nonserious goal that will add an element of fun and nudge you off the tourist trail. Make it your mission to find the best bookstore in town, try every brand of local candy or search for the weirdest ice cream flavors. In England, declare that by the end of your trip everyone in the group must choose a Premiere League soccer team to root for when you get home. Locals will surely lobby for their club. In northeast Portugal I vowed to learn a few words of the local language, Mirandese. People were delighted to teach me \u2014 though, I imagine, not nearly so much as the English would be to talk about why their football team is superior. Sometimes an opportunity for a detour or a change of plans will arise that you (or your travel companions) might think is silly or a little nerve-racking.Despite what you learned as a kid, \u201cyes\u201d is also the answer to: Should you talk to strangers? (At least when culturally appropriate.) I sometimes like to set a goal \u2014 to talk to five random people a day, for example. Then I ask any dumb question that comes to mind. At a restaurant in Naples, I asked the Italian family at the table next to mine how their fritti misti appetizer was. They gave me the rest of the plate. I asked a fellow customer in a South Dakota gas station if there was any difference between the pot of coffee she was pouring and the one she wasn\u2019t. It was fresher, she said. I doubt it was, and didn\u2019t care anyway, but she turned out to be a fun Estonian exchange student with great stories of her journeys across America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Are Revealing the Sum of All Risks ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s not a main reason for the sell-off, but a widening sense of unease that several types of problems are rising at once. The most telling thing about the pummeling that the stock market has taken recently, and especially this week, is that there\u2019s no simple single cause to point to.That reflects the fundamental economic risk for 2019 and beyond. There isn\u2019t a lone caution on the horizon that can be identified and monitored and that policymakers can respond to.Rather, markets reflect a widening sense of unease that several different types of risks are rising at once \u2014 and that although any one of them might be manageable, together they could lead the economy into serious trouble in 2019 or 2020.And while stocks are down 9.5 percent since early October, the yield on longer-term Treasury bonds is at about the same level. The bond market tends to be more closely tethered to the direction of the overall economy than stocks, so that suggests investors in recent weeks have not radically reshaped their view on future growth.But when you tick through the list of fears causing the sell-off, it\u2019s easy to see why stock investors in particular are getting jittery, driving steep market drops Monday and Tuesday.The giant tech companies that have propelled the market for years are facing risks of slowing growth (especially Apple) and new regulation (especially Facebook). Oil prices are plummeting, sending the share prices of energy companies downward. Investors are starting to worry that companies with heavy debt loads could struggle to handle them, with General Electric as Exhibit A. The trade war, long at a steady simmer, could boil over at any time.But before running for the hills in panic, there are a few things worth considering. First, bad things happen all the time in the economy, and in markets. Usually, the damage is localized to the industries directly affected.Bondholders and credit ratings agencies lost confidence in those industrial icons\u2019 corporate debt, causing plenty of pain for the automakers\u2019 employees and stock prices. But the overall economy kept humming along. (It was a recession rooted in other sectors, three years later, that dragged American automakers toward bankruptcy.)Similarly, it\u2019s easy to look at the slowdown in home sales and building activity, for example, and fear that it could lead to a repeat of the 2008 recession.But in that episode, housing starts peaked in January 2006. For nearly two years, the economy largely held up; as housing contracted, other sectors grew. It was only after the housing downturn triggered a financial crisis that a recession began in December 2007.In terms of a slowing global economy, in 1998 an emerging markets crisis seemed to endanger a booming American economy enough that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates late that year to try to guard against damage. As it turned out, 1999 was a boom year.What these episodes all show is that adjustments \u2014 whether in the credit markets, the housing market or emerging markets \u2014 tend to cause huge economic disruption only if there are compounding factors, or inadequate policy responses.The implicit message: If all of these negative forces really do start to harm growth, the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases, rather than stick to some preordained path.The great fear for the economy in the next couple of years shouldn\u2019t be the risks we know about. It is that those risks will materialize and interact in unpredictable ways, and together cause damage that none of them alone could. And if that happens, the last few weeks will look like a crucial moment when it began.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Remember Reconstruction", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe drama of the era happened all across the country. But Americans walk past momentous places and never recognize their role in our history during the period after the Civil War. Dr. Downs and Dr. Masur are the authors of the National Historical Landmark Theme Study on Reconstruction.Many contemporary controversies over issues like voting rights and the scope of the government have their origins in the period following the Civil War. That era, known as Reconstruction, is one of the most contentious in this nation\u2019s history, and also one of the most misunderstood. Reconstruction started in the early days of the Civil War. As United States forces entered the South, enslaved African Americans immediately pressed for freedom. They escaped to Union lines, demanded pay for their work, petitioned for their rights and served the Union war effort as laborers and soldiers. Some four million African Americans built new lives in freedom during the postwar Reconstruction era \u2014 reuniting families separated by slavery, building churches, founding schools and serving in government. Yet many white Americans refused to accept the reforms. Southern Democrats opposed racial equality and used violence, intimidation and fraud to strip African Americans of their newfound constitutional rights. They organized groups like the Ku Klux Klan and unleashed a reign of terror to keep blacks away from the ballot box. They also passed seemingly race-neutral laws that depressed black voter turnout through literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses and new registration systems.For decades, historians and figures in popular culture erased or distorted Reconstruction, representing the period as an unmitigated failure while celebrating the establishment of professed white supremacy regimes in Southern states. The film \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d is perhaps most notorious for doing this, but textbooks also twisted the story, making the era\u2019s democratic experiments appear misguided and even tragic. Now, the period is often ignored or misrepresented in school curricula.The National Park Service, which manages historic sites and interprets history all over the country, can address this. It is the steward of dozens of parks that commemorate the Civil War era, yet its only unit dedicated to Reconstruction was created two years ago, when President Obama established the Reconstruction Era National Monument in Beaufort, S.C. The bill would turn this site into a national park, helping it attract visitors and contributing to its permanence and accessibility.More significantly, the bill expands the nation\u2019s sense of where it can learn this history. It would establish the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network, based on similar networks Congress has created for the Civil Rights Movement and the Underground Railroad. These networks foster collaboration within national parks and allow the agency to work with state and local governments and private parties interested in commemorating and interpreting American history. The drama of Reconstruction happened on farms and plantations across the South, where freedwomen and freedmen began working for wages or shares of the crops; in hamlets and crossroads where African American men voted for the first time; in State Capitol buildings, where legislatures met to remake state constitutions; and in cities where African Americans demanded equal access to streetcars and theaters. Across the country, Americans debated the future of their communities and the country as a whole.Today, Americans walk past places where such events took place and never recognize how much of the nation\u2019s history was formed during Reconstruction. The Reconstruction Era National Historic Network promises to reveal historical connections across the nation and to help Americans comprehend a history that is both inspiring and chastening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visitors From the Ocean\u2019s Twilight Zone", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "Researchers recently hauled up specimens from a layer of the world\u2019s seas that contains an abundance of aquatic life.Supported byRecent evidence suggests there are more animals here by weight than in all of the world\u2019s fisheries combined. But who lives here, and in what quantities?Since August, a group of scientists has been using new technology to better understand the twilight zone\u2019s strange inhabitants. They hope their findings will lead to a more sustainable approach before the fishing industry tries to harvest some of its abundant life as fisheries closer to the surface are diminished.Below are highlights of what they hauled up on their first cruise.Each animal in the ocean has its own auditory signature that ships usually detect by sending out sound waves that bounce or scatter off their bodies. It\u2019s how whale watching cruises often find humpbacks for you to view.\u201cSome of them look like crazy monsters,\u201d Dr. Sosik said \u2014 like the glowing, elongated one above.But she pointed out that, \u201cmost of the animals that live in the twilight zone are really small.\u201dThis size adaptation is key here where food is scarce, because small things don\u2019t need as much of it.This fang-toothed monster, the Sloane\u2019s viperfish (Chauliodus sloani), could fit inside your hand.It has one of the biggest teeth-to-body-size ratios in the animal kingdom. Its teeth are too large for its mouth to accommodate, so it just closes them like a cage, imprisoning its prey before it eats.\u201cThese fish might not see prey for a few days, and when they see something, they don\u2019t want to lose it,\u201d he said.The belly of a hatchetfish contains light organs or photophores. Many animals down here make their own light through a chemical reaction inside photophores of various shapes, sizes and arrangements.By turning on these lights and regulating their intensity, hatchet fish blend in with light flowing down from the surface, becoming invisible to predators looking up for silhouettes from below.This hiding technique, called counter-illumination, is the most common use of bioluminescence in the twilight zone.Animals like the hatchetfish also use their bodies as mirrors to hide, or even make themselves transparent.For sensing a dimly-lit environment, animals like this lantern fish may turn their eyes into giant lenses for low light.Or like the common fangtooth, below on the right, they opt for other senses.\u201cIt relies on kind of just bumping into things in the middle of the night,\u201d Dr. Caiger said.That ridge along its body\u2019s length has pressure sensors that can detect objects, current or animals moving in the water a few body lengths away. Up close, a mucus coating enhances the fish\u2019s ability to detect chemicals around it.Instead of squirting ink to escape predators, the fist-size glass squid above on the left hides in plain sight, pulling its tentacles and head inside its spike-covered body cavity. Then it fills this squid orb with its own ink, becoming \u201can unpalatable, turgid ball,\u201d Dr. Caiger said.When the Navy started using active acoustics to monitor the sea in the 1930s, they noticed lots of sound bouncing off a layer they thought was the bottom. But its depth changed from night to day.This \u201cfalse bottom\u201d turned out to be a traveling mass of animals that journey hundreds to thousands of feet from the depths to the surface each night in a living wave that wraps around the planet.During the day, surface dwellers like sharks, tunas and swordfish dive down to to the depths to eat, recent evidence has found.\u201cThe layers are not distinct. They\u2019re very highly interconnected, and the organisms that live in one layer are influenced by the organisms that live in another,\u201d Dr. Sosik said.Scientists working to untangle this multilayered food chain think it may play a major role in regulating climate by keeping carbon in the ocean. And that\u2019s part of why it\u2019s so important to study these watery depths that we ordinarily cannot see.\u201cIf you imagined erasing the life in the twilight zone, it wouldn\u2019t affect just that layer. It would affect the ocean and the whole planet,\u201d Dr. Sosik said. \u201cIt\u2019s also just amazingly interesting, and you can\u2019t look away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After that I thought, there\u2019s no point in worrying about it, I\u2019m going to have to go act, and I\u2019m going to have to act in a nontraditional way. Posting a job description and hoping people are going to show up and apply to the job wasn\u2019t working because the people just didn\u2019t exist. So rather than trying to hire the skills and knowing they\u2019re not as easily available, let\u2019s create the skills internally.\u201dShe created a system open to hiring people who have little or no experience, and, in many cases, even skills, in cybersecurity, with the understanding that they will come in, join a more experienced team and learn on the job. They are formed into teams of five to seven people solving one problem at a time, with the new employees teaming with more experienced security experts to watch.Many skills from other industries are transferable to the cybersecurity field. Cybersecurity experts need to be able to communicate policies to, as Ms. Naidoo put it, \u201cincrease the cybersecurity I.Q.\u201d of an entire organization. For example, people from a finance background might be able to educate their co-workers in accounting about cyberrisk.She\u2019s grown her team by about 25 percent over the last year with developers, consultants and research professionals. She said being more flexible in hiring, and hiring outside of the normal pipeline, had evened out some of the inequities in the field \u2014 like a relative dearth of minorities and women.\u201cTo solve the skills shortage, we have to hire people who have the right aptitude, who have the right attitude, people who are curious, are willing to learn,\u201d Ms. Naidoo said. \u201cOutside of that, I have very few other criteria. I\u2019m opening the aperture for where we look. I\u2019m trying to hire in nontraditional places, nontraditional groups of people, and so I don\u2019t expect them to have the skills or the experience that we need. I will hire people wherever I can find them.\u201dMichael Doran, 38, was a police officer in St. Louis for almost 10 years before going into cybersecurity.\u201cI quickly found out a lot of the older detectives were not doing a lot of the computer crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw my opening there to make a niche for myself.\u201dHe went to the cybercrimes unit as a forensic digital examiner within the St. Louis police department\u2019s cybercrime unit. But it didn\u2019t take long for the private industry to scoop him up.\u201cIt was an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d he said, speaking of more than doubling his salary to near six figures. \u201cI took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\u201dMore C-suite executives are filling their own skills gaps when it comes to cybersecurity, said Eric Rosenbach, co-director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and former chief of staff at the Defense Department.He runs an online class for working, senior-level executives \u201cwho are only now seeing how seriously they need to take it because they\u2019ve seen so many other C.E.O.s get fired for major breaches,\u201d said Mr. Rosenbach.Offered at least six times a year, the classes educate 300 to 400 people each term. He says executives need to know how to minimize the legal, financial and public relations risks before an attack occurs.Beyond the particular needs of firms in the cybersecurity arena, there is also a skills gap in the larger population that needs to be addressed, Mr. Rosenbach said.\u201cI\u2019m surprised, even at Harvard, how few of the students here know very basic stuff about cyberhygiene, two-factor authentication, things like that, that people should be doing to protect themselves,\u201d he said.\u201cOne thing I don\u2019t think people appreciate as much is that cyber is about human issues, it\u2019s about training people not to do dumb things like click on spear-phishing links, holding people accountable. There\u2019s a lot of human leadership involved in trying to improve cybersecurity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If Mr. Whitaker has any concern for the independence of the department he is taking over \u2014 not to mention the rule of law in America \u2014 he will follow Mr. Sessions\u2019s lead and hand the reins of the investigation to someone less evidently invested in destroying it.It\u2019s not even clear Mr. Whitaker may legally hold the post of acting attorney general, since he has never been confirmed by the Senate.

{"Headline": "With Hoopla and Murals, Crystal City Welcomes Amazon", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Over the past few months, murals had started appearing on a fence surrounding an empty brick warehouse in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington. Sporting geometric shapes and adorned with hanging bicycles, the murals also displayed aspirational slogans in big black letters like \u201cWhat If?\u201d and \u201cWhy Not?\u201dOn Tuesday, Virginia government officials opened the gates to the lot where the murals had popped up. Inside, they held a news conference to welcome the object of their messaging: Amazon.\u201cInnovation is the lifeblood of our commonwealth and the driving force of Amazon,\u201d Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, said to hundreds of cheering state politicians, business leaders, Amazon officials and real estate developers as he welcomed the e-commerce giant to the area. Mr. Northam delivered his address from a stage that had been secretly set up, with a lectern that bore a twist on the state\u2019s unofficial motto: \u201cVirginia is for Amazon lovers.\u201dMr. Northam deemed the victory by Crystal City as \u201chistoric\u201d \u2014 especially for an area, just a few miles across the Potomac River from Washington, that has been crying out for revitalization.Crystal City was the dream of a local developer, Robert Smith, who in the 1960s began to construct commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums on lots once occupied by industrial buildings and junkyards. In a nod to its audacious goals, the neighborhood was named for the grand crystal chandelier that Mr. Smith put in the first building.In the 1970s and 1980s, Crystal City became a hub for government offices like the General Services Administration, corporations like US Airways and defense contractors. But in the last two decades, many of those tenants left, sending Crystal City into a prolonged decline and leaving it without a strong residential or commercial identity.A more recent boom in the Washington region has helped fuel some redevelopment in Crystal City. Steps away from Amazon\u2019s future headquarters is a new Whole Foods supermarket, which is owned by Amazon; a yoga studio; and Commonwealth Joe Coffee Roasters, a premium coffee shop.With plenty of vacant properties and potential for redevelopment, the area gives the internet retailer a perch to sell more cloud storage services to the Department of Defense and other government agencies nearby. It is also minutes from Reagan National Airport, with many direct flights to Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle. The neighborhood is walkable and just a few subway stops from downtown Washington and Capitol Hill. The area also has one of the country\u2019s best-educated work forces, and the public school systems rank high.\u201cFirst thing I want to say is \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d Brian Ball, Virginia\u2019s secretary of commerce and trade, exclaimed into the mic at the news conference. The audience applauded and shouted \u201cWoo!\u201d in affirmation.Mr. Northam said Virginia had to adjust some of its incentives with the announcement of only 25,000 jobs, but he wouldn\u2019t elaborate.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia also spent the day on a media tour, promoting the ripple effects of Crystal City\u2019s partnership with Amazon. In a morning interview with Yahoo, he pumped his fists in the air and said the benefits of Amazon\u2019s new offices would stretch into rural areas of the state.\u201cThis is really a win for the whole region,\u201d Mr. Warner, a Democrat, said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just immediate jobs but the enormous amount of spinoffs and what I think that will do to spur entrepreneurial activity.\u201dCrystal City will anchor Amazon\u2019s presence in the area, but the company\u2019s offices will spill over into parts of the Pentagon City neighborhood and nearby Alexandria. Arlington and Alexandria officials branded the area as National Landing, a two-and-a-half-mile urban stretch connected by three Metro subway stations along the Potomac.Helping to drive Crystal City\u2019s winning bid was the real estate owner and developer JBG Smith, which worked with local officials to present a plan to Amazon. The plan included developing 150 acres of vacant buildings and empty land with the three subway stations and a station for the Virginia Railway Express, which connects to major cities in the state.Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, has not toured the site, a company spokesman, Jay Carney, said. But the location is convenient for the world\u2019s richest man: Mr. Bezos owns a massive Washington home \u2014 a former textile museum in the tony Kalorama neighborhood, just a few miles from Crystal City.Some Crystal City residents were joyful about Amazon\u2019s impending arrival on Tuesday, while others were wary.Evelyn Wong, a mother of two toddlers, said she was excited about the prospect of her home\u2019s increasing in value. On a Facebook page for her townhouse community of 200 units, residents have been posting frequently about Amazon\u2019s arrival and how much they might be willing to sell their homes for to developers, she said.\u201cI emailed my Realtor this morning to tell her I was so happy we bought last year,\u201d Ms. Wong said.Others were concerned about traffic and rising inequality in wages. Kevin Combes, a resident of Pentagon City, said Amazon could make residential development stall.\u201cJobs-housing balance is critical to growing our cities in a sustainable way,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should be able to live close to work, affordably. Crystal City was just beginning to convert vacant office space into housing, but that work has been halted.\u201dLocal government leaders promised to improve transportation, saying Amazon\u2019s arrival would help bolster work on Metro stops, the notoriously congested Route 1 in Arlington and other major roads.The company and local officials will also have to retrain skeptical residents on the new National Landing branding.Max Schwager, a Pentagon City resident, was among many locals confused by the National Landing name.\u201cIt\u2019ll take decades for this name to actually take off, if it even ever does,\u201d said Mr. Schwager, a theater manager who has lived in the region for seven years. \u201cEspecially with neighborhoods, people around here like to stick to their guns.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a federal agency that had offices in Crystal City. It is the General Services Administration, not the Government Services Administration.Cecilia Kang reported from Arlington, and Tiffany Hsu from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are We Still So Fat?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 Things We\u2019d Really Like to KnowOnly bariatric surgery reliably leads to long-term weight loss. Now scientists hope to duplicate the effects with a pill. Whenever I see a photo from the 1960s or 1970s, I am startled. It\u2019s not the clothes. It\u2019s not the hair. It\u2019s the bodies. So many people were skinny.Scientists do a lot of hand-waving about our \u201cobesogenic environment\u201d and point to favorite culprits: the abundance of cheap fast foods and snacks; food companies making products so tasty they are addictive; larger serving sizes; the tendency to graze all day.Whatever the combination of factors at work, something about the environment is making many people as fat as their genetic makeup permits. Obesity has always been with us, but never has it been so common.Everyone \u2014 from doctors to drug companies, from public health officials to overweight people themselves \u2014 would love to see a cure, a treatment that brings weight to normal and keeps it there. Why hasn\u2019t anyone discovered one? It\u2019s not for lack of trying.Yes, some individuals have managed to go from fat to thin with diets and exercise, and have kept off the weight. But they are the rare exceptions. Most spend years dieting and regaining, dieting and regaining, in a fruitless, frustrating cycle.That treatment is bariatric surgery, a drastic operation that turns the stomach into a tiny pouch and, in one version, also reroutes the intestines. Most who have it lose significant amounts of weight \u2014 but many of them remain overweight, or even obese. Their health usually improves anyway. Many with diabetes no longer need insulin. Cholesterol and blood pressure levels tend to fall. Sleep apnea disappears. Backs, hips and knees stop aching.There are not nearly enough surgeons or facilities to operate on all the obese people who might be helped by bariatric surgery, noted Randy Seeley, director of the nutrition research center at the University of Michigan. And many patients and doctors persist in thinking \u2014 all evidence to the contrary \u2014 that if overweight people really set their minds to it, they could get thin and stay thin.Scientists got an unsparing look at what they were up against 50 years ago, when a clinical researcher at Rockefeller University, Dr. Jules Hirsch, did some old-fashioned experiments. He recruited obese people to stay at the hospital and subsist on a 600-calorie a day liquid diet until they reached a normal weight.The subjects lost 100 pounds on average, and they were thrilled. But as soon as they left the hospital, the pounds piled back on.Dr. Hirsch and Dr. Rudy Leibel, now at Columbia University, repeated the study again and again, with the same result. Eventually, they found that when a very fat person diets down to a normal weight, he or she physiologically comes to resemble a starving person, craving food with an avidity that is hard to imagine.Obesity\u2019s genetic connection was conclusively demonstrated in the 1980s in a series of papers showing that body weight is strongly inherited, almost as strongly as height. Children adopted as infants ended up with weights like those of their biological parents. Twins reared apart ended up with nearly identical body weights.It was beginning to look hopeless for obese people.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussLeptin signals some sort of master controller in the brain. If a person is too thin \u2014 according to what the brain perceives as an acceptable weight \u2014 the brain signals that person to eat.In fat people, that controller is set too high: their brains make sure they stay fat.The drug company Amgen paid Rockefeller and Dr. Friedman $20 million for rights to leptin, hoping to develop it as an obesity treatment. The idea was to give leptin to obese patients so their brains would think they had too much fat. If it worked, they ought to lose their appetites and drop pounds. By tailoring leptin injections, doctors might even fine-tune a person\u2019s weight.To everyone\u2019s chagrin, leptin fizzled. Most people did not respond to leptin injections by losing weight. But leptin was a key to unlocking a complex network of hormones and brain signals that control body weight. The problem was that no single target seemed to make much difference in weight loss.\u201cI think of eating as a survival mechanism,\u201d said Dr. John Amatruda, a consultant and former executive at Bayer and Merck while trying to develop weight-loss drugs. \u201cYou need to eat, so our bodies are wired to have complex systems that are redundant.\u201dThe hope now is to figure out how to have the benefits of bariatric surgery without the surgery. The operation alters the body\u2019s orchestra of hormones and signals, among them leptin but also many others. Afterward, tastes change. Many patients no longer crave the high-calorie foods that used to sate them. Many find they are no longer ravenously hungry.Might those effects be mimicked with a drug? Many researchers are trying, although most drug companies have dropped out of the obesity market, seeing no truly effective treatments on the horizon. Dr. Seeley remains optimistic that a drug will be found. He studies mice and rats, giving them bariatric surgery and trying to untangle the web of biochemical changes that follow. \u201cWe think we have good clues,\u201d he said, \u201cbut nothing is far enough along.\u201dFor now, researchers wish people \u2014 including fat people themselves \u2014 would stop blaming the obese for their problem.\u201cThis idea that people should eat less and exercise more \u2014 if only it were so simple,\u201d Dr. Hall said.Advertisement"}

Vast new reserves of offshore oil would provide an added boost, complemented by the country\u2019s robust and sophisticated manufacturing sector.The rocket never reached orbit.

There\u2019s something to that. Quantity has a quality all its own, goes the saying, and Beijing can supply quantity like no other country save for India.Tyrannies do not work in the long run. But they do know how to make people work in the short term.Maybe that\u2019s because individual rights, democratic choices, rule of law, competitive markets, high levels of transparency, low levels of government corruption, independent news sources, and freedoms of thought, conscience and speech are assets beyond price \u2014ones that Westerners tend to value too lightly while foolishly assuming others do as well. If you define power as the power to attract and not simply compel, then Beijing \u2014 with its dystopian vision to fully surveil and rate all citizens by 2020 \u2014 isn\u2019t a rising power at all. It\u2019s a collapsing one.All this may seem an excessively glum take. What about the skyscrapers of Guangzhou? What about the world-beating test scores of students in Shanghai? What about the hundreds of millions brought out of subsistence living and raised to, or above, the middle class?China\u2019s rise is not some kind of mirage. But what matters is the future, not the past, and whether a nation built on constraining the freedoms granted to ordinary people can outpace, outsmart, and outlast another nation built on defending and broadening those freedoms. On current evidence, that seems utterly doubtful.American policymakers and pundits often talk about the challenge of managing China\u2019s rise. They had better start thinking instead of the challenge of managing its decline, beginning at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires this weekend. Japan and Europe went gently into eclipse, and the Soviet Union surrendered without a fight (at least until its current revanchist phase).Will China\u2019s current leadership accept the possibility of their own decline so philosophically, after having convinced themselves of their rapid rise to primacy? Nobody should bet on it. A wounded tiger is rarely a placid one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Long Struggle for America\u2019s Soul", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApparently, the self-evident truth that all people deserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is far from settled.Mr. Delbanco writes about American culture in the 19th century.Like many Americans, I\u2019ve been following events at our southern border \u2014 the separation of children from their parents; the president\u2019s denigration of nonwhite migrants as criminals, rapists and animals; his bluster about denying birthright citizenship to their children; and his pledge to send federal troops to intercept a dwindling caravan of frantic refugees.To my ears, it all sounds eerily familiar. This is not the first time America has been torn apart over how to respond to people of color desperate to escape inhuman conditions. Nor is it the first time a president has threatened to deploy federal troops to return them to the horrors from which they fled.I\u2019m thinking, of course, of African-Americans, who were regarded for much of American history not as human beings but as a species of animate property no different from cattle and sheep. Their circumstances under slavery were certainly different from those of illegal immigrants today. For one thing, the authorities in their \u201chomeland,\u201d the American South, wanted to keep them rather than lose them. Slave owners worked hard to prevent their slaves from running away. South Carolina adopted its first \u201cAct to Prevent Runaways\u201d as early as 1683. A hundred years later, Georgia established a nightly slave patrol in its main port city that came to be known as the \u201cSavannah Watch.\u201d In the waning years of British rule, colonial officials favored draining wetlands in order to prevent \u201cdeserting slaves and wild beasts\u201d from finding shelter in the swamps.Yet despite such efforts, when delegates from the former British colonies convened at Philadelphia in 1787, the problem of runaway slaves posed a serious threat to the project of creating a new nation. If a durable union was to be forged between the South, where slavery was the bedrock of economy and culture, and the North, where it appeared headed toward extinction, slaves running for freedom across America\u2019s internal border would have to be stopped. In Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, the founding fathers attempted to stop them:No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, delegate from South Carolina, exulted that \u201cwe have obtained a right to recover our slaves in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before.\u201dPinckney spoke too soon. Stating the principle proved much easier than carrying it out \u2014 just as chanting \u201cBuild the Wall!\u201d has proved easier than building it. From the Southern point of view, citizens in any state, Northern or Southern, were obliged to return runaways just as they would be obliged to return stray livestock or stolen cash. But as the nation expanded westward, the boundary between slavery and freedom became longer and more porous. Northern states put up barriers to enforcement, including \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d laws guaranteeing jury trials for fugitives and prohibiting state officials from assisting in returning them to the South.Slave owners tried to cut off the problem at the source. Shoes \u2014 issued to field slaves to prevent foot injuries that could sideline them from work \u2014 were collected at night to discourage slaves from taking flight. From Georgia and the Carolinas to Virginia and Tennessee, runaways resisting arrest could be killed with impunity \u2014 and the only witness might be the killer himself.Under such conditions, most fugitives never made it very far. Some were mutilated \u2014 tendons cut, faces branded \u2014 as warnings not to try again, and to others not to try at all. Still, they kept on trying, just as in our own time the immigrants keep on coming. In 1841, when Charles Dickens came to the United States on a lecture tour, he was amazed by newspaper notices, \u201ccoolly read in families\u201d as \u201ca part of the current news and small-talk,\u201d offering rewards for returning runaways:Ran away, a negro woman and two children. A few days before she went off, I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face. I tried to make the letter \u201cM.\u201dBy the 1840s, despite all measures to contain them, the flow of runaways had made the fugitive slave problem, in the words of Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, \u201cthe gravest and most vital of all questions, to us and the whole Union\u201d \u2014 so grave that calls for secession arose throughout the South.In an effort to blunt the rising sentiment for disunion, Congress tried to solve the problem once and for all by shifting enforcement responsibility from the states to the federal government. In August of 1850, it passed a bill \u201cto provide for the more effectual execution of the third clause of the second section fourth article of the Constitution of the United States\u201d \u2014 known ever since as the Fugitive Slave Act. In September, President Millard Fillmore signed it into law.It was a law without mercy. To accused fugitives arrested under its authority, it denied the most basic right enshrined in the Anglo-American legal tradition: habeas corpus \u2014 the right to challenge, in open court, the legality of their detention. It forbade them to testify in their own defense. It ruled out trial by jury. Except for proof of freedom, such as emancipation papers signed by a former owner, it disallowed all forms of exonerating evidence, including evidence of beatings or rape while the defendant had been enslaved. It criminalized the act of sheltering a fugitive and required local authorities to assist the claimant in recovering his lost human property. It put the power of extradition in the hands of \u201ccommissioners\u201d appointed by the federal government and limited the disputed issue to confirming the identity of the person who had tried to flee to freedom. If the accused could be shown to have belonged to the claimant according to the laws of the state from which she had fled, she was ordered back to captivity.In early 1851, in concert with white abolitionists, free black people began to organize resistance. In Boston, slave catchers seized a young man known as Shadrach who had escaped a few weeks earlier from slavery in Norfolk, Va., and found work in a Beacon Hill coffeehouse. While serving breakfast, he was seized with his waiter\u2019s apron still on and taken to the nearby courthouse. As news of the arrest spread, a mostly black and angry crowd gathered in Court Square.Led by Lewis Hayden, a fugitive from Kentucky, a group of men rushed the courtroom and hustled Shadrach into the crowd outside, which, like a \u201cblack squall\u201d (the words of the white antislavery attorney Richard Henry Dana), swirled around him. Whisked from Boston to Cambridge, then through Concord, Leominster and Fitchburg, he eventually made it to Canada. Theodore Parker, a white clergyman who became known as \u201cMinister at Large for Fugitive Slaves,\u201d declared that \u201cif I were a fugitive and could escape in no other way, I would kill [the slave catcher] with as little compunction as I would drive a mosquito from my face.\u201dParker proved prophetic. In Lancaster County, Pa., a Maryland slave owner who tried to force a fugitive to return with him to Maryland was shot and killed by a local black man. In Syracuse, a biracial crowd attacked a police station where an accused fugitive was being held. Armed with clubs, axes, and a battering ram, they smashed into the building and spirited away the prisoner, who, like Shadrach, found refuge in Canada. In Milwaukee, a fugitive named Joshua Glover, who had escaped from St. Louis, was held in jail until, as one his rescuers later remembered, \u201ctwenty strong and resolute men seized a large timber some eight or ten inches square and twenty feet long and went for the jail door; bumb, bumb, bumb, and down came the jail door and out came Glover.\u201dThese events took place, of course, in a world vastly different from our own. In the United States of 1850, more than three million black people were still legally enslaved within the country\u2019s own borders. Politicians \u2014 even those with qualms about slavery \u2014 did not hesitate to express frank racist contempt for African-Americans, and if called out for doing so, they did not deny it. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who favored gradual emancipation, denounced Shadrach\u2019s rescue by black Bostonians as an outrage perpetrated \u201cby African descendants; by people who possess no part\u201d in \u201cour political system.\u201d The chief justice of the United States, Roger Taney, declared that blacks \u201chave no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\u201dThere is an aphorism attributed to Mark Twain (though no evidence exists that he ever said it) that while history does not repeat itself, it does rhyme. The story of the fugitive slave crisis is a rhyming story filled with echoes in our own time.For one thing, Boston; New Bedford, Mass.; Syracuse; Cincinnati; and Rochester, among other places, became \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d where the domestic illegal immigrants of their day sought safe haven. The left, which had once decried the principle of states\u2019 rights, began to see the federal government as an evil force controlled by the right. Black people feared the sight of law enforcement officers in the streets. For large sectors of the public, the legitimacy of Congress and the courts collapsed. Politics became radically polarized. The leading intellectual of the North, Ralph Waldo Emerson, reacted with horror at the thought that a man \u201cwho has run the gauntlet of a thousand miles for his freedom\u201d must now, by law, be hunted down and sent \u201cback again to the dog-hutch he fled from.\u201d Meanwhile, a leading newspaper in the South, the Georgia Citizen, declared it past time to send \u201ca naval and military force\u201d sufficient \u201cto batter down the walls of Boston and lay it in utter ruin\u201d as reward for its sedition.But the strongest \u201crhyme\u201d between fugitive slaves in the 19th century and illegal immigrants today is their shared anguish \u2014 the \u201cdegenerating sense of nobodiness,\u201d in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s devastating phrase \u2014 inflicted by a society that treats them as non-persons. People demeaned in this way forced Americans then, and force us now, to confront the central question of our history: Who is \u2014 or isn\u2019t \u2014 recognized as fully human? Our Declaration of Independence was supposed to answer this question with the proposition that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and \u201cendowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,\u201d including \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201dAt certain decisive moments in our history, attempts have been made to extend this principle beyond the cadre of the propertied white males who first articulated it. In 1854, as the crisis over slavery deepened, Abraham Lincoln called upon America to \u201creadopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it.\u201d By destroying slavery, the Civil War brought what he called a \u201cnew birth of freedom\u201d for black Americans. The postwar constitutional amendments sought to guarantee the rights of citizenship \u2014 notably the right to vote \u2014 to all American men, including former slaves and naturalized immigrants. The New Deal tried to protect vulnerable citizens from the destructive effects of dynamic capitalism. The Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and \u201960s tried to dismantle the legacy of slavery in the form of Jim Crow.But if we\u2019ve learned anything in the age of Trump, it\u2019s that rights can also be constricted and rescinded. The self-evident truth that all people deserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a long way from settled in the American mind. The question of who is considered fully human has returned with a vengeance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thousand Oaks and Our Peculiarly American Affliction", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "OpinionBe shocked by the massacre at a bar. It\u2019s not normal.Supported byContributing Opinion WriterIt has become my habit to check social media when I first wake up, a consequence of this modern age. I wasn\u2019t sleeping well, so this morning I checked my phone around 5 a.m., expecting to see continued analysis of the midterm elections and maybe a charming news item about Cardi B. I should have known better. Over the past two years there has been increased security at my events, armed guards. Sometimes they are there because I have received a threat. Sometimes they are there because I am a black woman with opinions and the threat is already implied. Every time I go on stage, I look out into the audience and wonder if there is a man with a gun in the sea of faces. I am not scared of him. I am resigned to the inevitability of him pointing that gun at me, at the crowd, and pulling the trigger. I don\u2019t want to be this resigned. I don\u2019t want you to be, either.In an interview, the father of one of the young women who escaped the carnage at the Borderline Bar said his daughter did what he has taught her to do in the event of a mass shooting. It took me a moment to realize what he was saying. We are raising generations of children who are prepared for this kind of crime. It is a peculiarly American affliction that this epidemic of gun violence doesn\u2019t move us to take any real steps toward curbing gun violence and access to guns.It is painfully obvious that there is no shooting appalling enough to make American politicians stand up to the National Rifle Association and gunmakers. A congressman was shot and critically wounded. Children at Sandy Hook Elementary were murdered. Revelers at the Pulse nightclub were murdered. Concertgoers in Las Vegas were murdered.The script following these shootings is too familiar \u2014 flags at half-staff, hollow words of sympathy \u2014 but what chills me is the relatively calm eloquence of the survivors speaking to reporters. How they don\u2019t seem particularly surprised to have survived a mass shooting. That they are able, in the immediate aftermath of trauma, to articulate their experiences. They can do this because they have seen it done.How do we change this script? How do we convince enough people that we are well past the time for radical action? We must elect politicians who will ban assault weapons and at the very least enact legislation requiring federal, rigorous background checks for gun owners. But really, that\u2019s not radical. It\u2019s the bare minimum, and by the grace of that kind of legislation in California, the shooter was able to use only a handgun. This massacre where 13 people died could have been much worse.In late September, I went to a gun range with my brother, who is a gun enthusiast. We spent about an hour shooting guns as he explained the merits of the various weapons. We wore safety goggles, and though it wasn\u2019t my first time shooting a gun, he went over the safety protocols. Before we could even enter the range we watched a safety video. From the moment we entered the facility until the time we left, we were reminded of the danger of these weapons. Each gun was heavy in my hand, hot. Before long, the space around us was thick with the stench of oil and gunpowder. We were shooting at targets, metal and paper. There was a certain satisfaction when I shot well. I understood the appeal of holding that kind of power in the palm of my hand. I also understood the responsibility of holding a gun. I was awed by it. I was not so enamored that I want to own a gun myself. Yet.Today I held a 4-month-old baby. He is cute and strong and wide-eyed. He still smells sweet and new. I held him and for a few minutes I forgot about everything terrible. I forgot about the man with a gun and the 12 other people he killed and the people he injured. I forgot about the man with a gun who walked into a yoga studio and started shooting. I forgot about the man with a gun who walked into a grocery store and started shooting. I forgot about the man with a gun who walked into a synagogue and started shooting. And then I looked at this baby\u2019s tiny face and his wide, gummy smile. I remembered everything terrible. I understood the responsibility of holding a child. I was awed by it. I realized that as horrifying and commonplace and inevitable as mass shootings are, we cannot do nothing. Stare into the horror. Feel it. Feel it so much that you are moved to act.Advertisement"}

Alarmingly, we are experimenting again with a monopolized economy.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.In the aftermath of the Second World War, an urgent question presented itself: How can we prevent the rise of fascism from happening again? If over the years that question became one of mostly historical interest, it has again become pressing, with the growing success of populist, nationalist and even neofascist movements all around the world.Common answers to the question stress the importance of a free press, the rule of law, stable government, robust civic institutions and common decency. But as undoubtedly important as these factors are, we too often overlook something else: the threat to democracy posed by monopoly and excessive corporate concentration \u2014 what the Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d We must not forget the economic origins of fascism, lest we risk repeating the most calamitous error of the 20th century.It is a story that should sound uncomfortably familiar: An economic crisis yields widespread economic suffering, feeding an appetite for a nationalistic and extremist leader. The leader rides to power promising a return to national greatness, deliverance from economic suffering and the defeat of enemies foreign and domestic (including big business). Yet in reality, the leader seeks alliances with large enterprises and the great monopolies, so long as they obey him, for each has something the other wants: He gets their loyalty, and they avoid democratic accountability.There are many differences between the situation in 1930s and our predicament today. But given what we know, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that we are conducting a dangerous economic and political experiment: We have chosen to weaken the laws \u2014 the antitrust laws \u2014 that are meant to resist the concentration of economic power in the United States and around the world.From a political perspective, we have recklessly chosen to tolerate global monopolies and oligopolies in finance, media, airlines, telecommunications and elsewhere, to say nothing of the growing size and power of the major technology platforms. In doing so, we have cast aside the safeguards that were supposed to protect democracy against a dangerous marriage of private and public power.Unfortunately, there are abundant signs that we are suffering the consequences, both in the United States and elsewhere. There is a reason that extremist, populist leaders like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Xi Jinping of China and Viktor Orban of Hungary have taken center stage, all following some version of the same script. And here in the United States, we have witnessed the anger borne of ordinary citizens who have lost almost any influence over economic policy \u2014 and by extension, their lives. The middle class has no political influence over their stagnant wages, tax policy, the price of essential goods or health care. This powerlessness is brewing a powerful feeling of outrage.After the fall of the Third Reich, the Allies broke up the major Nazi monopolies specifically so that they could not be \u201cused by Germany as instruments of political or economic aggression,\u201d in the words of the law used to do so. The United States took its medicine, too: In 1950, Congress passed the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 to curb politically and economically dangerous concentrations. It empowered the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to block or undo mergers when the effect was \u201csubstantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dIt would be understandable if you assumed that the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 had been repealed. But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary. Consequently, over the last two decades we have allowed successive waves of mergers that make a mockery of the 1950 law, and have concentrated economic power in ways that are dangerous to the polity.We need to figure out how the classic antidote to bigness \u2014 the antitrust and other antimonopoly laws \u2014 might be recovered and updated to address the specific challenges of our time. For a start, Congress should pass a new Anti-Merger Act reasserting that it meant what it said in 1950, and create new levels of scrutiny for mega-mergers like the proposed union of T-Mobile and Sprint.But we also need judges who better understand the political as well as economic goals of antitrust. We need prosecutors willing to bring big cases with the courage of trustbusters like Theodore Roosevelt, who brought to heel the empires of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, and with the economic sophistication of the men and women who challenged AT&T and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s. Europe needs to do its part as well, blocking more mergers, especially those like Bayer\u2019s recent acquisition of Monsanto that threaten to put entire global industries in just a few hands.The United States seems to constantly forget its own traditions, to forget what this country at its best stands for. We forget that America pioneered a kind of law \u2014 antitrust \u2014 that in the words of Roosevelt would \u201cteach the masters of the biggest corporations in the land that they were not, and would not be permitted to regard themselves as, above the law.\u201d We have forgotten that antitrust law had more than an economic goal, that it was meant fundamentally as a kind of constitutional safeguard, a check against the political dangers of unaccountable private power.As the lawyer and consumer advocate Robert Pitofsky warned in 1979, we must not forget the economic origins of totalitarianism, that \u201cmassively concentrated economic power, or state intervention induced by that level of concentration, is incompatible with liberal, constitutional democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president is the living embodiment of a spiraling crisis of American corruption, but the problem is far bigger than just him.Mr. Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center.Democrats are now preparing to assume control of the House. This offers many possibilities for oversight and investigation. For one, the House Ways and Means Committee has the right to inspect the president\u2019s tax returns, and Democrats are sure to swiftly call on the Treasury to hand over President Trump\u2019s tax records.Newly empowered Democrats need to be ready to hit back, and not just at the president. Mr. Trump is the living embodiment of a spiraling crisis of American corruption, but the problem is far bigger than this one rotten guy and his family.When it\u2019s easy for a class of people to cheat and get away with it, over time, lots of them will. When their ranks and resources hit a critical mass, their desire for political cover can get traction. Their pooled wealth, much of which has been illicitly withheld from the system, can be deployed to incrementally change the system \u2014 to rig the tax code and its enforcement \u2014 to keep themselves in the money (and out of jail).This happens the world over, again and again, and it happened to us. Mr. Trump is using the presidency to cover up his crimes, feather his nest and protect the interests of dictators who funnel money to his family. And it started with the tax-evasion tricks he learned at his father\u2019s knee.The continued survival of the American system may turn on shutting down would-be Trumps. In the near term that means limiting the opportunity to use public office for private gain. House Democrats can address that when they take over the chamber. In the longer term, it means cracking down on tax cheats who grow powerful by leeching our polity of its fiscal lifeblood.If selling off assets and rigorous financial transparency requirements dissuade the unscrupulous rich from pursuing political careers, clearing a path for citizens who never owned a shell company, that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s a victory for democratic equality and clean government.Passing strong anti-corruption legislation through the House would make an important statement and lay the groundwork for a more ambitious anti-corruption agenda \u2014 even if Senate Republicans kill it.In the longer term, Congress must choke off the growth of the crooked class by throwing more resources at tax enforcement and making enforcement easier by making the tax code simpler. Close loopholes, seal off asset-concealment escape routes and reverse the proliferation of micro-exemptions, credits and carve-outs.Real estate merits special attention. Much of Mr. Trump\u2019s ill-gotten empire is based on the manipulation of the assessed values of his properties through an easily gamed system of valuation by local authorities. If commercial real estate search companies like Zillow can create algorithms that reliably estimate the market value of properties, the government can do the same. The taxable value of real property should be fixed through a general, rule-bound, politically independent method, with political discretion reserved for transparent legislative rate-setting. Determining the value of taxable assets through an opaque process of bureaucratic whimsy invites corruption. Tolerance of fiscal corruption means more than lost revenue, underfunded schools, straitened social insurance programs and mountains of government debt held by America\u2019s geopolitical rivals. It is the corruption of the body politic and an incentive to get rich, or richer, by cheating the system \u2014 which is, in effect, an incentive to slowly destroy it.Free and prosperous democracies run on social trust: the mutual expectation of non-exploitation. Rampant corruption is the bane of trust, the Kryptonite of republican self-rule. Failure to guard against it has delivered us into the hands of a grievously compromised tax cheat who saw a chance to cover his decadent backside by winning power as a tribune of the people. But it was our lack of vigilance, not his peerless mendacity, that allowed Donald Trump the bogus reputation and stolen resources he needed to seize it.Will Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center.Advertisement"}

As Dr. Stanford continued to try to calm the passenger, another flight attendant approached and asked to see the license. She, too, looked at it and walked away. Then the two flight attendants returned together and began another series of questions.\u201cAre you a head doctor?\u201d one of them asked. When Dr. Stanford said she did not understand the question, the flight attendant asked, \u201cAre you actually an M.D.?\u201dThen the second flight attendant spoke: \u201cIs this your license?\u201d When the doctor asked what she meant, the flight attendant repeated the question. \u201cWhy would I carry someone else\u2019s medical license?\u201d Dr. Stanford said she replied.The unguarded skepticism about medical professionals and race is something that Dr. Stanford, who graduated from the Medical College of Georgia in 2007, said she has often discussed with colleagues of color, who have swapped stories of being mistaken for support staff, or asked to remove trays or wipe up messes in the emergency room.\u201cThis is something that the medical community has embraced as a reality,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you Google a doctor, most of the pictures that come up are of a white man.\u201d\u201cThere are other people who look like me,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I should not be called into question about something I have worked for my entire life.\u201dDr. Stanford said she was not challenged for the rest of the two-hour flight. As they were descending, she said, one attendant told her they would not need to check her license anymore because \u201cit seems like you were able to handle everything.\u201dShe interpreted the encounter as biased because of the persistent questioning about whether she was a physician even after she had provided proof. \u201cIt never stopped,\u201d she said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out why we were having this discussion.\u201dDelta apologized to Dr. Stanford on Wednesday and said it was investigating, according to the email it sent her.Mr. Black said the flight attendants working on Dr. Stanford\u2019s flight, Flight 5935, on Tuesday were employed by Republic Airline, a Delta Connection partner.\u201cMoving forward, we are following up with our connection carrier partner to ensure their employees understand and consistently apply the policy,\u201d he said in an email.Jon Austin, a spokesman for Republic, said in an email on Thursday that the airline was working with Delta to make sure its employees apply such policies. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to Dr. Stanford for her medical assistance onboard our Flight 5935 and are sorry for any misunderstanding that may have occurred during her exchange with our in-flight crew.\u201dDr. Cross, who did not have her medical license with her, told The New York Times in 2016 that when she volunteered to help, a flight attendant demanded \u201ccredentials\u201d and confirmation that she was an \u201cactual\u201d physician, nurse or medical personnel.Dr. Cross said she had previously encountered assumptions that being a black woman, she was not a doctor. \u201cI think minorities in general, especially in my field of practice \u2014 I feel that they are always questioned and always assumed to be the nurse or the nurse\u2019s aide or here as part of the janitorial team or ancillary staff,\u201d she said.On Thursday, Dr. Cross said not much had changed since that year, even after her residency training ended.Now at Memorial Hermann Pearland Hospital in Pearland, Tex., with regular patients, she is still occasionally mistaken for support staff.\u201cI think that it is just going to be a lifelong battle,\u201d Dr. Cross said.Dr. Stanford appeared with Dr. Cross on a panel about gender and bias in medicine on Oct. 19, at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Medical Society. Less than two weeks later, Dr. Stanford was \u201cliving her story all over,\u201d she said.Both doctors\u2019 experiences were widely shared online by colleagues to highlight offensive assumptions about diversity in the medical field. The 2016 hashtag #WhatADoctorLooksLike, which was inspired by Dr. Cross\u2019s case, was resurrected this week to raise awareness about the doubts faced by many black medical professionals.Advertisement"}

The natural inclination of many, somewhat understandably, is simply to be a tougher Trump than Trump, but that inevitably reduces the candidate and the country.America doesn\u2019t need a liberal Trump; it needs precisely the opposite of that.

{"Headline": "A Call to Modernize American Philanthropy ", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesThe giving practices of rich magnates and foundations still suggest a colonial mind-set, the author of a new book argues, as he offers ideas for change. \u201cWriting this book, I started from a place of pain,\u201d Mr. Villanueva said. \u201cI was angry. But there\u2019s plenty of books that criticize. What would I do differently? I felt like I had to push through to a place where I\u2019m offering a different way of thinking.\u201dI sat down with Mr. Villanueva recently to discuss his book \u2014 a compassionate call for change and healing. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.The best thing you can do is go and sit in a community. Participate in a feast day. If you feel a tug of the heart that there\u2019s something special there, fund it. By funding, you\u2019re opening yourself up to receive, so it becomes reciprocal. I say this as a critique. But it\u2019s more of a sadness for me that we\u2019re not opening our hearts and minds to receive and learn and be in relationship with communities.Funding rules are also often decided without an analysis of race and place. I was working in a foundation that decided only to fund organizations with a budget of $500,000 or more. In foundations\u2019 defense, they often have small staffs and processes exist to be able to move money quickly, but sometimes the rules end up pushing people out instead of letting people in.In philanthropy, everyone\u2019s kind of looking at diversity, but we\u2019re still behind the curve. The culture is so mainstream white dominated that it\u2019s hard for people of color to be successful. I\u2019ve heard stories: black women asked not to wear their hair a certain way, a Native woman who was asked not to wear Native jewelry to work because it made other people uncomfortable. For me, I\u2019ve been sort of accused: \u201cWhich side are you on? Do you work here or do you work for the community?\u201dOne: Where did this money come from? We\u2019re operating in the charity space and it feels pure. But we need to know the history and the role that people of color played in helping to amass the wealth. Then we\u2019ll feel more compelled to give some back to those communities.Second: Who gets to allocate, manage and spend it? Who are the gatekeepers to the wealth? That representation matters.Third: Look at your giving, look at the data. If we are a funder that is only supporting organizations led by white people and pursuing mainstream ways of doing change, then we should ask: How can we rise above the processes we\u2019ve created to reach folks who may have different solutions?We\u2019re never going to get there only moving 5 percent of foundation assets, and then of that amount, investing only 7 or 8 percent in communities of color.Coming from a Southern faith tradition, I was taught to pay tithes. Ever since I had a job when I was 14, I\u2019ve given away at least 10 percent of my income. I was taught that the money belongs to God and I was fortunate to keep 90 percent. I think everyone should consider giving 10 percent of their income to support causes they care about. And one way to begin to chip away at the race-wealth gap would be for foundations to take 10 percent of their assets and invest them in communities of color.In my book, I talk about a woman named Hilary who wrote a letter of apology to me. She\u2019s a white woman and her family had a foundation and she started looking into her ancestry. She realized that her family had owned slaves in North Carolina adjacent to the town where my tribe, the Lumbee, is situated. In understanding that, she went through a process of grieving and soul-searching. She wrote letters of apology to a number of people of color. After we got connected she wrote one to me.When I read her letter \u2014 I carry it with me \u2014 I broke down and cried. It was beautiful to me that this person was taking ownership of years of things that happened against my community, and it made me love her. And it wasn\u2019t her fault; she was just born into that family. But her acknowledging that she now has this wealth and privilege and that it came about by some wrongdoing \u2014 that created a deep relationship between the two of us.We can\u2019t undo colonization, but to acknowledge it is a major step. That\u2019s what many folks are fighting for. Because we\u2019re still colonizing. We\u2019re still putting children in cages. People are not aware of our history and there\u2019s not been enough grief about it. We\u2019re in a vicious cycle of continuing to dehumanize folks.

{"Headline": "In Buenos Aires, a Rivalry Stretches Passions to the Limit ", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the city rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors meet in Saturday\u2019s Copa Libertadores final, all of Argentina will be watching. But on both sides, dreams of victory are matched only by fear of defeat. BUENOS AIRES \u2014 No matter what happens, Leonardo Uranga\u2019s tone will remain soft and steady. He will choose his words carefully. He will enunciate them clearly and slowly. At moments of the highest drama, the most exquisite tension, he will keep his head, even as all around him are losing theirs.As half of Argentina erupts in delight and the other sinks into the deepest despair, Uranga will keep his emotions in check. At the culmination of the biggest game of his long broadcasting career, he will not so much as raise his voice.For much of Saturday evening, then, he may well be unique. When the Buenos Aires archrivals River Plate and Boca Juniors meet in the second leg of the final of the Copa Libertadores \u2014 the most important game in South American club soccer \u2014 Uranga may well be the only calm person in Argentina.It is not something that comes naturally for him; indeed, it runs contrary to his instinct and inclination. As a commentator for Radio AM550, Uranga has always called games \u201cin the normal way\u201d: all rhetorical flourishes, impassioned outbursts and breathless, rapid-fire delivery. \u201cThat rhythm is part of football here,\u201d he said. \u201cEmotion and passion are the soul of Argentine football, the spirit of it. It is very hard to take that out.\u201dGiven the scale of Saturday\u2019s occasion, it is almost impossible. Uranga is hardly alone in regarding it as the \u201cbiggest game in Argentine history.\u201d Even the sobriquet it has been given \u2014 La Final de Todos los Tiempos: The Final for All Time \u2014 does not feel much like hyperbole, not in the circumstances.It is the first time, after all, that River and Boca \u2014 the twin, repelling poles of the Supercl\u00e1sico, certainly the most heated derby in Argentina and probably the most intense one in the world \u2014 have met in the final of the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s most coveted club championship.And it is the last time that they will, at least in this format. Starting next season, the tournament will be decided not by its traditional two-legged, home-and-away final, but with a single game in a neutral stadium.For River, then, this is its last and only chance to win the trophy it cherishes more than any other by beating its fiercest foe in front of its adoring fans; for Boca, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to inflict the most excruciating humiliation imaginable on its eternal rival, to secure the greatest victory in its history on enemy territory.No wonder, then, that Mauricio Macri \u2014 once the president of Boca, and now the president of Argentina \u2014 declared before the first leg that \u201cwhoever loses will take 20 years to recover.\u201d There are plenty of fans who might suggest that estimate is on the low side.There are glimpses of how much it means everywhere in Buenos Aires, and throughout Argentina, too: Between them, River and Boca claim to be supported by around 65 percent of the country\u2019s population. It is not just the sight of jerseys tied to balconies or hung from windows, the blue and yellow of Boca, the red and white of River. It is not just the sound of countless conversations in cafes and bars and restaurants, all of them discussing what might happen, who might win.It is not just the headlines in the newspapers or the voices crackling through the radio, revealing that some 2,000 police officers will be on duty at the Monumental, River\u2019s home stadium, on Saturday evening, or that prosecutors in Buenos Aires have opened an investigation into the illegal resale of tickets, with prices reportedly rising as high as $2,000, or more.It is the individual stories, too. There is the one about Mat\u00edas Alvarez, a law student who has not been able to find work but did manage to secure a ticket for the game; on Facebook, he wrote that he would not sell it for any sum in the world, but that he would trade it happily if someone could offer him a job \u201cin some sort of office or business.\u201d Some things, he said, were \u201cmore important.\u201dHe was flooded with offers, people willing to offer employment just to be there, at the game; River eventually intervened to assure both him and his benefactor a place inside the stadium.That one was picked up by the Argentine media, but there are countless others that remain anonymous: the fans making the journey home from New York and Toronto and Paris and Madrid, clad head to toe in River jerseys and T-shirts, simply because they had to be here; the fan who waited all evening outside Carlos Tevez\u2019s house, where Boca\u2019s players had gathered for a team-building barbecue, just to wish them all good luck; the taxi driver whose family removed his Boca shirt from his wardrobe so that he was not tempted to wear it as he ferried people to the stadium on Saturday.Many more, though, are trying not to think about it at all. Just as Uranga will remain calm on Saturday, they are forcing themselves to be calm, for now at least. This is a country, after all, as the former national coach Marcelo Bielsa once said, where it is not just winning that matters; equally important is to see your opponent suffer. For both sides, defeat in this game is the stuff of dark nightmares.There are many \u2014 fans of River and Boca alike \u2014 for whom this final is not a source of hope, but of dread, who would much rather have found a Brazilian team or a Colombian team \u2014 anyone at all, really \u2014 standing in their way. \u201cIt is too much,\u201d one River fan said. \u201cThe idea of losing is unthinkable. The cost is too high.\u201dTens of thousands made the pilgrimage, a blue-and-yellow tide sweeping through central Buenos Aires, past the Casa Rosada, Argentina\u2019s presidential palace, and into La Boca. They commandeered buses, packed so tight they hung out of the doors, flags fluttering from windows, the volume of the songs increasing as they neared the stadium.An hour before the training session was scheduled to start, La Bombonera was full: more than full, in fact. Fans were packed into stairwells, trapped in corridors and standing on the desks in the press box. Children clasped desperately to their parents\u2019 shoulders, eyes wide at the sheer number of people crammed inside.So many made it inside that, a few hours later, the City Council closed the stadium for exceeding its permitted capacity. Thousands more still, though, remained outside, on the tight, cramped streets of La Boca, singing and dancing, waving flags, pledging their allegiance.For an hour, those inside watched the players train, the noise relentless. When the session ended, Boca\u2019s squad stood before them, thanking them for the support, taking their applause. \u201cYou have to remember that away fans cannot go to the game on Saturday,\u201d said Ezequiel Fern\u00e1ndez Moores, the dean of Argentine sportswriting. \u201cThe fans are saying to them: \u2018We cannot go, you have to go in our place.\u2019 They are sending them off to war.\u201d When the players left, the fans stayed. If anything, the stadium grew louder, so loud the very ground shook.That is the passion and the emotion that Uranga described, the intensity and the obsession that characterize the Supercl\u00e1sico, the Libertadores. It is what distinguishes Argentine soccer from its more sedate, less visceral cousin in Europe. As much as it is a source of pride, though, it comes at a cost.Before the first leg, Argentina\u2019s Institute of Cardiologists approached Radio AM550, Uranga\u2019s employer, to express its concern at the possible health impact of the two games between River and Boca. \u201cThat same passion can also be a generator of stress,\u201d Uranga said.In the buildup to the games, there had been public-service announcements instructing those with health problems to visit their doctor and make sure they did not run out of medicine, or even avoid the game altogether. Radio AM550 decided to go one step further.Instead of its usual coverage of the games, it would run a so-called Zen broadcast of each leg, dialing down the noise from the crowd and replacing it with relaxing music. Uranga and his broadcast partner, Eduardo Caimi, would \u201clower our tones, talk at a slower pace, describe things matter-of-factly.\u201dThey were joined on the radio by a cardiologist, Gonzalo D\u00edaz Babio, to offer advice to listeners with heart conditions.\u201cWe wanted people to be able to follow the game in a more relaxed way,\u201d Uranga said. \u201cThe doctor was there to give tips to people who were listening, to remind them not to eat too much, to get plenty of exercise beforehand, to drink lots of water and not so much alcohol.\u201dThat first game, a 2-2 tie, was a challenge: Dar\u00edo Benedetto, the Boca striker, put the hosts ahead in first half injury time. Uranga managed to keep his calm. \u201cI said that he had scored, and I described what had happened in the passage of play that had led to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not say it was some great tragedy for River.\u201dThe three of them will be back together on Saturday, when the stakes are higher still, the drama even greater. The first leg, after all, was never going to prove decisive. This, in contrast, will. For Boca and River, for the thousands who made the Bombonera shake, for the hundreds who have made the journey, for an entire nation, this is it.Uranga knows the context. He knows how much it means, exactly what the reward of victory and the cost of defeat will be. But it is his job to ignore it, to play it down, to remember on behalf of the audience hanging on his every word and the nation holding its breath that, at the end of it all, it is only a game and that some prices are not worth paying.\u201cIt is the most important game in the history of Argentine football, the final de todos los tiempos,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is still not as important as life and death.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Carmakers, Auto Shows Are No Longer Can\u2019t-Miss Events", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsPARIS \u2014 At the Paris Motor Show last month, the first international extravaganza of the new-car season, the press had to scramble to find the special among the predictable.The excitement among the media scrum \u2014 short-lived as it was \u2014 flowed from a stand introducing the VinFast, a generic-looking S.U.V. that was to be the first car built in Vietnam (the company had a sedan, as well). Miss Vietnam, in glamorous attire, was there, along with dancers in traditional clothing holding long sticks.At the next stand over, with music blaring, a modest group of fans sized up Ferrari\u2019s blood-red 488 Pista: 710 horsepower, base price $350,000.Such is the state of the auto show in 2018: A start-up from Vietnam grabs the media glory, and \u2014 Ferrari notwithstanding \u2014 companies like Ford and Fiat, Volvo and Volkswagen, don\u2019t even bother to show up.Perhaps Mr. Diess was taken by the joyous contrast at Goodwood, which showcases cars in a bucolic outdoor setting and offers visitors ride-and-drives, concerts and champagne along with the latest models.And in an attention-getting twist, Volvo elected to rent a stand and not display a single vehicle. As Marten Levenstam, a Volvo executive, explained to reporters: \u201cNow is the time to really do different things in a different way. This is just one example of that.\u201d Instead of cars, Volvo and its partner company Luminar displayed advances in LiDar technology, which uses lasers to aid autonomous vehicles in detecting objects in their surroundings.Furthermore, the roster of no-shows so far announced for Detroit this coming January, before the switch, is already formidable: Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, among others, have already confirmed that they won\u2019t attend. Of course, many no-show companies send scouts to assess the competition.What used to be obligatory attendance at big-time shows, to attract thousands of media types in one place, is now past.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a proper unveil for a show, we won\u2019t go,\u201d said Mark Dahnke, a spokesman for Audi.He likes to mention the adoption of a \u201claunch cadence,\u201d and Audi\u2019s conviction that bringing journalists to a one-off event, to spend a day or two with the car, is the more effective road to press attention. To that end, Audi recently invited 1,200 auto writers to San Francisco for the introduction of the E-tron, an electric S.U.V.\u201cIf you do have a big reveal, the media doesn\u2019t have enough time to digest properly what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Dahnke said, referring to auto-show introductions. Reporters \u201care covering 10 or 15 different brands in a day, and it causes you not to be able to cover a larger topic that might be more complex.\u201dFor some manufacturers, the return isn\u2019t worth the investment. A major presence at a show, with a display and newsconference \u2014 plus lighting, music, catering and the other accouterments \u2014 can cost a half-million dollars or much more.Often the funds are funneled elsewhere. Pointed messages and high-resolution artwork and clips are targeted to consumers though Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.The digital landscape, over all, has altered how cars are marketed: Last year, BMW introduced its M5 in an Electronic Arts video game. (BMW did take the opportunity in France to unveil its new 3 Series sedan.)\u201cAll the manufacturers are handing out photos, spec sheets, interviews in advance of a lot of these shows,\u201d said Steve Keyes, communications director for Centigrade in Detroit, which handles publicity for Alfa Romeo, Genesis and other brands. \u201cIf I\u2019m a journalist, I\u2019ve got all the information I need before a show \u2014 well, going to one is sort of a moot point.\u201dDespite the declaration of Mr. Diess at VW, one exception to the trend of abandoning the auto show, at least in the United States, is Volkswagen.\u201cBecause of the large attendances, auto shows sell cars,\u201d said Greg Lucia, a marketing spokesman for Volkswagen. \u201cWe look at auto shows as a fundamental way to get our product in front of consumers who are in the purchase funnel.\u201dMark Gillies, a spokesman for VW of America added: \u201cFor us as a small brand in the U.S., shows bring in large numbers of media. We can get the kind of exposure that\u2019s difficult for a 2 percent player, the way a General Motors or Toyota can do outside of an auto show venue.\u201dMr. Diess\u2019s damning opinion grates on many other decision makers in the automotive industry, who say the major shows \u2014 which usually open in the fall in Paris or Frankfurt and extend into the spring in Geneva and New York \u2014 are the defining ingredient to entice customers into showrooms.\u201cAbout 68 percent of those who come to our show are in the market for making a car decision,\u201d said Mark Schienberg, who was visiting Paris in October. \u201cThat\u2019s where the investment really takes off.\u201d Mr. Schienberg is president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, which organizes the New York International Auto Show each spring.\u201cThe issue for manufacturers is that they only have 20 minutes to do a press conference,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want more time. We get it. But we stress to them, do something at the show, because you can\u2019t fit 6,800 journalists in whatever outside venue they\u2019re doing.\u201dWhile reports of the auto show\u2019s death may be exaggerated, the portents are ominous.In Paris, acres of show floor were occupied by motorcycles and lots of Suzuki cars and trucks, a budget line that has largely abandoned the United States market. (It still sells motorcycles here.) And some of the companies that did go to Paris tried to leverage the situation by negotiating for a lower stand rental. That didn\u2019t work, said Jean-Claude Girot, the event\u2019s chief.\u201cI am not receptive to that,\u201d Mr. Girot said. \u201cWe are a commercial operation, and we must have profits.\u201dHe did allow that changing the generic formula is a must. \u201cWe have to reinvent \u2014 be more inventive, but no less interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cSmaller booths, perhaps. We have to fight to be better, to show better things to the visitors and press, and to keep the passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In U.S.-India Trade, Trump Sees Only Harley-Davidson", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 When it comes to trade, it often seems that India and the United States are playing a perplexing game of multidimensional chess.\u201cThe sanctions threat and the tariffs are in many ways linked,\u201d said Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the school of international affairs at O. P. Jindal Global University outside New Delhi.Yet Mr. Trump has voiced little interest in such policy questions or the rounds of negotiations that have kept the two countries from an all-out trade war. Instead, he has been publicly riveted by one small pawn in the game: India\u2019s tariffs on a few hundred high-end Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold here each year.Three times this year when Mr. Trump brought up the American trade relationship with India, he complained about the import duties \u2014 currently 50 percent \u2014 that India levies on Harleys and other foreign-made motorcycles.Mr. Trump\u2019s single-minded focus on Harleys has mystified trade experts in both countries.Most of the 3,000 Harleys sold in India last year did not incur any tariffs. That\u2019s because they were cheaper, low-powered models made in a factory outside New Delhi. Even many of the fancier bikes sold here were assembled from kits of imported parts, which are taxed at 15 percent, not 50 percent.Harley-Davidson\u2019s biggest problem in India is a lack of demand.Harleys are bulky and heat up a rider\u2019s legs, making them a poor fit for the country\u2019s traffic-choked roads and sweltering climate. And they are expensive. With an average annual income of $1,700, people here overwhelmingly favor small, cheap bikes, some of which cost less than $1,000. Harley\u2019s iconic big cruisers cost more than most cars, with its top model exceeding $87,000 in Mumbai after all taxes and licensing fees.Darryl Mathias, operations manager for the Mumbai dealership, Seven Islands Harley-Davidson, said sales had dropped about 50 percent in the past two years. He blamed rising gasoline prices and the Indian government\u2019s efforts to crack down on cash transactions more than the tariffs.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to show their wealth,\u201d he said.American officials say the president initially seized on the Harley tariffs after the Milwaukee company\u2019s chief executive, Matthew Levatich, complained to him about them. When Mr. Trump raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year, India dropped the tariffs from 75 percent to 50 percent.Harley-Davidson executives declined interview requests. In a statement, the company said it \u201csupports President Trump\u2019s efforts to lower tariffs and make American manufacturers more competitive.\u201dIndian and American government officials also declined to elaborate about the trade relationship, citing active negotiations and the pending decisions on tariffs and sanctions.For most officials in the two countries, the trade relationship is much more complicated than just motorcycles.The United States and India have been arguing over trade since the Obama administration, when they tangled over American exports of eggs and solar panels to India as well as India\u2019s weak protections for foreign intellectual property such as drug formulas.Trade hawks in the Trump administration such as Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, have made the $27.3 billion trade deficit in goods and services with India a key issue. American dairy farmers, for example, complain that they do not have fair access to India\u2019s markets because of high tariffs and India\u2019s requirement that all milk comes from cows that have not been fed the internal organs of other animals. That milk certification is important to Hindus, many of whom are vegetarians, but many American farmers cannot meet it.\u201cWe need to have reciprocal trade,\u201d Gilbert B. Kaplan, the American under secretary of commerce for international trade, said at a conference hosted by the U.S.-India Business Council here in September.This year, India irked American companies by increasing tariffs on products ranging from shoes to mobile phones to help balance its budget and stem a fall in the value of the rupee.Separately, the country announced that it would raise tariffs on 29 categories of American goods, including nuts, apples and finished metal products, in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.The items targeted influential industries such as almond growers, who last year shipped $651 million of the nuts to India, their largest market. But India deferred the start of the tariffs from June to September and then to Nov. 2. The government may well delay the tariffs again, Mr. Chaulia said, to assess the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections in the United States and what effect that would have on the American negotiating position.India, for its part, wants the United States to reduce tariffs on its exports of clothing and textiles, for which it pays higher duties than neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Modi administration is also adamant about maintaining its hefty subsidies for homegrown agricultural products to court Indian farmers, who are a key voting bloc.Looming over everything are geopolitical concerns.In addition to continuing oil purchases from Iran, Mr. Modi signed a deal with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Oct. 5 to buy Russian S-400 antiaircraft missile systems. The $5.2 billion purchase violates American trade sanctions against Russia and will eventually trigger penalties for India unless Mr. Trump approves a waiver.Trade experts predict that neither country will be quick to antagonize the other.\u201cUnder no circumstance would the Indian government give up its close relationship with the U.S. government,\u201d said Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi who has represented the Indian government on trade issues and formerly served on the board of the Export-Import Bank of India.Mr. Chaulia said India was also clear about its economic commitment to Iran. India has invested heavily there, including hundreds of millions of dollars in the seaport of Chabahar in southeastern Iran. The Trump administration wants a regime change in Iran \u2014 and India does not, he said.Eliminating the Harley tariffs is a way to ease the trade drama and please the American president, Mr. Chaulia said. \u201cAll Trump needs is to declare a win,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the nitty-gritty.\u201dAlan Rappeport and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington, and Maria Abi-Habib from New Delhi.

And while that feeling is nowhere near comparable to the suffering of those fleeing and battling the fires that are burning away the Western landscape, the toxic smoke is a bleak backdrop and an apt metaphor for where Silicon Valley now finds itself.Much of the mess, of course, has been emanating from one company: Facebook.

This was a practice he continued by sitting behind Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearings as his chief cheerleader. Conflict of interest much? Very much.The overall sense of this year is that the brilliant digital minds who told us they were changing the world for the better might have miscalculated.Actually no one wonders that anymore, which is why it\u2019s probably time to think about where the industry goes from here. While I can be hard on tech, I still have hope that it can regain its innovation, inspiration and sunny approach to the future.To do this, I have five suggestions:The fact that no one seems to get fired for anything at these companies is really quite breathtaking. Techies are fond of the obviously false bromide that failure is O.K. If it is so fine, one wonders why no one is being held publicly responsible for anything, aside from the tiresome apology tours that are on replay in Silicon Valley. Privacy breaches at Yahoo and Facebook and Google and everywhere? So sorry. Payoffs to alleged sexual harassers all over the system? So sorry. Questionable financing? So sorry. Yeah, I am sorry that they are so sorry, too, but actions should follow words.After trying several times to get an answer from him, I got frustrated: \u201cWhat kind of responsibility do you feel?\u201d I said I would feel sick to my stomach to know that people died possibly \u201cbecause of something I invented. What does that make you feel like? What do you do when you see that? What do you do yourself? What\u2019s your emotion?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s answer left me cold. And also more than a little worried for the future of his company. It\u2019s bad enough not to be able to anticipate disaster; it\u2019s worse, after disaster strikes, to not be able to reflect on how it happened. \u201cI mean, my emotion is feeling a deep sense of responsibility to try to fix the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a \u2026 that\u2019s the most productive stance.\u201dBut it\u2019s not the most productive stance.

That was the future Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation\u2019s industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest \u2014 cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland.The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast\u2019s high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes.So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history?First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions \u2014 the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there \u2014 a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next.This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu.San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates \u2014 most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services \u2014 there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable.This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need.This isn\u2019t an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish.No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted.Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Seventy years ago, Simone de Beauvoir wrote that pregnancy can be both \u201can enrichment and a mutilation\u201d; the mother \u201cfeels as vast as the world, but this very richness annihilates her \u2014 she has the impression of not being anything else.\u201dTalk about blaming the victims.According to USA Today, when asked about their decision not to scrutinize medical care, some doctors on the panels said they didn\u2019t have the resources, and that hospitals don\u2019t like to (and aren\u2019t required to) hand over their dead patients\u2019 charts. Lawmakers claimed that it wasn\u2019t the job of the state to meddle with doctors\u2019 decisions. And state officials argued that it was more important to focus on broader issues surrounding maternal health than on what may have gone wrong in specific women\u2019s cases.But it is hard to imagine some other scenario in which patients are dying in hospitals from complications of routine procedures \u2014 appendectomies, say \u2014 and instead of studying the care the patients received leading up to their deaths, review panels focus on the patients\u2019 lifestyles in the year before their procedure. \u201cThey did save me in the end,\u201d she says, \u201cbut after they almost killed me.\u201dMs. Williams\u2019s story offered a personal glimpse into an epidemic of preventable deaths that has long been ignored in this country. This sounds simplistic, but it had a powerful effect. \u201cWhat you have to understand,\u201d Dr. MacDorman explained, \u201cis that these emergencies are horrible and they happen too often, but still, they\u2019re not common. An O.B. might easily go a year without encountering such an emergency.\u201dThese numbers, disturbing as they are, don\u2019t account for the far greater number of women who are injured during delivery or suffer the trauma of near-death experiences. For many, this trauma can last a lifetime.Claire, who also asked that I use only her first name, was 38 weeks into her fourth pregnancy in 1992 when she went into the hospital certain she was in active labor. She protested when the doctor decided that the baby wasn\u2019t full-term and gave shots to halt the labor. A few weeks later the baby\u2019s head descended and Claire returned to the hospital, but the baby was now so big that she labored unsuccessfully for 24 hours before undergoing an emergency C-section. This is how she described her experience: \u201cThey gave me an epidural and asked me if I could feel the knife and I said, \u2018Yes, I can,\u2019 and they didn\u2019t believe me. They said that\u2019s impossible. But I kept saying, \u2018No, I can feel it.\u2019\u201d Then her blood pressure dropped. \u201cI hear my husband say, \u2018Look at her blood pressure.\u2019 And the doctor said, \u2018Oh, that must be a malfunction of the machine.\u2019 Then I hear, \u2018Oh, my God, she\u2019s going into shock,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cAt one point I heard them say, \u2018We\u2019re going to lose her, we\u2019re going to lose the baby\u2019.\u201dClaire still remembers it as one of the most terrifying experiences of her life. \u201cI never completely got over it,\u201d she told me. \u201cI have a daughter now who\u2019s pregnant.

{"Headline": "Armistice Day and Our \u2018Forever Wars\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy do they drag on interminably? Because one side lacks the means to win and the other lacks the will.Opinion ColumnistThis has been a week of drawing lessons from World War I. Here\u2019s mine: What was commemorated in Paris on Sunday as the centenary of the end of the First World War could equally be remembered as the starting date of the Second. Wars that don\u2019t end decisively \u2014 in absolute victory for one side and unequivocal defeat for the other \u2014 tend not to end at all.This idea \u2014 that the European \u201cpeace\u201d that held from 1918 to 1939 was really just a pause in a single long war that ended only with Germany\u2019s surrender in 1945 \u2014 is hardly original to me. But it\u2019s worth considering as America wages forever wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria (where we still deploy thousands of troops), and Israel wages equally endless wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.Why do they drag on interminably? Because one side lacks the means to win and the other lacks the will.One of those wars flared again this week as Hamas hit Israel with some 460 rockets and mortars and Israel responded with airstrikes of more than 100 targets in Gaza. Belying his reputation for hawkishness, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly accepted another Hamas cease-fire, leading his defense minister to resign in protest and Hamas to claim a tactical victory.Netanyahu sees no better outcome for Israel in Gaza than to accept what amounts to a kind of low-grade fever in Hamas\u2019s violent but relatively controlled and predictable rule. If anything, Gaza serves him as a political billboard of sorts \u2014 a warning to the Israeli public of what it can expect of a Palestinian state should one ever come into being.This is a policy of palliatives, and maybe it\u2019s better than the conceivable alternatives: stronger Israeli military action that results in more Palestinian casualties, and more international condemnation; a war to remove the Hamas leadership by force, which would be considerably bloodier without guaranteeing that Hamas won\u2019t return to power once Israel leaves; or full-scale re-occupation of the Strip, which leaves Israel with responsibility for the lives of some two million Palestinians.Worse, by accepting Hamas as the quasi-legitimate power in Gaza, Netanyahu has helped tilt Palestinian politics in a radical direction, a combination of Islamist intolerance, anti-Semitic bigotry, and a cult of violence and \u201cmartyrdom.\u201d Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president-for-life, is a sad excuse for a moderate, but there can be no hope of genuinely moderate Palestinian politics when Hamas is the pre-eminent actor in them.In each of these conflicts, there were good reasons to pursue aims short of victory, above all to prevent needless deaths. But it\u2019s also wrong to suppose that restraint doesn\u2019t also impose costs, or that the costs won\u2019t eventually translate to casualties \u2014 casualties that can dwarf even great immediate sacrifice.On October 30, 1918, Gen. John J. Pershing, the American commander in Europe, delivered a letter to the Allied Supreme War Council in which he made the case for fighting until Germany surrendered unconditionally.The tragedy of November 11, 1918, wasn\u2019t that a peace was lost. It\u2019s that, after so much sacrifice, no victory was ever gained to secure it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Starving Children, a Bite of Hope", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMalnutrition kills a million of the world\u2019s children a year. To stem that, United Nations agencies and charities are testing a new system for distributing high-nutrition foods more efficiently. As Americans gather for our most food-centric holiday, there\u2019s some potentially great news about food \u2014 especially for people who have very little to eat. It\u2019s a new strategy that could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of hungry children every year.Fifty million children under 5 suffer from acute malnutrition. It\u2019s one of the biggest contributors to the nearly one million deaths each year of children under 5. Malnutrition wears down the immune system, so a child can die from a cold. It also can cause permanent physical and cognitive damage to children who survive.But another factor is war. It\u2019s especially hard to work in those war and chaos zones where malnutrition is common. Today the most severely malnourished places are Yemen and South Sudan \u2014 both entirely man-made crises. The disruption of war means families can\u2019t work, can\u2019t reach crops and livestock or bring them to market. Health and sanitation systems shut down and workers flee.And the system requires desperate mothers to come to the food every week \u2014 which can mean walking for miles through perilous terrain, and then waiting for hours \u2014 rather than getting the food to them.The way we save hungry children needs an efficiency overhaul.O.K., successful pilot experiments happen all the time in the social sector. They almost never lead to widespread change. Even when bureaucracies endorse a new idea, officials often fear change and jealously guard their turf. Many a good idea has been studied to death.But this time might be different. The World Food Program and Unicef are enthusiastic, to the point of running joint pilot programs to test the idea in West Africa. \u201cWe are tremendously supportive,\u201d said Lauren Landis, the director of nutrition of the World Food Program. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s time for a revolution in the way we address acute malnutrition.\u201dHere\u2019s how malnourished children have been treated until now: If the child has a complication, such as pneumonia or fever, he or she goes to the hospital. Uncomplicated cases are separated into two categories, severe or moderate. (The test can be a weight/height ratio, the presence of marked water retention in the feet or the circumference of the mid upper arm.)Unicef treats severe cases, usually giving children Plumpy\u2019Nut packets to take home. The child must come back every week for a checkup and more packets. Children with moderate malnutrition go to a World Food Program feeding center, where they can get food on site and take-home food, often a corn-soy blend, to supplement the family diet.What could possibly go wrong? You name it.A large majority of malnourished children can\u2019t reach either program. \u201cMothers have to walk for hours, and even if they get there, the service might not be available,\u201d said Mesfin Teklu Tessema, senior director of health for the I.R.C.When programs do exist, a mother has no idea which one to go to. \u201cThe referral between programs doesn\u2019t always work,\u201d Ms. Landis said. And it\u2019s hard to make a weekly trip. \u201cIt\u2019s common to relapse if the mother is not able to bring the child every week to get the Plumpy\u2019Nut,\u201d said Grace Funnell, associate director of nutrition and health at Action Against Hunger.Since money is short, it is focused on treating severe cases. That means many children get no treatment for malnutrition until they deteriorate to the point where it is severe. This endangers children and creates extra costs, because they might need hospitalization. It also leads to a lot of relapses, because children can, in effect, be cut off treatment once they are only moderately malnourished.Even this flawed system, though, is far better than what came before, when hospitalization was the only treatment for severe malnutrition. In the past decade or so, the number of children treated each year has more than tripled.Much of the increase can be attributed to Plumpy\u2019Nut. The product was developed by the French company Nutriset 22 years ago but took about 10 years to reach widespread use. (It must get each government\u2019s approval, because technically it\u2019s a medicine.)With Plumpy\u2019Nut, or other similar high-nutrition blends developed since it emerged, a parent can easily treat a child at home. There\u2019s nothing to measure or prepare, and it doesn\u2019t have to be mixed with water, which is often unsafe to drink.The other factor is the growing numbers of community health workers, who fight diseases like malaria and tuberculosis effectively and cheaply. But they are still not widespread in every country, and few of them deal with malnutrition \u2014 in part because the system is so complex.The Food Program and Unicef have long been aware of the system\u2019s flaws. In 2011, they signed an agreement laying out a division of their labor. \u201cWe thought at that time we were clarifying roles and responsibilities,\u201d Ms. Landis said. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve gone on, we felt it wasn\u2019t a problem of clarifying. It was more a need to combine more closely, so children don\u2019t fall through the cracks.\u201dThe dual system arose because the Food Program historically has run feeding centers for people of all ages, and one of Unicef\u2019s missions is to train health care workers. So hospitalized children fell under Unicef\u2019s umbrella.Ms. Landis said the cost savings would come largely from switching to a single therapeutic food. \u201cSince that\u2019s the largest component of the cost of treatment, we could really save money,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we have one pipeline to buy everything, we can optimize the supply chain. And if there\u2019s one thing we know, it\u2019s a supply chain.\u201d\u201cIn principle, they are broadly sympathetic,\u201d he said.Only that?\u201cThat might be typical British understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a matter of turning good will into action.\u201d\u201cEverything we see is promising,\u201d Unicef\u2019s Dr. Aguayo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to go as fast as possible, but not faster, in the greatest interest of children\u2019s rights.\u201dOne reason for further testing, Dr. Aguayo said, was to find out how best to ensure that the most severely ill children get help in a system that treats severe and moderate alike. \u201cWe will still have limited resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to prioritize the children with the greatest risk. I\u2019m sure that we can.\u201dJeanette Bailey, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s senior technical adviser for nutrition and the leader of the just-concluded study, agreed that more pilots can test different ways to solve operational problems. But don\u2019t take too long, she cautioned. \u201cIf millions of adults were dying of Ebola, there would be outrage,\u201d she said. \u201cMalnutrition kills the youngest among us in a very slow way. It\u2019s been about a decade that we\u2019re not getting past 20 percent coverage. We can\u2019t keep letting generations of children slip through our fingers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Republicans will expand their Senate majority from the current 51-49 to as much as 54-46, pending the outcomes of a few races that as I write are still too close to call, but in which Republicans hold slim leads.Elected officials of both bodies will pay lip service to the idea of working together, and some of the more Panglossian pundits will express the hope that even this divided Congress will produce a deal on infrastructure spending or prescription drug prices. I guess maybe, but let\u2019s be realistic. What seems more likely is not only lack of cooperation but also active warfare between the two bodies.House Democrats will pass some progressive legislation, as they should, to show the nation their priorities heading into the next presidential election. But of course these bills will go nowhere in the Senate. If by some miracle the two chambers do manage to pass similar versions of a bill, the conference committee deliberations will be a food fight.So this is what we can expect. Two more years of continuing resolutions and possible government shutdowns. And if the Republicans do increase their majority to 54, it seems entirely possible that the Democrats might not recapture the majority there for a very long time indeed.From that list, I trust you can see the problem. If Democrats are having to count on North Carolina (where the party last elected a senator in 2008) and Georgia (2000) and Arizona (1988), they\u2019re barking up an awfully tall tree.In the nearer term, Democrats simply must find, field and finance candidates who can win statewide in purple states. I don\u2019t mean centrists \u2014 look at Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, who got clobbered. I mean candidates who can first excite base voters, because they must do that to be competitive, but who can also go out and get some votes in parts of these states where Democrats normally get crushed.I\u2019m tired of watching election-night returns and seeing dots of blue in oceans of red. Democrats won\u2019t make huge dents in those oceans, even with a solid rural strategy, but remember \u2014 they don\u2019t need to.

{"Headline": "How Mark Zuckerberg Became Too Big to Fail", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artFacebook has had a turbulent two years. But almost no one in tech thinks Mr. Zuckerberg, the social network\u2019s chief executive, should step down from the company he built. I\u2019ll spare you the suspense. Just about everyone thought Mr. Zuckerberg was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who currently work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters.The consensus went like this: Even if Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 as Facebook\u2019s founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder \u2014 bore most of the responsibility for the company\u2019s cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it. More than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject \u2014 that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook\u2019s problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated \u2014 not the man who runs it.\u201cTo be blunt, if we took Mark Zuckerberg out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don\u2019t think the corporation would change in any significant way,\u201d Mr. Lynn said.That few can imagine a Facebook without Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebook makes decisions that create huge consequences for society \u2014 and he has profited handsomely from the chaos.Yet because of Facebook\u2019s ownership structure \u2014 in which Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares \u2014 he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one. This fits a pattern. Over the last two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures \u2014 when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them.There\u2019s another way to put this: For better or worse, Mr. Zuckerberg has become too big to fail.In America, it\u2019s not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders\u2019 dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts. Facebook\u2019s problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebook has been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 American presidential election. If Facebook admits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that\u2019s happening if most of the people who run Facebook remain the same?When I asked Facebook about this, the company argued that things were changing. It just hired Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of Britain, as head of global affairs \u2014 a move that the company said imbued it with a serious outsider\u2019s perspective.The social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership, but declined to do so on the record. The executive explained that fixing Facebook would involve deep costs. The company is hiring more people to review content, for example, and it might have to slow down some of its most ambitious projects to address its impact on the world. The executive argued that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s total domination of Facebook\u2019s equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s supporters also argued that he has shown a deep capacity to understand and address Facebook\u2019s problems. After the company went public in 2012, its stock price languished for months because it had no plan to make money from consumers\u2019 shift to mobile devices.\u201cMark would tell you that he was too late in understanding the importance of mobile \u2014 but when that became apparent, Mark understood its gravity and he understood how to fix it,\u201d said Don Graham, a former Facebook board member and former publisher of The Washington Post. \u201cHe changed the direction of that company incredibly fast, in detail, not by one action but by 20 actions \u2014 and if you looked at the quarter-by-quarter numbers of what percentage of Facebook\u2019s revenue was coming from mobile, I couldn\u2019t believe how fast it changed.\u201dThe question at Facebook now is whether Mr. Zuckerberg has similarly seen the light on its current problems. He has said fixing Facebook was his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same. \u201cI think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he\u2019s failed is because he\u2019s unaccountable,\u201d said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. \u201cGiven a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it\u2019s hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.\u201d\u201cI think by taking the step to relinquish the position of the board chair, it\u2019s a very important structural change so that he would not have a completely free hand to muscle his way through decisions,\u201d said Jonas Kron, a Trillium senior vice president.A Facebook spokesman said the company had not yet taken a position on the resolution. In the past, similar measures have been voted down by Mr. Zuckerberg and his allies. Which leaves us here: Either Mr. Zuckerberg fixes Facebook, or no one does. That\u2019s the choice we face, like it or not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jets, Horses and Bribes: How a Venezuelan Official Became a Billionaire as His Country Crumbled", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe opulent lifestyle of the Andrade family was as spectacular as the economic collapse of the country they left behind.Venezuelan immigrants, the family lived in a mansion in Florida surrounded by show horses, as neighbors peeked over the property line in awe. The family patriarch, Alejandro Andrade, had been a bodyguard of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez before rising to powerful positions in his government.This month, Mr. Andrade will be known for something else: On Nov. 27, he is expected to be sentenced for taking bribes as Venezuela\u2019s treasurer, in a money-laundering scheme that made him a billionaire.Venezuela is facing its worst economic crisis in modern history. Inflation and devastating shortages of food and medicine have forced more than three million people to flee the country, according to the United Nations.But among those who have left Venezuela is a small clique that made untold fortunes, including government officials, well-connected businessmen and military leaders who siphoned off billions of dollars. Many argue that this deep-rooted corruption laid the groundwork for the collapse of Venezuela today.The beneficiaries even have a name: The \u201cboligarchs,\u201d a term often used for the new oligarchy that emerged under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Socialist-inspired \u201cBolivarian Revolution.\u201d\u201cHow could it be that a government employee had 60 horses?\u201d said Franklin Hoet-Linares, a Venezuelan lawyer who lives a short distance from Mr. Andrade\u2019s house in Wellington, Fla., near West Palm Beach.He is one of many Venezuelan officials accused of enriching themselves from state coffers or illegal activities.And President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s inner circle \u2014 including his wife, his defense minister and others \u2014 \u201csystematically plunders what remains of Venezuela\u2019s wealth,\u201d American officials contend. Several of them are also under sanctions.The American government\u2019s case against Mr. Andrade is, in fact, built around another Venezuelan billionaire, Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, who owns the news network Globovisi\u00f3n and has been living in Miami.Mr. Gorr\u00edn asked Mr. Andrade \u2014 identified as \u201cForeign Official 1\u201d \u2014 to help him secure the lucrative rights to conduct foreign currency exchanges for the Venezuelan government, according to the federal documents.When Mr. Andrade received a bill for $174,800 to transport his horses, he simply sent it to Mr. Gorr\u00edn, who paid the invoice from his personal bank account in Switzerland. In 2012, Mr. Gorr\u00edn sent a $20 million wire transfer from a Swiss bank to purchase an aircraft for Mr. Andrade, according to Mr. Andrade\u2019s plea deal.Separate charges against Mr. Gorr\u00edn, including nine counts of money laundering, were unsealed this week. Mr. Andrade and other Venezuelans fell under the jurisdiction of American prosecutors who say their money laundering transactions passed through the United States financial system.Mr. Andrade has forfeited his assets \u2014 including real estate, aircraft, horses and bank accounts \u2014 and faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Gabriel Jim\u00e9nez, a Venezuelan in Chicago who owned a bank used to pay the bribes, also pleaded guilty, American officials said.In Venezuela Mr. Andrade was known by the nickname \u201cthe One-Eye,\u201d after a common story, that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez hit him in the eye by mistake during a baseball game. The two originally became close when Mr. Andrade participated in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s failed attempt to take power in a 1992 coup.In 1998, when Mr. Ch\u00e1vez ran for president and won, Mr. Andrade served as his bodyguard. A decade later, he had risen up the ranks to a much more prominent role, as the head of the treasury.Then in 2012, not long before Mr. Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer, Mr. Andrade moved to Florida.The Andrades were perhaps best known in the United States for their horses, with a lavish collection of steeds and their colorful names, like Bon Jovi and Hardrock Z.\u201cHe had a lot of horses,\u201d said Elizabeth Madden, an American Olympic-medal winning equestrian. \u201cYou see that in this industry, people buying horses and stuff like that. You don\u2019t know where the money comes from.\u201dThe elder Mr. Andrade became known in Florida social circles, too, according to McLain Ward, an Olympic equestrian medalist who said Mr. Andrade sponsored young rider events, often ones in which his son was competing.But beyond that, the details on the family were vague, he said.\u201cWe knew that he was a Venezuelan living here, but about his family, not so well,\u201d said Mr. Ward, who said he sold two horses to the Andrades a couple of years ago. \u201cWe knew they were involved in the government in some way.\u201dMr. Hoet-Linares, the Venezuelan lawyer who lives close to the Andrade mansion, said he remains angry at the profiteering of well-connected Venezuelans while many people in the country do not have enough to eat.Two years ago, he said, he accosted Mr. Andrade at a party about the sums he had taken and the possibility of using money to reconstruct Venezuela.\u201cI said, \u2018Look, let\u2019s find a way to help the country,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hoet-Linares recalled. \u201cI think he was a little surprised. He said, \u2018I\u2019m off to a trip, we can talk when I\u2019m back.\u2019\u201dMr. Hoet-Linares says he did not hear back. But while the seizure of Mr. Andrade\u2019s assets is a step in the right direction, he said, it\u2019s far from enough.\u201cThe most perverse thing about Venezuelan corruption is that the money that they take internationally and in the U.S. does not go to the treasury of Venezuela,\u201d he said.The equestrian community this week was also at a loss for what to make of the amount of money that the Andrades had amassed.\u201cIf he\u2019s as strong of a rider as I think he is, he\u2019ll bounce back,\u201d Allie Rose Crowell, an equestrian competitor, wrote on Facebook about Emanuel Andrade in reaction to the news.\u201cBut I\u2019m not forgiving people who steal a billion dollars from one of the poorest nations on the planet, and using it for their own self interest.\u201dSarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Rake Leaves on a Windy Day", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the elections, a red-state liberal ponders futility \u2014 and against all odds, arrives at hope.Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 Leaf blowers are like giant whining insects that have moved into your skull. They are swarming just behind your eyes, drilling deep inside your teeth. Leaf blowers have ruined autumn with their insistent whine and their noxious fumes, and they are everywhere. You may believe it is futile to resist them, but you still can. In almost every situation where something is loud, obnoxious and seemingly ubiquitous, resistance is an option.Head to the weathered shed in your backyard and fiddle with the rusty padlock until it finally yields. Reach into the corner where you keep the shovel and the posthole digger and the pruning shears. From that jumble of wonderful tools requiring no gasoline, pull out a rake. Quite some time has elapsed since you last used the rake, and its tines may be a bit crooked now, bent here and there along the row. Never mind, the rake will do. Making do is part of the point.Think of how the rake reminds you of the comb your mother tugged gently through your clean hair after a bath. Think of the way your mother smelled as she leaned close to untangle the snarls. Remember how your damp hair held the rows the comb left behind, like new-planted peanuts in your grandfather\u2019s fields. That\u2019s what the grass will look like after you\u2019ve cleared it of leaves.Take care to lift the rake a little when you arrive at the raised roots of the maple trees and the margins of the yard where the lawn mower can\u2019t reach beneath the tangle of honeysuckle. Don\u2019t push too far into those hidden spaces beneath woody shrubs or the hollows between tree roots. This is where small crawling things are hiding, sheltering under the damp leaves. When the birds finally return in springtime, these little stirring creatures will be a feast for their nestlings. Whatever it might feel like on this damp November day, remind yourself that springtime is coming.Don\u2019t let the wind become a frustration to you. This is not the time for insisting on perfection. We are making do now, remember? In a forest, fallen leaves compost themselves to feed the trees. The leaves you miss in raking will molder and rot through the winter, generating their own heat and protecting large trees and small creatures alike. Think of your desultory raking as a way to feed the trees, as an investment in the urban forest.When the wind rises, pause. Stand still. This is your chance to smell the living soil stirred up by raking. Its pungent scent may recall to you the long-ago taste of mud pies and the smell of centipedes.While you\u2019re breathing in the scent of the ancient soil, listen for the squirrels. They will be fussing at you from the treetops, scolding you for turning up the dirt they have claimed for their own planting. All autumn long, the squirrels have been sowing nuts and acorns across the landscape. Take a moment to wonder, leaning on your rake, how many forests the squirrels\u2019 thumbless hands have planted in all the busy autumns of their kind.Now, see? For a moment you have managed to forget the leaf blowers! You have failed to note the sounds of traffic on the nearby street where everyone is in a hurry and always drives too fast. For a moment, too, you have forgotten your worries \u2014 your own small worries and the bigger worries of the world.Remember that one day soon the wind will die down, the tree limbs will be bare, and the small creatures that live beneath the leaf litter will burrow deep into the cold ground. For now, give yourself over to what is happening in the sky. Watch the leaves unloose themselves from their branches and deliver themselves to the wind. Watch the wind, which you cannot see, catch and lift the leaves, which you can see. Watch the wind catch them, lift them, drop them and lift them again. Again and again and again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Key to Stopping the Illegal Wildlife Trade: China", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScience Times at 40The country is a critical market for animal contraband. Some scientists fear the official commitment to conservation may be wavering. Many of the creatures that share this planet with us may not be around much longer.But so is the global illegal trade in wildlife. For species like tigers and rhinos, poaching is a primary threat to survival.\u201cVery few ecosystems are not affected by wildlife trade,\u201d said Vincent Nijman, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University in Britain. \u201cIt directly impacts a very large number of species, and has a knock-on effect on many more species still.\u201dBut, as Dr. Nijman pointed out, any solutions for tackling illegal wildlife trade are unlikely to work without the involvement of one major player: China.Until recently, China seemed to have signed on to the cause. President Xi Jinping, who has pledged to turn the country into an \u201cecological civilization,\u201d stepped up seizures of contraband animal products and created a new national park to provide a haven for Siberian tigers. In January, Mr. Xi banned the domestic trade in ivory.\u201cThis development came as a surprise to us, because China, at the moment, is leading in so many ways on the environment,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. \u201cWe should be stepping up protection for tigers and rhinos, not lowering it.\u201dChina\u2019s State Council directed that rhino horn and tiger bone be limited to use in scientific research and in traditional Chinese medicine, practiced by qualified doctors at certain hospitals.Officials also pledged to strictly control trade, a reassurance that did little to assuage concerns that poaching was about to spiral even further out of control.Indeed, just three days after China\u2019s announcement, Jose Louies, chief of the wildlife crime control division at the Wildlife Trust of India, received a call from an informant who said that tiger traffickers had begun anticipating a price increase.\u201cPoachers keep their ears to the ground \u2014 they feel everything that is happening in the market,\u201d Mr. Louies said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret for them that all the tiger materials are going to China.\u201dThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) banned international commercial trade of rhinos and most tigers in 1975. But for decades afterward, China permitted domestic sales of products made from these animals.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussIn 1993, under a law called the Pelly Amendment, President Bill Clinton threatened China with sanctions for undermining the Cites treaty. China responded with a ban on rhino horn and tiger bone, and poaching declined significantly.\u201cBy banning those products, the Chinese government made a significant contribution to conservation of rhinos and tigers over the past twenty years,\u201d said Zhang Li, a field biologist at the Beijing Normal University.Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine quickly followed suit, replacing the banned materials with sustainable substitutes and removing tiger bone and rhino horn \u2014 which have no scientifically proven benefits \u2014 from textbooks and the pharmacopoeia.\u201cIf the government\u2019s intention by lifting this ban is to support Chinese medicine, the result is the opposite,\u201d said Lixin Huang, executive director of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in California.She suspects that the decision was encouraged not by practitioners of traditional medicine, but by \u201cthose dealing in the business of profit-making\u201d \u2014 tiger farmers.Rather than shutter after the 1993 ban, tiger farms continued to grow and now house over 6,000 captive animals. For over a decade, China has expressed interest in domestic trade of its captive tigers\u2019 parts.But at a Cites meeting last month in Sochi, Russia, Chinese officials strongly opposed the findings, according to Heather Sohl, a chief adviser at the World Wildlife Fund who attended the meeting.Officials did not mention the country\u2019s impending decision to reopen trade.\u201cChina has quite often restricted progress on tackling tiger trade discussions we have at Cites,\u201d Ms. Sohl said. The fact that officials questioned proposals to control tiger trade \u201cwasn\u2019t unusual and didn\u2019t give us any insight that this was coming.\u201dMichael \u2018t Sas-Rolfes, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford who toured tiger farms at the invitation of the Chinese government in 2007, was not surprised.\u201cThe only part of this that was completely unexpected for me was the timing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese focus has always been more on conserving a species as a resource, not on the Western focus of conserving a species in its habitat.\u201dEven as Western countries have pushed for blanket bans on certain wildlife products, he continued, demand for those products in certain quarters of Asia has not fallen. Instead, illegal trade and the profits to be made from it have increased.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that China\u2019s move may serve as a bit of a wake-up call that the \u2018just say no\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. \u2018t Sas-Rolfes said.\u201cThe conversation on drugs has evolved into something more sophisticated \u2014 smoking pot is not the same as shooting up with heroin. And we need to apply the same nuanced, evidence-based thinking to wildlife trade.\u201dSome are eager to see China\u2019s markets reopen.\u201cRather than criminals coming here, wantonly killing our animals, we can now supply horn from stockpiles to meet the demand and take pressure away from wild populations,\u201d said Pelham Jones, chairman of the Private Rhino Owners Association in South Africa.China\u2019s directive specified that tiger bones and rhino horns must come from farmed animals, but not that they be farmed in China. Conservationists believe the number of rhinos in China to be very small.By contrast, over 7,000 rhinos live on at least 300 private ranches in South Africa. Nearly 90 percent of rhino owners are keen to sell their animals\u2019 horns, which can be clipped every few years.The profits, they say, will help cover the steep security costs of keeping poachers at bay.\u201cThere\u2019s only one country in the world that can meet China\u2019s demand, and that\u2019s South Africa,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Whether a proposal to reopen international trade of rhino horn could pass at Cites depends on a number of technicalities in the treaty and on whether proponents could rally enough support.The United States has started looking into options of its own for ensuring that China\u2019s domestic ban on tiger and rhino trade remains in place, said Christine Dawson, director of the office of conservation and water at the State Department. That includes the possibility of recertifying China under the Pelly Amendment, which would pave the way for sanctions.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake for these two major economies, and the leverage may never be better for the U.S. to fold this issue into the broader trade issues going on right now,\u201d said David J. Hayes, executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center at New York University.Mr. \u2018t Sas-Rolfes pointed out, however, that the Pelly Amendment might have lost its potency in a China with rising influence on the world stage. In any event, officials now may simply decide not to follow through with the directive.\u201cLet us hope that China recognizes the stark inconsistency of this decision with its laudable stance on ivory, and takes steps to ban the trade of rhino horn and tiger bones altogether,\u201d said Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary of Britain. Whatever comes of the tiger bone and rhino horn controversy, Dr. Nijman emphasized that global collaboration \u2014 and perhaps compromise \u2014 with China might be key to solving the much bigger challenge of illegal wildlife trade.\u201cThat means trying to better understand the Chinese way of thinking and working directly with them for solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe solutions may not be the ones we initially thought were perhaps best from our Western perspective, but ultimately they may be the only way forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I felt like I was kind of small, and there was something really big going on.\u201d\u201cHow can we expect the public to support the judiciary and the Constitution and the rule of law when they know so little about it?\u201d Judge Katzmann asked, sitting in his 24th-floor chambers before heading downstairs to meet the students.\u201cThere needs to be a shared understanding of the principles underlying our governmental system,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf that is lost, then what I worry about is that our support for our institutions will go under.\u201dAfter the students finished their tour, Judge Katzmann told them about his family, and about his own experience growing up in the city, attending public schools in Queens and commuting by bus and subway, just as they do. He was joined by Victor Marrero, a senior district judge and co-chairman of the civic-education initiative, who attended public school in the Bronx; and Richard Sullivan, who had been confirmed as a judge for the appeals court only days before, and whose parents grew up a block apart from each other in Queens.As the judges spoke about their lives and various paths to the court, the students, who started out nervous and quiet, relaxed and began to ask questions \u2014 the reaction Judge Katzmann was hoping for. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve done moot courts, I take the students back to the robing room and I say, \u2018Put on the robe,\u2019 \u201d he said later. \u201cAnd these are often kids of color. I say, this could be your future. And you really can see in their faces, oh yes, this could be their future.\u201dAshley Santacruz, a 12th grader whose parents are from Peru, said she was surprised to learn of Judge Katzmann\u2019s background. \u201cThe normal concept I think many people hold is that judges come from families that are judges and attorneys, and they have this life that is just very successful and very easy. And it was very admirable to see that it\u2019s not that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat just motivated me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.And the stock markets are a mess.On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.The stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.The pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.The sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.But the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201dUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.So far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.But those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.Strong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.In recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.On Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.Apple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.Oil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.Last quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.In 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.For the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.Disappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.In other words, the market may be messy for a while.\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201dClifford Krauss and Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Instagram, Seeing Between the (Gender) Lines", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "Social media has turned out to be the perfect tool for nonbinary people to find \u2014 and model \u2014 their unique places on the gender spectrum.Shortly after that conversation, Moore said, \u201cI started exploring my gender variants and what they meant.\u201d At first, Moore considered transitioning genders. Moore researched hormone therapy and surgery, but something about that didn\u2019t feel quite right. \u201cI realized that wasn\u2019t me, either,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI came to this understanding for myself that gender was projected onto my body, and I don\u2019t need to alter my body to affirm my gender or align with one gender or another.\u201dAt that time, around 2013, Moore, who is black, was living in Tucson and had few friends of color \u2014 and even fewer who were gender-nonconforming. But Moore worked in the African-American student-affairs office at the University of Arizona and often attended conferences focused on social justice and organizing, where many of the participants and attendees embodied the gender spectrum. It was the first time Moore was surrounded by nonbinary people. Gender-neutral pronouns like \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d were much more common in these spaces. By the summer of 2014, Moore began using them, too, and going by their middle name, Matice, which felt more androgynous than their birth name, Maria. Moore continued to interact with people from the conferences on Facebook and other forms of social media using the new name and pronouns. Online, Moore said, \u201cI felt the availability to identify in that way.\u201dAround the same time, Moore became aware of a performance-and-poetry group (now disbanded) called Dark Matter. Moore became transfixed by videos of one of its members, Alok Vaid-Menon, who was able to eloquently dismiss conventional notions of gender, particularly the idea that there are only two. Seeing people like Vaid-Menon online gave Moore the courage to reconsider how they approached gender. Moore began experimenting with their outward appearance. Before Moore changed the pronoun they used, Moore had favored a more masculine, dandy-like aesthetic \u2014 close-cropped hair, button-down shirts and bow ties \u2014 in large part to fit in at work. Moore began wearing their hair longer and often chose less gender-specific clothing, like T-shirts or boxy tops, which felt more natural and comfortable to them. Vaid-Menon\u2019s assuredness, Moore said, \u201cboosted my confidence in terms of defining and asserting my own identity in public spaces.\u201dA shift in technology emboldened Moore, too. In 2014, Facebook updated its site to include nonbinary gender identities and pronouns, adding more than 50 options for users who don\u2019t identify as male or female, including agender, gender-questioning and intersex. It was a profound moment for Moore. \u201cThey had options I didn\u2019t even know about,\u201d Moore told me. That summer, Moore selected \u201cnonbinary,\u201d alerting their wider social spheres, including childhood friends and family members who also used the site. For Moore, it saved them some of the energy of having to explain their name and pronoun shift. Moore also clarified their gender pronouns on Instagram. \u201cI wrote it into my profile to make it more explicit.\u201d To some, the act might seem small, but for Moore, their identity \u201cfelt crystallized, and important.\u201dSeveral societies and cultures understand gender as more varied than just man or woman, but in the United States, a gender binary has been the norm. \u201cIn our cultural history, we\u2019ve never had anything close to a third category, or even the notion that you could be in between categories,\u201d said Barbara Risman, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Risman, who recently published a book called \u201cWhere the Millennials Will Take Us: A New Generation Wrestles With the Gender Structure,\u201d contrasted her early research with what she is seeing now. Few of the people she interviewed for the book in 2012 and 2013 were openly using nongendered pronouns, if they even knew about them. Just four years later, she began researching nonbinary young adults because the landscape had changed so radically. \u201cIt was reflexive with their friends at school, social groups. Many colleges classes start out with \u2018Name, major and preferred pronouns,\u2019\u2009\u201d Risman told me. In Risman\u2019s experience, it used to take decades to introduce new ideas about sex, sexuality or gender, and even longer for them to trickle upstream into society. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating is how quickly the public conversation has led to legal changes,\u201d Risman said. California and Washington, among others, now allow people to select \u201cx\u201d as their gender, instead of \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale,\u201d on identity documents. \u201cAnd I am convinced that it has to do with \u2014 like everything else in society \u2014 the rapid flow of information.\u201dHelana Darwin, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who began researching nonbinary identities in 2014, found that the social-media community played an unparalleled role in people\u2019s lives, especially those who were geographically isolated from other nonbinary people. \u201cEither they were very confused about what was going on or just feeling crushingly lonely and without support, and their online community was the only support in their lives,\u201d Darwin told me. \u201cThey turned to the site to understand they aren\u2019t alone.\u201d Most of her subjects said social media was instrumental in deepening their understanding of their identities. \u201cA 61-year-old person in my sample told me that they lived the vast majority of their life as though they were a gay man and was mistaken often as a drag queen after coming out. They didn\u2019t discover nonbinary until they were in their 50s, and it was a freeing moment of understanding that nothing is wrong. They didn\u2019t have to force themselves into the gay-man or trans-woman box \u2014 they could just be them. They described it as transcendent.\u201dWhen Darwin began her study four years ago, she was shocked to discover that the body of research on nonbinary people was nearly nonexistent. \u201cEven as nonbinary people are becoming increasing visible and vocal, there were still only a handful of articles published in the field of sociology that were even tangentially about nonbinary people and even fewer that were explicitly about nonbinary people.\u201d What little research there was tended to lump the nonbinary experience into trans-woman and trans-man experience, even though all signs pointed to deep differences. The void in the field, she thinks, was due to society\u2019s reliance on the notion that all humans engage in some sense of gender-based identity performance, which reaffirms the idea that gender exists. \u201cThere was an academic lag that isn\u2019t keeping with the very urgent and exponentially profound gender revolution happening in our culture.\u201dHer research found that social media is a gathering place for discussing the logistics of gender \u2014 providing advice, reassurance and emotional support, as well as soliciting feedback about everything from voice modulation to hairstyles. The internet is a place where nonbinary people can learn about mixing masculine and feminine elements to the point of obscuring concrete identification as either. As one person she interviewed put it, \u201cEvery day someone can\u2019t tell what I am is a good day.\u201dNearly everyone Darwin interviewed remarked about the power of acquiring language that spoke to their identity, and they tended to find that language on the internet. But Harry Barbee, a nonbinary sociologist at Florida State University who studies sex, gender and sexuality, cautioned against treating social media as a curative. \u201cWhen the world assumes you don\u2019t exist, you\u2019re forced to define yourself into existence if you want some semblance of recognition and social viability, and so the internet and social media helps achieve this,\u201d Barbee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a dream world where we are free to be you and me, because it can also be a mechanism for social control.\u201d Barbee has been researching what it means to live as nonbinary in a binary world. Social media, Barbee said, is \u201cone realm where they do feel free to share who they are, but they\u2019re realistic about the limitations of the space. Even online, they are confronted by hostility and people who are telling them they\u2019re just confused or that makes no sense, or want to talk to them about their genitals.\u201dGrowing up in Columbia, S.C., Ahomari Turner always felt like an alien. \u201cIn high school and middle school, I felt that I had to be a boy, that I had to pretend to be straight, which is really hard for me, because it was just obvious that I was not.\u201d Around the time Turner was 24, a friend who identified as male began referring to Turner as \u201cshe.\u201d Even though it was confusing, Turner said, \u201cI didn\u2019t correct him, because it felt great.\u201d Turner, who is now 27 and uses \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d as pronouns, began to realize around this time that they were intersex. As a child, they visited doctors, multiple times. Those visits were followed by unexplained surgeries. \u201cI was growing breasts, and it was confusing,\u201d Turner told me. \u201cI felt so alone, because I didn\u2019t have any friends experiencing similar things.\u201dIntersex people don\u2019t fit neatly into a binary, in part, Turner told me, because their bodies are neither. Turner turned to the internet and came across the YouTube videos and writings of Pidgeon Pagonis, a dark-haired, charismatic intersex activist who lives in Chicago and is strikingly honest about the involuntary procedures they endured. It was the first time Turner understood what happened to them as a child.Turner, who is black, pointed out that mainstream gender-nonconforming narratives tend to privilege white upper-class bodies. One of the most obvious examples is Taylor Mason, a nonbinary character on the Showtime drama \u201cBillions,\u201d played by the nonbinary actor Asia Kate Dillon. \u201cThe people who usually get lifted up are skinny, white and femme, as if that\u2019s the only face of people who are nonbinary, and it\u2019s very far from it,\u201d Turner said. Online, the faces can be far more varied, especially through hashtags like #NonbinaryIsntWhite, a movement on Twitter and Instagram, where people who identify as nonbinary post selfies. The result has been a kaleidoscopic board of inspiration for a multitude of gender and racial expressions, with wildly varying styles of dress, makeup and settings. To scroll through the images is to understand that there is no one way to be nonbinary. The entire point underscores the idea that there is no status quo, no \u201cnormal\u201d and no need to limit yourself based on a societal ideal. One post from a person using the handle SevaQuinn shows themselves in a black button-down with a flower in their hair and the caption, \u201cMy ethnicity is about as mixed as my gender.\u201d Another person posting under the handle AfroAutPunk shows themselves wearing a Prince shirt, headphones and lipstick, with the caption, \u201cBlack, fat, disabled, nonbinary, queer and intersex.\u201dPsychologists often posit that as children, we operate almost like scientists, experimenting and gathering information to make sense of our surroundings. Children use their available resources \u2014 generally limited to their immediate environment \u2014 to gather cues, including information about gender roles, to create a sense of self. Alison Gopnik, a renowned philosopher and child psychologist, told me that it\u2019s not enough to simply tell children that other identities or ways of being exist. \u201cThat still won\u2019t necessarily change their perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to see it.\u201dIn her 2009 book, \u201cThe Philosophical Baby,\u201d Gopnik writes that \u201cwhen we travel, we return to the wide-ranging curiosity of childhood, and we discover new things about ourselves.\u201d In a new geographic area, our attention is heightened, and everything, from differently labeled condiments to streetwear, becomes riveting. \u201cThis new knowledge lets us imagine new ways that we could live ourselves,\u201d she asserts. Flying over feeds in social media can feel like viewing portholes into new dimensions and realities, so I asked Gopnick if it\u2019s possible that social media can function as a foreign country, where millions of new ideas and identities and habitats are on display \u2014 and whether that exposure can pry our calcified minds open in unexpected ways. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a wider range of possibilities to look at gives people a sense of a wider range of possibilities, and those different experiences might lead to having different identities.\u201dWhen we dive into Instagram or Facebook, we are on exploratory missions, processing large volumes of information that help us shape our understanding of ourselves and one another. And this is a country that a majority of young adults are visiting on a regular basis. A Pew study from this year found that some 88 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds report using some form of social media, and 71 percent of Americans between ages 18 and 24 use Instagram. Social media is perhaps the most influential form of media they now have. They turn to it for the profound and the mundane \u2014 to shape their views and their aesthetics. Social media is a testing ground for expression, the locus of experimentation and exploration \u2014 particularly for those who cannot yet fully inhabit themselves offline for fear of discrimination, or worse. Because of that, it has become a lifeline for many people struggling to find others just like them.Alok Vaid-Menon, who shaped Moore\u2019s gender journey, has become an influential figure to others navigating gender nonconformity. Vaid-Menon, who is 27, grew up moving between two worlds in College Station, Tex., a small town about an hour outside Houston. \u201cThere was an unwelcome mat at every door,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. At home, Vaid-Menon was part of a tight-knit Indian community, while at school, Vaid-Menon\u2019s world was predominantly white and evangelical. Bullying and racism were de rigueur there. As a young child, Vaid-Menon spent hours online on Myspace and Xanga \u2014 a blog-based social network popular in the early 2000s \u2014 sharing journal entries and poetry that were mostly about \u201cexistential loneliness.\u201d Through those interactions, Vaid-Menon met people who praised the young teenager on the beauty of their words and creativity. Vaid-Menon began to thrive.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever saw anyone who looked like me, ever, even online,\u201d Vaid-Menon said, before adding with a laugh, \u201cuntil maybe Joanne the Scammer,\u201d referring to the online persona of a mischievous woman in a ratty fur coat and an even rattier blond wig, portrayed by Branden Miller. But online friends, whom Vaid-Menon described affectionately as a \u201cragtag group,\u201d were among the first to affirm the feelings and uncertainty Vaid-Menon was experiencing. There was a collective sense that everyone could share stories that were forbidden in their offline lives. \u201cSeeing visible queer people online and seeing people be vulnerable \u2014 all of that created me.\u201d In the beginning, Vaid-Menon was just trying to meet peers and get information about queer and trans identities, with the hope of finding clarity on their own feelings. \u201cBut then I started getting messages from random people in, like, Arkansas, and that taught me that strangers can be people we feel more close to than our blood family,\u201d Vaid-Menon said. \u201cThat paradox is what I do with my social media today.\u201dVaid-Menon is extremely active on Instagram, uploading daily stories and posts for their 146,000 followers. Scrolling through their page reveals an inspired bouquet of multicolored and multipatterned outfits, lips coated in blues, pinks or purples. They are constantly playing around with their presentation, seamlessly blending together suits, thigh-high boots, dresses, sweaters, hair colors, makeup, footwear and accessories to create a look that truly feels beyond any known understanding of masculine or feminine \u2014 which is exactly the point. Many of Vaid-Menon\u2019s posts feature a confident and smiling Vaid-Menon at performances or speaking engagements, often posing with trans, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming friends, including the Canadian artist Vivek Shraya, the Brazilian singer Liniker and the Stonewall activist Miss Major.To the average scroller, the photos themselves give the impression of a celebratory postgender, postracial world. But reading the accompanying text more often than not reveals a life marked by anxiety, trauma and fear. One such post features Vaid-Menon against a pink backdrop in a striped, sequined two-piece dress. Pouting aqua lips and yellow-lidded eyes are framed by cascading curls. The entire effect is of a futuristic pinup. The text reads: \u201cIn the last year that i posted this I still receive daily hate mail from people of all genders telling me that my body hair is ugly & that I need to shave to be more \u2018real\u2019 & \u2018beautiful.\u2019 So i figured i would repost because people still don\u2019t get it! Body hair has no gender! Facial hair has no gender!\u201d Another post shows a beaming Vaid-Menon posing in front of a stone wall, wearing a marigold-yellow button-down embroidered with flowers and neon patchwork shorts that meet patent-leather boots \u2014 one hot pink, the other lime green. Vaid-Menon\u2019s blue-tinged hair is pulled into a side ponytail that flirts with bright orange pom-pom earrings. The caption reads: \u201cthe worst thing just happened!! i was trapped underground in the subway for an hour because of a train malfunction. I was dressed feminine & one of my worst fears is getting on trains & being trapped with people harassing me \u2014 you can\u2019t escape & no one defends you :/ i had to really focus on my breath & it took everything in me not to have a full blown panic attack!\u201dAlthough social media generally conditions users to share only their highlights \u2014 the success reel of their lives \u2014 Vaid-Menon thinks it\u2019s important to share the reality of living in a gender-nonconforming body; they want people to understand what the daily experience can be like. \u201cThe majority of nonbinary, gender-nonconforming cannot manifest themselves because to do so would mean violence, death, harassment and punishment,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. But Vaid-Menon believes that more people will respond to the vulnerability Vaid-Menon expresses; it\u2019s something they learned as a young gender-questioning person growing up in a small Republican town. \u201cIt taught me that people do not have to understand in order to care, because people cared about me outside of my gender and perceptions.\u201dVaid-Menon is a gifted public speaker and lecturer and uses Instagram like an open-source pulpit, drawing from their academic background and knowledge of South Asian gender systems to challenge heteronormativity and the treatment of marginalized people. If being vulnerable is one way Vaid-Menon tries to reach people, being outspoken about gender is another. In one recent Instagram Live video, hours after the news broke that the Trump administration planned to sign an executive order that would narrow the definition of gender to an immutable, biological condition, limiting protections for transgender people under federal civil rights law, Vaid-Menon sits wearing an olive green jacket and a topknot dyed to match and delivers a searing lecture about the widely adopted binary notions of sex and gender. \u201cThere is a gender-sex distinction that has been normalized even in progressive movements,\u201d Vaid-Menon begins. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea that gender is a cultural attribute, expressed by fashion and outfits, whereas the body has to do with sex. There\u2019s a series of binaries that are created here.\u201d Vaid-Menon warms up as the talk continues, speaking in a cadence that is accelerating and tinged with anger. \u201cWhy is it that when trans people take hormones, it\u2019s seen as body modification, and if cis people take hormones for, like, a medical condition, it\u2019s not seen as body modification? That\u2019s where transphobia lives. The body is mutable. Sex is mutable. Sex is not a \u2018biological essential category.\u2019 We allow gender to be nonconforming while we stabilize sex.\u201dPersonally, Vaid-Menon doesn\u2019t identify as any gender. \u201cNonbinary is so oxymoronic,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me. \u201cWe\u2019re defining ourselves by an absence and not our abundance.\u201d When pressed, they will describe themselves as transfeminine, gender-nonconforming and nonbinary \u2014 but only reluctantly. \u201cI really try to escape having to put myself in these categories,\u201d Vaid-Menon said. \u201cI wanted to be free from boxes \u2014 not end up in a new one.\u201d Social media is one of the few outlets for that uninhibited expression.Vaid-Menon views social media as strategic, and as a practice to push everyone to rethink their conception of gender. \u201cTechnology is not an obstacle to intimacy \u2014 it is a conduit for it, and it expands our capacity for it,\u201d Vaid-Menon told me.

{"Headline": "Will Harping on Immigration Do What Trump Wants It to Do?", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s unrelenting focus on migrants may prove ineffective because voters have already sorted themselves out along partisan lines.The authors are political scientists.Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on immigration has had real consequences, even though congressional candidates across the country have chosen to focus on other issues, like the economy or health care. Compared to recent elections, voters\u2019 beliefs about immigration are more strongly related to how they plan to vote in congressional races. This shows how Mr. Trump is shaping how Americans vote even though he\u2019s not on the ballot. His brand of identity politics has metastasized to states and districts across the country.The importance of immigration in 2018 has its roots in 2016. In the presidential election, attitudes toward immigration became more strongly correlated with voting for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton than they were with voting for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. The increased role of immigration attitudes stemmed from the 2016 campaign itself: Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton took sharply divergent positions, embodied in Mr. Trump\u2019s call to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s argument that our diversifying nation was \u201cstronger together.\u201d Our research has shown that it was attitudes about identity-inflected issues like immigration \u2014 not a purely \u201ceconomic\u201d anxiety \u2014 that were distinctively important in 2016.Because Mr. Trump has linked the party to his position on immigration, white Americans\u2019 views of immigration now predict their vote for Congress more than in recent elections. To show this, we use data on the same set of 2,700 white respondents interviewed in December 2011, November 2012 and May 2018 in the Views of the Electorate Research Survey.In 2011, this survey asked whether immigration to the United States should be easier or harder, whether there should be a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and whether undocumented immigrants were mostly a benefit to or a drain on society. White Americans were divided on these questions: 48 percent wanted to make it easier to immigrate or keep it the same, while 44 percent wanted to make it harder (the rest were unsure). Similarly, 37 percent favored a path to citizenship, 42 percent opposed it and 22 percent were unsure. And while the majority (58 percent) said that undocumented immigrants were a drain, there were obviously many Americans who felt differently. We combined answers to these three questions to produce an overall measure of views about immigration.In 2012, white Americans did not appear to act on these views as much as they seem likely to in 2018. These 2011 views on immigration are more strongly correlated with how whites said they would vote in elections for House as of May 2018 than with how they actually voted in the 2012 House election. This is true even after accounting for other factors related to how people vote, including their identification as Democratic, Republican or independent and whether they described themselves as a liberal, moderate or conservative.Voting in congressional elections among whites has become more strongly associated with immigration attitudes. Anti-immigration voters are more likely to support Republicans this year than they were in 2012; pro-immigration voters\u2019 support of Republicans has dropped. The chart shows the chance that a white voter would support a Republican House candidate based the voter\u2019s view of immigration.VOTERS\u2019  VIEWSON IMMIGRATIONPROANTI100%(SUPPORT THE 8875%Voters in 201871Voters in 2012MORE REPUBLICAN SUPPORT50%3925%MORE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT230100%VOTERS\u2019 VIEWSPRO-IMMIGRATIONANTI-IMMIGRATION(SUPPORTING88MOREREPUBLICANSUPPORTVoters in 201875%7150%Voters in 20123925%23INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT0By The New York Times | Source: analysis of the Views of the Electorate Research Survey by John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn VavreckWill this renewed debate over immigration helps the Republican Party\u2019s chances in 2018?That\u2019s far from clear. In 2016, Mr. Trump benefited because many white Obama voters disagreed with the Democratic Party on immigration. In December 2011, about a third of white Americans who would go on to vote for Mr. Obama believed that it should be harder to immigrate to the United States. Once the 2016 campaign made immigration a bigger issue, some of these white Obama voters who wanted restrictions on immigration shifted to Mr. Trump.But immigration may not be as effective a wedge issue in 2018. Immigration no longer divides Democrats as much as it used to. This shows how Mr. Trump is reshaping not only his own party, but the opposition. The result is fewer and fewer white Democrats who could be persuaded by Mr. Trump\u2019s message on immigration.This increasing polarization of the parties ensures a debate about immigration that extends well beyond this election. And it will be a particularly divisive and emotional debate precisely because immigration touches on fundamental questions about who deserves to be in America and what it means to be American in the first place.These are the questions that Americans will help to answer on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European River Cruises Hit a New Obstacle: Not Enough Water", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateMonths of drought have left water levels on Germany\u2019s Rhine, and rivers like the Danube and the Rhone, river at record lows, making passage difficult for some cruise ships.A week into a two-week river cruise along the Danube River in August, Erin Needham, her husband, Scott, and her mother-in-law, Linda, found themselves in an odd position: their trip, Ms. Needham\u2019s first to Europe, was being cut short because the water was too shallow for the ship to go on.Stuck in Vilshofen, Germany, and unable to make it to Passau, the next stop on the itinerary, Ms. Needham was disappointed, but her cruise company, Riviera Cruises, had warned guests that this could happen, so she felt she couldn\u2019t be upset. After a few days in Vilshofen some passengers opted to take a bus tour planned by Riviera while others decided to get on their flights home a week early. Ms. Needham and her family chose to continue their cruise on another ship, also run by Riviera, along the Rhine river.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s tough to decide if we should cancel before a trip starts,\u201d said Jana Tvedt the vice president of Riviera Travel USA. \u201cYou think it\u2019s going to work one way and then two days later it\u2019s totally different.\u201dThe unpredictable nature of the weather, especially the inability to know when it will rain next, has left cruise goers irate and unsure of whether to go on their trips.\u201cWe got an email three days before we were supposed to leave, with the option to cancel for a full refund,\u201d said Carol Milosch. (Ms. Milosch and her two companions had paid a total of $6,500 for their cruise.)After a few hours of debating, Ms. Milosch, who lives in Asheville, N.C., chose to go on the October trip on Avalon Waterways because she had been planning it since December. Three days of the eight-day trip were spent touring the countryside by bus instead of cruising the Rhine. \u201cWe still saw a lot and Avalon was good to us, but it just wasn\u2019t the trip I spent nearly a year imagining,\u201d Ms. Milosch said. It\u2019s not just passengers who have had to adjust to the drought and planning challenges. Cruise companies including Riviera, which Ms. Needham\u2019s family sailed with, and Avalon, which Ms. Milosch\u2019s family used, have had to think of ways to keep trips intact, despite the low waters. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to find creative solutions,\u201d said Rudi Schreiner, president and co-owner of AmaWaterways. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a week ahead if the water will hit critical levels, but people book their trips sometimes a year ahead and we want to provide them with the best possible vacation.\u201dIf the water is too low in certain areas, Mr. Schreiner\u2019s company tries to make it up. For each day that the cruise deviates from the planned itinerary, passengers receive a 15 percent discount off a future trip. And if the trip cannot go forward on the river, bus tours are provided. Similar deals are provided by other companies. \u201cWe still want you to have a good time, but maybe that\u2019s in a slightly different area than planned,\u201d Mr. Schreiner said. Typically, if a cruise is canceled or moved to land, a full refund \u2014 including airfare, if booked as part of the package \u2014 is offered. Travelers who book their own airfare separately will not be guaranteed a refund for that part of their trip unless they bought travel insurance or a refundable ticket.And as the off-season approaches, some companies are planning to dedicate more time than in previous years to figuring out how to prepare for next summer. \u201cWe made the right decisions this year, but we\u2019ll be meeting to figure out how to improve our processes,\u201d said Pam Hoffee, the managing director of Avalon Waterways. \u201cIf this happens again next year, we want to communicate with our guests faster and help them as quickly as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many of Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments, some of which she has apologized for or attempted to explain, appear to contradict baseball\u2019s mission.\u201cThe contribution was made in connection with an event that M.L.B. lobbyists were asked to attend,\u201d an M.L.B. spokesman said in a statement. \u201cM.L.B. has requested that the donation be returned.\u201dThe Hyde-Smith campaign reported its contributions to the Federal Election Commission on Nov. 23. That was almost two weeks after her comments about public hanging came to light, but baseball says the donation was made earlier in the month at a political event by M.L.B. lobbyists who were unaware of her remarks.The baseball commissioner\u2019s office has its own political action committee and donates to politicians on both sides of the aisle to help promote its causes in Congress, like protecting M.L.B.\u2019s antitrust exemption and other legislation, like how teams pay minor league players.Charles Johnson, an owner of the San Francisco Giants, also made contributions to Hyde-Smith. He and his wife, Ann, each donated $2,700.There are a handful of minor league baseball teams in Mississippi, but none affiliated with the Giants.Hyde-Smith, a Republican appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant in March to replace Thad Cochran, who resigned for health reasons, is facing Mike Espy, a Democrat, in Tuesday\u2019s runoff election. Since M.L.B. made the contribution, further reports have come to light showing Hyde-Smith\u2019s support for the Confederacy. In a photograph on her Facebook page, she is shown wearing the cap of a Confederate soldier and holding a musket. The caption reads, \u201cMississippi history at its best.\u201dShe was also seen on video espousing voter suppression among college students to a small group of supporters after the Nov. 6 general election. Hyde-Smith is heard to say that it would be \u201ca great idea.\u201d She later labeled the comment a joke.She said the same thing about her earlier statement, made at a rally on Nov. 2, that she would happily sit in the front row for public hangings. The comment stirred up the painful history of lynchings in Mississippi and elsewhere.Since then, several large corporations, including Walmart, AT&T and Pfizer, have also asked for their contributions to be returned.An earlier version of this article misstated the manner in which a Giants owner, Charles Johnson, and his wife donated to Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign. The donation was made directly to the campaign, not through a super PAC. An earlier version also published statements from Johnson and the Giants in error. They referred to a different donation by Johnson, not his contribution of Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign. The article also misstated the timing of M.L.B.\u2019s donation to Hyde-Smith. It came about two weeks after video of her comments invoking public hangings emerged, not two weeks after she made the comments.Advertisement"}

Australians were not impressed. The existential threat? A hardware store\u2019s suggestion that people put onions under a sausage instead of on top. Bunnings Warehouse, a national chain of nearly 300 stores, may not have expected it, but the effort to dispense culinary advice as if it were home repair led to a countrywide meltdown. The discussion got so fevered that Prime Minister Scott Morrison found himself fielding a reporter\u2019s question on Wednesday about whether Bunnings\u2019s guidance was \u201cun-Australian.\u201dHe delicately weighed into the fray.\u201cWhether the onions are on top or underneath, I\u2019ll always be buying sausages on bread,\u201d Mr. Morrison said.For the uninitiated, a dash of context: Australian community groups often set up fund-raiser barbecues outside Bunnings locations, at which they sell open-faced sausage sandwiches, typically composed of a sausage, fried onions and tomato sauce (known to Americans as ketchup) on a slice of white bread.The chain, it seems, was worried that people eating the sausages would enter their stores and drop onions on the floor, leading other customers to slip, fall and perhaps sue. \u201cOnions can be slippery when they fall out of a sausage sandwich,\u201d Bunnings wrote in a flier distributed to community groups that included instructions for constructing a sandwich. \u201cTo make sure that onions don\u2019t end up on the ground and pose a slipping risk, please apply a small amount of onion to the bread under the sausage when serving.\u201d The irony of a store that encourages customers to \u201cdo it yourself,\u201d regulating the minutiae of sausage and onion construction, was not lost on its customers. \u201cI think its ridiculous,\u201d Liam Magee, a co-owner of Massive Wieners, a hot dog restaurant in Melbourne, said of Bunnings\u2019s onion policy. Mr. Magee said his restaurant placed onions beneath a sausage upon request only \u2014 usually from customers with beards who wanted to minimize mess. \u201cWe call it an underdog,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cif you don\u2019t see the onion, it\u2019s going to reduce prebite satisfaction.\u201dOthers pointed out that the supposed safety measures might actually increase the risk of spillage; the greasy onion might make the bread soggy, possibly even splitting it open. Worse still, the controversy led citizens to learn that their compatriots in Western Australia don\u2019t put their sausages on white bread, but on rolls, akin to American hot dogs.Bunnings did its best to respond seriously to the barrage. \u201cSafety is always our No. 1 priority,\u201d Debbie Poole, a spokeswoman for Bunnings Warehouse, said in a statement. \u201cRegardless of how you like your onion and snag,\u201d she said (using an Australia term for sausage), \u201cwe are confident this new serving suggestion will not impact the delicious taste or great feeling you get when supporting your local community group.\u201dThe company denied that the guidance was really a marketing ploy intended to go viral.\u201cThis is not about marketing,\u201d Ms. Poole said. \u201cThis recommendation has been made in the best interest of customer safety.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flying the Flags of Friendship", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesFrom Boston to the Bronx, North Carolina to New Jersey, I picture each of these women wearing one of my aunt\u2019s scarves, not as a mourning shawl, but as a wrap woven with memory.It had been a hard year for my mother. In August, she buried her younger sister whose cancer returned after a 30-year hiatus in a swift and devastating sucker punch.Less than three months later, she lost her best friend, a woman I knew as \u201cAunt Ginny.\u201d They had spoken weekly \u2014 sometimes daily \u2014 since kindergarten. A widow, Aunt Ginny died alone in her apartment after suffering a fall in her bathroom, a turn of events she would have found pitiably commonplace. She was a Bronx-born raconteur and was the first of a tightly knit circle of five to pass. Her wake was held on my mother\u2019s 75th birthday.When Aunt Ginny\u2019s adult children asked my mother if she would be willing to help clean out her apartment, my mother, selfless and strong, agreed. I worried it would be too much for her physically and emotionally. So much sadness, so short a window. Of course, she had lost friends before, but none this close.The home of her sister, my actual aunt, remained untouched. My aunt\u2019s daughter, my cousin, chose to wait. She was asking herself the same question I did: Can you dismantle a life, break it down into boxes, watch it divided, stored or hauled away, and then carry on with your evening? Your weekend? Your life? Her answer was a firm \u201cno.\u201dOn her way back from a day of sorting through Aunt Ginny\u2019s clothing, china and photographs, my mother stopped at my home bearing a bag filled with scarves.\u201cHow did it go?\u201d I asked tentatively.\u201cShe always complained about the parking. There were plenty of spots.\u201d Her exasperation had nothing to do with the lot. She was angry with her friend for leaving without saying goodbye.Moving as deftly as a Manhattan street vendor, my mother arranged the scarves across my kitchen table. We stood, admiring them: florals, plaids, paisley, a kaleidoscope of color, as bold and vibrant as my aunt herself.\u201cWhat are you going to do with them all?\u201d I asked, fearing that my mother, with a penchant for small-scale hoarding, would allow all this silk to rest in the corner of a couch for months. Waiting.I thought of Joan Didion\u2019s account, in \u201cThe Year of Magical Thinking,\u201d of her reluctance to give away her husband\u2019s shoes because she believed he\u2019d need them when he returned.I wondered if my mother was thinking that way too. But she chose the opposite.\u201cI\u2019m going to mail them to Eileen, Mary, Pat, Jean,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought we should all have one.\u201dIt is fitting. For decades they had been each other\u2019s go-to accessory, together through hope and disappointment, love and loss, births and, now, death.\u201cI think she\u2019d like the idea of her scarves venturing back out into the world, having new adventures,\u201d I wanted to say but didn\u2019t. I was a writer grappling for words. For the past 47 years, it had been my mother comforting me \u2014 broken bone, bruised ego, recurrent miscarriage, career setbacks.I wanted to be there for her in the way she had always been for me, with a ready ear, a sturdy shoulder and a wide-open heart.\u201cThis is the one she got in Paris, and remember this? I think she wore it to Nancy\u2019s baby shower,\u201d my mother smiled at her recollection.The way clothing evokes memory, and its innate ability to comfort, wasn\u2019t new to me. When my husband lost his job after 18 years at the same company, he sought solace inside a fleece cocoon. For days, as depression took hold, he wore a black pullover, the top half of a sweatsuit given to him by his uncle, half in jest, as a nod to our New Jersey roots. \u201cYou\u2019ll look just like Tony Soprano,\u201d his uncle teased.This garment telegraphed his mood, his need for warmth and protection in a cold, harsh world. When I see it now, it takes me straight back to some of our darkest days. I want to burn it, or donate it to charity. Perhaps someone else needs it. At the same time, I wonder: Should we keep it and let it serve as a reminder to be grateful we\u2019re in a better place?In my kitchen my mother surveyed the scarves. \u201cPick one,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019d want you to have one too.\u201dI pictured my aunt, tall and trim, an ever-present hint of mischief in her twinkling chestnut eyes, the stem of a wine glass held between her long, manicured fingers. I thought about the friendship she, my mother and their mutual friends shared. They knew and celebrated one another\u2019s birthdays and wedding anniversaries without the help of Facebook reminders. I can hear their endless calls, long, curling cords of rotary phones stretched across avocado kitchens, my mother throwing her head back laughing while making dinner with one hand.\u201cThis one looks like Eileen. I could see Pat in this,\u201d my mother said.As we decided who should receive which one, my mother turned them over in her hands, the knuckles of her once-delicate fingers now curved and bulging in odd directions. She was lost in thought and I wanted to ask what she was remembering. She had the ability to vividly recall the past. I was in a place where I could only look forward.I offered her some puffy mailer envelopes, a paper and pen. \u201cWe can package them now, send them out in the morning,\u201d I volunteered.But she wanted to go home and wrap them properly, with tissue paper and personal notes. She is always doing more while I consistently trade thoughtfulness for expediency.Amid a constant swirl of work and family obligations, I have lost track of friends in my own town. I respond to a text with an emoji, hoping it is enough in that moment, knowing it isn\u2019t. I realized my mother was providing a master class in caring and friendship.My mother mailed my Aunt Ginny\u2019s scarves. Within days, the thank-you calls began. Together, she and her friends laughed, cried and remembered.I like to picture them. From Boston to the Bronx, North Carolina to New Jersey, each woman, myself included, going about her day, wearing one of my aunt\u2019s scarves, not as a mourning shawl, but as a wrap woven with memory. Not as protective armor steeling us against whatever comes next, but as the best kind of tourniquets, bright flags helping us survive.Elizabeth Alterman is a freelance writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wedding in Paradise Is Lost, but \u2018Angels\u2019 Help After Camp Fire Devastation", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsA week before her wedding, Megan Janko was in a hotel room in Folsom, Calif., poring over the guest list. She would have rather been at home in her farmhouse, two hours away, which she shared with her fianc\u00e9, Joey Best; her 12-year-old son, Vincent Harris; and Mr. Best\u2019s 11-year-old son, Henry.The rest of the room was occupied by Joseph and Katherine Best\u2019s two rat terriers, Mr. Best and Ms. Janko\u2019s two bearded dragon lizards and their pair of finches. The lizards took up residence in the bathtub, the finches, in their cage, on the crowded bathroom counter. Ms. Janko and Mr. Best\u2019s own dog, Luke, a German shepherd, had to be dropped at a shelter to avoid eviction from the hotel. He doesn\u2019t get along with the other dogs.Still, it could have been worse.Just after the fire drove Ms. Janko, Mr. Best and their children from their home, they found a hotel in Roseville, a little closer to Paradise. But after a few days, they had to repack their few belongings, one of them a marriage license. \u201cPrevious bookings and things,\u201d Ms. Janko explained about the move.Ms. Janko and Mr. Best met in 2010 in Paradise at Kreative Beginnings, a child-care center Katherine Best opened in 2007. Ms. Janko was applying for a job as a teacher. Mr. Best, a teacher and the school\u2019s bus driver, sat in on the interview alongside his mother, the director.\u201cThere was interest right away,\u201d said Mr. Best, and not only the professional kind. But Ms. Janko, who landed the job, was still in a committed relationship with Vincent\u2019s father.\u201cI thought of Joey as this really nice guy who was fun to talk to, but nothing else at the time,\u201d she said. As 2011 wound down, though, Ms. Janko\u2019s relationship did, too. The field trips she and Mr. Best took their students, 5 to 12 years old, on several days a week \u2014 to the park, to the local bowling alley, to the pool \u2014 started feeling like dates. Therapeutic ones.\u201cWe would sit by the pool together, and I would be talking about my issues with my son\u2019s dad, and he would tell me about his breakup with his son\u2019s mom,\u201d she said. Just after school dismissal one day in February 2012, they were cleaning up a classroom when she leaned over and kissed him.\u201cIt was totally out of character for me,\u201d she said. Mr. Best felt the thrill of possibility \u2014 he knew something romantic had been brewing \u2014 but he held back. He was still recovering from the breakup he had gotten used to discussing with Ms. Janko poolside. \u201cI knew I needed someone who was really going to care about me,\u201d he said.Before they had a chance to figure out if she was the one, Ms. Janko was laid off by his mother at the child-care center.\u201cThe school almost had to close because a lot of the kids were on state-funded care, and it had been a bad budget year,\u201d she said. She and Vincent moved to Magalia, Calif., to live with her father, Joseph Janko. There, she found teaching work. But the distance didn\u2019t dim her attraction to Mr. Best.\u201cJoey has the biggest heart, and he\u2019s kind of old-fashioned, which I love,\u201d Ms. Janko said. \u201cI can be 100 percent myself around him.\u201d They nurtured their relationship first through social media, then via phone calls and finally with visits neither wanted to end. Within months, she said, \u201cI decided, I just want to be with this person all the time.\u201dIn 2014, Ms. Janko and Vincent moved into the three-bedroom Paradise farmhouse with Mr. Best and Henry. Two years later, she was rehired by Kreative Beginnings. The boys, who have known each other since their own preschool days, have become like brothers. \u201cIt\u2019s a typical blended family, where one minute they\u2019re fighting and the next minute they\u2019re best friends,\u201d Ms. Janko said.\u201cIt was this great turnout of everyone we worked with, including his parents and his sister,\u201d she said. Sarah Khalil, Mr. Best\u2019s younger sister, was Kreative Beginnings\u2019 office manager. \u201cJoey had tricked me, but I didn\u2019t catch on.\u201dMs. Janko, as usual, was holding a guitar pick for Mr. Best. \u201cHe has this special pick, and when he needs to use it he motions for me to come up to the stage and give it to him,\u201d she said. When he motioned to her that evening, the band paused. \u201cI ran up there with it, and he started saying all this crazy stuff and then he was down on one knee.\u201d In one hand, he held his guitar. In the other, a diamond solitaire ring. Though she couldn\u2019t make out everything he said through the club\u2019s noise, she does recall the words, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\u201cI love the idea of him proposing that way, but at the moment, to be honest, I was mortified,\u201d Ms. Janko said. That didn\u2019t stop her from whispering a tearful yes.The wedding planning was winding down by fall. \u201cWe were just figuring out the final touches, like the tablecloths and centerpieces,\u201d Ms. Janko said.Then came Nov. 8, a morning so thick with smoke, devastation and panic in Paradise that Ms. Janko has difficulty piecing it together. She remembers parents rushing to Kreative Beginnings at 7:30 a.m. to collect their children once news of the fire hit, then rushing to her own house to look for Mr. Best and their sons. The roads home were gridlocked.Ms. Janko, with shaky hands gripping the wheel, made it home and, in the space of 15 minutes, helped Mr. Best load her Honda Civic and his Ford Ranger truck with a few valuables. In addition to the marriage license, they included her \u201cJoey box,\u201d a little receptacle in which she kept letters he had written her through the years, and part of his treasured, and valuable, comic book collection \u2014 he had sold part of it the year before to buy Ms. Janko\u2019s engagement ring. The couple fled Paradise with the boys, birds and finches in Ms. Janko\u2019s car and Luke, the German shepherd, with Mr. Best in the truck.The road out of town was an inferno. \u201cThe boys were hysterical,\u201d Ms. Janko said. \u201cWe kept driving and driving, and I kept looking in the rearview, afraid they were going to see flames coming at us.\u201dMs. Janko, Mr. Best and his parents found each other on safer ground within hours in a Costco parking lot in Chico. Ms. Khalil, her husband, Nader Khalil, and their eight-month-old daughter, Iris, arrived a little later. Ms. Khalil had been among the first notified on Nov. 8 that her Paradise house was burning. Before 7:30 a.m., she had already returned home from her desk at Kreative Beginnings to make sure her husband and daughter had evacuated.

{"Headline": "Can We Stop Suicides? ", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "OpinionIt\u2019s been way too long since there was a new class of drugs to treat depression. Ketamine might be the solution.Supported byContributing Opinion WriterIn May of 2017, Louise decided that her life was just too difficult, so she\u2019d end it. In the previous four years, three siblings and a half-sibling had died, two from disease, one from fire and one from choking. Close friends had moved away. She felt painfully, unbearably alone. It would be the fourth time Louise (I\u2019m using her middle name to protect her privacy), then 68, would attempt suicide, and she was determined to get it right.She wrote a letter with instructions on where to find important documents and who should inherit what. She packed up her jewelry and artwork, addressing each box to particular friends and family members. Then she checked into a motel \u2014 homes where people have committed suicide lose value and she didn\u2019t want hers to sell below market \u2014 put a plastic sheet on the bed, lay down and swallowed what she figured was an overdose of prescription pills with champagne.A few days later, she woke up in a psychiatric ward in Albuquerque. The motel maid had found her. \u201cI was very upset I had failed,\u201d she told me recently. So she tried to cut her wrists with a bracelet she was wearing \u2014 unsuccessfully.Now, scientists think that they may have found one \u2014 an old anesthetic called ketamine that, at low doses, can halt suicidal thoughts almost immediately.Depression ran in Louise\u2019s family. It had afflicted all her siblings, both of her parents and her grandmother. Prozac had helped Louise for a time, but stopped working for her in the late 2000s, as it sometimes does. No other drug seemed able to lift her dark moods. After her suicide attempt, Louise\u2019s psychiatrist suggested she try ketamine. She agreed, and received an infusion intravenously. Within hours, her sense of well-being improved. The hospital discharged her. Back home, she discovered that going to the market was no longer a \u201cherculean task.\u201d Getting her car washed wasn\u2019t an insurmountable chore. \u201cLife was better,\u201d she said. \u201cLife was doable.\u201dNonetheless, if proven safe and effective in small doses, ketamine stands to transform how doctors deal with suicidal patients and depression generally.[Discover the most compelling features and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]Suicidality doesn\u2019t perfectly overlap with depression. Many people attempt suicide not because they\u2019re clinically depressed, but rather impulsively, because they\u2019ve been fired or they\u2019ve broken up with girl- and boyfriends, or sometimes because they\u2019re just really drunk. I\u2019ve heard people who show up in the hospital in this state \u2014 despondent, angry and uninhibited more than depressed \u2014 described as \u201cdrunkicidal.\u201d Many are fine once they sober up. For those who aren\u2019t, ketamine may help independent of its effect on depression. And because ketamine is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, doctors can prescribe it off-label. Meaning that not only does a drug exist right now that could help with depression and suicidality, it\u2019s theoretically available to patients.\u201cMore patients should be aware of this,\u201d Louise told me. \u201cIt really is a godsend.\u201d But ketamine has what many view as a major flaw. It can produce dissociative and hallucinatory side effects while it is being administered. Patients can feel as if they\u2019ve left their bodies or that they\u2019re dying. Louise described her first ketamine experience as being like Picasso\u2019s painting \u201cGuernica\u201d \u2014 disjointed and unpleasant. But subsequent treatments, she said, were \u201cwonderful\u201d \u2014 full of images of birds, fish and whales.Questions also remain about the safety of long-term use. Depressed patients often have to return for \u201cbooster\u201d treatments (Louise finds that she needs an infusion once a month). The drug is considered safe when given once, but no one is sure how repeated doses may affect the brain. And ketamine can be addictive, too. The deeper issue here is one of weighing the risks of new treatment that hasn\u2019t been fully vetted and has unclear long-term side effects against a condition whose primary symptom is the urge to kill oneself. The most ringing endorsement of ketamine may come from those on the front lines of medicine: E.R. doctors. I met Louise through a doctor friend, Lowan Stewart, who works at the emergency room in Santa Fe, N.M., where she was first admitted after overdosing. He also treats patients at the ketamine clinic where Louise ended up going. Generally speaking, the protocol in emergency rooms doesn\u2019t include giving suicidal patients ketamine, and he argues that this should change.E.R. doctors are often quite familiar with ketamine; Dr. Stewart uses it as an anesthetic regularly on children precisely because it\u2019s considered so safe. Now that research has revealed its potential to treat depression and stop suicidal impulses, he thinks that doctors should offer it to suicidal patients in the E.R. \u201cWe could help so many people,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberal Parents, Radical Children", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe generation gap returns.Opinion ColumnistWhen I meet someone who runs an organization in a blue state, I often ask: Do you have a generation gap where you work? The answer \u2014 whether the person leads a college, a nonprofit, a tech company, an entertainment company or a publication \u2014 is generally the same: Yes, and it\u2019s massive.The managers at these places, who are generally 35 and above, are liberals. They vote Democratic and cheer on all the proper causes of the left. But some of the people under 35 are not liberals, but rather are militant progressives. The older people in the organization often have nicknames for the younger set: the Resistance, Al Jazeera, the revolutionaries. The young militants are the ones who stage the protests if someone does something deemed wrong.If a company fires an employee for writing an inappropriate memo or uttering an inappropriate phrase, it\u2019s usually because there\u2019s been a youth revolt. If a speaker is disinvited from a festival or from campus, it\u2019s often because of a youth revolt. If a writer is fired for a tweet, or an editor has to resign from a literary review because of an unacceptable article, it\u2019s often because of a youth revolt.The militants are more likely to believe that the system itself is rotten and needs to be torn down. We live in a rape culture, with systemic racism and systems of oppression inextricably tied to our institutions. We live in a capitalist society, a neoliberal system of exploitation. A person\u2019s ideology is determined by his or her status in the power structure.Two great belief systems are clashing here. The older liberals tend to be individualistic and meritocratic. A citizen\u2019s job is to be activist, compassionate and egalitarian. Boomers generally think they earned their success through effort and talent. The younger militants tend to have been influenced by the cultural Marxism that is now the lingua franca in the elite academy. Group identity is what matters. Society is a clash of oppressed and oppressor groups. People who are successful usually got that way through some form of group privilege and a legacy of oppression.The big generational clashes generally occur over definitions of professional excellence. The older liberals generally believe that the open exchange of ideas is an intrinsic good. Older liberal journalists generally believe that objectivity is an important ideal. But for many of the militants, these restraints are merely masks for the preservation of the existing power structures. They offer legitimacy to people and structures that are illegitimate.When the generations clash, the older generation generally retreats. Nobody wants to be hated and declared a moral pariah by his or her employees. Nobody wants to seem outdated. If the war is between the left and Trumpian white nationalism, nobody wants to be seen siding with Trump.The generation gap on the right is less dramatic. It\u2019s less politically important because the young don\u2019t influence the G.O.P. much; the old Trumpians do.But over the long run it will matter. The boomer conservatives, raised in the era of Reagan, generally believe in universal systems \u2014 universal capitalism, universal democracy and the open movement of people and goods. Younger educated conservatives are more likely to see the dream of universal democracy as hopelessly na\u00efve, and the system of global capitalism as a betrayal of the working class. Younger conservatives are comfortable in a demographically diverse society, but are also more likely to think in cultural terms, and to see cultural boundaries.Whether on left or right, younger people have emerged in an era of lower social trust, less faith in institutions, a greater awareness of group identity. They live with the reality of tribal political warfare and are more formed by that warfare.I guess the final irony is this: Liberal educated boomers have hogged the spotlight since Woodstock. But now events are driven by the oldsters who fuel Trump and the young wokesters who drive the left. The boomers finally got the top jobs, but feel weak and beleaguered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting the Spiritual Void", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrauma is a moral and spiritual issue as much as a psychological or chemical one.Opinion ColumnistWherever I go I seem to meet people who are either dealing with trauma or helping others dealing with trauma. In some places I meet veterans trying to recover from the psychic wounds they suffered in Iraq or Afghanistan. Sometimes it is women struggling with the aftershocks of sexual assault. Sometimes it is teachers trying to help students overcome the traumas they\u2019ve suffered from some adult\u2019s abuse or abandonment.Wherever Americans gather and try to help each other on any deep level, they confront levels of trauma that their training has often not prepared them for.Medication can rebalance chemicals in the brain, but it can\u2019t heal the inner self. People who have suffered a trauma \u2014 whether it\u2019s a sexual assault at work or repeated beatings at home \u2014 find that their identity formation has been interrupted and fragmented. Time doesn\u2019t flow from one day to the next but circles backward to the bad event. People who endure trauma sometimes say that they feel morally tainted. They have the same plaintive mind-set as the old man at the cemetery in \u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d who says to his wife, \u201cTell me I\u2019m a good man.\u201dAs a culture we\u2019re pretty bad at dealing with moral injury. Sometimes I look at the rising suicide and depression rates, the rising fragility and distrust, and I think it all flows from the fact that we\u2019ve made our culture a spiritual void. When you privatize morality and denude the public square of spiritual content, you\u2019ve robbed people of the community resources they need to process moral pain together.One of his patients, Art, told Tick, \u201cMy soul has fled.\u201d He felt it leave his body at Khe Sanh. Art was a machine-gunner repelling wave after wave of North Vietnamese\u2019 assault, killing them by the score.One day the North Vietnamese overran his position, and while he was sprinting away in retreat, expecting to die at any second, he felt his soul run out of his body. It stayed out, traumatized, on red alert, for decades.Tick told Art: \u201cWe can try to make your body and this life a safe place for your soul to move back into. If we can get you off combat alert, if you can learn to trust a little bit \u2026 maybe we can bring you two closer together.\u201dPeople who are recovering from trauma often embrace the language of myth, which offers us templates of moral progress. Recently, in New Orleans, I met the founder of a community of vets called Bastion. The men and women there are taught to see their lives as a hero\u2019s journey with three stages: from Separation through Initiation and then back to Return.When we see our lives in mythic terms, we can see that life still offers a chance to do something heroic. \u201cMyths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life,\u201d Joseph Campbell wrote.Tick points out that most ancient cultures put returning soldiers through purification rituals. The men came back from battle and the terrible things they had done there, and they were given a chance to cleanse, purify and rejoin the community. The community would take possession of the guilt the soldiers may have felt for the things they had to do on its behalf. The Tohono O\u2019odham, a Native American people from the Sonoran Desert, once practiced a 16-day purification ceremony.These ceremonies had, Tick writes, what most rites of passage have: a sacred space, training by the elders, ordeals that prepare and test the initiate, rituals that symbolize the transformation taking place. After the cleansing, the blood-soaked soldier was now known as a warrior, a positive leader in the community.I wish our culture had many more rites of passage, communal moments when we celebrated a moral transition. There could be a communitywide rite of passage for people coming out of prison, for forgiveness of a personal wrong, for people who felt they had come out the other side of trauma and abuse. There\u2019d be a marriage ceremony of sorts to mark the moment when a young person found the vocation he or she would dedicate life to.It\u2019ll take a lot to make our culture a thick moral culture. But one way or another, nations and people have to grow a soul big enough to enclose the traumas that haunt them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheep Without Shepherds", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor ordinary Catholics, the failures of their leaders have created a two-decade test of faith.Opinion ColumnistHere is a striking fact about the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. The sex abuse crisis in the early 2000s, the horrid revelations of predation that began in Boston in 2001, did not have an obvious long-term effect on the practice of the faith.Yes, American Catholicism has lost millions of its baptized flock over the last 50 years. But that decline was steepest in the 1960s and 1970s; by the turn of the millennium, some trends (attendance at Mass, for instance) had stabilized, and the number of Catholics marrying in the Church and baptizing their children had settled into a slower decline.The question was sharpened by last week\u2019s fiasco in Baltimore, at the General Assembly of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, where the American Church\u2019s shepherds were supposed to vote on some kind of plan to handle malfeasance within their ranks \u2014 only to have their intentions swatted down, at the last minute, by the Vatican\u2019s insistence that any accountability measures be hashed out in Rome some months hence. The fiasco was not surprising \u2014 the tone-deafness and self-protectiveness of the Roman intervention, the bafflement and internal divisions of the American bishops, and the liberal-versus-conservative arguments that followed were all characteristic of Catholicism\u2019s crisis under Pope Francis.But in being unsurprising the fiasco was still revelatory. When the sex abuse scandals broke in 2001 it was possible to imagine that they were just about sex abuse \u2014 that the church could simply stop treating predatory priests with therapy, start defrocking them, and move forward chastened and renewed.Seventeen years later, with neither the American bishops nor Pope Francis able to muster an adequate response to the revelation that a famous cardinal was a predator whose sins were known even as he rose, it\u2019s clear that this was wrong. The Church has done much better since 2001 in the most basic task of keeping children safe. But in everything else connected to the scandal there is little progress because Catholicism\u2019s leaders cannot agree on what progress means.It is clear that there is festering sexual and financial corruption in the hierarchy; it is clear that there are problems in the way the Church trains priests and selects bishops. But the Church\u2019s theological factions are sufficiently far apart that each would rather do nothing than let the other side lead reform \u2014 because the liberals think the conservatives want an inquisition, the conservatives think the liberals want Episcopalianism, and there is some truth in both caricatures.Thus all proposals for reform are evaluated through an ideological lens, and neither side has enough confidence to learn something from the other, or to conduct a full purification of its own ranks.The result, as in secular politics these days, is stalemate and confusion, with a Church increasingly unsure of what it teaches, led by men who can\u2019t agree on how it might be cleansed. Which in turn leaves the Catholic faithful with less hope than in 2001 that their bishops can achieve competence and decency, let alone Christian holiness.Someday soon (maybe for Advent or Christmas) I will write a column about why this leave-taking is a terrible mistake. But for today it\u2019s enough to raise the possibility that Henneberger and Linker are representative of many wavering Catholics who stayed with a compromised leadership in 2001 but won\u2019t stay with a hierarchy that seems bankrupt in 2018 \u2026 or for however long the Church\u2019s internal stalemate obstructs justice and forestalls reform. I think the bishops meeting in Baltimore know that this is a possibility, that they may be responsible for the loss of churchgoers, the loss of souls. I think many have genuinely good intentions, a genuine desperation to figure out what must be done.And I think their impotence is a lesson, all too literal, in the road that good intentions often pave.Advertisement"}

Here are concrete steps it could take to make things better.Ms. Jacobson was the United States ambassador to Mexico from 2016 to 2018. Mr. Restrepo was a special assistant for Western Hemisphere affairs to President Barack Obama.Trying to stop immigrants as the Trump administration is doing \u2014 unilaterally, at the border and with tear gas and troops \u2014 is a sign of only one thing: failure.In fact, the administration\u2019s response to the migrant caravan from Central America that recently arrived at the border with Mexico highlights much of what is wrong with American politics and immigration policy today.These migrants, regardless of their reasons for coming, are being exploited and victimized at both ends of their journey: at home by street gangs, human traffickers and major criminal organizations, and in the United States by politicians seeking political gain.Given the situation at the border, there is an urgent need to deploy practical solutions to the challenges of migration with the clear goal of establishing safe, orderly and legal migration.This means that the United States must stay true to its national interests, history, values and legal obligations in the ways it handles people seeking asylum. That does not mean letting in every petitioner. Economic migrants do not qualify for asylum; they should understand that, for them, the perilous journey north will ultimately be a fruitless one.Instead, the United States and its partners in the region need to address the governmental dysfunction in Central America that is driving so many desperate people to embark on incredibly dangerous journeys in search of a better, more secure life.The United States also needs to expand its refugee programs in the so-called Northern Triangle of Central America \u2014 El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014 so that people can apply for refugee status while still in their home countries.Longer-term work is also essential to break the cycles of lawlessness and economic deprivation fueling migration.The United States should not be threatening to curtail assistance to the Northern Triangle countries, as President Trump has done. Instead, it should be providing additional assistance focused on job creation and strengthening anti-gang and violence prevention programs. Effective but small-scale local programs to combat these problems already exist \u2014 they should be expanded so their impact is felt across the region. The president-elect of Mexico, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who will take office on Saturday, has spoken of his country playing a more active role in economic development in the Northern Triangle. The United States should leverage that interest to the fullest extent possible.Any effort to promote more stable, sustainable societies in the Northern Triangle must also include the region\u2019s private sector, which should be pressed to contribute financially to American aid packages. And the United States should support efforts to root out corruption that is often fueled by predatory corporate interests. Roberta Jacobson was United States ambassador to Mexico from 2016 to 2018 and assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs from 2012 to 2016.

The G.D.P. is growing at about 3.5 percent a year, which is about a point faster than many experts thought possible. We\u2019re in the middle of the second-longest recovery in American history, and if it lasts for another eight months it will be the longest ever. If you were born in 1975, you\u2019ve seen the U.S. economy triple in size over the course of your lifetime.And yet are we happy?So why the long faces?Part of the problem is Donald Trump. People can\u2019t feel good about things when they think the country is disastrously led. How many unpaid internships can you endure before you lose faith in the system?But the biggest factor is the crisis of connection. People, especially in the middle- and working-class slices of society, are less likely to volunteer in their community, less likely to go to church, less likely to know their neighbors, less likely to be married than they were at any time over the past several decades. In short, they have fewer resources to help them ride the creative destruction that is ever-present in a market economy.And they are dying. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that life expectancy in the United States declined for the third straight year. This is an absolutely stunning trend. In affluent, well-connected societies, life expectancies rise almost as a matter of course. The last time the American mortality rate fell for three straight years was 1915-1918, during World War I and the flu pandemic, which took 675,000 American lives.And yet here we are \u2014 a straight-up social catastrophe.Economic anxiety is now downstream from and merged with sociological, psychological and spiritual decay. There are thousands of employers looking for workers and unable to find any. Many young people do not have the support structures they need to persevere in school and get skills. There\u2019s an interesting debate going on in conservative circles over whether we have overvalued total G.D.P. growth in our economic policy and undervalued programs that specifically foster dignity-enhancing work. The way I see it is this: It\u2019s nonsense to have an economic policy \u2014 or any policy \u2014 that doesn\u2019t account for and address the social catastrophe happening all around us. Every single other issue exists under the shadow of this one.Conservatives were wrong to think that economic growth would lead to healthy families and communities all by itself. Moderate Democrats were wrong to think it was sufficient to maximize growth and then address inequalities with transfer payments. The progressives are wrong to think life would be better if we just made our political economy look more like Denmark\u2019s. The Danes and the Swedes take for granted a cohesive social fabric that simply does not exist here.It\u2019s not jobs, jobs, jobs anymore.

{"Headline": "Learning to Attack the Cyberattackers Can\u2019t Happen Fast Enough", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 In a technology lab full of graduate students huddled over laptops, Prof. Marios Savvides flipped through photos on a computer screen searching for one full of people whose faces were barely recognizable to the human eye.\u201cHow about a riot?\u201d Professor Savvides asked. He had just come upon an image of police officers wearing helmets and gas masks and rioters covering their mouths and noses with bandannas \u2014 all trying to shield themselves from the tear-gas- and smoke-filled air.Professor Savvides was delighted. It was a perfect example of where, with the facial recognition skills of artificial intelligence, \u201cwe can now recognize a face from very few pixels,\u201d he said.CyLab, which includes the center, was founded in 2003 to expand the boundaries of technology and protect people when that technology \u2014 or the people using it \u2014 poses a threat.Based in the university\u2019s 25,000-square-foot Collaborative Innovation Center, CyLab works in partnership with roughly 20 corporations \u2014 like Boeing, Microsoft and Facebook \u2014 and government agencies to do research and education in internet privacy and security.The subject has become one of the hottest areas of research and training in the United States these days as increasingly sophisticated hackers threaten not only personal computer security but also the operation of everything from banking systems to water purification plants to nuclear arsenals. While the threats mount, the number of people qualified to confront them is far too low, experts say, and educational institutions and government agencies are scrambling to fill the gap.More than 300 researchers and graduate students are working or studying at CyLab this year, making it among the largest cybersecurity training centers in the world. It offers more than 50 courses in security and privacy and has trained more than 75,000 people.Biometrics, the science of using hard-to-mask physical attributes \u2014 like facial characteristics, fingerprints, retinal scans and DNA \u2014 is just one specialty. CyLab is also engaged in broader uses for A.I., cryptography, network security and an array of other cybersecurity skills.One of the first times Professor Savvides and his group used his facial-recognition technology for something besides research was just after the 2015 Boston Marathon bombing. His lab took the blurry, low-resolution, surveillance image of the suspected bomber released by the F.B.I. and, using A.I. technology, reconstructed the image and sent it to the bureau.The next morning, the identity of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the bombing, was revealed. Professor Savvides doesn\u2019t know whether his reconstruction helped the F.B.I., but \u201cwe were extremely surprised to see the resemblance to Tsarnaev that was constructed from the very low resolution, pixelated face that even our human brain cannot comprehend,\u201d he said.Like fingerprints, each person\u2019s iris is unique; it stays the same as we age, and unlike fingerprints, cannot be scratched or covered up in some way short of removing the eye altogetherAnd fingerprints can\u2019t be taken from a long distance.Then police would know whether the person was driving a stolen car, had a criminal record or was on a terrorist list \u2014 and might be dangerous \u2014 before walking up to the car.It could also help speed up endless security lines at airports. Instead of a human agent taking a passport or a driver\u2019s license and running it through a security check, the irises of travelers could be quickly scanned.Professor Savvides gets annoyed with such talk.\u201cWe all want better computer and human relations \u2014 we\u2019ve craved it for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cBut biometrics and facial recognition are stigmatized by Hollywood.\u201dSome of the CyLab work is focused on the threats that most affect people in their daily lives: password security.\u201cA password that\u2019s long and just slightly complex is stronger than a password that\u2019s very complex but short,\u201d said Mr. Bauer, an associate professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering.Just changing a few words or adding numbers in a password already used does very little to stop hackers, who can easily try thousands of variations of a password in rapid succession, he said. As everyone has been told repeatedly, the worst thing to do is reuse passwords from different accounts. That may be how many people\u2019s accounts have been hacked.Other research from CyLab has discovered that, contrary to common assumptions, older people are less likely to be a target of phishing than 18- to 25-year-olds, perhaps because younger people are more likely to take risks, said Jason Hong, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction InstituteMuch of cybersecurity is, as Kathleen Carley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s School of Computer Science, put it, \u201cemploying computer techniques to better understand society and employing our knowledge of society to better understand computer techniques.\u201dHer work is social cybersecurity \u2014 that is figuring out how to make social media \u201ca free and open place without undue influence.\u201dIt\u2019s a subject that has become a major societal issue with the suspected Russian hacking of the 2016 election in the United States.Most people, she said, don\u2019t realize the impact of bots, which are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. The role of bots is to convince and direct individuals; it could be for relatively innocuous reasons such as marketing, but increasingly bots are used by organizations or governments to run schemes or sow discord on social media by creating or amplifying an existing conversation, making it more virulent and divisive.The bots exploit how human brains are wired. People hear something repeated over and over, seemingly from many sources, and it soon seems like the truth.\u201cThey are affecting the country\u2019s values and beliefs,\u201d she said.One example, which Professor Carley and her team discovered in 2015, was a bot used to persuade Syrians and those in the Syrian diaspora to go to a website to donate to charity for Syrians.\u201cWe believe it was actually a money-laundering site for ISIS,\u201d she said.In that case, the bots, or botnet, which are bots connected together and controlled as a group, were identified simply through human detection. But A.I. researchers have now created algorithms to identify bots.The one Professor Carley and her team created is called bot-hunter.Perhaps even more insidious are bots that generate and magnify discord on social media, \u201cwarping the information environment,\u201d Professor Carley said, and affecting everything from how people vote to what they buy to how they view others in society.There are relatively few bots compared with real human accounts, but they are so active that their effect is far out of proportion to their size, she said.One popular example is the big role bots played in the civil unrest in Ukraine in 2013 believed to be fomented by the Russians, Professor Carley said.She and others are developing technological fixes, such as using A.I to do automatic fact-checking, to identify bots and to identify posts with abusive language. But, she said, \u201cthe tools are in their infancy,\u201d and technology alone won\u2019t solve this problem \u201cPolicymakers and the public have to be educated,\u201d she said.And while fun, it is also a way to encourage young people to think about a profession they may never have considered before.\u201cThere\u2019s a dramatic shortage of people in cybersecurity,\u201d said Martin Carlisle, a professor and director of academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon who oversees the contest. \u201cAnd we know the vast majority of students have picked their major by the time they get to college.\u201dSo targeting middle- and high-school students, he said, is a way to get them excited about a career in cybersecurity before they\u2019re already in college.This year\u2019s winner? Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, Calif. It was the only team that solved every challenge, although thousands made significant inroads, he said.\u201cThis was one of the few competitions I could access as a high school student,\u201d said Carolina Zarate, who entered the contest in Maryland and who is now a graduate student studying information security at Carnegie Mellon.She helps develop problems for picoCTF and is also part of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s competitive hacking team, which has won four out of the last six competitions at the Def Con conference, considered to be the Olympics of hacking competitions.For Ms. Zarate, the interest in cybersecurity was always there, but she said she hoped the challenge got more people involved.\u201cIf you think how many new areas technology is touching \u2014 what if someone hacked self-driving cars or bitcoins?\u201d she said. \u201cI want my money and life to be safe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If we take the other, we\u2019ll be on the road to autocracy, with no obvious way to get off.But ugly as the scene will be if Democrats win, it will be far worse if they lose. In fact, it\u2019s not hyperbole to say that if the G.O.P. holds the line on Tuesday, it may be the last even halfway fair elections we\u2019ll ever have.Look at what\u2019s happening in Georgia, where Brian Kemp \u2014 the Republican secretary of state, who oversees elections \u2014 is running for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams. In any other democracy, letting a man supervise his own election would be inconceivable. But that\u2019s how it is in Georgia, and Kemp is abusing his power to the max.A political party with any kind of commitment to democracy and fair play would treat Kemp as a pariah. Instead, he has the full support of the national G.O.P.Now, Democrats haven\u2019t made the clear and present danger to democracy a central theme of their campaigns; they\u2019ve been running mainly on health care instead. And it\u2019s hard to fault their judgment. After all, health care is indeed on the line in these elections: Millions of Americans, especially but not only those with pre-existing conditions, will lose coverage if Republicans hold the House, because they\u2019ll finally repeal the Affordable Care Act and will soon go after Medicare and Medicaid.Meanwhile, the reality is that ordinary voters are more easily moved by issues that have a direct impact on their well-being than by more abstract concerns about democracy and rule of law. And until very recently, mainstream news media berated Democrats for running on nothing but opposition to Trump (which was never true, but the media said it anyway), while tending to dismiss talk about Republican abuse of power as hysterical.But with the crucial moment here, everyone should bear in mind what\u2019s at stake. It\u2019s not just tax cuts or health coverage, and anyone who votes based simply on those issues is missing the bigger story. For the survival of American democracy is on the ballot.Advertisement"}

When I was in middle school, she had a side hustle selling acrylic-rhinestone bug brooches. The jewelry was hard to move on its merits \u2014 even for the 1980s it was staggeringly ugly. But what she lacked in salable product, she made up for in sheer selling stamina. Every sleepover, school fair or birthday party, out would come the tray of bejeweled grasshoppers and stag beetles, glinting with Reagan-era menace. Presumably someone was making money from this venture \u2014 some proto-Trump barking orders from his tax haven \u2014 but it certainly didn\u2019t seem to be Rebecca\u2019s mother, whose sales pitches took on an ever more shrill note of desperation.Soon she had given up even the basic social pretense that we might actually want the brooches. The laws of supply and demand morphed seamlessly into the laws of guilt and obligation, and then into the laws of outright malice, mirroring the trajectory of capitalism itself.At that time, when naked hawking to your friends was still considered an etiquette blunder, the sales pitches by Rebecca\u2019s mother felt embarrassing \u2014 as gaudy and threatening to the social ecosystem as a purple rhinestone daddy longlegs. But 30 years later, at the height of the gig economy, when the foundation of working life has apparently become selling your friends things they don\u2019t want, I look back to that raw need in Rebecca\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes with something terrifyingly approaching recognition.The trick of doing this well, of course, is to act as if you aren\u2019t doing it at all \u2014 as if this is simply how you like to unwind in the evening, by sharing your views on pasta sauce with your 567,000 followers.

Australia and Turkey joined the United States in declining.Mr. Macron aimed the accord largely at democracies, which meant that the countries most often accused of conducting state-sponsored attacks \u2014 Russia, China, North Korea and Iran \u2014 did not participate in the process.Israel, which along with the United States conducted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history, the Stuxnet attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program, also declined to sign.The United States did not say why it did not sign the accord, and one diplomat, who would not allow the use of his name because he is not authorized to speak publicly on policy issues, said that it was possible that Washington may sign the principles at a later date.But if past debates over setting norms of behavior for cyberspace are a guide, American officials are leery of any kind of agreement that might make illegal the types of activity \u2014 like espionage, data manipulation or attacks on infrastructure \u2014 that the United States may want to use in a future conflict.Elections are an interesting example. Congress and many others have condemned the 2016 Russian attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the private email accounts of senior officials in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But the United States has interfered in foreign elections before, including Italy in the 1940s and Iran and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s, and some officials say that no American president should be forced to give up that tool if it could prevent a war.Similarly, the Pentagon worries about commitments to avoid using cyberattacks as a prelude to military action. The United States had a secret program, code-named \u201cNitro Zeus,\u201d which called for turning off the power grid in much of Iran if the two countries had found themselves in a conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Such a use of cyberweapons is now a key element in war planning by all of the major world powers.Still, the fact that companies and governments came together on any kind of vision for keeping the internet free of malicious activity was viewed by some key players as a step forward.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s democracies are rallying around the need to protect all democracies from cyberattacks,\u201d said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, who has been among the most vocal in arguing for a digital Geneva Convention. \u201cYou have to start by building a strong coalition among the democracies themselves.\u201dMuch of the statement of principles calls for restrictions on actions Washington has also condemned in the past: the theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets and industrial designs, and attacks on \u201cthe public core of the internet.\u201dThe United States has indicted Chinese, North Korean, Iranian and Russian hackers for offenses including theft of industrial secrets and for attacking Sony Pictures Entertainment to prevent the distribution of a movie that North Korea found offensive. Nonetheless, the administration\u2019s aversion to international agreements in general may have made it leery of joining the announcement on Monday.Governments were outnumbered by companies and nongovernmental groups as signatories. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and I.B.M. all signed on. Three of the five countries that are part of what is known as the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d \u2014 the English-speaking victors of World War II who share intelligence information \u2014 also signed: Britain, Canada and New Zealand.Advertisement"}

The authorities said they suspected that he might have had post traumatic stress after a deployment in Afghanistan but was ultimately determined to have posed no threat. Neighbors said he was a solitary figure who lived with his mother, and often clashed with her.As news of the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., spread to his former battalion, shocked veterans wondered if the troubles that led their fellow Marine to kill innocent civilians in a crowded bar had resided in him before the military, or if he had brought them home from war.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised someone I knew ended up doing a mass shooting. We had another guy recently committed suicide by cops in Texas,\u201d said Sam Tanner, who served with Mr. Long and described him as a friend. \u201cGuys struggle. We\u2019ve lost more Marines in our peer group to suicide than we ever lost in Afghanistan.\u201dAnother friend said he could not match the Marine he knew, who had been given a good conduct award, with the man who barged into the bar.\u201cHe was a really good guy. He gave me the Bible I still carry today,\u201d said Dewayne Pettiford, who was his roommate in the military. \u201cWe were trained as machine gunners, so you know you are capable of doing something like this. But that he did it makes no sense. It is against all our values.\u201dMr. Long, 28, lived with his mother on a quiet street of palm trees and tidy ranch houses. Neighbors said that when Mr. Long moved in after leaving the military, they regularly heard yelling in the Long house, and sometimes at night, gunfire.Tom Hanson, 70, who has lived in the home next to the Longs for decades, called 911 about a year ago, concerned about the yelling.\u201cI didn\u2019t know if he was going to kill himself or what he would do, so I called the sheriff to investigate,\u201d he said.Another neighbor, Donald Macleod, who lived behind the Longs, said Thursday morning that agents in F.B.I. jackets were searching the house, where he once heard gunfire at night, and Mr. Long arguing with his mother.According to Sheriff Geoff Dean, Mr. Long was also the victim in a January 2015 fight at a different bar in Thousand Oaks.The sheriff\u2019s office said that after a disturbance at the house in April, mental health specialists had talked to Mr. Long, discussing his service in the Marine Corps and whether he had PTSD. They determined that he was not an immediate danger to himself or others and that he could not be involuntarily taken to a mental hospital.Mr. Long joined the Marine Corps after high school in August 2008, just as the Marines were preparing for a bloody campaign in Afghanistan to take the Helmand Province from the Taliban, according to Marine Corps records. He trained as a machine-gunner, and was assigned the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment in Hawaii. Marines who served with him described him as a health-food and fitness fanatic who liked to lift weights to loud music.The battalion deployed in 2010 to Helmand, but Mr. Long was held back because the battalion had limited space and he was seen as a low-performing Marine, said Mr. Tanner, who was also held back.\u201cHe was a little strange,\u201d Mr. Tanner said. \u201cAnd I think his seniors didn\u2019t like him.\u201dA short time later, Mr. Long deployed instead with Golf Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment. In Afghanistan, the 1,000-Marine battalion saw little action compared with others during a troop surge from 2010 to 2012, Marines said.\u201cIt was fairly quiet,\u201d said Jeremy Soliz, who was part of the deployment. \u201cWe were warriors, but we acted more like policemen. We built roads, built canals, tried to help people.\u201d\u201cEvery time you walked outside the wire, you wondered if you were going to get your legs blown off,\u201d he said.Records show Mr. Long earned the Combat Action Ribbon, given to Marines who have engaged the enemy. Nothing in his record indicates that he was wounded, or punished for misconduct. He was honorably discharged in 2013.After the Marines, Mr. Long appeared to readjust, Mr. Pettiford said. He studied athletic training at California State University, Northridge, and feverishly followed the Los Angeles Dodgers. He always seemed in high spirits when Mr. Pettiford checked in.Blake Winnett, 35, a set builder who lived with Mr. Long in two different houses, said that Mr. Long spent a lot of time studying and on the computer in his room while he was attending CSUN. He also had a carefree side.\u201cHe was a raver, essentially, and liked to go to underground dance events,\u201d Mr. Winnett said. \u201cThe sweatier the better.\u201dBut there were also signs of trouble. Mr. Long was hospitalized from a motorcycle crash about three years ago, Mr. Pettiford said.\u201cA combat deployment creates such a high level of stimulus and afterward you struggle to fill it,\u201d Mr. Pettiford said. \u201cThat\u2019s why guys wreck their motorcycles. They are searching for that intensity they lost.\u201dNeighbors said they rarely saw him outside the house.Mr. Hanson, who lives next to the Longs, said Mr. Long was quiet.\u201cHe rarely spoke to me, but that didn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople have their own lives, we\u2019re different ages, different concerns.\u201dMr. Hanson said he had countless friends who were Vietnam veterans with whom he used to get together for casual basketball or football games. He motioned to the street in front of his home, now cordoned off with red crime-scene tape.\u201cWe\u2019d spend time together, get air, blow off some steam,\u201d Mr. Hanson said of his veteran friends. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that now.

Another scholar, Lourdes Torres, a professor of Latino studies at DePaul University in Chicago, argues that the word Latinx undermines hard-fought feminist battles. \u201cIn its attempt to be gender-inclusive,\u201d she said, \u201cone can argue that it\u2019s gender-erasing of women who have fought for a long time to not just have Latino, but to have Latino/Latina, to make sure women are represented.\u201d\u201cAs social factors change, sometimes the language has to change,\u201d said Dr. Torres. \u201cThe people who use the language are the ones who determine what it is.\u201d She and Dr. Potowski both gave words like \u201cpresidenta\u201d or \u201cjefa\u201d as examples; neither existed until women entered the work force and took on those roles. Ed Morales, a Columbia University professor who wrote \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,\u201d agrees. In a recent conversation he said that \u201cthe X, which is so strange and is not Spanish, sort of marks this new hybrid idea.\u201d The title of his book, similarly, was meant to be forward-looking. \u201cI thought it was a futurist term,\u201d he said, \u201cimagining a future of more inclusion for people that don\u2019t conform to the various kinds of rigid identities that exist in the United States.\u201dDialectical hierarchy is nothing new. Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, for instance, are criticized for dropping word endings or using inventive slang. It\u2019s significant that the Real Academia recognized American Spanish in its pages, but why is it widely perceived as being less valid than the Spanish dialects spoken in other countries?Many young, American Latinos believe that Spain\u2019s official ruling on language erases our African and indigenous roots in favor of European values. Some have argued that Latinx is partly a nod to the gender fluidity that existed among Natives before colonization. The value of the X is that it \u201cprovokes conversation about who we\u2019re including and who we\u2019re not including in our communities,\u201d she said. But that doesn\u2019t mean everybody has to use it. \u201cIf you talk to my dad or my t\u00eda, that\u2019s just another silly academic or political thing,\u201d Dr. Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely of a certain world.\u201dStill, she said, even if the terms are not always understood, it\u2019s important to be \u201cinclusive of all those identities that have had less visibility in our conversations, in our books, in our movies.\u201d If we can, she said, \u201cit would be a really powerful thing.\u201dHere are more stories to read this week.

The date printed on my actually green \u201cPermanent Resident\u201d card is July 11, 2018: 7/11, a date that will always remind me of the bright blue 7-Eleven Slurpees I used to drink. And also, in the year 2018, of a long summer of the Trump administration\u2019s cruelty on family separation. A summer when \u201cWhere are the children?\u201d was a trending topic. Then, even though so many of the kids were still not with their parents, people forgot about the kids, or the people fleeing for their lives and hoping that this country would grant them asylum. This is the country I can permanently stay in now.My father left because of the war in 1991. Mom followed three years later. I followed, unaccompanied, in 1999. I did not understand what a border was, or what legality meant. What I did understand was that I wanted to be reunited with my parents, to be held by them. I faced corrupt cops in Guatemala, had M-16s pointed at me in Mexico, had a shotgun pointed at me by an Arizona rancher. The group I was traveling with was surveilled, followed by helicopters. The border has always been highly militarized. The caravan is a caravan because it is safer to flee in numbers. The final step of the green card vetting process was to return to El Salvador, where I hadn\u2019t been in 19 years. I had to pass medical exams and an interview at the American Embassy. In other words, to obtain the legal right to remain in the United States, safely away from the country I fled at age 9, I had to go back to that country. I was woken up by gunshots five times while I was there for around a month. On the Russian River, enjoying the end of the summer, my green card inside my wallet, my friends asked how I would define being American. We tried to come up with definitions, but they seemed to fall short.  I remembered waiting for my number to be called at the United States Embassy in San Salvador. G44. Three arrows were painted on the embassy floor, leading from the street to the interview booths. A green one for green card applications. A yellow one for other visas. And a purple one for visitor visas. I followed the green one to a seating area from which I could see the rest of the people in the room, the visitors and the other-visas, make their way to the interview booths. I waited one hour, then another, for G44 to be called. I tried to keep calm as I watched people argue with the officers or simply cry on their way out of the embassy, following the same colored lines they had stepped on hours earlier. I imagined they had all been denied, and wondered how many of them would try to leave by other means.It has been strange to navigate the good news of my visa and now my permanent residency, along with the rise of President Trump and his anti-immigrant rhetoric. I still cannot vote until I\u2019m a citizen. That possibility won\u2019t come true for another five years. I think the closest thing to defining American is a false sense of safety. With this card in my pocket, I should feel safe, or at least safer, but I truly don\u2019t. Not when there has been a rise of people with legal documentation getting stopped by ICE. Not when the president himself is questioning the 14th Amendment. It has been hard for me to accept that I have, in a way, benefited from the \u201cAmerican dream,\u201d whatever that may mean today.Javier Zamora is the author of \u201cUnaccompanied,\u201d a book of poetry.

{"Headline": "The First Thanksgiving", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecently arrived refugees in the United States prepare to cook the most American of feasts.A new friend who was also Muslim gave her a turkey from a local halal butcher for Thanksgiving. Ms. Anjari cut it into pieces, covered it with water, and simmered it into soup with potatoes, carrots, ginger and cumin. Her family liked it, she said, but it didn\u2019t seem very special to her. Were the apples really going to be baked with cinnamon, a spice that Ms. Anjari uses with meat and chicken? Why would you roast a bird whole \u2014 how would it get evenly cooked that way? How can macaroni and cheese, one of her children\u2019s favorite dinners, be a side dish? Were the mashed potatoes not going to be seasoned with a little garlic and a lot of caramelized onions, the way she makes them? The vetting process for resettlement takes about two years. While Ms. Anjari, her husband and their children were admitted, dozens of their relatives are still stranded in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.From the day of arrival, food is an integral part of adjustment to a new country. On the State Department\u2019s list of things that sponsors must provide immediately is a \u201cculturally appropriate\u201d meal for the family. Some sponsors interpret this in religious terms, and provide store-bought halal fried chicken or kosher pizza. But others take the responsibility more literally, going to great lengths to greet arrivals with home-cooked food that is specific to their place of origin, familiar and comforting. Working from online recipes and grocery lists, Ms. Farmer cooked a dinner of lamb stew and cracked wheat, and stocked the family\u2019s new kitchen with key ingredients like tahini, yogurt, cucumbers and rice. Fereshteh Ganjavi, who arrived from Afghanistan in 2013 and now works at Integrated Refugees, said the meal is particularly powerful for refugees who arrive after years of exile from their home country. Her welcome dinner included a traditional pulao of lamb and rice with raisins, and green tea spiced with saffron and cardamom, a brew specific to the mountainous Hindu Kush region that stretches across northern Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cWe were living in a camp before entering the U.S., and I had almost forgotten the taste of our own food,\u201d she said.Dima King, who arrived in the United States last year, is seeking asylum because of the anti-gay persecution and legislation that have taken hold in his native Russia since 2013. He is cooking his first Thanksgiving dinner this year. Still, he said he is intimidated by roasting a whole turkey (a skill that is rarely taught in culinary school) and will likely attempt a smaller cut. But he has fully envisioned the dessert: a pumpkin pie with meringue topping. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to use fresh pumpkin,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to be very comfortable with vegetables.\u201dEven for trained and accomplished cooks like Mr. King and Ms. Anjari, the traditional Thanksgiving dinner can seem rife with unfamiliar flavors and methods. The multitude of soft, starchy dishes (like mashed potatoes, yams, stuffing and pie), the sharpness of cranberry sauce and the sheer size of a turkey strike many first-timers as peculiar. She put the bird in one of her lightweight round tins \u2014 a heavy roasting pan with handles is not part of her cookware collection \u2014 covered it tightly with foil, and let it cook at high heat; then lowered the oven, removed the foil and let it brown. Finally, she toasted slivered almonds in clarified butter (the Middle Eastern version, called samna, is prized for its lush, tangy flavor) and scattered them over the bird for a rich, crunchy garnish. She had already taken some brussels sprouts for a trial run, roasting them plain with salt and pepper until slightly caramelized. \u201cLittle cabbages!\u201d she said with pleasure, slicing one open for the first time. Working quickly, by hand and without measuring, she mixed a batch of the butter-rich dough she uses for ma\u2019amoul, classic date-stuffed cookies: It would be used to line a pan for her first apple pie. In Syria, she said, she routinely made batches of the same dough using 25 pounds of flour and six pounds of sugar. All the women of the family, including her mother, three sisters and countless in-laws and cousins, would gather to share the painstaking work of pinching, filling and pressing. Peeling apple after apple without even looking down at her hands, her phone pinging with messages from relatives who remain in the Middle East, she said that cooking alone had been a hard adjustment. \u201cThat\u2019s when I miss home the most,\u201d she said. Finally, she sat down to taste the food, surrounded by her children and a crush of friends, interpreters, sponsors and assorted cookbook helpers. As a cook, she understands both that making Thanksgiving dinner is part of the passage to American life, and that mastering it gradually is a fine approach. But this year, the appeal of sweet potatoes \u2014 even mashed with butter and salt \u2014 continued to elude her. \u201cNext time,\u201d she said, like many a Thanksgiving cook, \u201cI\u2019ll make them better.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Link Between August Birthdays and A.D.H.D.", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new study raises questions about age, maturity and overdiagnosis. The authors are health policy researchers.Diagnosing A.D.H.D. is difficult. Unlike other childhood diseases \u2014 such as asthma, obesity and diabetes \u2014 the diagnosis of A.D.H.D. is inherently subjective and depends on the assessment of parents, school personnel and health care providers. For a child who is easily distracted, an assessment of normal, inattentive behavior by one could be a formal diagnosis of A.D.H.D. by another.It turns out that although diagnosing A.D.H.D. requires a subjective interpretation of facts, the month in which a child is born can be a strong, objective predictor. We believe these findings reveal just how subjective the diagnosis of A.D.H.D. can be. In any given class, inattentive behavior among younger, August-born children may be perceived, in some instances, to reflect symptom of A.D.H.D., rather than the relative immaturity that is biologically determined and to be expected among children who are nearly one year younger than September-born classmates.The stakes of additional, potentially inappropriate diagnoses are high, particularly when diagnoses are accompanied by medical treatment, which has side effects. In cases where A.D.H.D. is appropriately diagnosed, we know that behavioral and medical treatments can improve concentration and school performance and other outcomes. And in these instances, the harms of medical treatments are, on average, outweighed by the benefits. But when the disease is improperly diagnosed, the clinical harms and dollar costs of treatment may not be met with commensurate benefits.At a minimum, physicians who frequently diagnose A.D.H.D. in children should be aware of these findings. A simple mental \u201cadjustment\u201d for whether a child is born in August may be sufficient to help physicians reduce overdiagnosis.School personnel and parents should also be aware of how simple cognitive biases can creep into how important clinical decisions are made. Both our and previous findings suggest that parents of children who are young for their grade could reasonably question whether the initiation of medical treatment for A.D.H.D. should be delayed.In his 2008 book \u201cOutliers,\u201d Malcolm Gladwell describes the now well-known phenomenon that a disproportionate number of Canadian professional hockey players have birth dates in the beginning of the calendar year. This is explained by the Jan. 1 age eligibility cutoff for hockey programs in Canada, which leads to the oldest hockey players within an age-based division exceeding the age of the youngest players by nearly a year, conferring them a performance advantage. A similar phenomenon is true for A.D.H.D., where a child\u2019s age relative to peers confers a markedly different rate of diagnosis and treatment, but the stakes are higher.Anupam B.

{"Headline": "Juul\u2019s New Product: Less Nicotine, More Intense Vapor", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Juul Labs has soared to the top of the United States e-cigarette market in just three years with its high-nicotine products that give off just a wisp of vapor.Now, facing public backlash and overseas restrictions, the company is working on a way to lower the nicotine in its pods \u2014 but still maintain a potent punch from the addictive chemical.Juul is developing a pod that is higher in vapor, which, experts say, can enhance the rate at which nicotine is absorbed in the body.People knowledgeable about the development of the higher-vapor pod say the company hopes it will appeal to cigarette smokers who are accustomed to a bigger cloud. And by reducing the nicotine level, even while magnifying the effect of the nicotine, Juul presumably would be able to meet stricter nicotine limits in many countries.It is unclear what levels of nicotine would be in the new design, and a variety of models are under development for different markets. The new pods are being designed for sale overseas, where Juul wants to replicate the success it has had in the United States.But in the European Union, where Juul plans to expand, and in the United Kingdom, where it is already on the market, the nicotine limit for e-cigarettes is 20 milligrams per milliliter of fluid \u2014 about a third of the amount in the most popular American Juul pod.A lower nicotine version is also on sale in the United States, but, at 23 milligrams of nicotine per milliliter of fluid, it still exceeds European Union requirements.Joshua Raffel, a Juul spokesman, declined to answer numerous questions about the new pod. In an interview, he would only say: \u201cWe are always looking to create products that help adult smokers switch from combustible cigarettes and limit appeal to youth.\u201dJuul has not ruled out marketing the product in the United States, but would need the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval to do so.Some experts said the higher vapor could potentially make the pods even more addictive, increasing the risk particularly to young people, whose developing brains are more susceptible to the addictive qualities of nicotine.Micah Berman, associate professor of public health and law at The Ohio State University, said the amount of nicotine in a pod can be deceptive \u2014 what really matters is how much the body actually absorbs.\u201cOne of the things with cigarette design over the years is that they have figured out how to maximize the impact of nicotine in cigarettes,\u201d Mr. Berman said.Of Juul\u2019s plans, he said: \u201cIf it\u2019s a change that reduces test levels of nicotine \u2014 the amount you would identify as being in the pod itself \u2014 but doesn\u2019t actually change the biological level, then that\u2019s certainly problematic. It\u2019s more like cheating the test.\u201dBut Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said that increasing the vapor might indeed make Juul more useful to smokers who want to quit.\u201cFor smoking cessation, you need to have a satisfying delivery system with a good amount of nicotine with a small amount of aerosol,\u201d Dr. Benowitz said. \u201cBut if you are vaping because you like the sensory aspects of it, then you want more aerosol. Right now, Juul is a good nicotine delivery device but the quality is not the same as a cigarette. I could see why some people might like a product that generates more aerosol and is more cigarette-like.\u201dThe new pods are expected to be slightly longer than the existing pods, but are designed to fit the current Juul device.The San Francisco-based Juul, which began selling its vaping device by the same name in 2015, has now captured more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market share in the United States. Its success has been met with harsh public criticism over an epidemic of teenage vaping, and increasing government pressure to stop it.Earlier this month, facing a deadline from the Food and Drug Administration, Juul announced major changes in its sales and marketing practices aimed at reducing youth access to its devices and popular flavored pods.A sleek, electronic device that looks like an elongated flash drive, Juul works by heating a liquid flavor pod that contains nicotine and benzoic acid. When Juul users inhale, they get a very quick and powerful burst of nicotine.The F.D.A.\u2019s biggest public health goal in this administration has been getting smokers to quit, and reducing the 480,000 annual deaths in the United States from cigarette-related disease. To do so, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner, has encouraged the development of alternatives like e-cigarettes and, early in his tenure, extended the deadline for them to meet tough new agency rules.But this strategy backfired when Juul and other e-cigarettes became immensely popular with youths, and the agency recently restricted sales of certain flavors that appeal to youths.The other half of the F.D.A.\u2019s plan is to reduce nicotine to nonaddictive levels in traditional cigarettes. The agency has started that process, but the tobacco companies have made clear they will fight it. There has been no agency announcement yet regarding limits on nicotine in e-cigarettes.Experts in e-cigarette engineering said there were a number of ways Juul could amp up the vapor, or aerosol, in its products. Edward Hensel, associate dean of engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said one way is by adjusting the heating coil, inside the flavor pod.\u201cThey can use the same battery and the same electronics but by changing the coil you can have a different amount of power, and so aerosolize more product,\u201d Dr. Hensel said.Some public health advocates noted another consequence of a more powerful pod.\u201cMore vapor is more secondhand vapor,\u201d said Chris Bostic, a deputy director at Action on Smoking & Health, a public health group working to eliminate tobacco use. \u201cA bigger cloud of vapor sounds to me like a bigger problem for bystanders.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Gun-Safety Issue Is Actually Helping Democrats", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm election results suggest that the power of the N.R.A. may be diminishing.Mr. Spitzer has written five books on gun policy.It is an unsettling coincidence that mass shootings bookended the 2018 election, from a Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27 to a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Nov. 7. The election that took place in between, though, demonstrated that Democrats and even some Republicans found gun-safety advocacy a boon to their campaigns in a way not seen in a long time. In comparison with previous elections, the gun-rights forces\u2019 customary blaring megaphone seemed nowhere near as loud as usual \u2014 or as effective. This is borne out by an examination of public attitudes, candidate positions, money and exposure.Consider first the public environment. According to Pew Research Center analysis, more Americans now favor gun regulation (52 percent) over gun rights (44 percent), a reversal from 2016. And 57 percent say gun laws should be stricter, compared with 52 percent in 2017. A recent Kaiser Foundation poll found gun policy to be the third most important concern of voters, behind health care and the economy. Similarly, Election Day exit polling found the same rank order, except that gun policy was bumped to fourth by immigration \u2014 a position it probably would not have lost but for President Trump\u2019s strenuous efforts to exploit immigration anxiety. An NBC News exit poll reported that 60 percent of voters favored stronger gun laws, including 42 percent of gun owners.Candidates embraced the gun-safety agenda this cycle to a degree not seen since at least the 2000 elections, when Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made it key to his campaign messaging. According to Mark Kelly, who founded the gun-safety organization Americans for Responsible Solutions with his wife, the former House member Gabrielle Giffords, only four of 36 candidates listed on the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cred to blue\u201d list in 2016 included the gun issue in their platforms. (The \u201cred to blue\u201d list refers to Republican-held seats Democrats hope to gain.) This year, 38 of 59 candidates on the list included the issue. Candidates for Congress and other offices around the country aggressively touted their support for stronger gun measures, in races in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. Consider it no coincidence that many of these states suffered recent mass shootings.Members of Congress, including ambitious ones like Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who ran against Nancy Pelosi to be party leader in 2016, and Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, both had A ratings from the National Rifle Association. But both reversed course, trading their A for an N.R.A. F after recent mass shootings. In Pennsylvania\u2019s First Congressional District, representing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress advertised their support for stronger gun laws, leading gun-safety forces to split their endorsements between the two (Brian Fitzpatrick, the incumbent Republican, won narrowly).Part of the appeal of the gun-safety issue arises from its resonance with women, for whom gun violence is a top concern, and who constituted a key swing constituency. According to a survey conducted by the Y.W.C.A., a top tier of personal concerns among women includes \u201ckeeping their families safe from gun violence.\u201dIn the money race, gun-safety groups apparently topped the N.R.A., which has spent about $11 million in the midterms. Combined gun-safety group spending was about $12 million \u2014 a first at the national level. If the amount of N.R.A. spending seems low, it is: The organization spent twice that in 2014 and five times that amount in 2016. By its own admission, the N.R.A. has money problems. It has also suffered political black eyes from corporate boycotts, allegations of improper ties with Russian agents seeking to influence the 2016 elections and relentless political attacks by the student-led movement that arose from the Parkland school shooting.In five targeted congressional races \u2014 Colorado Sixth, Georgia Sixth, Minnesota Second, Texas Seventh and Virginia Seventh \u2014 gun-safety groups spent major money on behalf of gun-safety supporters, and all won. Especially notable is Georgia\u2019s Sixth District, where Lucy McBath, a Democrat whose son was killed in a racially motivated shooting, defeated a recently elected Republican in a district once represented by Newt Gingrich. Jason Crow, a Democratic military veteran, defeated an incumbent Republican in Colorado\u2019s Sixth District, which includes the site of a 2012 movie theater shooting. He also embraced the gun-safety issue, with a boost from Vote Vets (they allied themselves with the Giffords-Kelly group). In at least three House races \u2014 Florida Twenty-fifth, Minnesota Eighth and North Carolina Thirteenth \u2014 the N.R.A. spent significantly on pro-gun-rights candidates who won.The Senate tally was roughly a draw. N.RA. money helped bring down Democrats in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, but it fell short against Democrats re-elected in Montana and West Virginia. In the one Senate race where the opposing sides spent heavily, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, edged out her opponent in Arizona. And in Florida, the Republican Rick Scott left the N.R.A. with no one to back in this traditionally gun-friendly state after he broke with the organization to sign several new gun measures into law as governor. Among governor\u2019s races, N.R.A. efforts helped the vote leaders in Florida and Georgia (both are subject to recounts as of this writing) and the Oklahoma winner, but they fell short in Nevada, Oregon and Wisconsin.Even more telling has been the explosion of political ads supporting stronger gun laws. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal, pro-gun-law ads aired more than 100,000 times as of September 2018 \u2014 an increase by a factor of 22 over 2014. The ratio of gun-control to gun-rights ads this year also favors the control side much more. For example, the swing states of Florida and Nevada aired no pro-control ads four years ago. This year, they aired more than 45,000. For tossup races as defined by the Cook Political Report, gun ads were more likely to support stronger laws. In tossup House races, 93 percent of the gun-related ads supported stronger gun laws.So why the sea change in public attitudes and emboldened candidates running squarely on gun safety? The answer begins 18 years ago. After Al Gore\u2019s 2000 defeat, Democrats decided, rightly or wrongly, that the gun issue was a poison pill for them, so they all but abandoned it. This left the national gun debate mostly in the hands of the gun-friendly Bush administration and gun-rights supporters. That one-sided national debate turned public attitudes more strongly in favor of gun rights. Democratic silence ended with the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting and President Obama\u2019s decision to promote stronger gun measures in Congress. The effort failed, but it began a new kind of political momentum as new and well-funded gun-safety groups formed, grass-roots mobilization and fund-raising dedicated to gun safety increased, mass shootings continued and candidates began to speak about the issue.Robert Spitzer is a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of five books on gun policy, including \u201cGuns Across America\u201d and \u201cThe Politics of Gun Control.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That was the Big Burn of 1910, which torched an area nearly the size of Connecticut in a weekend.What remained of that blowup told a story: of hurricane force winds, of 100-foot trees that crushed firefighters, of a land so scorched by intense heat that it was decades before seedlings sprouted in some places.But at least life returned. And over the last century, a healthy forest emerged along with a consensus political view that wild land was essential to our national character.The story it tells is grim, a portent of nature altered and convulsive. It\u2019s not just that this audacious experiment \u2014 a huge parkland on the doorstep of a metro area of 13 million people \u2014 is now on life support. It\u2019s that, as we are the first species to radically disrupt the world that gave us life, much of that world may soon be unsafe for human habitation.California used to have distinct fire seasons. Now the storms of flame and smoke are year-round, and all of the nation\u2019s most populous state is a fire zone. One in eight Americans lives in a land that could turn catastrophic on any given day.Last year it was the wine country north of San Francisco and the mountains above Santa Barbara. This year it\u2019s the area around Yosemite National Park, the peopled canyons of the northern part of the state, and this last best open space on the shoulders above Los Angeles.In the north, the town of Paradise was essentially wiped off the map, with more than 13,000 homes gone, more than 80 people killed, hundreds still missing, thousands homeless \u2014 the deadliest fire in state history. It\u2019s a human tragedy.In the south, it\u2019s almost 100,000 acres put to flame in the mountains that meet the sea, with deer left charred in their tracks, an iconic Western-set movie ranch burned into black and white, the sweet-scented chaparral and sage highlands all of a moonscape. It\u2019s a tragedy of nature.The two, wild and urban, have long had a tenuous coexistence in the Golden State. Of late, it\u2019s reached a breaking point, with climate change happening at an accelerated pace \u2014 \u201cthe new abnormal,\u201d as Gov. Jerry Brown calls it.But which is more of a threat to our existence: a natural world that is symptomatic with the sickness of excessive human intervention, or the people who deny the change \u2014 the willfully ignorant in charge of the federal government?We witnessed the worst of reality-avoidance when President Trump visited the fire zones a few days ago. After a drive-by look at the wastelands, he suggested raking the forest floor, as he imagined they do in Finland. He said he wanted to \u201cmake climate great.\u201d The Finns set him straight. The world laughed.Trump has a crackpot for acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, a man associated with a company that promoted time travel and Bigfoot. And yet the president denies the peer-reviewed, consensus driven evidence on climate change.But it wasn\u2019t environmentalists who kicked up 50-mile-an hour winds in a state that had seen barely a whisper of rain over the last six months, hot gusts that bounced through canyons thick with man-made combustibles.The national parks, oft-called America\u2019s best idea, were created by people who looked beyond their own lives. Those people made great ancestors \u2014 benevolent, farsighted, selfless. What they protected were islands of diversity that humans were fast destroying. Climate change has put these parks in real peril.Shed a tear for the Santa Monica mountain wonderland. The dozen or so mountain lions, and maybe a couple of the bobcats that have been collared and tracked, are still alive. But what of all the other species staggering among the black sticks of charcoal in the park? Fires that used to happen every 100 years here now occur every 20.Advertisement"}

If you take a potato, remove its skin (where at least some nutrients are found), cut it, deep fry the pieces in oil and top it all off with salt, cheese, chili or gravy, that starch bomb can be turned into a weapon of dietary destruction.The study found that, controlling for other risk factors, participants who ate fried potatoes two to three times a week were at a higher risk of mortality compared with those who ate unfried potatoes.In the United States, potatoes are the most consumed vegetable, with Americans eating an average of 115.6 pounds of white potatoes a year, of which two-thirds are in the form of French fries, potato chips and other frozen or processed potato products, according to Agriculture Department statistics.Of Americans\u2019 appetite for fries, Dr. Rimm said, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad in this country you\u2019ll pry them from my cold dead hand.\u201dSplit your order, get the smallest portion possible or substitute with a side salad or some kind of green vegetable, Ms. Moyer said, or get a baked white or sweet potato instead.\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people who are sending back three-quarters of an order of French fries,\u201d Dr. Rimm said. \u201cI think it would be nice if your meal came with a side salad and six French fries.\u201dSome appetizers consist of fries coated with cheese and chili or other dressings, which can deliver as much as 1,000 calories per serving, Ms. Moyer said.Don\u2019t overdo it on the condiments, either: An average packet of ketchup is only 10 calories but the same amount of aioli or mayonnaise can add nearly 100 calories.\u201cWith such an epidemic of obesity, nowadays most of us need to cut back,\u201d Ms. Moyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room for an extra 100 calories here and there.\u201dDiners should ask how often a restaurant changes its oil, Dr. Rimm said. The repeated heating, cooling and reuse of oil promotes the creation of unhealthy fatty acids.\u201cIn a country where we already consume a fatty diet comprising mostly of pro-inflammatory markers of omega-6 versus heart-healthy omega-3 (often found in fatty fish) we must limit its use and intake,\u201d she said in an email.Dr. Rimm suggested that consumers track how they feel after eating fries, and that, in turn, might lead to changes in eating habits.Ms. Magee said to savor the flavor. Take half a fry, put it on your tongue and close your eyes, she said.\u201cAnything can be eaten healthfully if it\u2019s eaten mindfully,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you eat French fries that way, you will probably be satisfied with 10.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Things like deadnaming, or purposely referring to a trans person by their former name, and misgendering \u2014 calling someone by a pronoun they don\u2019t use \u2014 are used to express disagreement with the legitimacy of trans lives and identities.Defenders of these practices claim that they\u2019re doing this not out of malice but out of honesty and, perhaps, even a twisted sort of love. They surely see themselves as truth-tellers fighting against political correctness run amok. But sometimes, voicing one\u2019s personal \u201ctruth\u201d does just one thing: It shuts down conversation.I tend to be somewhat shy about media appearances, especially when it comes to TV. In the back of my mind, whenever I\u2019m invited on, I wonder whether I\u2019ll be able to discuss the day\u2019s topic or whether I\u2019m going to get roped into a debate over my own existence. I know many trans people who feel the same. If this isn\u2019t harassment, I don\u2019t know what is. Aside from the harm it does to trans people, it also impedes the free flow of ideas and debate, in the same way that conservatives often accuse student protesters of shutting down speech on college campuses.Sometimes, as the logic behind the campus speaker argument would dictate, we have to set parameters on speech if we want to actually have a debate on the issues, which, in the case of trans people, are certainly not in short supply.Is this framework useful? Perhaps Trump is a racist. Perhaps not. Either way, we can have a productive conversation about whether particular Trump statements or actions are racist. But we can\u2019t have a productive conversation that starts from the premise that Trump is a racist overall, and that every action he takes and every statement he makes is therefore covered with the patina of racism. That conversation is about insults, not truth.Mr. Shapiro, who is himself a critic of trans individuals and policies that support us, makes an excellent argument for finding a productive framework for useful conversation. Just as we can\u2019t actually address the merits of any particular policy proposed by Mr. Trump if our focus is solely on the man himself, we can\u2019t address the merits of policies that affect trans people if debate starts from the premise that trans people are and will always be whatever happens to be stamped on our original birth certificates. And as Mr. Shapiro notes, while there may or may not be truth to the statement that Mr. Trump is a racist, any discussion had through that lens will be \u201cabout insults, not truth.\u201dIf we want more and better speech on this topic, even among trans critics, Twitter\u2019s policy gives us the framework we need to reset our thinking. To date, we\u2019ve put semantics over substance.In both cases, the focus was almost universally on whether or not trans women are actually women and trans men are actually men. Rather than having a robust discussion about what practical effects a change to the Department of Health and Human Services definition of sex and gender might have \u2014 for instance, it could give rise to even more rampant discrimination than trans people already face, an uptick in gender-specific exclusions from insurance policies and more \u2014 we found ourselves mired in the same stalemate.Sadly, this is what passes for \u201cdebate\u201d on trans issues: less a look at what any proposed policy would actually accomplish and much more of a focus on trans people as a concept.But we\u2019re not concepts, ideologies or philosophical questions to be pondered. We\u2019re human beings, and we\u2019re more than eager to engage in good-faith discussion about policies that affect us: what role trans people can or should play in the military, what rules should exist on the topic of trans athletes, what steps trans people should have to take to update our legal identity documents or what needs to be done to ensure the safety and privacy of all people in sex-segregated spaces like bathrooms or shelters.These are all debates that can, and should, be had in a reasonable, respectful, policy-oriented way. Instead, through misgendering and deadnaming, each conversation is handled as a referendum on our legitimacy and existence. The truth is that I\u2019m unlikely to ever persuade people dead set on the idea that I am not who I know myself to be, and there\u2019s virtually zero chance of someone else convincing me that I\u2019m not. We need to come to terms with the fact that we won\u2019t understand what the \u201cother side\u201d feels or believes, and maybe that\u2019s O.K. But that doesn\u2019t relieve us, as a freewheeling democratic public, of the responsibility to hash out thorny policy issues. By setting guardrails for that conversation, Twitter\u2019s new policy points us in that direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chicken That Finds Its Flavor in the Wild", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenDried wild mushrooms lend this comforting braise its depth and character.Roasted chicken is a simple pleasure, fried chicken is a delight and chicken grilled over fire is lip-smackingly good. However (though I don\u2019t like to play favorites), a braised chicken dish is always more interesting. I seem to be constantly proselytizing for this kind of moist, saucy slow-cooked dish. You can\u2019t really rush it, and the time spent preparing it (mostly waiting), is a truly worthy endeavor.There are plenty of ways to braise a chicken. Among classic home-style French dishes, there is the standard poule au pot, in which the bird is simmered whole with leeks and carrots, then served with its own broth. There is the delicate blanquette de poulet, with chicken and vegetables in a lightly thickened sauce blanche, to serve with buttered noodles or rice. Perhaps the most famous French chicken braise is coq au vin, the bistro favorite, red wine contributing color and acid to the rich ruddy sauce; a spoonful of potato pur\u00e9e is practically required.But there are many more braised fowl recipes in the repertoire \u2014 we have barely skimmed the surface. Think of poulet chasseur, hunter\u2019s chicken: It uses white wine, tomatoes and mushrooms, but is certainly related to coq au vin.I make a version with wild mushrooms \u2014 dried wild mushrooms, to be precise. Because their flavor is so concentrated, they\u2019re a cook\u2019s best friend. Even a few pieces or a bit of dried wild mushroom powder added to a sauce or stock catapults flavor.Of course fresh wild mushrooms are wonderful, but they can be costly, as much as $40 a pound. Dried chanterelles, porcini or morels can be bought for just a few dollars an ounce, more than enough for deep woodsy flavor. You can pick up a small packet at most Italian delis and nearly any supermarket, and online sources abound.Here, dried porcini and morels, smoked bacon and red wine perfume the sauce to give braised chicken legs depth and character, with a flavor nearly similar to a game bird. Using turkey broth makes this braise even headier. (For a quick, concentrated version, simmer 2 pounds of meaty turkey wings with 6 cups water for about an hour.)Remember, as with most braises, making the dish a day in advance of serving is a wise decision; it only improves the flavor.To accompany the saucy chicken, I like small boiled potatoes, peeled and warmed in butter with lots of parsley. But choose whatever carbohydrate delights you. There will be mopping.Advertisement"}

They saw my hometown, Storm Lake \u2014 Steve King\u2019s birthplace \u2014 transformed over the past four decades thanks to meatpacking and the wave of immigrant workers it attracted. The town has more than doubled in population to at least 15,000 in that period, though we don\u2019t really know how many people are here because so many are undocumented.Tyson Foods owns the expanding pork and turkey plants here, where almost all of the 2,200 employees are immigrants. Meatpackers reached into rural Mexico 30 years ago to find young men who could pull pork loins or throw turkeys off a truck at 2 a.m. Jobs drew refugees from around the war-torn globe, from Myanmar to Sudan. Our elementary school is 90 percent children of color, most of them Latino. Here, oppressed people find liberty and put a foot on the first rung of the ladder to success.Some residents have remained resentful of the immigrants. But most of us learned that they weren\u2019t mocking us in Spanish in the grocery store checkout line, that they didn\u2019t soak up food stamps and welfare, that they do pay taxes yet still can\u2019t collect Social Security. They aren\u2019t criminals any more than our white residents are. The immigrant laborers now earn $18 per hour or better at Tyson. They\u2019ve started families, filled our schools, attended our churches and starred on our high school soccer team. Ours is one of the few rural communities in Iowa that are growing, with more births than deaths. If you paid close attention to what Mr. King was saying those 16 years about Mexicans, you would hear the same thing he says in white supremacist soirees. But now it is making waves. People are getting wary. The same voters who used to think he was a straight shooter speaking his mind got uncomfortable seeing poor children locked up in cages at the border. In January, the Des Moines Register\u2019s Iowa Poll, conducted by the reputable Selzer and Co., found that 69 percent of Fourth District voters actually support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Mr. King says he will win as he always has by firing up the base \u2014 and he might be right. Beware the caravan from Honduras, the women and children in flip-flops, he relentlessly warns. They might invade his hometown, Kiron, population 273, which certainly could use a few more souls even if they are \u201cnot of our culture.\u201d When you have nothing to sell \u2014 tax cuts are no good when you\u2019re losing money on that pile of corn outside \u2014 fear is always a sure standby.If Mr. King wins, it will be because Republicans outnumber Democrats here 190,000 to 120,000, while independents number 172,000. That Mr. Scholten is even in the conversation is a wonder. Fear of immigrants might have worn out its welcome when Sioux County, 80 percent Republican, decides that Latinos are pretty good help in the dairy barns. If we run them off as Mr. King and Trump demand, then who\u2019s going to milk those cows and scoop hog manure from a pit? It\u2019s harder to hate or fear someone you know, as Storm Lake learned.

In Rolette County, home to the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, it was up 62 percent from 2014 and 33 percent from 2016. In Benson County, home to the Spirit Lake Nation, it was up 52 percent from 2014 and 10 percent from 2016.One of the most striking results of the night, though, came far from the reservations: in a normally Republican district in the Fargo area, where Ruth Buffalo became the first Native American Democratic woman elected to the North Dakota Legislature. She did it by unseating State Representative Randy Boehning, the primary sponsor of the very voter ID law Native Americans had feared would disenfranchise them.For all the symbolic resonance of her victory, Ms. Buffalo, a public health professional with three master\u2019s degrees, campaigned entirely on local issues \u2014 and her win underscored how partisan divisions can be scrambled when the national hot buttons are removed from the conversation.\u201cRuth ran not as necessarily a Native American woman, but as a woman in Fargo who wanted to talk about issues that were affecting her community,\u201d said Scott McNeil, executive director of the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party. Mr. Boehning did not respond to a request for comment.We spoke with Ms. Buffalo on Monday. The interview has been condensed.Q. Tell me about your background and how you ended up in politics.I ran unsuccessfully in 2016 in a statewide race for insurance commissioner. I became party secretary [of the North Dakota Democratic N.P.L.] in April 2017. I was also appointed to the Fargo Native American Commission by the mayor in July 2017. I just kind of stayed involved in the community and continued to volunteer on different boards and commissions.You\u2019ve spent much of your career in public health. I worked seven years at a tribal college as a \u201cstrengthening lifestyles\u201d director. I was a head women\u2019s basketball coach for three years. For one year, after my son was born, I was assistant men\u2019s basketball coach. And then I was offered a scholarship to study public health \u2014 master\u2019s degree classes \u2014 and also be a part of a breast cancer research team in an urban setting. Prior to those seven years, I was a substance abuse prevention coordinator for my tribe, the M.H.A. Nation. I\u2019ve always been more on the prevention side of things.You\u2019ve said that you went into public health because of your own family\u2019s experience. What happened there?I\u2019m the oldest of three girls biologically. My mom also raised two of my older first cousins, who I consider sisters, and three older brothers. When I was 10, my younger sister was misdiagnosed at the local field clinic in Mandaree. She had appendicitis, and it almost ruptured and we almost lost her. Local health care providers turned her and my mom away. They would say she just had flulike symptoms and give her Tylenol and send her home.My mom drove her to the nearest town that has a hospital \u2014 Watford City, 27 miles away \u2014 and the ambulance rushed her to the next level of care in Williston, and they had emergency surgeons. From that experience, with my little sister being 5 at the time \u2014 it really opened my eyes. It was scary, and I wanted to figure out how we could fix that in our community to where nobody else would have to experience that.So from that point on, I set out to become a medical doctor. I applied and got into a summer program in seventh grade: physics, chemistry, math. It was a six-week program every summer. Then I went on to study pre-med in college. I found that I could not work with cadavers my whole senior year, so I had a life-changing decision to make [laughs].What were the biggest issues you focused on in your campaign?Access to health care. I knocked over 6,500 doors, and that was the most common theme I found at the doors from voters. Another issue that came up was our education system, K-12 and higher ed, and then also property taxes. People are afraid to be thrown out on the street, to lose their homes because the property taxes continue to increase.North Dakota is a pretty conservative state. How do you think you won as a Democrat?I would say meeting people where they\u2019re at. Literally on their doorsteps. Most people were surprised to see a candidate at their doorstep. They were pretty receptive and open to having a conversation with me on what matters most to them.We did try to keep up on our Facebook page and do different animated videos on issues. Because I\u2019m not a politician. And that\u2019s the feedback I got from people, too, that a lot of the words they were seeing through the videos seemed to be coming from a regular person.Let\u2019s talk about the voter ID law. Did that affect you at all?I\u2019m living currently off the reservation, in a district that is not located near or on present-day tribal lands.

There used to be two precincts in Mandaree, where I\u2019m originally from, and the more rural precinct \u2014 the precinct that is farther east of Mandaree \u2014 for some reason was closed. They had to drive all the way around the river to Killdeer, at least 45 minutes.As a Native American woman, you defeated the main sponsor of the voter ID law that many feel targeted Native Americans.

{"Headline": "We Asked for Examples of Election Misinformation. You Delivered.", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReaders submitted more than 4,000 examples of misinformation. Here are the different types being spread this election season.Readers responded. In all, more than 4,000 examples of misinformation were submitted to The Times from social media feeds, text-messaging apps and email accounts.Each legitimate submission was vetted by reporters and editors at The Times, and many have influenced our journalism in the lead-up to the midterm elections. We are grateful for readers\u2019 submissions, and dedicated to continuing the work of fighting digital misinformation.Here is a review of some of the major types of misinformation submitted by readers, as well as some discovered in our own reporting.Some election-related misinformation is about specific candidates and races. Other misinformation coalesces around major news events in what could be called \u201choax floods,\u201d often adding to highly charged partisan conversations.Two news events in particular inspired floods of misinformation in recent months: the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the caravan of Honduran migrants moving through Guatemala and Mexico on its way to the United States border.One typical piece of misinformation was a graphic that was found by readers on right-wing Facebook pages. The graphic claimed that Christine Blasey Ford, one of Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers, had been photographed with George Soros, the liberal philanthropist and frequent target of right-wing conspiracy theories. The photograph, shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook, was actually of Mr. Soros posing with Lyudmyla Kozlovska, a Ukranian human rights activist.One typical example is a post found on numerous right-wing Facebook groups. The post used old and mislabeled photos of injured police officers in order to claim that caravan migrants were behaving violently toward law enforcement. The false post was shared thousands of times.Since 2016, major social media platforms have tried to make themselves less vulnerable to exploitation by bringing more transparency to political ads on their platforms.Readers submitted many examples of confusing and poorly labeled ads in their home districts. One example was an ad placed on Google that took aim at Jared Polis, a Democrat running for Colorado governor. The ad, sponsored by a group called \u201cSave Our State Colorado,\u201d falsely claimed that Mr. Polis supported placing Colorado schools under Islamic Shariah law. No committee under the name \u201cSave Our State Colorado\u201d is registered with the Federal Election Commission, and it is unclear who is behind the ad.Dozens of readers sent in tips about a Russian manipulation campaign playing out on Reddit, the popular online message board.Several readers submitted examples of social media misinformation with the ostensible goal of suppressing voter turnout.Many readers submitted tips about deceptive or exaggerated claims targeting individual candidates. Deliberate misinformation about candidates long precedes the internet. (In 1800, Thomas Jefferson wrote anonymous articles about his rival, John Adams, in partisan newspapers.) But social media has supercharged the distribution of politically motivated smears.False claims were sent to voters offline, too. One reader in Texas sent us a scan of a mailer that falsely warned that Texans displaying lawn signs supporting Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic Senate candidate, would be subject to $500 fines.Dozens of readers sent in screenshots of text messages they received from political campaigns, some of which contained misleading and exaggerated claims.Several readers in Texas reported receiving suspicious text messages purportedly from the O\u2019Rourke campaign. The messages claimed that the campaign was looking for volunteers to drive undocumented immigrants to the polls.Supporters of Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for governor of Florida, also reported receiving suspicious text messages claiming that Mr. Gillum was under an \u201cactive criminal investigation,\u201d along with other negative messages. These messages were not labeled with the name of a sponsoring organization or campaign.Many readers submitted examples of what could be called \u201cattack pages\u201d \u2014 social media pages labeled with the name and picture of a candidate, but actually operated by a group backing the candidate\u2019s opponent. These pages are then used to buy ads opposing the candidate whose picture appears on the page, usually with a mocking nickname.The National Republican Senatorial Committee has started several Facebook pages mimicking Democratic candidates. A page called \u201cThe Real Heidi Heitkamp\u201d was used to buy negative ads attacking the Democratic senator from North Dakota. \u201cMillionaire Claire,\u201d a page impersonating Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, was also used as a vehicle to attack her and promote her Republican opponent, Josh Hawley. \u201cRadical Kyrsten,\u201d another page operated by the N.R.S.C., was used to go after Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat running for Senate in Arizona.Democrats operated attack pages as well. For Our Future, a liberal PAC, sponsored an attack page for Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for governor in Ohio. The page, called \u201cThe Real Mike DeWine,\u201d was used to promote articles criticizing Mr. DeWine\u2019s political record.Attack pages don\u2019t technically violate Facebook\u2019s rules, since they are labeled in fine print with the name of the sponsoring organization. But they can be confusing to the casual Facebook user scrolling through his or her feed, which led many readers to submit their own examples.An earlier version of this article misidentified Thomas Jefferson's rival in the 1800 presidential election. It was John Adams, not James Madison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Would Have Driven Her Anywhere ", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveCaring for a mother who suffers from dementia was really hard. I wish I could do it again.When my mother was booted from an assisted living facility in North Carolina for being \u201ctoo high maintenance,\u201d my husband, Ted, and I agreed to have her live near us in Prescott, Ariz.She had spent seven years of dementia in assisted-living facilities, first near my brother in Austin, Tex., and then near my two sisters in Asheville, N.C. It was our turn. My mother never liked any of these facilities, but she disliked the one here most of all. Sometimes, she disliked me.One of the few things she did like about Prescott was being reunited with her old car, a 1992 Honda Accord she had sold to me years before, shortly after my father had died.The Honda connected her to her life before dementia in Austin, where she had a church, Bible study and friends. In Prescott, she had no church, no friends, and her only outings were when I would take her to get her hair done or to do errands. She was happiest when we were in the Honda and took pride in the fact that the car had been hers, a reminder that she once had been independently mobile.Our outings followed a routine, on account of her dementia. She would scream, \u201cOw!\u201d as I helped lower her into the car. She would sit with her legs facing out and then slowly scoot herself to face forward enough to get both legs inside the car. She would ask for help with the seatbelt, but when I would help, she\u2019d say, \u201cBe careful! Don\u2019t be so rough!\u201dThat day we were headed to Prescott\u2019s only shopping mall. Over the last few months, we had gone there to buy her tennis shoes, underwear, a nightgown and a new dress, all at Dillard\u2019s. But this time she wanted to stay in the car.\u201cYou sure?\u201d I said. \u201cYou like Dillard\u2019s.\u201dShe was sure. She trusted me to find the Clinique makeup remover she needed.I cracked the windows and told her I\u2019d be quick.I didn\u2019t like leaving her in the car, knowing she could forget entirely where I had gone and why she was there without me, but the errand was made so much easier by her absence. No getting the folded-up walker out of the trunk. No protracted process of helping her out. No waiting for her to find and put on her sunglasses. No waiting while she walked so slowly. Without her along, I jogged.Returning minutes later, I was relieved to see her in the passenger seat, right where I had left her. She was leaning forward, rummaging through the open glove compartment.\u201cHey,\u201d I said.\u201cThat was fast,\u201d she said.I gave her the makeup remover, but she was intent on the contents of the glove compartment.\u201cAnything good in there?\u201d I asked.She showed me what was in her lap: a tire gauge, a wine opener, a small screwdriver and a first aid kit. \u201cI used to keep cash in here,\u201d she said.I remembered. She would go to the drive-through at her bank and put the envelope of money in the glove compartment. She liked stashing cash in different places as backup for emergencies. Often she would forget she had done this and go get more. In her condo in Austin, I had found envelopes of $20 bills in spare purses in her closet and in the vegetable drawer of the extra refrigerator.She pulled out the blue zippered pouch that held the insurance and registration. \u201cThis comes in handy,\u201d she said.I agreed.The day the old Honda finally stopped running, without warning, while I was driving within a mile of my house, my mother had been dead for three and a half years. I know this only by looking at a calendar. Emotionally, it felt much closer, maybe a few months. With the car and my mother so connected, I remember thinking: \u201cReally? Now the car?\u201d I took it personally, as if I were being hammered by misfortune.I figured it was the oil, which I had neglected to check. I had neglected the car generally, but I loved it. It had belonged to only two people: my mother and me. A copy of our handwritten payment agreement, detailing a year of monthly checks I paid her, was in the glove compartment, inside the blue zippered pouch.\u201cPaid in full,\u201d it had said for more than a decade, but that sweet contract between my mother and me was something I wanted to keep. Her time in Prescott was so much shorter than we had expected. With the amount of money left for her care, we had budgeted for 12 years. After moving to be near us, she lived only 11 months.I called AAA first, and then Ted, who joined me and brought me a coat, as it would be cold once the sun went down. We had the guy tow the car to Kent, our mechanic.Turned out to be the timing belt, which blew while the car was running, in motion. Kent said to me, so gently, \u201cA car this old isn\u2019t worth investing that kind of money.\u201d He gave me the name of a local guy who might give me $400 to use it for parts.I asked if he could keep the car for two weeks because I was leaving to visit my niece in California. He said no problem; he would move it out to the street for now.My mother had also died in motion, without warning. She was walking from the lunch table to the bathroom when she collapsed.After returning from California, I still didn\u2019t deal with the car. Our mechanic\u2019s garage is in a neighborhood I drive through every day, but I couldn\u2019t bear to see the old car there, radiating abandonment, so whenever I drove by I\u2019d keep gazing straight ahead.Finally, Ted convinced me to have it towed to our carport until I could figure out what to do. Brilliant. Why hadn\u2019t I thought of that? Once the car was home, visible every time I came and went, it rejoined the family, like a low-maintenance version of my mother.Ted was on the job market that winter and had landed several Skype interviews. Our house isn\u2019t big, so on a day he needed quiet to be interviewed, I decided to go down to the carport, sit in the old Honda and write.I put on long underwear, a down jacket, hat, gloves and boots. I got in on the passenger\u2019s side, where my mother used to sit, and reached to open the rear vent window for air. I pushed the seat back all the way and covered my lap with a fleece blanket.Inside, the car was like a time capsule from the day the timing belt failed. There was a receipt from the veterinarian, directions to a friend\u2019s new home on a Post-it note, a piece of chewed gum in a wrapper.I released the parking brake and the car sighed. No need anymore for that tension.Reaching down for the lever to recline the seat, my fingers landed on a piece of round plastic. It was a maroon Boost cap.Funny how something like that can transport you.What would I have given right then to wait patiently as my mother made her long, slow way to the car. To hear her say, \u201cOw, be careful.\u201d To buckle her seatbelt for her, open her drink and witness her satisfied first sip. I would have driven her anywhere.I opened the glove compartment and sifted through its contents: plastic blue pouch, tire gauge, screwdriver, wine opener and plastic fork and spoon. I sat in that seat as if it were my mother\u2019s lap, looked out at yesterday\u2019s snow and closed my eyes.I don\u2019t know how long I stayed there. An hour? More? It was womb-like, a cocoon.Eventually, Ted knocked on the window, smiling, saying, \u201cCome back in. You must be freezing.\u201dI wasn\u2019t able to part with the Honda until a month later when, in preparing to move to California for Ted\u2019s new job, getting rid of the car became just one more item on a very long to-do list.The guy who bought it for parts hooked it up and towed it away. I knew better than to watch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Hart-less Presidency", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter 30 years, Gary Hart still wonders what might have been.Opinion ColumnistDENVER \u2014 As we fantasize about a parallel universe, where America is not a joke and our president cares about other human beings, the same questions keep swirling in our heads.What has happened to this country? Can he be stopped? When will it end? How the hell did we get here?At sunset in the red mountains outside Denver, a tall man with white hair, granite features, black jeans and black Lucchese cowboy boots thinks he knows that last answer.While the rest of us obsess on what happened in 2016 and what will happen on Tuesday, Gary Hart is bedeviled by what happened in 1987, and whether the tabloid mania sparked by his liaison with Donna Rice led down a rattlesnake-filled path straight to our tabloid president.Hart, and a new Jason Reitman movie about the Rice imbroglio, \u201cThe Front Runner,\u2019\u2019 both pose the question: Is there a direct connection between Hart\u2019s fall and Trump\u2019s rise?If reporters had not hidden in the bushes, would there have been any Bushes?If Hart had won in \u201988, would Dick Cheney have finished his career with a golden parachute at Halliburton instead of a dark plunge into deranged global domination? Would we have been spared from two wars against Saddam, Sept. 11, ISIS and the climate catastrophe?\u201cI bear a very heavy burden of responsibility,\u201d Hart says, picking at a \u201cgame plate\u201d of elk, buffalo and quail at The Fort restaurant outside of Denver. \u201cIf all that stuff had not happened and if I had been elected, there would have been no gulf war. H.W. wouldn\u2019t have been president. W. wouldn\u2019t have been president. Everything would have changed. I don\u2019t say that to aggrandize myself. It\u2019s just, history changed.\u201cAnd that has haunted me for thirty years. I had only one talent and it wasn\u2019t traditional politics \u2014 I could see farther ahead than anybody.\u2019\u2019You could dismiss this as \u201csans moi, le deluge\u201d grandiosity. But, whatever his flaws, the former senator from Colorado was a political Nostradamus. He foresaw the rise of Silicon Valley and the demise of Detroit. Known as \u201can Atari Democrat,\u2019\u2019 he lunched in L.A. with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1983.As early as the \u201970s, he recalled, \u201ca few of us were forecasting that globalization and the shift of the economic base from Detroit to Silicon Valley was going to have huge impact on our country sociologically and politically.\u2019\u2019He oversaw a bipartisan panel on threats facing the nation that delivered its final report on Jan. 31, 2001. \u201cThe first finding was America will be attacked by terrorists using weapons of mass destruction and Americans will die on American soil, possibly in large numbers,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe saw Colin Powell. We saw Rumsfeld. We saw Condi Rice.\u2019\u2019 He said he warned Rice at the White House again on Sept. 6, 2001. \u201cGuess who didn\u2019t listen? George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Always keep one thing in mind: 9/11 could have been prevented.\u201dHart is 81 now, which is a jolt when you see him, because he hasn\u2019t been in the public eye much in the decades since that totemic image of Rice smiling on his lap on a pier in Bimini, while he was wearing a \u201cMonkey Business\u201d crew T-shirt. He rejected the skeezy redemption offered by the scandal food chain. In his 2010 memoir, the only Rice in the index is Condoleezza.Before Hart, we had F.D.R., L.B.J. and J.F.K., who did not suffer politically for dalliances because the mostly male press corps had a bro-code and a blind eye.After Hart, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump got through frenzies about sexual transgressions by enduring the ridicule, enlisting their wives to defend them on TV, and attacking their accusers.But the scratchy Hart wasn\u2019t made that way. The adultery story enhanced the sense that he was an enigma, a story line that developed when the press learned that he had changed his name from Hartpence and fudged his age by a year.Hart ruefully recalled reporters having \u201ca cool and aloof key\u201d on their Radio Shack TRS-80s. When Hugh Jackman, who plays the candidate in the movie, gave interviews calling Hart enigmatic, Hart said to his son, John, \u201cI\u2019m not enigmatic, am I?\u201d \u201cYep, you are,\u201d John replied.Hart haughtily withdrew from the race with a Jeffersonian echo: \u201cI tremble for my country when I think we may, in fact, get the kind of leaders we deserve.\u201d \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d featuring Vera Farmiga as the traumatized Lee Hart, uses that speech to imply that the leader we deserve, for being so squeamish about Hart, is Trump.Hart maintained that \u201cthere was no relationship\u201d with Rice. Rice \u2014 who became an evangelical and supports Trump \u2014 told People this week, \u201cI\u2019m just not discussing it.\u201d But a married candidate can\u2019t have a gorgeous young model fly up to D.C. from Miami for the weekend to visit his house \u2014 \u201cthe infamous townhouse,\u2019\u2019 as Hart\u2019s son dryly calls it \u2014 and not attract questions if they are seen.\u201cThat\u2019s the only way that 48-hour period makes any sense,\u2019\u2019 Hart told me.Even if it was casual recreation, the optics were bad and he \u2014 and his campaign \u2014 should have known it. Especially if the stakes for the world were as high as he says.Shamelessness is now a superpower, as the twitterati say, and the audacious are rewarded. I wondered if Hart wished he had fought back.\u201cI\u2019m not Donald Trump and I didn\u2019t behave like Donald Trump,\u2019\u2019 he replied firmly. But he does refer to his hell week as \u201cthe witch hunt.\u201d\u201cI blame myself,\u2019\u2019 he said. He says he doesn\u2019t blame the press, but I don\u2019t believe him. \u201cI am still disturbed more by what happened after the original story \u2014 the condemnation in op-eds, in editorials, in opinion pages, by people who knew who I was but who just came down on me like a ton of bricks and wrote awful, vile things about me. The key word was character. \u2018We had to do this because our job is to protect the American people from bad characters.\u2019 It was all self-justification. There\u2019s nothing wrong with my character.\u2019\u2019Hart said that, after the Rice story broke, Ben Bradlee had a Washington Post reporter give Hart a list of supposed inamoratas, warning that there would be a story unless Hart withdrew. \u201cA list of names!\u201d Hart said, the 30-year-old outrage fresh in his voice. \u201cI mean, everybody knew Ben Bradlee and Jack Kennedy chased girls.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hold myself out to be \u2014\u2019\u2019 he said, trailing off. \u201cLook, Lee and I were separated several times and I stayed at Bob Woodward\u2019s house. Yes, I\u2019m a famous Washington philanderer and when my wife and I separate, where do I go to do my philandering? Bob Woodward\u2019s house? Gimme a break!\u201d I am not sure that\u2019s true. We have not reached any consensus on the issue, except that most strategists know better than to publicly trash the women at the center of such scandals.In the Clinton years, some journalists wrote that we should separate \u201cpublic character\u201d from \u201cprivate character\u201d and acknowledge, as with the Founding Fathers, you could be a good leader, even if your private life was questionable.But last year, in the midst of the #Metoo reckoning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand criticized Al Franken after he was accused of groping and faux-groping for a joke picture, and told The Times that Bill Clinton should have resigned over the Lewinsky matter.The standards remain subjective, inconsistently applied and partisan.Matt Bai, the Yahoo columnist who helped write the new Hart movie based on his book, \u201cAll the Truth Is Out,\u2019\u2019 posits that Hart\u2019s exile \u201ccost us something\u201d as a nation.But Bai thinks that each case must be \u201cmeasured in some context,\u201d and that the press should not abdicate its responsibility to judge. He thinks it was \u201cdamn relevant\u201d for reporters from The National Enquirer to skulk around the Beverly Hilton and reveal that John Edwards had fathered a child with his mistress, while forcing an aide to say it was his.Although Hart would like the media to have a serious discussion about what is and is not permitted, the culture has flown past that.Nowadays, it wouldn\u2019t be reporters in the bushes next to Hart\u2019s Capitol Hill townhouse snapping pictures as the couple emerged, but passers-by on cellphones.\u201cThere has been an explosion in social media that creates a minute-to-minute voracious appetite for things that will attract people\u2019s attention,\u2019\u2019 David Axelrod told me. \u201cAnd the explosion of money in politics weaponizes negative stories.\u201dIf Hart didn\u2019t get to be president, he\u2019s still prescient. I didn\u2019t want to leave without asking what he thinks the next great threat will be.\u201cCyber,\u2019\u2019 he shot back. \u201cCould be banks. Could be transportation systems. Could be communications systems. It\u2019s going to happen. If you want to find a secure place up here and take it off the grid, I can help you do that.\u2019\u2019A photo caption in a previous version of this article referred to Gary Hart as a former Democratic presidential nominee. He was a candidate for the nomination, but never the party's nominee.Advertisement"}

Try to find the biggest sage leaves you can: They are easier to fry than small leaves, which can burn almost as quickly as you add them to the oil. In either case, set everything up before you start frying, and work quickly. Then season the leaves while they are still hot so the salt sticks. (Then try not to gobble them all before the aligot is ready.)Although in France aligot is usually a side dish to roasted or grilled meats, I like it as a meatless main course, served with a snappy green salad, preferably one made from assertive lettuces like watercress, escarole, fris\u00e9e or radicchio.Aligot is most impressively served right after it\u2019s made, when the potatoes are best able to stretch to dramatic heights in front of your guests. But if you must, you can make it up to three days in advance. Reheat it on low, stirring in a little cream until the mixture is melted and smooth. Then sit down and exhale.

{"Headline": "We Tried Facebook\u2019s New Portal Device (So You Don\u2019t Have To)", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what happened when two Times tech reporters installed Facebook\u2019s new Portal video-calling gadgets in their bedrooms.So we \u2014 Mike Isaac and Farhad Manjoo, two technology writers for The New York Times \u2014 took the $199 and $349 devices for a test run over the last week to see if they could make us feel more connected to each other. We both installed the Portal, which starts shipping on Thursday, in our homes (our bedrooms, to be exact). The devices are video-calling machines that people can use to talk through a screen to other Facebook users. They have a 12-megapixel camera with high-definition video and artificial intelligence software; the camera follows people about as they move around. Were we worried about what these always-on devices might collect on us? Here\u2019s how it played out.So I have to say, waking up next to you in my bedroom was, uh, quite an experience. I put my Portal Plus on the desk that sits bedside. The screen saver cycled through my photo albums on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 and also occasionally your face.What was your experience like initially? The unboxing process was funny to me. It felt like an Apple design moment; every piece of plastic and \u201cpull here\u201d tab was carefully placed, with the intentionality that Apple usually saves for its device packaging, but with a very Facebook-y twist on things. There was an iconic Facebook thumb on my power cord holder, for example.Setting up my Portal Plus was easy. Popped the thing out of the box, plopped it on my desk, plugged it in, connected to Wi-Fi and my Facebook account. From there, I think, I called you almost immediately.The great thing about these devices is that they are stationary and always on. When you want to call someone, you just tell it to call the person \u2014 no looking for your phone, no holding the phone while you chat. It all just works with a single utterance. (Everything old is new: These devices are like landlines!)The problem with Amazon\u2019s Echo Show is its fixed viewing angle \u2014 if you don\u2019t have it pointed exactly at you, it\u2019s hard to have a conversation. My kids, who use the Show to call my parents, are always fighting with each other about who gets to stand right in front of the screen.The Portal solves that problem in a neat way: It uses software to follow you around a room, always keeping the speaker in frame and cropped. I found this very useful.I will also admit I loved the augmented reality lenses, a flourish Facebook is adding to pretty much all of its camera-based apps. Just like Snapchat, I can choose a filter that turns my face into a werewolf, or stick a (live) cat on my head as a hat. Cat-as-a-Hat: a goofy gimmick worthy of Dr. Seuss \u2014 but it works!Facebook also went out of its way to let us know that all video chats are encrypted, and the company does not store the contents of the calls, nor does it listen in on them. But even that wasn\u2019t enough for me! Whenever I wasn\u2019t using the Portal, I unplugged it. I turned the camera around to face the window looking over the back yard. I would periodically check to make sure all lights or microphones were off when I took a phone call or text.I don\u2019t think he believes that anymore, and Facebook has been working to improve how users can manage their private data on the platform. Still, if you\u2019re going to choose between a calling device made by Facebook and one made by Amazon or Apple, you wouldn\u2019t be crazy to discount Facebook\u2019s device because of its business model and history.All that said, a lot of people are just fine with the level of insight Facebook has into their lives. If you already chat and call on Facebook Messenger on your phone, then chatting and calling from Portal isn\u2019t putting you in any greater danger.Portal is better than the Show at making calls, and for a first piece of hardware, it\u2019s quite impressive. But it\u2019s still a device of fairly limited functionality \u2014 a well-designed luxury at this point.I guess we\u2019ll always have our Slack chats.Advertisement"}

The last \u201cimportant question\u201d was, \u201cWhat is your relationship to potato chips?\u201d which he\u2019d asked while gesturing to the many bags of various flavors piled in my pantry (the answer, of course, being, \u201cPotato chips are my soul mate\u201d), so it wasn\u2019t as if I was expecting anything electric to come out of his mouth.I looked at him, and he said with a steady gaze, \u201cWould you marry me?\u201dI felt the strangest thing. Not joy, not shock, not fear. I felt calm. Calm, as everyone who knows me is aware, is a rare feeling for me. But first I had to make sure he wasn\u2019t making fun of me.\u201cIs that a hypothetical or a practical question?\u201d\u201cBoth,\u201d he said.\u201cThen yes.\u201dWe ordered another round, set a date for a courthouse wedding four days later and immediately begin to text our friends. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d was a typical response. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ignored them.Drunk on whiskey and other stuff, we stumbled out of the bar. As I stood on the curb to hail a cab, he ran to the drugstore next door. \u201cJust need to get something.\u201d He came back out, his arms full of potato chips, bags of every flavor they had on the shelves.But marriage is not about love. It is about politics. All of my adult life I have argued for the abolition of marriage, because marriage is a series of rights unfairly distributed to men and women who have found love or who have deluded themselves into thinking they have found love. If romantic love is its own reward, as every Hollywood film and novel in the \u201cwomen\u2019s fiction\u201d section at the bookstore would have us believe, then why pile on tax breaks, hospital visitation, health insurance, immigration assistance and all of the rest of it? Having a successful love life should not have a determination on whether you live or die. One American friend of mine is chronically ill but had the very good fortune to fall in love with a German man, gaining access to a nationalized health service and an expedited immigration process. Being away from the broken American health care system and the even more broken Medicaid insurance system for the poor and disadvantaged, my friend has renewed health, more energy, a higher income that comes with a larger capacity for work, and optimism for the first time in years.An Indian friend of ours had the very good fortune to fall in love with an American woman, giving him access to an expedited immigration process and a more easily attainable work visa, allowing him to keep his job at an institution that despite pulling in millions of dollars a year in grants and donations decided that sponsoring its immigrant workers\u2019 visas wasn\u2019t worth the investment of time and money.And then the wife of my husband\u2019s friend \u2014 she had the misfortune of falling deeply in love with a Colombian man, with his own already shaky migration status, and the United States government announced it would not be approving her application for an extension of her residency visa and gave her 30 days to pack up the four years of life she had built in New York City. She had no guarantee that she would be able to return or that the two of them could find a place where both of them would have the ability to work and live.Well, how could people not, with the gangly girl whom he professes to ardently adore standing before them. But she has no hesitation, not even a moment of doubt. This is the love she was promised, and she will cling to it like the life raft that it so clearly is, no matter what her father tries to do to break them apart.But the other thing James does is suggest that maybe it doesn\u2019t matter whether Morris loves her or not, as long as he takes care of her. Is it a tragedy to make love a transaction? To say I will stand by your side as long as I get tailored suits from Paris and sherry imported from Spain and cigars from Cuba? Or health insurance for my chronic illness? Or a residency visa?I, too, have around $30,000 a year, although a hundred years after James wrote his book, that is not the prize it once was. And also like Catherine, I have all the grace of an elephant in high heels, my knees decorated with an ever shifting display of bruises from my stumbling into things, and my manner of dress also runs toward the tacky and the shiny. I have my assets, an intelligence and an accomplished body of work, but women in our culture are not pursued for intelligence and accomplished bodies of work, certainly not by considerably younger men.As such, my lover resembles Morris, in his effortless charm, his handsome face and his desire for something I could easily provide. Unlike Catherine, I am aware of my failings and how on paper this match seems so unlikely. I am also attuned to the doubt that runs through our social circle, with my friends making cracks about our green-card marriage, and the confusion that comes into his friends\u2019 faces when they are introduced to me.If this were solely practical, a bloodless transaction for a much-needed visa, or if it were solely romantic, just two people so taken with each other the concerns of the world mattered not to us, this marriage would make more sense to me. It is the mix that knots my stomach at times and turns me cold.The file wears on both of us. Pictures we take of each other are both for us and for the government. When I say, \u201cWhat\u2019s your niece\u2019s name again?\u201d I\u2019m asking it to set it in my brain for the eventual quiz, not out of curiosity. But the government\u2019s file is different from the one in my head. It\u2019s not going to sway any official to learn how I felt when I discovered that for weeks my lover had been, without telling me, going on Twitter, searching for my name and liking every nice thing said about my writing there. Or how frequently he grabs for my hand when we are walking down the street. Or his urgent kiss when the judge declared us wed.\u201cYes,\u201d I said, although the look on his face made me wish I had lied.Jessa Crispin is the author of \u201cWhy I Am Not a Feminist: A Feminist Manifesto.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Business With No End", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "Where does this strange empire start or stop?Part I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InPart I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InWhere does this strange empire start or stop? Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty. I wondered if they knew their place in this vast and vertiginous network \u2014 if they knew that they were helping to achieve Everymarket\u2019s dream: A dream of being a marketplace \u201coffering practically everything from everywhere for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cave in Borneo Jungle, Scientists Find Oldest Figurative Painting in the World", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterA cave drawing in Borneo is at least 40,000 years old, raising intriguing questions about creativity in ancient societies. On the wall of a cave deep in the jungles of Borneo, there is an image of a thick-bodied, spindly-legged animal, drawn in reddish ocher.Until now, the oldest known human-made figures were ivory sculptures found in Germany. Scientists have estimated that those figurines \u2014 of horses, birds and people \u2014 were at most 40,000 years old. The finding also demonstrates that ancient humans somehow made the creative transition at roughly the same time, in places thousands of miles apart.Archaeologists have been discovering cave paintings and ancient sculptures for centuries, but it was only in the mid twentieth century that it became possible to precisely determine their age.Traces of radioactive carbon are present in some types of art, and scientists gauge their age by measuring how long the carbon has been breaking down.For years, those sculptures stood out as the oldest figurative artworks on the planet. \u201cIt was very lonely for a long time,\u201d said Dr. Conard.Scientists suspected that still older art was out there, but radiocarbon dating has limits. Many cave paintings lack the carbon required to date them.Moreover, the half-life of radioactive carbon is only 5,730 years. In a sample that\u2019s 40,000 years old or older, all of the carbon required to date it may be long gone.In recent years, scientists have developed a new dating method.When water trickles down cave walls, it can leave behind a translucent curtain of minerals called a flowstone. If a flowstone contains uranium, it will decay steadily \u2014 and at a predictable rate \u2014 into thorium. That ancient age stunned Dr. Aubert and his colleagues, and they grew eager to use their method on other cave art. Pindi Setiawan, an archaeologist at Bandung Institute of Technology in Indonesia, invited Dr. Aubert and his colleagues to try it in Borneo.Dr. Setiawan and Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesian National Center for Archaeological Research, had spent years studying drawings in remote mountain caves there.Getting to the site was not easy. The team had to travel upriver by boat into the rain forest, then to backpack up mountains for days, hacking a path with machetes.Over the course of two field seasons, the researchers visited six caves. They removed bits of flowstone overlying paintings and used the samples to date the minimum age of the artwork underneath.The scientists discovered flowstones underneath some images, as well; these samples allowed them to determine a maximum age. The earliest art in the caves, the researchers found, were reddish-orange hand outlines and drawings of animals. The oldest of all was covered by a flowstone that formed 40,000 years ago.That drawing depicts a four-legged animal that Dr. Aubert suspected was a species of wild cattle called a banteng.Since the 40,000-year-old flowstone covers the banteng image, the artwork must be older than that \u2014 and thus the oldest known figurative art on the planet.It\u2019s hard to say when people first began to make these cave drawings, but one intriguing clue comes from a hand stencil. A flowstone atop it is 23,600 years old, while another underneath is 51,800 years old.Combining the evidence from this stencil and the banteng image, it\u2019s possible that people started making art in the Borneo caves sometime between 52,000 years ago and 40,000 years ago.The new discovery indicates that people in Borneo were already making figurative images at the same time as people in Europe \u2014 or perhaps even thousands of years beforehand. Now Dr. Aubert and other researchers are puzzling over what triggered these bursts of creativity.One thing is clear: Figurative art came late in the history of our species. Today, every culture makes art of some sort, and it is likely that humans in Africa over 200,000 years ago had the capacity to create it. But for thousands of generations, there\u2019s no evidence that people actually made figurative art. The closest thing to it are abstract engravings etched on shells or pieces of ocher.Only much later did our species expand out of Africa. They arrived in Southeast Asia and Australia perhaps as early as 70,000 years ago. Modern humans didn\u2019t get to Europe until much later, about 45,000 years ago, researchers suspect.Dr. Aubert speculated that over thousands of years, certain societies of hunter-gatherers found places with good food supplies, or developed new kinds of tools, and thus attained denser populations.In those societies, people may have begun communicating with symbolic images and pictures.\u201cWhen they arrive at a certain place and there\u2019s an increase in population, they make rock art,\u201d said Dr. Aubert.The early images and figures might have illustrated stories contained vital information for how to survive in hard times, Dr. Conard said.Or perhaps the drawings helped joined people as a group, encouraging them to cooperate \u2014 \u201ca kind of glue to hold these social units together,\u201d he said.If that\u2019s the case, then ancient figurative art may yet turn up in other places where early humans reached dense populations, including Africa, Asia or Australia.There are many examples of early cave art that have yet to be dated with the latest flowstone method. \u201cThey\u2019re just everywhere,\u201d Dr. Aubert said.For now, however, he just wants to go back to the caves of Borneo and figure out how ancient humans made those remarkable images. Aside from their artwork, no one has found a trace of the people who once lived there. \u201cWe want to go there and dig,\u201d said Dr. Aubert. \u201cWe want to know who those people were. We want to know how they lived. We want to know everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheryl Sandberg Asked for Soros Research, Facebook Acknowledges", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySheryl Sandberg asked Facebook\u2019s communications staff to research George Soros\u2019s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request, indicating that Facebook\u2019s second in command was directly involved in the social network\u2019s response to the liberal billionaire.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, asked for the information in an email to a senior executive in January that was forwarded to other senior communications and policy staff, the people said. The email came within days of a blistering speech Mr. Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking Facebook and Google as a \u201cmenace\u201d to society and calling for the companies to be regulated.Ms. Sandberg \u2014 who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros\u2019s speech, according to a person who attended it \u2014 requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, Facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries.The people with knowledge of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s email asked for anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution.In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.\u201cMr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook\u2019s stock.\u201d The company said that while Ms. Sandberg \u201ctakes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,\u201d she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers\u2019 later work.Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from Facebook, said he was skeptical of the company\u2019s account.\u201cIn light of Sandberg\u2019s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there\u2019s no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,\u201d Mr. Vale said. \u201cFacebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from Facebook coalition or any member organizations.\u201d\u201cWe had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,\u201d Mr. Schrage said of Mr. Soros. \u201cDefiners researched this using public information.\u201dFacebook has defended its inquiries into Mr. Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure \u2014 particularly one like Mr. Soros, a onetime currency trader who made a fortune in the 1990s betting against the British pound.But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Ms. Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.The Times investigation found that Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect President Trump. The Times also found that when Facebook was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.But it is Ms. Sandberg who oversees Facebook\u2019s policy and communications arms, which starting last year embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company\u2019s critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.Facebook hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros.Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm\u2019s research.\u201cShe very much placed it on the now departed communications chief\u201d \u2014 Mr. Schrage \u2014 \u201cand also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,\u201d Mr. Robinson said.

{"Headline": "You Have a Right to Weariness", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe struggle for goodness and decency is an eternal struggle, not a seasonal one.Opinion ColumnistDo we have a right to weariness in an era of animus? More precisely, can we afford it, or is exhaustion a luxury reserved for those whose wealth, privilege and status insulate them from the losses the rest of us could suffer? Does patriotic defense of country require perpetual, obsessive vigilance, or is it permissible to retreat occasionally for one\u2019s own mental and spiritual health?These are questions I ask myself regularly, and ones that are frequently asked of me, if not in those exact words. People are trying to figure out the proper posture to take in a world riven by deceit and corruption, a world in which the leadership of the country represents an assault on decency.This is a conundrum, I must confess.I, as much as anyone else, feel trapped by our current predicament. I would love nothing more than to write about other things, worthy things, more intellectually stimulating things. But for more than two years, I have written almost exclusively about Donald Trump.I feel compelled by what I view as history, fundamental and consequential, playing out right before me with nothing short of the life of the republic at stake. And yet, at a certain point, words begin to fail, or the obvious has already been stated. Once you have pointed out that Trump is a liar, you can then note only that he is telling more lies. The same goes for his racism, bullying, anti-intellectualism, corruption and grift.At some point, it becomes clear that the abnormal, outrageous and unacceptable have become a constant, and even the rolling boil of righteous folk\u2019s indignation reduces to a simmer.People often ask me, \u201cWhen will it end? What can we do to get him out of there?\u201dMy answer always is, \u201cI doubt it will end soon, and there\u2019s very little anyone can do to change that.\u201dI hate to bear that message, but it is the only one I can deliver if I wish to be honest rather than popular.As much as there was to celebrate last week, with liberals winning control of the House of Representatives, and doing so with such a diverse slate of candidates, it was also clear that Republican control of the Senate means that any hope of removing Trump via impeachment has shrunk to nearly nothing. Even if the House impeaches Trump, the Senate remains highly unlikely to remove him.Democrats are even debating how far they can take oversight in the House without turning off people politically.The only hope is that the Robert Mueller investigation may deliver something so damning that some Senate Republicans view it as unacceptable. But there is no evidence as of yet that anything would sway them.At this point, it may be more prudent to view what comes from the Mueller probe as fodder for the 2020 presidential campaign. It may not pave the way for an impeachment conviction by the Senate, but could well pave the way for an electoral \u201cimpeachment.\u201dIt is very likely that we are stuck with Trump until the 2020 election, and even then the Democrats can take nothing for granted if they wish to defeat him.That is the root of people\u2019s distress. How can Republicans in Congress abide this behavior and use it for political positioning? How can so many of our neighbors condone open hostility to minorities, the press and the truth?Or maybe the questions are for us. How could we not have registered fully just how hostile a substantial portion of America is to inclusion and equality? How could we not have registered the full depths of American racism and misogyny? How could we not remember that American progress has always been like a dance with a disagreeable partner, stumbling backward as well as moving forward?I remember calling my mother when Trump was elected, and she was not nearly as distraught as I thought she\u2019d be. Her stated reason: We\u2019ve been through worse. She is an elderly black woman from the South. Her sense of history and heartbreak are long and fraught.Recently, I\u2019ve delved even more deeply into this line of thinking, reading about how black people positioned themselves during both Reconstruction and Jim Crow, when the political structures were largely arrayed against them.I wanted to know how they survived and made progress against open hostility. The recurring themes are to never lose hope in the ultimate victory of righteousness; to focus your fire on the things you are most able to change; and to realize that change is neither quick nor permanent.The struggle for goodness and decency is an eternal struggle, not a seasonal one.Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you need to tune out every now and then and take a mental health break. There is no shame in it. This is a forever fight. Once you have recharged, reapply your armor and rejoin the fight with even more vigor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steven Pinker Thinks the Future Is Looking Bright", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScience Times at 40The Harvard psychologist says he is no starry-eyed optimist. It\u2019s just that the data don\u2019t lie.The thesis of his latest book, \u201cEnlightenment Now,\u201d is that life on Earth is improving. By every major measure of human well-being, from personal safety to longevity to economic security to happiness, people everywhere are far better off today than they were before the start of the Enlightenment in the 17th century.I sat down with Dr. Pinker to talk about how science has made life better, and what humanity needs to do to keep the good times rolling. This is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.I stumbled across data showing that violence had declined over the course of history. The homicide rate in England was 50 times higher in the 14th century than it is today.Like any other news reader, I just assumed that there was as much mayhem as ever. It\u2019s only when you plot it over time, taking into account all the people who don\u2019t get murdered or raped, that you can see the trends.It\u2019s not just in violence that one sees progress, but in poverty, in illiteracy, in access to small luxuries like beer or televisions. The percentage of the world getting an education, in gender parity in education \u2014 girls are going to school all over the world. Even in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the world\u2019s most retrograde countries, the rate of female education has increased.It was an epiphany from seeing graphs of human improvement that changed my view of the overall course of history: that progress is a demonstrable fact. It\u2019s not a matter of seeing the glass as half full. It\u2019s not a matter of being an optimist. It\u2019s a fact that very few people know about.The most overarching explanation would be that the Enlightenment worked. The idea that if we \u2014 we being humanity \u2014 set ourselves the goal of improving well-being, if we try to figure out how the world works using reason and science, every once in a while we can succeed.Part of human nature allows us to control the other part of our human nature. Even though humans tend to be unreasonable, it can\u2019t be the case that we\u2019re incapable of reason \u2014 otherwise, you\u2019d never be able to make the argument that we\u2019re being unreasonable. Even if we tend to backslide to irrationality, that doesn\u2019t mean we should indulge that when we are deliberating how to run a society.No! I was surprised by how much interest there\u2019s been from centrist politicians, who are desperate for a coherent narrative to defend centrist liberalism, cosmopolitanism, open society, from the threats both by populists and by the hard left. I think there is a hunger for a coherent worldview that isn\u2019t just the status quo, the un-Trumpism. We can do better than that. We ought to use reason and science to enhance human well-being.Yes. Advances in longevity and health \u2014 life expectancy on Earth has grown from about 30 to more than 70, in rich countries to more than 80. Health and prosperity, and sustenance \u2014 the fact that famines are far rarer than they used to be. Malnutrition is much lower, infectious disease. More generally, I see science as part of the Enlightenment \u2014 namely reason applied to human betterment.There\u2019s a lot of blame to go around. The value of science is not the value of a bunch of people who call themselves scientists. It\u2019s the concept. It\u2019s also the value of science that tells us when there\u2019s been a failure of reasoning, that identifies the biases and distortions and also points the way to overcome them.None of us is anywhere close to perfect. Scientists themselves are not terribly, not completely rational. We can set up institutions that result in greater rationality than any of us is capable of individually, like peer review, like free speech, like a free press, like empirical testing \u2014 norms and institutions that make us collectively more rational than any of us is individually.If we\u2019re going to solve the problem of avoiding catastrophic climate change, it\u2019s going to come through technology. If you can bend the curve with advances in science, and people can just do what is cheapest and most convenient and that spares the planet \u2014 that\u2019s our most feasible pathway to avoiding catastrophe. I do think that science and technology are going to be absolutely essential to meeting those challenges.It looks like the biggest reason is not because they don\u2019t know the science, but because of their political ideology. The reason that people deny human-made climate change is not that they\u2019re ignorant of climate science, but because they\u2019re on the political right. Conversely, people who accept human-made climate change don\u2019t necessarily understand what\u2019s causing it. There are scientists who believe that Al Gore\u2019s making of \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d is the worst thing that ever happened to climate change awareness, because he branded it as a left-wing issue, and then the right rejected it out of hand.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussOne answer is to make people aware of it, because I think most people are not. Then once one has that understanding, to try to depoliticize issues as much as possible. I do try to disassociate empirical issues from political baggage.I read the news differently to try to put events of the day in perspective. The mainstream media are a hell of a lot better than the not-so-mainstream media, but I\u2019ve noticed a number of sources of systematic pessimism in journalistic practices. My own view of the world was radically altered when I looked at data instead of headlines.If history is about all the wars, all the disasters, you\u2019re missing all this incremental improvement that can only be ascertained through data.It\u2019s no contradiction to say that we\u2019re extending human life and there are threats: threats of climate change, threats of authoritarian politicians. You can appreciate the threats, worry about the threats, try to fight back against the threats at the same time that you appreciate the progress that we have made.I would say that it\u2019s appreciating the progress that gives us the courage and conviction to try to strive for more progress. History tells us that attempts to make the world better tend to succeed. We\u2019ll never achieve a utopia, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make things a little bit better.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Atlantis, El Dorado, Kitezh, Great Zimbabwe, Troy, the Lost City of the Incas. The legends of vanished cities, mythical or real, are an endless source of fascination and fantasy. For an archaeologist it is surely the ultimate ambition to one day burrow under some remote hummock and uncover the remnants of one such long-lost settlement, to reconstruct the shards, stones, bones and baubles into a place where people worked, argued, laughed, lived and died. And with every such discovery we all learn a bit more about who we are and where we come from.Under a small village called Chiliomodi, the team excavated a dense residential area of stone walls, floors of marble, stone and clay, distinctive door openings and pottery dating from the fourth century B.C. to late Roman times. Coins, urns and other artifacts proclaimed that over centuries the descendants of Trojan prisoners of war came to live in comfort and luxury, in contact with East and West.Why is that important? For most people, simply looking through a newly opened window into the distant past satisfies a basic human need to know and requires no further justification. Still, does the discovery that a mythical city few ever heard of exists really change anything? The question is often put to archaeologists, and the usual answers about learning from history or stripping away layers of myth are not particularly convincing.The real answer is personal, and probably differs from person to person, but for each of us a look at what came before is important for many of the same reasons that art, literature and history are important: They open our minds, they lead us to reflect, to better understand ourselves and our world.For archaeologists like Dr. Korka, there is also the profound thrill of the chase, the expectation that every discovery holds the promise of an even greater one. \u201cYou know,\u201d she told The Times, \u201cthere are rumors that even Oedipus was raised there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Frank Wergin, a construction company owner, looked on admiringly: \u201cThat\u2019s our 2020 presidential candidate.\u201dOr do they need a calm, reasoned, reliable (but not flashy) Democrat from the American heartland to provide a stark contrast to the president \u2014 in short, Amy Klobuchar?\u201cMy fear for the Democratic Party is that people are going to see who can be the most virulent, anti-Trump person \u2014 and that is his game; his game is to be angry and snide,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cI think people are exhausted. I think people want to believe that we can be better than that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t agree with, \u2018When they go low, we go low,\u2019 but I do agree that when they go low, we have to respond,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, referring to the intraparty debate over Michelle Obama\u2019s 2016 mantra: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d she went on, \u201cresponding doesn\u2019t mean just going down a rabbit hole everywhere Donald Trump goes. It means doing a response but continuing to push your own agenda. I don\u2019t think we want to use those same tactics and tweet caustic comments every morning.\u201dIn the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar is not in the forefront on divisive issues like immigration, but she has led efforts to curb the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, expand voting rights, address sexual harassment and protect online privacy after revelations of Facebook\u2019s data mining.Early in her tenure, she carved out a niche in consumer protection, shepherding passage of bipartisan bills to ban lead in toys and improve swimming pool safety after several highly publicized child deaths, measures that Gregg Peppin, a Republican strategist here, said have earned Ms. Klobuchar a derisive nickname: \u201cThe Senator of Small Things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s issues that are kind of no-brainers, and when it comes to substantive things, she\u2019s really not there,\u201d Mr. Peppin said, adding that Republicans have a second nickname for her: \u201cCotton Candy Amy, because there\u2019s no nutritional value; you put it in your mouth and it melts away and there\u2019s nothing really there.\u201dMs. Klobuchar has heard the \u201csmall things\u201d criticism, and resents it.\u201cNot for a minute do I view these as small things,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cThey\u2019re big things for the people whose kids\u2019 lives were saved.\u201dShe acknowledged that she is demanding: \u201cI have high expectations.\u201dBut outwardly, Ms. Klobuchar is the embodiment of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d \u2014 polite and intent on being able to \u201cdisagree without being disagreeable,\u201d as she wrote in her 2015 memoir, \u201cThe Senator Next Door.\u201d In an era of Twitter rants and senatorial showboats, she is the worker bee in the background, tallying up how many of her bills get signed into law: 24, she said, since Mr. Trump became president.America got a taste of those traits during the contentious confirmation hearings for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The proceedings left the Judiciary Committee\u2019s other two possible 2020 presidential candidates, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, with political scars. Mr. Booker was widely mocked for drawing attention to what he called his \u201c\u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment,\u201d a defiance of committee rules on the release of private material, while Ms. Harris left people scratching their heads over tantalizing lines of questioning that seemed to lead nowhere.In contrast, Ms. Klobuchar drew on skills honed during her years as the chief prosecutor for Minnesota\u2019s most populous county and calmly pressed the nominee on whether he had ever blacked out while drinking. \u201cHave you?\u201d he shot back, to which she replied steadily, \u201cI have no drinking problem, Judge.\u201d\u201cI think that the country is desperate for somebody that can pull us together, end this harsh partisanship and get us back on dealing with real problems. That\u2019s Amy\u2019s stock in trade,\u201d Mr. Mondale said in an interview. \u201cShe\u2019s strong, but she\u2019s decent and just with people, as we saw in those Kavanaugh hearings.\u201dBut while winning over independents and some centrist Republicans, as Ms. Klobuchar has done, may be an asset in a general election, it could be a hindrance in a Democratic primary dominated by the left. Although she is hardly a centrist, Ms. Klobuchar departs from progressive orthodoxy on several fronts.She has not signed onto Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care bill, commonly called Medicare for All; she said it \u201cshould be considered,\u201d but prefers \u201ca sensible transition\u201d such as allowing people to buy into Medicare, or expanding it to cover those 55 and older. Her push to make college more affordable is not as expansive as the left would like. While she has denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s border policies, she has not joined the movement to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\u201cShe\u2019s a perfectly fine Democrat,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, \u201cbut if we\u2019re looking for a transformational leader and someone who\u2019s going to elevate big, bold ideas and systemic change, others like Elizabeth Warren seem to fit the bill a little bit more head on.\u201dMs. Klobuchar, 58, grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs as the daughter of a schoolteacher and a prominent columnist for The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Jim Klobuchar, whose very public battle with alcoholism she spoke of while questioning Judge Kavanaugh. She said she was simply trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist who testified that the future judge sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.\u201cI was trying to find a dignified way to connect what she had said, which seemed so compelling and true, with what he had said, which was maybe he just doesn\u2019t remember what happened,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I brought it up in the context of my dad, just because I was trying to explain that I know this world.\u201d\u201cI was dressed as a Christmas tree, decked out in a green turtleneck, green tights, brown shoes and brown socks,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was covered in ornaments, and I had a star attached to a ruler on top of my head.\u201dFor the record, Ms. Klobuchar is married, to a University of Baltimore law professor named John Bessler; they have an adult daughter named Abigail who works for a New York City councilman, Keith Powers.

{"Headline": "Rewriting the Old Disability Script", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityWe changed queer literature, and the world, by writing our own stories. With disability, we can do it again. Dr. Griffith is a novelist who has multiple sclerosis. Story creates culture. It teaches us to feel, think and behave in ways generally approved of by those around us. Story conditions us. This conditioning, or bias, is not always visible to us, but it constrains and guides our behavior. Implicit bias can\u2019t be changed until we learn to see the old, embedded story and then find a new and better story to overwrite it.I am a queer, disabled writer who grew up Catholic in the north of England at the fulcrum of two competing stories. In Yorkshire, even more than 400 years after the reign of Henry VIII, Catholics were a small, feared and embattled minority \u2014 as a 9-year-old I was spat upon in the street for raising money for a Catholic charity. It was confusing because to me, my family, friends and teachers (mostly nuns), Catholics were Good, the norm. Out on the street, and to our neighbors, Catholics were Bad, other. So I was aware of dueling cultural narratives, and this, perhaps, is what inoculated me against other cultural stories \u2014 though only partially.Then, when I was 15, I went with my first girlfriend to a gay club where, for the first time, I saw two men kissing and felt instant and visceral revulsion. I was appalled. This was ridiculous: a homophobic lesbian! I had spent the past 10 years counterprogramming anti-lesbian hate but hadn\u2019t thought to do the same for gay men.But disability was different.I did not grow up disabled. I did not develop an awareness of this culture\u2019s bias against, horror at and disdain for physical and intellectual difference. No one explicitly told me that disability was Bad; they didn\u2019t have to. The bias was pervasive and implicit. I did not learn to defend against or counterprogram that ableist story. Instead, I absorbed and internalized it.I learned I had multiple sclerosis 25 years ago. Perhaps because my physical impairments gained on me slowly, it took me years to feel the sting of nondisabled people\u2019s dismissal. It took me years to begin to understand that I had been dismissing my disabled self \u2014 years to recognize the ableist narrative I\u2019d absorbed \u2014 because I had nothing to contradict it.Disability fiction today is in roughly the same place queer fiction was 70 years ago or more. Imagine if all queer fiction today were as depressing as \u201cThe Well of Loneliness.\u201d Then imagine that most disability fiction is worse.One and a quarter million. And we have 50.Think about all those stories that are missing. Stories that we need to overwrite the corrosive narrative of ableism. Without those stories, the implicit bias will continue and the cycle will renew itself endlessly. We changed queer literature, and the world, with story. We can do it again. We can write those stories in our own voices, our strong, beautiful, ordinary, disabled voices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save the Germs", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith modern medicine killing off whole categories of bacteria and viruses \u2014 including benign ones that promote health \u2014 scientists propose a way to preserve microbes that may rescue us one day. Ms. Schenck is a documentary filmmaker.Set in a tuberculosis sanitarium in the Swiss Alps on the eve of World War I, Thomas Mann\u2019s novel \u201cThe Magic Mountain\u201d delves deep into the \u201cfeverish process of decay and repair\u201d that is life.But humans are resilient too, and we\u2019ve known for decades about \u201cgood germs\u201d that can resist or defeat \u201cbad germs\u201d in our bodies. The trouble is that industrial environments, antibacterial drugs and sophisticated medical procedures can kill off those good germs while letting bad ones grow unchecked.Last month, a team of scientists led by Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, a Venezuelan now at Rutgers University, suggested a source of new cures: Create a global microbe vault or system of vaults, perhaps where the climate is easy on refrigeration, to collect and preserve such beneficial microbes, particularly from countries least affected by modernization. Who knows the magic that surviving ancestral biotics might hold for understanding and curbing today\u2019s diseases?The key to understanding the proposal is that not all germs are bad. Some bacteria and viruses aid digestion; others regulate immune systems. But modern medical, dietetic and hygiene practices have put many on the endangered list. The scientists argue that the diversity of the human populations in which they occur creates diversity in how they function. There are even germs that display \u201camphibiosis\u201d: They can be good or bad depending on which other microbes are present, or on their human hosts\u2019 genes, age or environment. Put simply, while we were nearly eradicating TB, the arsenal of wonder drugs \u2014 along with practices like elective cesarean sections, processing foods and purifying water \u2014 were carpet-bombing many good microbes, alongside toxic germs, that come with birth. We get them when we squeeze through the birth canal and when we drink breast milk \u2014 a co-evolution of mothers and microbes unbroken for at least 200,000 years.Americans may have lost half their microbial diversity in recent decades. In China and India, the loss grows ever faster as those countries\u2019 development accelerates. Research also points to a strong link between this loss, especially in early life, and the epidemic-level increase of many terrible diseases and disorders. In Canada, Meghan Azad has shown that babies receiving antibiotics are likelier to become overweight children and teenagers; research by Brett Finlay and Marie-Claire Arrieta shows that if babies 3 months old lack normal levels of four key bacteria, they are predisposed to asthma. And evidence grows that diminished microbial diversity may trigger or worsen inflammatory bowel diseases, diabetes, food allergies and autism.An example of a vault\u2019s potential benefit comes from Dr. Blaser, one of the writers in Science: \u201cFor most infectious diseases, there isn\u2019t 100 percent mortality. Our ancestors survived many plagues with the help of their microbes. While antibiotics can cure us from some diseases, resistance to these powerful drugs is growing. New treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections, like multi-drug-resistant TB, could come from our ancient microbes.\u201dNew treatments could mean newly discovered antibiotics or uses for bacteria-eating bacteriophages. Stool samples would contain viruses also from a person\u2019s digestive tract, which could, in theory, point toward a cure for drug-resistant TB and other maladies.Creating the vault could also increase technology transfers to the developing world. Professor Dominguez-Bello argues passionately that making it a public resource could catalyze the creation of local microbe collections around the world.Many questions remain unanswered: Would a vault offer long-term preservation only? A working collection for countries and researchers? What would be the criteria for a withdrawal \u2014 a W.H.O. declaration of a medical emergency? But the thinking behind the project is sound. We should muster resources to halt the loss of good germs, and restore their diversity and population. You can\u2019t restore microbes that have gone extinct. The key to success is to keep in balance Mann\u2019s \u201cfeverish process,\u201d which is life itself.Sarah Schenck is a co-director and co-producer of a documentary being made about the critical role of microbes in human health.

I could barely speak. He might have said, \u201cLovely party,\u201d but that was it, he was on his way. The isolation of my queer youth was about to return. Out of nowhere, I told him he was my favorite ballet dancer in the world.13 PhotosWhat he hears most from his 171,000 Instagram followers is that he looks like he\u2019s having fun. And he is. Dancing with ABT has been his dream since he was a boy, when he attended a gala and visited the principals\u2019 red-velvet hallway backstage. He loves ballet and wants others to fall in love with it, too, and he hopes his feed will bring more people into the theater. But it bugs him that so much of ballet Instagram \u2014 his own at times, too \u2014 is \u201cdancer thirst trap.\u201d The twerking and the tights and the belts are a misleading representation of the work, the almost inhuman physical effort behind a dancer doing splits in the air. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to understand what we really do from Instagram, where everything has a smile on it and a cigarette in its mouth,\u201d he says. \u201cBallet is one of the most physically demanding things in the world, but you have to seem like you\u2019re just taking a whiz.\u201dWhiteside has a point. But like any protagonist, he can\u2019t see himself as we do. Before social media, ballet on video \u2014 think of those tame PBS broadcasts \u2014 appealed to a specialized audience. One reason is its perspective: The cameras, way up in the auditorium, show ballet from a limited point of view. But on Instagram, the close-up angles, taped ankles, the veins and arteries flooded with blood, give us ballet as the dancer experiences it. Rather than removing the magic of a darkened theater, this intimacy brings us closer to the my-God-how-does-the-human-body-do-that awe that ballet inspires.Lidberg has since become a leading choreographer around the world, developing works for companies such as City Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. In his latest piece, \u201cSiren,\u201d performed in October at the Joyce, he flips the genders in Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey.\u201d Ulysses is a woman, and the sirens \u2014 the original temptations \u2014 are men. Its central theme is that existential desire to connect.Every dancer I spoke with has a story of how their art touched someone in unexpected ways, just as the ballerino from Winnipeg gave me something I could carry far into my future. Art is nothing if it does not connect, and these dancers are connecting with people who might previously have thought ballet could not, or would not, speak for them. Whiteside tells me about a letter he received from a woman who thinks her young son is gay. The boy loves to dance, the mother writes, and wants to be like Whiteside when he grows up. His classmates make fun of him for loving ballet, but the mother is proud of her son for staying resolute; seeing Whiteside become successful gives her hope as a parent. \u201cI wrote her back and said that was me \u2014 headstrong little effeminate gay kid,\u201d Whiteside says.

And differences of geographical origin are just the start of the complexities that besiege Minsung and Nanhee in this overwhelming play about being overwhelmed in a very confusing century.Our leading lovers (though they might question being so described) are also both citizens of a vast global nation in which instant communication has never seemed easier or more impossible.

Nanhee is indeed the daughter of a North Korean miner, whom she has left behind in defecting to the South and whose spirit (embodied by Francis Jue) haunts her daily life.

There\u2019s more flight-oriented imagery to process. The play begins with Mr. Jue, as Nanhee\u2019s father, relating a bedtime folk tale about an angel who loses her ability to fly and falls in love with a mortal man, and who must later choose between staying on earth or ascending to the skies once again. The conflicting demands of freedom and family turn out to dominate both Nanhee and Minsung\u2019s lives.Penguins will later play a part in their story, including one cunning puppet version who pokes its head out of a toilet to taunt Nanhee, who is spending her first night in Minsung\u2019s tiny apartment in a barrackslike building for students. And then there\u2019s the battalion of North Korean troops that shows up accessorizedwith penguin heads in one of Nanhee\u2019s guilty fantasies.As Nanhee deals with her conflicted feelings about fleeing her homeland, Minsung keeps trying to connect with his wife (Jaygee Macapugay) and daughter (Kendyl Ito), sometimes by phone, sometimes on Facebook. And the gaps \u2014 generational, cultural, technological \u2014 just keep widening. Minsung finally finds himself reaching out to Nanhee with a pop song he wrote about suicide in a YouTube video that goes viral.The diverse and untethered world of \u201cWild Goose Dreams\u201d has been given remarkably coherent life by a design team that includes Clint Ramos (the neon and anime-inflected set), Linda Cho (costumes) and Lillis Meeh (special effects).

{"Headline": "How the Jumping Spider Sees Its Prey", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScienceTakeResearchers looked deep into the eyes of a predatory spider to learn what it was looking at. O.K., if you\u2019re still here, jumping spiders are predators that stalk their prey and leap on them, like a cat. They are smart, agile and have terrific eyesight. It has been clear for a long time that their vision is critical to the way they hunt, and to the accuracy of their leaps. But a lot has remained unknown about the way their eyes work together.The first step was getting a custom-built spider eye tracker, similar to ones used on humans, to follow a spider\u2019s gaze. Actually, Dr. Jakob had two made, probably the only two in the world. She has one and her colleagues in New Zealand have the other.Jumping spiders have eight eyes. Two big eyes, right in the center of what you might call the spider\u2019s forehead, are the principal ones, and they pick up detail and color.Of the other three pairs, a rear set looks backward, a middle set is as yet a bit of a mystery, and the foremost detect motion. The lenses of the main eyes are attached by flexible tubes to retinas. A camera was set up to look down those tubes and see the activity of the retinas, which look a bit like boomerangs. The inside of the spider\u2019s head was lit by ultraviolet light, which penetrates the outer carapace. But as accurate as the main eyes are, they only see what is in front of them. If they had to find prey, it would be like using a narrow flashlight beam to explore a dark room. Not very efficient.The researchers found that the front pair of secondary eyes, the motion detectors, tell the main pair of eyes where to look.When they were painted over temporarily and the spider was presented with moving images, it had no idea where to look.But when they were active, the principal eyes would turn toward motion that the secondary eyes had noticed. The researchers could see the retinas moving as the spiders scanned the object for detail.It is the \u201ccooperation between physically separate sets of eyes\u201d that is most remarkable, Dr. Jakob said. The next step is to see how the spider\u2019s tiny, but very effective, brain manages that coordination. The secondary eyes are not just informing the spider that there is something moving, they are transmitting the location of the moving object, so the brain can tell the main eyes to get a better look. All in time to plan one of the creature\u2019s deadly leaps.The researchers were able to conduct the experiment without harming the spiders. They affixed a Dr. Seuss style hat to the top of the spiders\u2019 heads with wax, and that hat was attached to an apparatus to keep them in one place.After the experiment, off came the hat. And off went the spiders. Advertisement"}

Who knew?Opinion ColumnistLet\u2019s face it: Make America Great Again was a brilliant political slogan. Why? Because it could mean different things to different people.For many supporters of Donald Trump, MAGA was basically a promise to return to the good old days of raw racism and sexism. And Trump is delivering on that promise.But for at least some Trump voters, it was a promise to restore the kind of economy we had 40 or 50 years ago \u2014 an economy that still offered lots of manly jobs in manufacturing and mining. Unfortunately for those who trusted Mr. Art of the Deal, Trump never had any idea how to deliver on that promise. And even if he had a clue about policymaking, he couldn\u2019t have changed the long-term trajectory of our economy, which is moving steadily away from making physical stuff and toward providing services.As a result, Trump, who cares above all about image, is now getting headlines that make a mockery of his campaign posturing \u2014 headlines about closing auto plants and lost jobs. Now, autos are a special case; overall manufacturing employment is still rising, although not especially fast. But relative to his grand promises, what\u2019s happening is an embarrassing bust.Why was the vision of revived manufacturing nonsense? Talking about what Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know is, of course, a vast task, since his ignorance is both broad and deep. But he seems to have misunderstood three specific things about manufacturing.First, he believes that trade deficits are the reason we\u2019ve shifted away from manufacturing. But they aren\u2019t.Still, even if trade deficits are a distinctly secondary cause of manufacturing decline, can\u2019t Trump help a little by getting tough on foreigners? That brings us to his second fallacy: No, trade deficits aren\u2019t caused by unfair foreign trade practices.The truth is that while tariffs and so on can affect trade in particular industries, the overall trade balance mainly reflects exchange rates, which in turn are mainly driven by capital flows: The dollar is strong because foreigners want to buy U.S. assets. And Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 tax cuts for corporations, big deficits that drive up interest rates \u2014 are so far making the dollar even stronger.Or to put it differently, running America isn\u2019t like running a family business. It has to be done by setting broad policies and sticking to them, not by browbeating a few people whenever you see a bad headline.So Trump\u2019s promise to restore U.S. manufacturing was doomed to fail. Why did he make it in the first place?For what it\u2019s worth, I suspect that in this case Trump wasn\u2019t actually trying to scam voters. My guess is that he genuinely believed that he could bring manufacturing, coal mining and so on roaring back, that others had failed to do so only because they weren\u2019t tough enough.But the real question isn\u2019t whether Trump will ever realize that he doesn\u2019t know how to MAGA.

What I want to do here is, first, to recount my understanding of their logic; then offer my own views on what a reasonable Brexit projection might assume for both the short and the long run.But where did these negative scenarios come from?When economists try to assess changes in trade policy, they normally use some kind of \u201ccomputable general equilibrium\u201d (CGE) model. These models attempt to take account of the impacts of trade policy on consumption, production, and the allocation of resources. And there has been quite a lot of CGE modeling of Brexit.But the BoE\u2019s worst-case scenario shows a cost exceeding 10% of GDP, around three times what a CGE would tell you. Where\u2019s that coming from?Part of the answer is that the BoE includes some nonstandard effects of trade: they assume that reduced trade (and foreign direct investment) will reduce productivity more than the direct impacts on resource allocation would predict. They cite some statistical evidence, but it\u2019s important to realize that this is black-box, reduced-form stuff: there\u2019s no explicit mechanism through which it\u2019s supposed to happen.However, these assumed nonstandard effects aren\u2019t what\u2019s driving the really bad scenarios; they only, as I understand it, contribute something like 1 percentage point of GDP to the predicted costs.What\u2019s key to the very bad results is, instead, the disruption that might come with a hard Brexit. Right now, goods flow into and out of Britain with minimal frictions. After Brexit, there would have to be customs inspections, and the UK doesn\u2019t have remotely enough customs infrastructure to do the job. The result would be huge delays at Dover and other ports, with queues of trucks backing up for many miles on motorways, just-in-time production massively disrupted, and more.That disruption is what\u2019s driving the terrible scenarios. Notice that this analysis says that the costs of leaving the EU are much higher than the GDP that would have been foregone if Britain had never entered the EU, and therefore had the customs infrastructure to deal with trade flows in place.OK, that\u2019s what I understand about the BoE analysis. What do I think about it?So, about the BoE\u2019s purpose in issuing this report: if it wasn\u2019t intended to scare people, the Bank was extraordinarily na\u00efve in not realizing how it would be reported and read. They really led with their chin here.On the substance: I\u2019m skeptical about the supposed effects of trade on productivity. I know that there\u2019s some evidence for such effects; trade seems to favor more productive firms. But relying a lot on effects we can\u2019t model seems dubious.In particular, I have strong memories of the openness-growth debacle of the 1990s. At the time, there were many statistical studies purporting to find that open, outward oriented developing countries had much higher growth rates than inward-looking economies. This was interpreted to mean that countries that had tried to industrialize by protecting domestic markets could achieve Asian-type growth rates if they liberalized trade.As it turned out, the supposed statistical evidence on openness and growth was quite suspect. And when massive trade liberalization happened in places like Mexico, the hoped-for growth miracles didn\u2019t materialize.So I would treat that channel of Brexit losses as questionable. But what I learned from the BoE is that it\u2019s not that central to the analysis.What about disruption at the borders? This could indeed be a huge problem.What\u2019s puzzling about the scenarios shown in Figure 1 is that they show these disruptions going on for multiple years, with barely any abatement. Really? Britain is an advanced country with high administrative capacity \u2014 the kind of country that history shows can cope well with huge natural disasters, and even wars. Would it really have that much trouble hiring customs inspectors and installing computers to recover from an 8 or 10 percent drop in GDP?And even in the short run, I wonder why Britain couldn\u2019t follow the old prescription, \u201cWhen all else fails, lower your standards.\u201d If laxer enforcement, special treatment for trusted shippers, whatever, could clear the bottlenecks at the ports, wouldn\u2019t that be worth it, despite the potential for fraud, as a temporary measure?That said, it\u2019s truly amazing that Britain finds itself in this position. If the downsides are anywhere close to what the BoE asserts, given the risk \u2014 which we\u2019ve known for a long time was substantial \u2014 of a hard Brexit, it was an act of utter folly not to have put in backup capacity at the borders. We can\u2019t possibly be talking about all that much money, and the Brexit vote was more than two years ago. What has the UK government been doing?All in all, it\u2019s quite a spectacle. Whether you\u2019re pro-Brexit or anti, you should be horrified and outraged at how the issue has been handled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s First Order of Business Should Be to Reclaim the Power of the House", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is about much more than Trump. Mr. Weiner is a political scientist and a former senior aide to Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. Many Democrats are salivating over the prospect of using their new House majority to investigate President Trump. The more important constitutional question is whether they will use it to legislate and reassert congressional authority that has lain dormant for decades. They now control the most powerful and representative institution of government. House members wield the power to inhibit policies they oppose and to leverage that authority to insist on those they favor. Democrats should act like it rather than orienting themselves around the presidency as though it, and Mr. Trump, were the be-all and end-all of American politics.A period in which Congress is itself divided may seem inauspicious for a revival of legislative authority. But because successful legislation would require compromise and moderation, the moment may be especially suited to that task. If members of Congress are willing to place loyalty to their institution over fidelity to their parties, which the framers of the Constitution anticipated, they can begin restoring its status as the first branch of American government.The Constitution made Congress the subject of Article I for a reason. The most substantial powers of the national government are delineated there. Restoring congressional power \u2014 not simply through investigation or rhetoric but ultimately through legislation \u2014 would both transcend and serve Democrats\u2019 partisan interests.It is true that Democrats will control only one chamber of Congress in the face of Republican control of the White House and the Senate. But to James Madison, the House was the locus of constitutional action: Congress was the most powerful branch of government, and the House was the most powerful branch of Congress.For their part, Republicans must elevate loyalty to Congress over fealty to a president of their own party. That may sound implausible, but if it is, the Constitution is already lost. As long as House Republicans see themselves as adjuncts of the White House, Congress will remain in orbit around a presidency at the center. If they decide there is nothing to gain in doing so, they must ask \u2014 as must Democrats who reach the same conclusion \u2014 the Madisonian question: Why seek a job obsessively only to perform it submissively?Legislating from the limited position of House Democrats will not be effortless, nor should it be. The Constitution is designed not to facilitate easy decisions but to defer them until the public view, now volatile and divided, is settled. Congress should be judged not by the volume of its output but by its representation of the public\u2019s views and its defense of its institutional authority.In that sense, this moment is a stress test for the constitutional regime, which places Congress in the driver\u2019s seat. The presidency can pull an emergency brake but was never intended to steer the vehicle.The question is whether House Democrats will realize that control of the people\u2019s branch places them in power rather than in opposition \u2014 and whether Republicans, behaving institutionally rather than ideologically, will join them in returning Congress to its pride of constitutional place. Both parties have professed a desire to restore constitutional norms. Reviving the power of Congress \u2014 something only moderation and cooperation can accomplish \u2014 is their chance to prove it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End Forced Arbitration for Sexual Harassment. Then Do More.", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf tech companies really want to be cutting-edge, they should get rid of the policy in all employment-related disputes. Ms. Gerstein the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.On Nov. 1, more than 20,000 Google employees walked off the job in protest of the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct. A week later, Google capitulated to some of the protesters\u2019 key demands and announced the end to forced arbitration for its employees in relation to sexual harassment and assault claims. The very next day, Facebook followed suit with regard to sexual harassment claims. Microsoft, Uber and Lyft have taken similar steps in the past year.Technology companies pride themselves on their cutting-edge, visionary nature. Now that they\u2019ve taken the first step, here\u2019s an opportunity for them to be early adopters, and national leaders, by making an even more impactful move: ending forced arbitration in relation to all employment-related disputes, not just sexual harassment. And given the extensive reach of these companies through their multitude of contractors, they should prohibit their contractors from forcing employees into arbitration, as well.Of course, workplace violations of different types are often intertwined: The same employers that permit or perpetrate sexual harassment also commit a host of other violations \u2014 underpaying workers, discriminating in other ways or preventing workers from organizing. A case I handled long ago captures this. A group of women who worked for a dry cleaner came to our office because they were underpaid, working 56 hours a week for subminimum wages and no overtime.As I investigated, I quickly learned how interrelated their problems were. The women, who were Latina, were paid less than their male co-workers. All of the Latino workers, male and female, made less than their non-Latino counterparts. No one made enough to live on, and everyone there was surely exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Over repeated meetings, another story also emerged: The boss routinely made leering comments to the women workers, told them to wear short skirts and, as I later learned, had sex with one of them in a La Guardia Airport hotel \u2014 consensually, he insisted. When I questioned him in sworn testimony about his behavior toward his female employees, he said, \u201cSpanish women like it.\u201dHow do you tease apart the sexism, racism and economic exploitation in this situation? You can\u2019t. They\u2019re inseparable. What brought the women to our office was their unlawfully low pay. But this was partly a result of discrimination against them based on their sex and national origin, and from an even broader viewpoint, it was a result of their lack of power or a voice on the job.So why would it make sense to end forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment only? Why should any company still block people from filing in court when they\u2019re racially harassed or underpaid or paid less because of their national origin? All are offenses against human dignity, and in all of these cases, there is the same tremendous power differential that makes it so hard for people to speak up.The workers who walked out at Google have lives very distinct from the immigrant women who spend their days pressing clothes. But at the root of sexual harassment, or any kind of workplace abuse, is abuse of power. Even a Hollywood legend like Gwyneth Paltrow didn\u2019t speak up about Harvey Weinstein because she thought she would be fired.Even if these companies stop using forced arbitration, their workers will still have plenty of reasons not to speak up: fear of retaliation (even though it\u2019s illegal), fear of being blacklisted, difficulty finding a lawyer to take the case. And with President Trump remaking the judiciary in his image, federal court may soon not be such a great option, either. But at the very least, working people should have the chance to have their day, together, in court.By ending forced arbitration only in cases of sexual harassment, Google, Facebook and their fellow technology companies have responded to public pressure, to the day\u2019s news cycle. But it\u2019s time to be proactive, not just reactive. There\u2019s no logic to ending forced arbitration for sexual harassment only and leaving it intact for so much else.In the end, the most compelling reason for a company to foist arbitration on its work force is to avoid liability and public exposure that might result from a court case. But if a company wants to avoid liability, blocking workers from court isn\u2019t the best way to do that. The answer is to create a fair and lawful workplace, the best possible workplace, for everyone who contributes to a company\u2019s success and to give workers a voice. That, and not a new phone or new app, is the kind of vision and disruption we need more of.Terri Gerstein is the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Says Europe Must \u2018Get a Handle\u2019 on Migration to Thwart Populism", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEurope\u2019s leaders need to send a much stronger message that they will no longer offer \u201crefuge and support\u201d to migrants if they want to curb the right-wing populism spreading across the Continent, Hillary Clinton warned in an interview published Thursday.Mrs. Clinton said that while the decision of some nations to welcome migrants was admirable, it had opened the door to political turmoil, the rise of the right and Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union.\u201cI admire the very generous and compassionate approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part, and must send a very clear message \u2014 \u2018we are not going to be able to continue provide refuge and support\u2019 \u2014 because if we don\u2019t deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politic,\u201d she said.The issue of migration has been a divisive one worldwide, and especially so in Europe, in the wake of an influx of refugees and migrants that, in 2015 alone, drew one million people to the continent. Since then, its leaders have cut unauthorized migration to Europe by 90 percent, largely through the kinds of deterrents Mrs. Clinton belatedly recommended.In the United States, President Trump has mobilized his base of supporters by focusing on what he calls the perils of immigration. He spoke frequently before the midterm elections about a caravan of immigrants traveling north toward the country\u2019s southern border. Democrats agreed on a strategy of mostly ignoring that issue, but the party is divided on how best to grapple with immigration in general.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks to The Guardian drew criticism and a dose of surprise from an array of scholars, pro-immigration advocates and pundits on both the left and right, some of whom were so perplexed by the comments that they wondered aloud whether Mrs. Clinton had perhaps misspoken. Mrs. Clinton, many said, has a long history of supporting refugees \u2014 a track record seemingly at odds with her recent remarks. Her immigration platform in the 2016 presidential election boasted that \u201cwe embrace immigrants, not denigrate them.\u201dA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Thursday night.\u201cI was kind of shocked,\u201d Eskinder Negash, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments. \u201cIf she\u2019s simply saying you need to cut down on refugees coming to Europe to ask for asylum because they have a well-founded fear of persecution, just to appease some right-wing political leaders, it\u2019s just not the right thing to do.\u201dTanja Bueltmann, a history professor at Northumbria University in Britain who focuses on migration issues, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s perspective was \u201ctragically misjudged.\u201d\u201cUltimately, immigration is not actually the problem that inflamed voters: Much more foundational issues, such as austerity, are the real reason,\u201d Professor Bueltmann said. \u201cImmigrants and refugees are simply the scapegoats populists have chosen to use to drive forward their ideas.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s comments came against a complicated backdrop in Europe. Far-right parties have seized on the immigration issue and gained a foothold in parliaments and governments across the continent, while centrist leaders in a number of countries have undertaken largely successful efforts since 2016 to drastically lower the number of unauthorized immigrants now reaching their borders.To liberals in Europe, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advice may have seemed belated as the continent continues its conservative tilt; but it was right on time for the rising populists, who seized on her remarks as they seek to revive a fading and highly effective issue.\u201cMaybe Hillary has understood the lesson,\u201d said Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, which has advocated an Italians First platform and a hard line against migrants entering their country.Ms. Meloni, who recently hosted Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist \u2014 as a keynote speaker at her party\u2019s annual conference in Rome, added that Mrs. Clinton appeared to acknowledge that opposition to migration was \u201cnot a problem of racism,\u201d and that \u201cif you don\u2019t control migration it will affect mostly poor people, people living on the outskirts, working classes.\u201cThe left didn\u2019t understand that, or didn\u2019t want to, and they paid for their distance from the people,\u201d she said.At the same time, centrist leaders have worked to make the continent less hospitable to unauthorized migrants; the number of new arrivals there has dropped to a fraction of what it was.\u201cWe must get the facts straight,\u201d said Gerald Knaus, the architect of the controversial deal with Turkey. \u201cToday in 2018, few irregular migrants reach the European Union.\u201dMr. Knaus said that mimicking the approach of the far right only risked helping them. \u201cJust getting tough without any strategy does the work of the far right,\u201d he said.Democrats in the United States have also struggled to come up with a collective stance on immigration to counter President Trump\u2019s relentless focus on the issue.Indeed, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s assessment represented a stark reminder of the sort of politics she and her husband were long identified with: pragmatic and canny in the view of moderates but, to progressives, nothing less than craven accommodation to the nationalism she purportedly wants to tame.The strategy reprised some of the themes that he used to great effect during the 2016 presidential election. Since the midterm election, talk of the caravan has largely dropped off the Republican agenda.Mrs. Clinton was largely absent from the midterm campaigns, and figures on the American left swiftly seized on her comments to argue that she was badly out of step with the Democratic Party\u2019s ascendant liberalism and should remain sidelined.\u201cOur job on the left,\u201d Corey Robin, a progressive author wrote in a stinging Facebook post, \u201cis to say: goodbye to all that, we\u2019re done being done.\u201dKatrin Bennhold, Jason Horowitz and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Amazon Finally Makes an HQ2 Decision", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello from Seattle. I\u2019m Karen Weise, the new tech correspondent here. As you might imagine, the announcement of Amazon\u2019s decision in what it had billed as a search for a second headquarters, a.k.a. HQ2, has dominated news here this week.I\u2019ve found the HQ2 search and the obsession around it fascinating because of the blatant display of Amazon\u2019s power to promise jobs and lobby politicians, thanks to the company\u2019s market dominance and consumer adoration.The choice to enter New York is particularly interesting because Amazon will need to deal with a local political environment that is far more complex than its hometown\u2019s.Seattle has plenty of activism \u2014 from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests to becoming the first big city to pass a $15 minimum wage \u2014 and certainly there\u2019s some antagonism toward Amazon. But the labor, media and electoral politics of New York are a different breed.That\u2019s been evident in the blowback to the more than $2 billion in planned tax subsidies there. That the state promised to help Amazon get access to a helipad didn\u2019t help.The New York Post cover blared \u201cQueens Ransom\u201d next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read \u201cStay the Helipad Out.\u201dUntil recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle\u2019s civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon\u2019s main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics.That began to change in 2015, when Amazon\u2019s real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, \u201cI\u2019d call those branch offices.\u201d It\u2019s a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. \u201cWe know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,\u201d Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. \u201cWe are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I\u2019m on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us.\u201dHow that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon\u2019s growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That\u2019s a mix of the technical and creative work that\u2019s already thriving in the city.Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.But Amazon\u2019s agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s vision there?Some other tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Paying Off Men Accused of Sexual Harassment, Google Says It Will Meet Many of the Protesters\u2019 Demands ", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company will announce today that it is finally taking these issues seriously. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. One, they said, was a \u201cgood guy.\u201d Another didn\u2019t deserve to have his life ruined because of his indiscretion. Still another might walk his giant cache of tech knowledge over to a competitor, and that would not stand.These were the inane reasons put forward over the years by top Google executives for a series of hush-hush agreements and payoffs to far too many high-ranking men who had been accused of sexual harassment, according to numerous sources who were in the private meetings where the decisions were debated.Yesterday, all of Google\u2019s vice presidents met, and today, the company will deliver some answers. According to an internal memo from the head of human resources, Eileen Naughton, Google leadership will address the issues at a town hall at its Charlie\u2019s cafeteria in Mountain View, Calif. Global offices can call in at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. According to a just-released letter to employees from Sundar Pichai, the Google chief executive, that I obtained, Google will meet many of the protesters\u2019 demands. Those protesters had a long list, which included: An end to forced arbitration when filing a sexual harassment allegation, which has become a tool to suppress the accuser instead of protecting him or her; equality in pay and opportunity, which, by giving a wider range of people money and power, would help stop these kind of abuses; a public report on sexual harassment (news flash: sometimes shame is a perfectly fine motivator of good behavior); a uniform process for reporting sexual harassment charges in offices worldwide, which would prevent a piecemeal approach from hindering best practices; a chief diversity officer who reports to the chief executive officer, because clout comes with access; and creating an employee representative to the board, which seems like the smartest idea of all.\u201cWe recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to make some changes.\u201d His letter said that arbitration will no longer be mandatory, announced improvements to sexual harassment reporting and training, and emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to diversity. It\u2019s just unfortunate that it took a public protest by its employees for the company to move these issues to the front burner. Google shouldn\u2019t stop here. Next, and perhaps more painfully, all the executives who paid off their colleagues or let them off the hook should explain in detail to employees how that happened. That would include releasing all pertinent emails and other communications to help figure out how these decisions were made. While some think such disclosures are legally problematic, truth and reconciliation is the first step to true change. One of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst characteristics is an inability to reflect on itself. This is part of its laudable proclivity to push forward, but in this case, looking back is the best way to move ahead.Finally, these issues aren\u2019t limited to Google, and the company now has a chance to become a real leader of changes across tech and all of business. Imagine if it took the tens of millions of dollars it had given to each of the problematic executives and instead handed it over to a range of public advocacy organizations that could hold companies like Google to account.True that. None of the Googlers who walked out last week want technology to solve anything. They want the very human humans who run the place to do it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Among Israel\u2019s Ultra-Orthodox, It\u2019s (Sort of) the Year of the Woman", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAliza Bloch, a 51-year-old former high school principal, didn\u2019t just defeat the two-term incumbent, an ultra-Orthodox man who enjoyed the backing of rabbis from the dominant sects. She did it by uniting nonreligious longtime residents angry about being turned into minorities in their own city, English-speaking Orthodox immigrants impatient with inadequate government services, and forward-thinking ultra-Orthodox who were both sick of being denigrated as not religious enough and embarrassed by the bad press that Beit Shemesh has earned as a hotbed of religious fanaticism.\u201cUntil now, radicals controlled the discourse,\u201d Ms. Bloch told a cheering crowd of supporters who had waited around till after 3 a.m. Thursday for her razor\u2019s-edge victory to be assured with the counting of absentee ballots. \u201cThey prevented us from seeing one another as human beings. Until today, they were the ones who set the tone.\u201dBut no longer, she vowed: From now on, the city would become a model for all Israel. \u201cWe\u2019ve realized that we share a common good that unites us,\u201d Ms. Bloch said, adding: \u201cNo more \u2018I take care of the people in my sector.\u2019 We\u2019re done with that sort of talk in Beit Shemesh.\u201dTuesday\u2019s mayoral and council elections, a once-every-five-years affair in Israel, were dotted with small-scale coups, comedowns and comebacks across the country. But it was the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, sector that showed the most intriguing new uses of its considerable political clout.In Haifa, one of the leading Haredi parties, Degel HaTorah, or Flag of the Torah \u2014 representing the so-called Lithuanian wing of the non-Hasidic ultra-Orthodox \u2014 broke with the others and endorsed a nonreligious woman, Einat Kalisch Rotem, 48, who rolled to victory over a longtime incumbent to become the first woman elected as mayor of Israel\u2019s third-largest city. (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the two largest cities, have elected only men to the top job.)Gilad Malach, head of the ultra-Orthodox program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the Haredi sects believe Jewish law dictates that only men should lead, and that women should avoid calling attention to themselves in the way that politics requires. \u201cTheir belief is a woman shouldn\u2019t be a mayor, prime minister or even a member of the Knesset,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when they had a choice and they chose a woman.\u201dEven more groundbreaking, Degel HaTorah leaders celebrated and even bragged about Ms. Rotem\u2019s victory in public. One of the party\u2019s elected lawmakers, Moshe Gafni, placed a fawning congratulatory call to her \u2014 \u201cNow you can do everything you think should be done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are with you\u201d \u2014 and then posted a videotape of the call online. And when the new mayor-elect showed up at one of the sect\u2019s synagogues late that night, hundreds of young yeshiva students sang and danced around her as if she were a renowned Torah scholar.\u201cThey welcomed her as a rabbi \u2014 it was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Malach said.The ultra-Orthodox sects have typically wielded political power by voting as a bloc and by uniting across internal rifts \u2014 Hasidic and non-Hasidic, Ashkenazi and Sephardic \u2014 to deliver the biggest possible numbers for their candidates and their allies. But with the Haredi population already more than one million, or about 12 percent of the country, and still growing fast, the sects are starting to strike out on their own, Mr. Malach said.In the Jerusalem mayor\u2019s race this year, for example, Yossi Daitch, a Hasidic candidate, ran with the backing of the Hasidic party Agudat Yisrael, or Union of Israel. But the two other major ultra-Orthodox factions, Degel HaTorah and Shas, the Sephardic party, endorsed Moshe Leon, a non-Haredi businessman. Mr. Daitch stayed in the race even when it became clear he was unlikely to win \u2014 a sign of bad blood between the Haredi parties that, if unresolved, could mean trouble for Mr. Leon in his runoff with Ofer Berkovitch, a nonreligious deputy mayor.But it was the mayoral upset in Beit Shemesh, in the Judean foothills west of Jerusalem, that had veteran political analysts reaching in vain for historical comparisons and calling it almost biblical.If Ms. Bloch was facing a well-entrenched incumbent in Moshe Abutbul, he was highly unpopular, seen as having neglected the needs of many of his constituents and done little more than watch as many of the non-Orthodox fled seeking a better quality of life elsewhere.And ultra-Orthodox voters realized they were being ill served, too, said Daniel Goldman, a supporter of Ms. Bloch\u2019s and chairman of Gesher, a group that promotes coexistence among nonpracticing Jews, the ultra-Orthodox and everyone in between. \u201cThe new places in town are all Haredi, and the public infrastructure there is shocking,\u201d he said, with school children studying in trailers, inadequate bus service and too few ritual baths and synagogues.Ms. Bloch promised to bring fairness to the delivery of city services, reverse the exodus of young people and attract new employers in technology and other desirable industries. Mindful that Beit Shemesh\u2019s population growth has also included worldlier English-speaking ultra-Orthodox, she also promised to hire English speakers in the schools and city offices to make their adjustments easier to life in Israel.But she also faced challenges unique to Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox milieu. A self-described religious woman herself, if not Haredi, Ms. Bloch demonstrated great deference to Haredi sensibilities in her campaign, by keeping her own face off nearly all her campaign posters. \u201cI was really challenged in a male-dominated area,\u201d Ms. Bloch said in a phone interview as the votes were being counted. \u201cI\u2019m a religious woman who made herself aware to others through very hard work \u2014 even harder because I did not post photos of myself in synagogues, or reading the Torah.\u201dTal Schneider, the political reporter for Globes, an Israeli business newspaper, said she was bowled over by Ms. Bloch\u2019s restraint in her advertising. \u201cNow she can change policy, but to get there she had to take out the most important component of democracy, which is the person,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201dIt also worked. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox voters \u2014 voting their own minds, rather than their rabbis\u2019 dictates \u2014 split their tickets, voting for Ms. Bloch for mayor and for Haredi candidates for the City Council. Many more, unwilling to defy rabbinical authority outright, simply did not vote.As the final votes were being tallied early Thursday, one more twist clinched the victory for Ms. Bloch.\u201cShe did what I think most of us thought was impossible,\u201d said Mr. Goldman, of Gesher. \u201cI\u2019m eating my hat with mustard today, and it\u2019s the best meal I\u2019ve had all year.\u201dGabby Sobelman contributed reporting from Rehovot, Israel, and Myra Noveck from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Democrats Can Constrain Trump. They Can Also Overreach. ", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen members of the new Democratic majority take over in January, the president\u2019s power will shrink \u2014 not to nothing but significantly.Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.After Donald Trump won the election in 2016, he was in a position of great power to cut taxes, repeal Obamacare and build border walls to his heart\u2019s content \u2014 if congressional Republicans cooperated. Of course, they didn\u2019t always cooperate, but Mr. Trump was also able to push forward his agenda using the presidency\u2019s unilateral powers \u2014 to deregulate, start trade wars and expel undocumented immigrants \u2014 and his power to appoint conservative judges with the consent of the Senate.That was then. When newly elected members of Congress take their seats in January, creating a Democratic majority in the House, the president\u2019s power will shrink \u2014 not to nothing but significantly.The reason is not that a hostile Congress will block legislation that Mr. Trump seeks. Even without party control of both houses, many presidents employed their unilateral powers and skillful deal-making to score political victories. Ronald Reagan cut taxes, weakened regulations and negotiated historic nuclear arms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union. Bill Clinton pursued his New Democrat vision with a largely Republican-dominated Congress. George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d was almost entirely formulated by the executive branch. Barack Obama pursued several progressive measures \u2014 in the areas of immigration, affirmative action and campus speech \u2014 on his own.Nor is Mr. Trump\u2019s problem impeachment, at least, not in the short term. Removal requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and Republicans will almost certainly not oblige.No, Mr. Trump\u2019s power will shrivel for another reason: the interaction of congressional oversight and his chaotic, divisive and corrupt administration.Congress has so far used its oversight powers reluctantly. Republicans want to protect Mr. Trump, not embarrass him. That will change with Democratic control of the House. Committees will hold hearings on potential election collusion with Russia, of course, but also Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement policies, including family separation, his financial entanglements with the federal government, nepotism in the White House and allegations of corruption in the Trump Organization. Remember Whitewater? That single shady real estate transaction spawned a five-year investigation that consumed much of Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency. President Trump and the Trump Organization have (or so it has been alleged) been involved in dozens if not hundreds of shady transactions.The parade of witnesses will be long. The president seems to expect his aides to corroborate the alternative reality he tweets out in the dead of morning, but they, not he, face perjury convictions if they do. Those witnesses will confirm accounts of dysfunction already leaked to the media, further damaging the president\u2019s standing. Congress will demand to see Mr. Trump\u2019s tax records and other financial documents. The bonanza of information will put him into jeopardy of further criminal investigation as well as civil lawsuits and, of course, bad press.The investigations will also clog the gears of his already notoriously inefficient administration. The subpoenas alone will sap resources and damage morale. While Mr. Trump can still push agencies to deregulate, hold the line on immigration enforcement, raise tariffs and tear up treaties, every action will invite a new congressional inquiry, along with a blizzard of subpoenas and another parade of witnesses if \u2014 as so often seems the case \u2014 it is accompanied by leaks that suggest procedural irregularity, internal disagreement or impropriety.The White House will fight back by claiming executive privilege. This hazy area of the law provides many opportunities for delay, confusion and conflict. But executive privilege cannot be used to disrupt investigations into criminal matters, and most presidents have felt constrained to allow inquiries into serious allegations of unethical conduct. Will Mr. Trump? He could order his subordinates not to answer subpoenas. He could certainly get them to drag their feet. And while Congress could refer those officials to the Justice Department for prosecution for contempt, the department\u2019s longstanding policy is not to prosecute officials who keep silent based on executive privilege. But Congress can go directly to the courts to obtain a declaration that an official is in contempt, and \u2014 in extremis \u2014 arrest and detain him itself. This won\u2019t happen, but expect some tense moments.With or without executive-branch cooperation, Congress will uncover suspicious activities, which it will refer to the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions (or his successor) will be pressured to appoint special counsels. These new Robert Muellers could generate new clashes with the president, whose distrust of the Justice Department will reach new heights. If Mr. Trump survives these conflicts, he will be badly wounded.In existential contests between Congress and the presidency, Congress can\u2019t win without overwhelming public support. The presidency enjoys too many inherent advantages over a clumsy multimember body that is deeply unpopular and divided with conflicts. Mr. Trump can\u2019t be defeated, not until 2020. But if Congress acts wisely, he can be constrained.Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.Advertisement"}

The word is out on the street: \u201cHey, guys, get in line! Trump is giving away free stuff! Just tell him you\u2019re fighting Iran or the Muslim Brotherhood or that you\u2019re a friend of Sheldon Adelson\u2019s, and you get free stuff!\u201dNow Christmas has come early for the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in the form of a get-out-of-jail-free card for his involvement in the murder of moderate Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi was killed by a Saudi hit team, which then reportedly sawed apart his body and dissolved the pieces in acid.The Saudis claim this was a rogue operation that just happened to include key guards and aides of the crown prince. Attention: There has never been a rogue operation by the closest aides and guards of a Saudi leader in the history of Saudi Arabia. Not possible. This is an absolute monarchy. This was ordered from the top.But because one cannot absolutely prove M.B.S. ordered it, Trump has chosen to give M.B.S. a pass, using the same language he did with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is another recipient of Trump\u2019s free stuff. When U.S. intelligence agencies declared that Putin interfered in our 2016 election, Trump said Putin told him that he didn\u2019t do it. Putin\u2019s regime got a slap on the wrist \u2014 a few sanctions \u2014 but nothing remotely as damaging to him as his intervention in our elections was to us.And what did the American people get?

More silence from Putin on what he knows about Trump\u2019s finances or other escapades?As for the Saudis, Trump issued an official statement Tuesday: \u201cKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201dTrump could have told M.B.S.: \u201cI know this came from you. And so you\u2019re not getting a free pass. For starters, you\u2019re going to let every one of these women driving activists that you\u2019ve arrested out of jail; you\u2019re going to announce an immediate, unilateral cease-fire in Yemen \u2014 let the Iranians and Houthis have it and we\u2019ll side with you if they attack from there. You\u2019re going to end this stupid blockade of Qatar, and I expect you to keep taking steps to moderate Saudi Islam and ensure that Salafi-jihadist ideas are not exported to any mosque or madrasa from your country ever again.\u201dThat may be the most crass giveaway of U.S. principles by any president in American history, especially when you consider that the Saudis are unlikely to spend even a small fraction of that, and it would not be in our interest or theirs if they did. But even if they did buy so many arms, what is the intangible damage to our moral standing all over the world from such a grotesque blood-for-money transaction?Tell me that the Saudis decided to buy $450 billion worth of American university scholarships for their young people, or import $450 billion in Western education programs and technical colleges for the whole Arab world, and I might feel differently.Iran and Saudi Arabia are both behaving awfully \u2014 just in different ways and places. It is true, though, that a lot of people have given Iran a pass in recent months because it is anti-Trump and anti-Israel, while the Saudis have become pro-Trump and tacitly aligned with Israel.Did you know that, according to Reuters, on Sept. 28, four days before Khashoggi was murdered in Istanbul, \u201cDanish police shut two major bridges to traffic and halted ferry services from Denmark to Sweden and Germany\u201d \u2014 cutting off Copenhagen from the rest of Denmark and causing massive traffic jams \u2014 \u201cin a nationwide police operation\u201d intended to prevent an attack by an Iranian government agent on an Iranian Arab exile living in Demark? Denmark recalled its ambassador from Tehran over the incident.Did you know that on Oct. 2 \u2014 on the same day Khashoggi was killed \u2014 the BBC reported that \u201cFrench officials say Iran\u2019s ministry of intelligence was behind a plot to bomb a rally of Iranian opposition groups in Paris in June. In a statement, the French government said it had frozen the assets of two senior Iranian officials\u201d?Rather than choosing between bad allies and bad enemies, we should be working frantically to do the one thing that is in our whole country\u2019s security interest, financial interest and moral interest \u2014 launch a Manhattan Project to get America off oil by 2025.It is our addiction to oil that funds so much of the bad behavior out of the Middle East. It is our addiction to oil that forces us to look the other way at a murder most vile.

Neither Ms. Penelton nor Mr. Loughry could be reached for comment.Mark Preisinger, the mayor of Leavenworth, said on Saturday that Mr. Klemp\u2019s remark lacked \u201ccommon decency\u201d and showed he had no filter. But it was hardly the most inappropriate thing Mr. Klemp has said at an official meeting, Mr. Preisinger said.During his speech, Mr. Klemp called Robert E.

{"Headline": "The Retrenchment Election", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNobody is moving, just settling into place.Opinion ColumnistOne of the pleasures and challenges of this job is you do a lot of traveling. I\u2019ve been in 23 states over the last three months. The general impression I get is that I\u2019m not covering a midterm election campaign. I\u2019m covering two separate electorates.The biggest difference is atmospheric. In urban and suburban America, Donald Trump\u2019s outrage du jour is on everybody\u2019s lips: Did you see what he tweeted now? Did you see his racist ad? Where will the Mueller investigation go?In rural America, by contrast, all that stuff is like a thunderstorm in Inner Mongolia. It\u2019s something happening very far away with no particular relevance here, and so no one\u2019s paying much attention. In urban America people talk about Trump constantly. In rural America people generally avoid the subject. Even if 80 percent of the locals support Trump, you never know how somebody will react if you mention his name \u2014 they might call you a racist \u2014 so it\u2019s not a safe topic of conversation.The other big impression I get is that grand canyons now separate different sectors of American society and these canyons are harder and harder to cross.A lot has been said, but few minds have been changed.I\u2019m with Ron Brownstein of CNN and the former Republican representative Tom Davis: This is not a wave election; it\u2019s a realignment election. The results Tuesday will not be shaped by some crest of momentum behind the Democrats. They are going to be shaped by the fact that people are hardening into their categories, and those categories tend to produce a Democratic House and a Republican Senate.The Republicans were saddled with an unpopular president, and the normal thing to do would have been to try to get House races to turn on local issues. But Trump makes everything about himself, and so has nationalized all the races.Congressional elections are now mostly just mini-versions of presidential elections. The quality of any individual candidate matters a lot less, and there\u2019s much less variation in how different candidates are conducting their campaigns.Nationalized politics forces local candidates to act mostly like Trump or Pelosi stand-ins and less like themselves.The one word that the two electorates have in common is \u201cunraveling.\u201d Both groups have a sense that America is unraveling. If you ask them what \u201cissues\u201d matter most, they\u2019ll say health care or immigration. But that\u2019s not the right question to ask, because it doesn\u2019t get at the sense of existential anger and angst that is really driving things.Of course, the two electorates tell entirely different unraveling stories. In rural America, the sources of unraveling are the immigrants (symbolized by the caravan) and the radicalized mobs of educated elites (symbolized by the media). In rural America basic values like hard work, clear gender roles and the social fabric are dissolving before people\u2019s eyes.Urban Americans see the unraveling coming from the rising tide of nativism, the way Trump eviscerates social norms, the underground army of alt-right extremists with guns. If anything, the blue sense of unraveling is more comprehensive.Politics is no longer mainly about disagreeing on issues. It\u2019s about being in entirely separate conversations.The Venn diagram is dead. There\u2019s no overlapping area.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLearning the right lessons from the midterms is key for the party.Mr. Phillips is the author of \u201cBrown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority.\u201dAndrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams, progressive African-American Democratic candidates, may not have won their races for governor in Florida and Georgia (both are still too close to call). But the strategy they followed is still the best strategy for Democrats to win: inspiring, mobilizing and turning out voters of color and progressive whites.I\u2019ve argued for this strategy for years. In my 2016 book, I analyzed Barack Obama\u2019s victories in the context of the country\u2019s changing demographics. The implications of the Gillum and Abrams races are profound (to be clear, I did fund-raising for the efforts to elect both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum, just as I did for Mr. Obama in 2008), and learning the right lessons from 2018 is key for Democrats as they look ahead to the 2020 elections.Over the past 20 years, the best-performing Democratic candidates in statewide elections in Florida and Georgia have been Mr. Obama, Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams. (Hillary Clinton in 2016 was actually Florida\u2019s highest Democratic vote-getter ever.) This year, Ms. Abrams dramatically increased Democratic turnout, garnering more votes \u2014 1.9 million \u2014 than any other Democrat running for any office in the history of Georgia (and that includes Jimmy Carter, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton).Conventional wisdom dictated that both Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams did not give Democrats their best chance; more traditional, moderate white candidates were seen as the most competitive. In this view, moderate candidates can better appeal to and win over \u201cswing\u201d white voters. Or go back to the 2014 Georgia election results. The strategy of wooing supposedly moderate whites was put to the ultimate test when Democrats fielded nominees from two of the most prominent Democratic families in the history of Georgia \u2014 the Carters and the Nunns. Jimmy Carter\u2019s grandson Jason Carter ran for governor, and former Senator Sam Nunn\u2019s daughter Michelle Nunn ran for Senate. Together their campaigns spent more than $20 million, pouring enormous sums into television advertising seeking to persuade moderate whites to back their bids.They each received about 45 percent of the vote. To date, Ms. Abrams has secured 49 percent of the vote and may yet pull off a victory, pending final vote tallies.Or look at last year\u2019s special election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District. Historic sums of money were raised and spent, and the Democrat, Jon Ossoff, still lost to Karen Handel. This year, riding the swell of turnout inspired and organized by Ms. Abrams, the Democrat Lucy McBath flipped that seat.Mr. Gillum took a similar approach and was buoyed by the backing of organizations such as New Florida Majority, which hired community-based canvassers to knock on tens of thousands of their neighbors\u2019 doors to identify and mobilize Gillum supporters long before the rest of the country caught on to his candidacy.Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams did exactly what Mr. Obama did: They inspired people across the racial spectrum to participate and vote, and they did it by being unapologetically progressive. They did not shy away from championing Medicaid expansion, pursuing criminal justice reform and promoting gun control policies.Does this strategy require a candidate of color? No, but it does call for candidates who can inspire voters of color. Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas is an excellent example, and his inspiring and well-organized campaign brought him closer to winning statewide than any Democrat has come in Texas in years. And nationally, the Democrats reclaimed a majority in the House by winning in nearly a dozen districts with large populations of voters of color.Notably, this approach of tackling racism head-on is also the best way to woo many white voters. According to the exit polls, both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum received more support from whites in their states than either Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton did. White people \u2014 all people \u2014 want to believe in something. Challenging them to reject racism and embrace their highest and best ideals is the most effective way to secure their support.Yes, the strategy of mobilizing voters of color and progressive whites is limited by the demographic composition of particular states. But what Mr. Obama showed twice is that it works in enough places to win the White House. And that is exactly the next electoral challenge.Democrats can go the old route that has consistently failed to come close to winning and demoralized supporters down the line, or they can do the math and follow the example of Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum and Mr. Obama before them. Invest in the infrastructure and staffing to engage and mobilize voters. Stand as tall, strongly and proudly for the nation\u2019s multiracial rainbow as Mr. Trump stands against it. And mobilize and call forth a new American majority in a country that gets browner by the hour and will be even more diverse by November 2020.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Melt Thy Rifles Into Garden Tools", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFIXESA Mennonite blacksmith, following his beliefs, seeks a path to reducing the impact of gun violence in America. Ms. Brown is a journalist who splits her time between Oakland, Calif., and New Haven, Conn. The venerable art of blacksmithing is not generally considered to be a radical act. But for Michael Martin, a 36-year-old Mennonite from Colorado Springs, the malleability of glowing metal from a forge\u2019s inferno makes it the perfect vehicle for addressing gun violence.Laurie Works, 29, was 18 years old on Dec. 9, 2007, when a gunman in Colorado Springs randomly opened fire on the family minivan, killing her twin sister, Stephanie, and her younger sister, Rachel. Her father was wounded in the attack.This year, at a rally to ban assault weapons, she stepped up to Mr. Martin\u2019s anvil to hammer the magazine of an AR-15 that would soon become a hoe to coax new growth from the soil. It was a model similar to the gun used in the carnage from which she will never fully recover. But the experience at the anvil \u201cwas transformational,\u201d she said \u2014 literally and psychically. \u201cIt was something tangible,\u201d she explained. \u201cI could feel the tension in my body releasing. A weight was gone.\u201dThe weapons Mr. Martin disarms are typically unwanted firearms donated by individuals, sometimes after the suicide of a loved one. Many also come through police department buyback programs, in which guns are surrendered anonymously, often in exchange for gift items.On a fall morning recently, Mr. Martin and two avuncular mentors, including his father, Fred, set up a pop-up smithy at the entrance to the Police Headquarters in New Haven. They were there at the behest of the Newtown Action Alliance, founded in the aftermath of Sandy Hook. The alliance worked with the police department, Yale-New Haven Hospital, the state\u2019s Department of Correction, and a network of faith leaders to bring a novel idea to fruition: Mr. Martin would teach soon-to-be-released inmates how to make garden tools from 141 guns gathered during a buyback. The resulting implements \u2014 dandelion diggers and spades from handguns, double-sided hoes from thick-barreled assault rifles \u2014 would be used to grow vegetables at two public agricultural high schools and at community gardens throughout the city. Come harvest, the produce would then be donated to city food banks and homeless shelters.That day, with the air acrid from hot metal, four inmate volunteers ranging in age from 26 to 38 donned heat-resistant welding gloves and assembled around a portable forge and anvils affixed to tree stumps. They worked in pairs, a blacksmithing arrangement known as \u201cteam striking\u201d: one partner lifted the molten barrel of a .22 rifle with tongs and held it still on the anvil while the other hammered and shaped the piece, piercing a hole in the center to accommodate a wooden handle.As a Mennonite, Mr. Martin comes from a long tradition of nonviolence and considers his work a form of conscientious objection (\u201craw\u201d is \u201cwar\u201d spelled backward). The first gun he converted into a garden tool came from a friend in Colorado Springs who wanted to get rid of an AK-47 he had bought for protection after the Sept. 11 attacks.Since then, Raw Tools has transformed several hundred guns, with help from a \u201cdisarming network\u201d of volunteer blacksmiths around the country. With the exception of a tattoo on his arm in which \u201cWar No More\u201d is scribbled on a fig, Mr. Martin resembles the tools he makes \u2014 simple, direct and without embellishment. He relies on small grants from local foundations and Mennonite organizations. \u201cOur work,\u201d he said, \u201cis about a cultural shift, to get communities and neighborhoods to rethink the tools they use to keep themselves safe.\u201d But symbols can be powerful, and public rituals can heal. For those who have survived violence or lost loved ones, turning a weapon into a productive tool \u201ccan mark a time in one\u2019s life when violence is behind them and creation in front of them,\u201d Mr. Martin said.In New Haven, the buyback that yielded 141 guns was the police department\u2019s largest since the program began in 2011 \u2014 in large part in response to news of the \u201cSwords to Plows\u201d effort and the involvement of the Newtown Action Alliance.New Haven has a long history of gun violence and was once home to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, makers of automatic rifles. Buybacks contribute to public safety, along with public education about gunlocks and other measures, said Police Chief Anthony Campbell, a graduate of Yale Divinity School who regards his occupation as a ministry. Chief Campbell has dealt with guns beyond his work: Six months after his college graduation and nine days before Christmas, his father committed suicide with the service revolver his mother used in her work as a corrections officer at the Rikers Island prison in New York. Two bullets \u2014 one to the chest, one to the head \u2014 upended his family\u2019s life.Until the tipping point arrives, Mr. Martin will continue to get spikes in requests after every mass shooting from gun owners who want out. Now, in response to the murder in a Pittsburgh synagogue of 11 Sabbath worshipers, he anticipates another. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional decision,\u201d he said of a gun owner\u2019s readiness to part with a weapon. \u201cWe lose that window of opportunity if we can\u2019t get to them in a week.\u201dBefore Mr. Martin arrived in New Haven, a police van loaded with guns from the buyback pulled up to the studio of Gar Waterman, a local metal sculptor. With sparks flying, Mr. Waterman and two activist Episcopal bishops who knew their way around hand saws and hot metal began dismantling the guns, including what Mr. Waterman called \u201ca very cheap AK-47 knockoff.\u201dEncased in coffin-like white cardboard boxes, the guns kept coming in relentless succession. Collectively, of course, they represented a drop in the bucket compared with the more than 300 million guns that are out there. But as James Curry, a retired Episcopal bishop suffragan, observed: \u201cBuckets get filled by drops.\u201dPatricia Leigh Brown, a former reporter at the New York Times, writes on culture and community for The Times and other publications.

{"Headline": "Can Laurene Powell Jobs Save Storytelling?", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHer firm is buying up one media property after another. This week it added Pop-Up Magazine Productions to its roster. Contributing Opinion WriterJust what is Laurene Powell Jobs up to?Over the last few years, Ms. Powell Jobs, an activist, investor and entrepreneur, has been investing in media companies through her social impact firm, Emerson Collective. Buying up a range of unusual properties, she seems to be making an effort to turbocharge storytelling in this fractured digital age.Emerson \u2014 which gets its name from, yes, Ralph Waldo and has focused on education, immigration and the environment since it was formally created in 2011 \u2014 would not disclose the price it paid for Pop-Up. But it\u2019s small compared to the many other investments its for-profit and nonprofit arms have made over the last two years.That includes an undisclosed sum to pick up a majority chunk of The Atlantic magazine, along with funding to add 100 employees, including the New Yorker writer George Packer and a former Facebook executive, Alex Hardiman; starting a documentary production company, Concordia Studio, with the Oscar-winning director Davis Guggenheim; buying a large stake in the production, content and talent management powerhouse Anonymous Content, the maker of \u201cSpotlight\u201d; purchasing another in Macro, which finances media focusing on stories of people of color, like \u201cFences\u201d; and making investments in the online magazine Ozy, the news site Axios and the podcast-making phenom Gimlet Media.Emerson has also sprinkled money all over nonprofit journalism, including at ProPublica, Mother Jones, The Marshall Project, the Committee to Protect Journalists, StoryCorps, Lawfare, Texas Observer and Chalkbeat.It\u2019s a lot, and it seems to be accelerating. Ms. Powell Jobs has $20 billion from the stakes in Apple and Disney that she inherited from her husband, Steve Jobs. She also seems to have inherited his understanding that narrative moves people more than anything else.I asked Peter Lattman, a former New York Times reporter and editor who is now the managing director of media at Emerson, what the firm\u2019s goals are. \u201cBroadly, we invest in and support super high-quality journalism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking at innovative approaches to media and storytelling.\u201dPop-Up is that. Its shows are truly memorable \u2014 they have to be, because they are not taped and never survive except in the memories of the audience present. With a multimedia brew of photos, music, dance and even shadow puppets, the Pop-Up shows have attracted sellout crowds who like its quirky vibe. But it\u2019s not all twee; the shows tackle a wide range of issues that often zero in on the impact of tech on society.Its editor in chief, Doug McGray, said that the company plans to use the new funds \u2014 it has raised $4 million in addition to the Emerson investment \u2014 to expand its Pop-Up business.\u201cI have always been inspired by the idea of making the most ambitious, inventive journalism we can,\u201d Mr. McGray said. \u201cAnd what we get here is to team up with an institution that already understands our value. It\u2019s such a natural alignment.\u201dWhat will be interesting to watch going forward is how the various arms of the Emerson media machine will work together. Both Mr. McGray and Mr. Lattman said that would be a welcome development. Already, Gimlet\u2019s podcast \u201cHomecoming\u201d went on to become the Amazon Prime show starring Julia Roberts, produced by Anonymous Content.\u201cBoth magazines have managed to create unique journalistic platforms that help foster empathy and a better understanding of the world,\u201d she said.I like the idea of that.Advertisement"}

The Cockroach Says \u2018No\u2019 With a Karate Kick.", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bysciencetakeNothing sends people scrambling for a boot faster than the sight of a scurrying cockroach. But to the pests, there are far scarier dangers out there.True terror? That\u2019s getting zombified \u2014 and then eaten alive.When some unlucky American cockroaches encounter the emerald jewel wasp, the wasp delivers a paralyzing sting to the roach\u2019s body. Then, with surgeon-like precision, it injects a mind-altering cocktail into the roach\u2019s brain. The roach, now a zombie slave, is forced to cater to the wasp\u2019s every whim. But the wasp has only one desire: to reproduce.Like a handler leading a horse, the wasp grabs hold of the roach\u2019s antenna and steers it into a hole. There, it lays an egg on the roach that eventually hatches into a hungry larva that chows down on the cockroach. When the baby matures, it bursts from the roach\u2019s chest ready to continue the gruesome ritual.But as Dr. Catania has studied, some roaches defend themselves from the wasps with a swift and powerful karate kick.\u201cIt reminded me in slow motion of one of those old Batman and Robin videos where you see the words \u2018Pow\u2019 appear on the screen,\u201d said Dr. Catania.Roaches\u2019 legs are covered in spikes that act like barbed wire, making the hit extra damaging.Although the strike doesn\u2019t kill the wasp, it makes the attacker back off. Dr. Catania found that 63 percent of the cockroaches that defended themselves were able to avoid getting stung by the wasp. But the roaches that didn\u2019t put up a fight nearly always got stung.Scientists don\u2019t know why not every roach fights back, and Dr. Catania would like to study whether the kick evolved specifically to combat the wasp or as a general method of self-defense. Whatever the answer, it seems that striking the first blow keeps the American cockroach from becoming a mindless zombie.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time to Make the Donates!", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn these turbulent times, charitable clicks are a form of self-soothing as well as generosity.Before the 2016 election, Tess Malone, 28, rarely engaged in charitable giving outside of disaster relief funds or individual GoFundMe fund-raising campaigns. But now, donating \u2014 often in the form of a late-night, anxiety-fueled frenzy \u2014 is as standard an expenditure for her as groceries and dining out.Ms. Malone, who lives in Atlanta and works in communications at Georgia Tech, siphons about $50 from her budget each month toward recurring donations to progressive causes and candidates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Network of Abortion Funds and Planned Parenthood. Ms. Malone wryly describes it as \u201cself-medicating with money,\u201d and for her it started the day after Donald Trump was elected to the presidency.Feeling powerless and unsure of how to help without meddling, Ms. Malone set up another recurring monthly donation, this time to the American Civil Liberties Union. The contribution felt productive, if microscopically so, and helped to assuage an otherwise overwhelming sense of despair. \u201cJust doing one thing, even if it\u2019s donating, feels like at least I did some of my part,\u201d said Ms. Malone, who also canvassed for Stacey Abrams\u2019s campaign for governor in Georgia and regularly volunteers as a patient escort at Planned Parenthood.For Ms. Malone and others reeling from a news cycle that feels like constant crisis mode, flinging money at political and social causes as a knee-jerk response to the headlines has become tantamount to self-care. Anger or fear as motivation for donating isn\u2019t a new phenomenon: Civil and human rights organizations immediately witnessed a so-called Trump bump after the 2016 election, with people like Ms. Malone channeling their shock and frustration by funneling money to political and social causes they felt were in jeopardy under the new administration.Immediately after the announcement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s retirement from the Supreme Court, the National Network of Abortion Funds saw more than 400 people collectively donate nearly $30,000, according Lindsay Rodriguez, the communications director. \u201cAfter news stories that threaten abortion, like the Kennedy retirement, the Kavanaugh hearings and election results recently in Alabama and West Virginia, we see a big surge in people posting on social media that folks should donate to abortion funds and tagging us, and local funds, in those posts,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said.Perhaps the strongest proof of the power of the panic donation transpired in July, when the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (R.A.I.C.ES.), a Texas-based nonprofit, scooped up three times its annual operating budget in a matter of days after a Facebook fund-raiser, days after news of the government\u2019s border separation policy broke.For many, it\u2019s a familiar cycle. News breaks \u2014 a mass shooting, a rolling back of civil rights, a vulnerable minority group in the cross hairs of legislation. Anger and panic ensue. In the face of that mass collective anxiety, social and political activists steer people toward the organizations already working to directly combat the issue at hand. Those panicking, eager to help and perhaps more so to feel slightly less terrible about the world if only for an instant, pull out their credit cards or PayPal passwords and attempt to reclaim their sense of agency by handing over a small sum of cash. Repeat as needed.For those who have the privilege to do so, dispatching 20 bucks to an organization is now as simple as Venmo-ing a friend for brunch, and it\u2019s a small price to pay for alleviating existential despair, if only briefly. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can do late at night from my phone when I\u2019m freaking out,\u201d Ms. Malone said. Unlike marching or volunteering, sending money can be done instantly and at any hour of the day or night, no matter when bad news strikes.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough money to have made any kind of giant difference, but the panic donation is a new reality for our budget,\u201d said Christina Rentz, 39, who lives in Durham, N.C., and works as a label manager at Merge Records. \u201cEvery time something horrible happens, I text my husband and say, \u2018I donated $50 more to the A.C.L.U., because everything is terrible,\u2019 or \u2018I donated to RAICES, because I cried on the way to work today.\u2019\u201d Gun control is an issue that makes Ms. Rentz, a mother of two young boys, feel especially hopeless. Consequently, she donates fairly regularly to Everytown for Gun Safety, though she can\u2019t remember which mass shooting spurred her first donation. \u201cI think it was Parkland, but \u2026 isn\u2019t it terrible that you\u2019re like, \u2018Which school shooting was it?\u2019 Isn\u2019t that horrible?\u201dSending money, Ms. Rentz said, temporarily alleviates that sense of helplessness and overwhelm. \u201cIt sucks to feel like you don\u2019t have any answers, and I think that\u2019s what leads to the panic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, surely someone must know, and maybe it\u2019s these people. \u2018Go forth and find the answers because I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u2019\u201dA similar sentiment has inspired Laurel Snyder and her husband, Chris, to donate to organizations like the A.C.L.U. and the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cWe had to support the institutions that could stand up for those beyond the government,\u201d said Ms. Snyder, 44, who writes children\u2019s books and lives in Atlanta. Ms. Snyder, who grew up canvassing and demonstrating, said she prefers to engage with activism by getting out in the streets, but her husband has become a habitual giver. The couple sees their donations not as a coping mechanism but as a responsibility, to the extent that they have become an unofficial line item on the family\u2019s operating budget. \u201cI feel like, we all didn\u2019t do enough for a really long time, and so we\u2019re sort of trying to pull back that ground,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my head, I have to do this budgeting, like, \u2018All right, I guess we won\u2019t get pizza this week.\u2019\u201dMs. Rentz, who has also donated to KIND Inc., You Can Vote and the N.A.A.C.P. in the last year, said, \u201cI think about it like, what could I spend this money on that\u2019s more important than this? And in that moment, there isn\u2019t anything. What, I\u2019m going to go to the movies another night? What is more important than safety and democracy? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s helping, but just that feeling is worth it to me.\u201dOne of those donors was Sam Swanson of College Park, Md., who had never contributed to the N.R.A. or actively engaged in gun culture until this year. Mr. Swanson, 22, who works in cybersecurity, closely followed the events of Parkland on conservative Reddit boards and was struck by the calls for gun control that ensued in the wake of the shooting. After watching the town hall on gun violence hosted by CNN, he said, he was galvanized to act. He described feeling \u201cdisgusted and angered\u201d by the way the N.R.A. staff was treated at the event, and fearful of potential legislation in response to the shooting. \u201cBut perhaps most of all,\u201d Mr. Swanson said, \u201cI felt a sense of resolve \u2014 a resolve to do something to ensure that my rights are protected and that the rights of millions of others like me are protected.\u201d He gave $30 for a basic N.R.A. membership (and bought his first pistol, a 9 millimeter, shortly thereafter).Mr. Swanson has since continued contributing to various Second Amendment organizations. In May, Maryland passed legislation banning bump stocks; Mr. Swanson reacted by giving $50 to Maryland Shall Issue, which planned to file a suit against the state. Donating to these organizations, he said, makes him feel helpful and hopeful \u2014 and, he added, \u201ca bit more safe, knowing that I\u2019m not alone in fighting for these rights.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the same event spurred an identical response in people on different ends of the political spectrum with irreconcilable perspectives but twinned motivations \u2014 fear, anger, helplessness. Though their political positions are opposite, the cognitive mechanisms are strikingly similar. Ulrich Mayr, a researcher and professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, is the co-author of a study of the neuroeconomics of altruism in 2009, which used brain imaging to track cognitive responses to giving money.\u201cWe basically tracked the reward centers while people see other people being helped, and when that happens, the reward area activity increased,\u201d Dr. Mayr said. That reward center in the brain is the same one that is activated by cocaine or, say, getting a bonus at work. \u201cThe short story is that we found pretty hard evidence that to a considerable degree, people do give because they really want to help other people.\u201d Seeing people better off \u2014 whether your personal definition of \u201cbetter off\u201d involves more or fewer guns, or immigrants, or abortion clinics \u2014 genuinely does make us feel better, and our brains respond by bookmarking it as something it wants to repeat. And thus the cycle continues, as the world spins madly on.Advertisement"}

The horrifying scale of the clergy sexual abuse crisis, as chronicled by a Pennsylvania grand jury report in August that revealed widespread abuse and cover-up over several decades, underscores an obvious but essential point: Bishops can\u2019t be trusted to police themselves.It\u2019s not the first meeting of its kind: 16 years ago, after The Globe\u2019s groundbreaking \u201cSpotlight\u201d investigation, bishops met in Dallas to adopt zero-tolerance policies. Any priest who had abused a minor would be removed. Civilian review boards would investigate claims of clergy misconduct. Those policies led to the removal of hundreds of priests, but the bishops didn\u2019t implement procedures that held themselves to the same standard of accountability. The failure to hold bishops accountable perpetuates a privileged culture of clericalism that lets the hierarchy operate under different rules. Whatever credibility the Catholic Church has left as a voice for justice in public life, the clock is ticking down fast.Standards and systems that prioritize transparency and accountability are essential. But church leaders should also recognize that technical or bureaucratic responses are insufficient to address the urgency of this moment. The Catholic Church faces a profound crisis of legitimacy. This crisis is not only the product of sexual predation. Moving forward, Catholic leaders should be more open to at least discussing a host of thorny issues. The church\u2019s patriarchal culture \u2014 most exemplified in excluding women from the priesthood \u2014 and its teachings about human sexuality and gender are rejected by not only many Americans but also a sizable share of faithful Catholics in the pews. How does the church hope to influence the wider culture when pastors are ignored by many of its own flock?At this dark crossroads for the Catholic Church, there is an opportunity for Pope Francis and the bishops to take a fresh look at the church and begin a prayerful discernment about the limits of patriarchy, human rights for L.G.B.T. people and the exclusion of women from the clergy. These will be uncomfortable but necessary topics to explore if the Catholic Church wants an era of renewal and its leaders hope to reclaim the ability to speak more persuasively to a diverse public square.Church teaching isn\u2019t set by a poll or the shifting winds of popular opinion. At the same time, the church is not a static institution. Doctrine does change and develop. The Second Vatican Council met from 1962 until 1965, a time when bishops opened the windows of the church to the modern world. The council brought historic changes in the way Catholicism understood democracy, the Jewish faith, the role of lay Catholics, interfaith dialogue and liturgy. The question isn\u2019t whether the church should stay the same or change. Paradoxically, the church has always done both. The more essential question is whether a 2,000-year-old institution that thinks in centuries can once again stand with a foot firmly planted in the best of its tradition while stepping into the future renewed and relevant to a new generation.John Gehring, the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life, is the author of \u201cThe Francis Effect: A Radical Pope\u2019s Challenge to the American Catholic Church.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kolkata, a Love of Literature, Fried Street Food and, Mostly, Sweets", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byfrugal travelerThis city is more relaxed than some of its modern Indian counterparts, and residents claim a strong relationship to its colonial past. India\u2019s rivers are central to the life of its people and the Hooghly River, a 160-mile branch of the Ganges that runs through the city of Kolkata in West Bengal, is no different. In the late afternoon, I walked to Babu Ghat, and onto the broad concrete slipway that descended into the water, where a few moored boats bobbed slowly and men and children bathed in underclothes. The sticky heat had finally begun to break and people were out sitting on the banks of the Hooghly, chatting, eating, or just watching the sun glitter on the water as it began its descent. A young man approached me and, apropos of nothing, asked if I liked Kolkata. When I replied yes, he nodded and said, \u201cKolkata is the heart of India.\u201dAfter four days in Kolkata (or the Anglicized \u201cCalcutta\u201d), the capital of West Bengal and known by the nickname, City of Joy, it was difficult to argue. Kolkata, a city strongly associated with British rule and the East India Company, has a fascinating relationship with its colonial history. With a rich literary tradition and strong educational institutions, Kolkata also has a more relaxed and peaceful feel than some of India\u2019s other modern metropolises. Combined with spicy Bengali cuisine and a love of fried street food, it proved a rewarding place to explore \u2014 and naturally, I managed to keep my budget in check.My comfortable room ($27 per night) in the Ballygunge area of the city was centrally located and ideal for exploring the rest of the city. I rented the room through Airbnb, which I use judiciously. When traveling solo, I\u2019ll typically rent a room in a family\u2019s home: In many instances, hosts have happily clued me in on things to see and do. One tip: Click on the host\u2019s profile picture to see how many properties they have listed. If I see that a host is managing a large number of places, I may choose to stay elsewhere \u2014 I\u2019m more interested in using Airbnb as a cultural exchange than as a hotel.My hosts, Saroj and her daughter, Mrinalini, knew their city well and were happy to offer insight. They both loved the intellectual curiosity and open-mindedness of the city. \u201cCalcutta is laid back, old world, colonial. People have time; it\u2019s a little easier,\u201d said Mrinalini. \u201cIn Bengali culture, women are generally considered equal,\u201d she added, compared to places like Delhi. \u201cIn some cases they\u2019re actually considered superior: It\u2019s very progressive. I didn\u2019t even think about being feminist because I never needed to be.\u201dWithin the Victoria Memorial\u2019s magnificent marble walls are some interesting artifacts and exhibitions. \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Eye: India 1770-1835\u201d has a number of handsome paintings from the likes of Thomas Daniell and Tilly Kettle, who arrived in India in the 1760s and was one of the first prominent English painters to work in the country. On the other side of the exhibition hall, a more intriguing exhibit catalogs the timeline of British colonial rule in India through photos, prints and historical relics.I was mulling over those words when I struck up a conversation on the street with Aradhana Kumar Swami, a teacher who was picking up his wife and buying supplies in Kolkata before embarking on a 40-hour train journey home to the Kerala region. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he responded, when I asked if there was any lingering resentment toward the British. \u201cWe have no problem with the British.\u201d Some people, he said, had an issue with the opulent Victoria Monument, however. Queen Victoria, he said, never once visited the city. \u201cThat could have been a school or something,\u201d he said, and shook his head.The energy from the protest carried over to the book market, probably the largest collection of books I\u2019ve ever seen in one place. Piles of books of all kinds \u2014 from engineering to Shakespeare to Dan Brown \u2014 spilled over from roadside stalls onto the street. I saw one barefoot vendor precariously negotiating his wares as if he were a mountain climber, looking for a particularly hard-to-find volume.Security is tight at the temple \u2014 no photos are allowed, and you\u2019ll have to check your cellphone, too (3 rupees), as well as your shoes (2 rupees). I joined a long queue of worshipers carrying gifts of money and flowers and got a peek at the Sri Sri Jagadiswari Kalimata Thakurani idol, bright red tongue visible and a foot placed onto a man\u2019s chest. I asked a stranger if he could tell me more about the significance of the idol, and he simply replied, \u201cMother!\u201dI spent hours walking the streets of Kolkata, and found this to be the best way to get to know the city. I worked up a decent appetite, naturally, and fortunately found a number of good options right there on the street. A deep love of Chinese cuisine pervades the city, as is evidenced by the number of stalls selling 30-rupee plates of fried chow mein noodles. I walked up and down Circus Avenue near my lodgings and indulged in another favorite, crunchy fried pakora made from chickpea flour (20 rupees) and sprinkled with spicy salt. Generous 10-rupee cups of spicy, milky tea are nearly omnipresent.A word about street food: Be careful. A nasty stomach bug can potentially ruin a trip. If you\u2019re going to risk it, look for places to eat that are busy and churning out food \u2014 it\u2019s a good way to ensure it\u2019s fresh. Be wary of fresh produce and raw food items, and don\u2019t drink things that contain ice. The tea on the street, however, is frequently kept at a rolling boil, making it safer than some of your other options. If you have doubts, don\u2019t eat it.It turns out that Kolkata, in addition to being India\u2019s cultural heart, also has a fierce sweet tooth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rough Drafts of Richard Feynman\u2019s Ideas Head to Auction", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe scribblings of a brilliant 20th-century physicist show that he did not get everything right on the first try, either.Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for key insights in understanding the quantum version of electromagnetism, and the medal and citation that came with it is the centerpiece of the auction, conducted by Sotheby\u2019s in New York. But the assorted writings that are also for sale by his family reveal clues into how he worked and thought.\u201cWe tend to have this idea of genius being someone who just sprung out of the womb and had these magical capabilities,\u201d said Cassandra Hatton, the specialist at Sotheby\u2019s in New York who is overseeing the auction. \u201cAnd Feynman himself denied that fact. He always said, \u2018Guys, there\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s no magic here. I\u2019m just somebody who\u2019s very interested and worked very hard and was very curious.\u2019\u201d During World War II, Feynman was part of the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. The physicists in Los Alamos, N.M., where the secret atomic research was conducted, were worried that workers producing plutonium in Oak Ridge, Tenn., were not heeding safety precautions. They wanted to explain the science of why the material was so dangerous. Feynman, in his 20s, flew to Oak Ridge to give the talk. Some of these pages may have been notes from that talk. Others may be versions he revised later for other talks to other audiences. Feynman, who died in 1988, donated his archive of scientific papers to the California Institute of Technology, where he spent much of his career. The papers offered at auction by his family are the leftovers, the scraps, the rough drafts. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not valuable, Ms. Hatton said.\u201cI think they\u2019re more important because they let us see how he got from A to Z,\u201d she said. \u201cThey show us the steps. They show us the little mistakes and the things he crossed out and where he changed his mind and what he decided to refine.\u201dWhile some people are very particular about a pen or type of paper, Feynman usually grabbed whatever was closest and started scribbling, usually without noting a title, date or place. That made it challenging to organize the papers as sometimes he continued his thought on a different colored piece of paper with a different pen.The written scribble on this sheet include the \u201cFeynman diagrams\u201d that he developed to quickly summarize a subatomic interaction with lines and squiggles.A few of Feynman\u2019s sketches are interspersed among his notes. Included in the auction are books from Feynman\u2019s library, including a textbook written by Paul Dirac, another giant of 20th-century physics. Feynman wrote comments in the margins. \u201cAnalyze this some day,\u201d he wrote on one page. In recent years, Feynman\u2019s reputation as a womanizer has led some critics to re-evaluate his academic legacy. Some of his behavior, like dating undergraduates, would likely be grounds for academic sanction today.For the mathematical notations on this particular place mat, \u201cWe couldn't tie it to any specific problem,\u201d Ms. Hatton said. \u201cIt seems almost like he was just playing around.\u201dIn his book \u201cSurely You\u2019re Joking, Mr. Feynman,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI\u2019d sit in one of the booths and work a little physics on the paper place mats with the scalloped edges, and sometimes I\u2019d draw one of the dancing girls or one of the customers, just to practice.\u201dOne of Feynman\u2019s most famous talks was \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d in 1959, which predicted the advent of nanotechnology, creating machines at the scale of molecules. This document, above, was found among the papers that the family had. It appears to have been prepared for a version of the talk given at El Camino College in California. Feynman was also well known as a lecturer, striving to find the clearest way to explain a difficult concept. Outside of physics, Feynman did magic and played bongo drums. This is a tambourine that Feynman bought in Brazil. He taught himself Portuguese and how to play the tambourine in a samba band.Feynman was not happy about the 4 a.m. phone call that he had won a Nobel. He complained about being woken up and hung up. He later recounted in \u201cSurely You\u2019re Joking\u201d:Then I began to think, \u2018How can I turn this all off? I don\u2019t want any of this!\u2019 So the first thing was to take the telephone off the hook\u2026. I went down to the study to think: What am I going to do? Maybe I won\u2019t accept the Prize. What would happen then? Maybe that\u2019s impossible\u2026.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now he\u2019s being sued by the Winklevoss twins.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the last year, Charlie Shrem, a 28-year-old Bitcoin investor, has bought two Maseratis, two powerboats \u2014 one of them 32 feet long \u2014 and a $2 million house in Florida, along with smaller pieces of real estate.Mr. Shrem, who had been the chief executive of Bitinstant, one of the first prominent Bitcoin businesses in the United States, has said in recent interviews that he went to prison with almost no money.So where did the money for the expensive toys come from? That\u2019s what two former business partners want to know.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who turned money from a settlement with Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg into a Bitcoin fortune, said they suspected Mr. Shrem had actually been spending Bitcoin that he owed them since 2012, according to a lawsuit unsealed in federal court on Thursday. The Bitcoin would be worth around $32 million at current prices.\u201cEither Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or \u2014 more likely \u2014 he \u2018acquired\u2019 his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole from\u201d the Winklevoss twins in 2012, the lawsuit says.The judge who oversaw Mr. Shrem\u2019s earlier trial has already agreed to freeze some of Mr. Shrem\u2019s financial assets, according to court documents.The lawsuit could blossom into an ever bigger problem for Mr. Shrem because an affidavit filed in court suggests that Mr. Shrem has also not paid the government $950,000 in restitution that he agreed to as part of his 2014 guilty plea.Mr. Shrem\u2019s lawyer, Brian Klein, said in a statement that the claims by the Winklevoss brothers were baseless. \u201cThe lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of Bitcoins,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name.\u201d.The lawsuit from the twins threatens another reversal of fortune for Mr. Shrem, who went from being one of the earliest Bitcoin millionaires to being called Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cfirst felon.\u201dOver the last year, though, Mr. Shrem has already gotten involved with a number of troubled projects.But those are likely to be mere headaches compared with what he could face in a confrontation with the Winklevoss twins. Mr. Shrem helped get the brothers interested in Bitcoin in 2012 and became their first adviser in the young industry.The twins asked Mr. Shrem to help them amass the beginnings of what would become an enormous stockpile of cryptocurrencies, giving him $750,000 to buy Bitcoin from other deep-pocketed investors.A few months into this partnership, the twins said, they realized that Mr. Shrem had not given them all the Bitcoin they were due. The brothers gave Mr. Shrem $250,000 in September 2012, but the lawsuit says that a month later, he delivered only around $189,000 worth of Bitcoin at the going price, which was around $12.50.The 5,000 or so missing Bitcoins became a point of tension between the twins and Mr. Shrem. They asked him numerous times for an accounting of the Bitcoins he had purchased and eventually brought in an accountant who documented the missing funds, according to court documents.\u201cI have been patient, and at this point it\u2019s getting a bit absurd,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss wrote to Mr. Shrem in 2013 in an email quoted in the lawsuit. \u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly.\u201dThe missing Bitcoins, which were worth 98 percent less at the time, appeared to have been forgotten in a broader battle between the brothers and Mr. Shrem over an investment in Bitinstant.In 2013, Bitinstant fell apart, and the twins blocked Mr. Shrem\u2019s efforts to revive the company with new investors because of their concerns about his management style. By the time Mr. Shrem was arrested in 2014, as a result of activities at Bitinstant that took place before the brothers invested, they had cut off contact with him.Cameron Winklevoss said that he and his brother decided to pursue the missing Bitcoins again after they saw Mr. Shrem\u2019s recent spending patterns.\u201cWhen he purchased $4 million in real estate, two Maseratis and two powerboats, we decided it was time to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Mr. Winklevoss told The New York Times.The brothers hired an investigator, who found that 5,000 Bitcoins were transferred in 2013 through addresses associated with Mr. Shrem and onto the Bitcoin wallet services Xapo and Coinbase, according to the complaint. The investigator traced the money on the blockchain, the public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded.Jed S. Rakoff, a judge in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, approved an application the twins made in September to freeze any funds that Mr. Shrem holds with those companies. Judge Rakoff wrote in his order that Mr. Shrem had \u201cevidenced an intent to frustrate the collection efforts of his creditors.\u201dThe court fight could cause problems for Mr. Shrem\u2019s latest venture, Crypto.IQ. The company, which promises market intelligence to Bitcoin traders, is holding a conference for customers in Las Vegas this month promising \u201cunparalleled insights from a roster of experts at the very epicenter of the crypto universe.\u201d\u201cMy personal life goes through bull and bear markets, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the key is how to deal with it when you\u2019re in the bear markets.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a podcast on which Charlie Shrem appeared. It is \u201cDeath, Sex and Money,\u201d not \u201cLove, Sex and Money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Want to Feed the Hungry? Lovely. Let\u2019s See Your Permit.", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 They unfurled colorful blankets on a grassy slope, and unloaded steaming trays of corn dogs, baked beans and vegetable beef soup. Every week for the past three years, the volunteers have gone to a park just outside downtown Kansas City with home-cooked meals for the homeless. They call it a picnic with friends.But on a cloudy afternoon earlier this month, an inspector from the Kansas City Health Department showed up and called it something else: an illegal food establishment.She ordered most of the food put into black garbage bags, bundled them on the grass and, in a move that stunned the gathered group, doused the pile with bleach.Allen Andrews, who has been living on the streets for the past year, said he watched silently as the bleach was poured, thinking back to when he had a home. He remembered how he had sometimes poured bleach on trash he put out for collection, to deter rodents from getting into it.\u201cThey treat us like animals,\u201d Mr. Andrews, 46, said.As the nation prepared for one of its biggest holiday feasts in a season of giving, a bitter fight has emerged in this city over who is permitted to help the hungry and how they may do it.On one side are city officials, who say they\u2019re merely concerned about the safety of donated food; on the other, the volunteers, who consider the city\u2019s food-sharing regulations heartless technicalities whose real purpose is to discourage homeless people from congregating.\u201cHomeless folks are more at risk of food-borne illness because of the challenges they are living under,\u201d said Rex Archer, director of the health department. \u201cFeeding them an unsafe meal, they actually will be lucky if they\u2019re able to get an ambulance and get to the hospital.\u201dBut Free Hot Soup volunteers and their supporters have said the city\u2019s cleanliness concerns are just a cover. In reality, they said, the city wanted to break up large gatherings of homeless people, bowing to the demands of some residents.The volunteers said their model for feeding hungry people is incompatible with permitting requirements, in large part because the approximately 100 volunteers who now prepare meals in their homes would be required to cook in commercial kitchens instead. The group considers its gatherings more akin to church barbecues or family reunions than to public events that require permits.\u201cThis is about anti-homeless-people, anti-poor-people policy,\u201d said Quinton Lucas, a city councilman who is running for mayor of Kansas City.Mr. Andrews, who said he lost his job and has been unable to find anything steadier than cleaning bathrooms at the Kansas City Royals\u2019 stadium during baseball season, says the Free Hot Soup meals are perfectly safe. \u201cI\u2019ve been eating from them a whole year, I haven\u2019t been sick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cook it with love.\u201dNo documented cases of people getting sick from Free Hot Soup\u2019s food have been reported, but the risks of foodborne illness from charitable meals are real, food safety experts said.\u201cJust getting access to food is one thing, but we want to make sure it\u2019s handled safely,\u201d said Mitzi D. Baum, the managing director of food safety at Feeding America, a hunger relief organization with food banks across the country.In Kansas City, neither side appeared to be backing down. City officials said they would continue to shut down Free Hot Soup gatherings (though they said they would not be bleaching the food anymore, an act that made headlines and drew outrage). The group\u2019s gatherings resumed on Sunday, but city inspectors stayed away, saying they wanted to give the group a chance to comply with the health requirements.At a downtown park, volunteers for Free Hot Soup did things differently this time: At the urging of a Facebook post, they ordered food from restaurants to be delivered to the park, a tactic that complied with the city\u2019s rules.But volunteers at Prospect Plaza Park, where the bleach had been dumped this month, were defiant, showing up with home-cooked turkey casserole and fajitas.\u201cPeople over permits,\u201d a poster read. \u201cAccess to food is a human right,\u201d the T-shirt of an organizer, Spring Wittmeier, said.Legal observers from the American Civil Liberties Union were on hand, as were new volunteers inspired by the news of the bleaching. Michael Garahan drove two hours from Emporia, Kan., where he is a chef at an Emporia State University sorority house, bringing a pot of gumbo and his food handler\u2019s license.Kansas City has 43 organizations with permits to feed the homeless, according to Troy Schulte, the Kansas City manager. But some homeless people have complained about safety issues and onerous restrictions at some of those operations. Mr. Schulte said he would have no problem with Free Hot Soup\u2019s gatherings if the group obtained a proper permit, but he acknowledged that the city\u2019s concerns extended beyond food safety.\u201cA lot of neighborhoods are now seeing this as, \u2018Well, they\u2019re feeding the homeless and then the homeless are sticking around in my neighborhood,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schulte said. \u201cThey\u2019re calling the city, asking for us to help deal with it. We\u2019re focusing police resources on those types of issues because it\u2019s a huge quality-of-life issue in our neighborhoods.\u201dFor now, much of the debate has focused on the bleaching incident in Prospect Plaza Park on Nov. 4. According to the city, after the inspector confiscated the food, volunteers threatened to take it back out of the trash bags and serve it, so that was why she poured bleach on it. Volunteers said no such threats were made, and the inspector\u2019s written report from that day did not mention any.\u201cThey made a big splash, and their intentions were to scare us off so that we wouldn\u2019t come back,\u201d Ms. Wittmeier said. \u201cI have a right to go hang out in a public park and share food.\u201dAs it was, the health inspector left the bleach-covered bags in the park.Judy Smith, a homeless woman who said she has struggled with mental illness, said she rummaged through the mess after everyone else had left. She found some sandwiches that were in Ziploc bags and untouched by the bleach, she said, so she ate them.\u201cWhy waste food that\u2019s still good?\u201d she said.Follow John Eligon on Twitter: @jeligonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stolen Picasso Buried in the Woods? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Six years after thieves made off with seven celebrated works of art in a brazen nighttime raid at a Dutch museum, an author who wrote a book about the heist said she received an anonymous tip.One of the stolen paintings, a Picasso, was buried under a rock in Romania, the letter said.Was the lead too good to be true?Mira Feticu, a Dutch-Romanian author based in the Netherlands, quickly informed the Dutch police about the letter she received on Nov. 6, pointing to the location of Picasso\u2019s \u201cT\u00eate d\u2019Arlequin\u201d (\u201cHarlequin Head\u201d). But she said she did not hear back from them.So she and a colleague, Frank Westerman, flew to Romania to find out if the letter\u2019s claim was genuine, she said. They landed in Bucharest, the capital, and drove for more than three hours this past weekend to a spot near a village to discover what they hoped would be the missing Picasso.But on Saturday, following the instructions she had been given, Ms. Feticu unearthed what looked like the Picasso.\u201cIt was buried in a woods not far away from the village of Carcaliu, where the thieves were from,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI was told to walk 450 meters down a path and find some markings on a tree. And then a second tree nearby has a red symbol on it. There, under a rock, we found the painting, wrapped in plastic just under the soil. I cried when I saw it.\u201dShe and Mr. Westerman returned to Bucharest with the painting and got help from the Dutch Embassy to turn it over to the Romanian authorities.The discovery was just one more twist \u2014 and not the last \u2014 in the strange saga of the stolen paintings and drawings, whose cumulative worth was said to range from 18 million to 100 million euros, or as much as $115 million.In addition to the Picasso, the theft included works by Monet, Matisse, Gauguin, Lucian Freud and Meyer de Haan. Dutch news media labeled it \u201cthe theft of the century.\u201dSo the recovery of even one of the paintings would be a stunning break in a long-running mystery.But what were the odds the thieves would leave a Picasso under a rock?The stolen paintings had been part of the collection of the Dutch investor Willem Cordia and had been on display for just one week at the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam, when they were taken.Peter van Beveren, who curated the collection from 2007 to 2011, was suspicious about the unearthed painting\u2019s authenticity. \u201cI have my doubts,\u201d he said bluntly by phone on Sunday from The Hague.\u201cI have studied some of the images put on the net, and I see very big differences,\u201d he said. \u201cI see lines that are different in thickness, ease of drawing, lines of the shoulder.\u201dThe 2012 heist shook the art world and raised questions about the security of museums in Europe.Then Ms. Feticu received the mysterious letter. Why was she chosen to unveil its recovery? She surmised it might be because of her book on the theft, as well as a Romanian-language interview she gave in May, which received a lot of coverage in Romania.Ms. Feticu initially said she believed that the painting was real, but admitted that it could easily be a fake. \u201cI have no idea who sent the letter to me, and maybe it is just a bad joke,\u201d she said earlier on Sunday. \u201cWe will see.\u201dDutch officials confirmed portions of the tale. Annemijn van den Broek, a spokeswoman for the country\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Sunday, \u201cI can confirm that the piece was handed over by a third party to the Romanian authorities, and that this happened in the residence of the Dutch ambassador in Bucharest.\u201d\u201cThe painting, which is part of a batch of seven paintings stolen in 2012 from a Dutch museum, is in the custody of the Romanian authorities and will be authenticated,\u201d the statement added.The next step, the authorities said, was to authenticate the work of art. The painting was to be delivered to the National Museum of Art of Romania in Bucharest on Monday in order to be examined by experts, according to local news reports.It was all fake, the group said: It had buried the phony painting in the woods as part of a continuing project, according to Ms. Feticu.\u201cWe don\u2019t know much,\u201d she said on Sunday night, adding, \u201cI feel angry and sad if this is true.\u201dWhy do it?It was no publicity stunt, the group insisted. \u201cThe purpose of our intervention was to show how the \u2018T\u00eate d\u2019Arlequin\u2019 could find its way back into the original Triton collection,\u201d the statement said. The aim was \u201cto find out at which point in the process things would falter, with whom and why. The work is one of the story lines of a performance, which as a whole focuses on the value of truth. What is real and what is not?\u201dThe director of the Kunsthal Museum, Emily Ansenk, said in a statement on Monday: \u201cWe are firm believers in artistic freedom, even when it concerns such a sensitive subject for us, and we hope that the theater makers reached their intended goal with this initiative. That said, we would have found it even better if the work by Picasso had actually been found undamaged.\u201dRomanian officials have declined to comment about the latest twist: A performance art group says they have in their possession a genuine fake Picasso.Advertisement"}

John Roberts reveals about the Republic.Opinion ColumnistGenerally, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter beefs are an expense of spirit and a waste of breath. But a minority of them are genuinely edifying, and illustrations of his likely world-historical role \u2014 which is not to personally bring down our constitutional republic, but to reveal truths about our political situation, through his crudeness and goading of others, that might be harbingers of the Republic\u2019s eventual end.The Official Washington response to this beef was to accuse Trump of once again degrading important constitutional norms \u2014 which in a sense his attack on the idea that judges\u2019 legitimacy transcends the partisan origins of their appointments obviously did.\u201cI don\u2019t agree very often with Chief Justice Roberts, especially his partisan decisions which seem highly political on Citizens United, Janus, and Shelby. But I am thankful today that he \u2014 almost alone among Republicans \u2014 stood up to President Trump and for an independent judiciary.\u201dRead these sentences over a few times, and relish their internal contradictions. John Roberts is to be commended for standing up for an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d Schumer suggests, so long as he is attacking President Trump. But when he is issuing rulings with which Schumer disagrees, he is a \u201cpartisan\u201d and \u201chighly political\u201d and a \u201cRepublican.\u201dSave for the pious tone there is little practical difference between this intervention and Trump\u2019s rants about \u201cObama judges.\u201d Which in turn suggests that in the case of Trump v. Roberts, our president is mostly just exposing a degradation that already exists, acknowledging a truth of our constitutional order that\u2019s badly disguised by official-D.C. politesse.To that centuries-old tension the last few decades have added several more. The growth of partisan polarization has increased the potential ideological hostility between the branches, and raised the perceived stakes of presidential elections and high court appointments both.Meanwhile, the liberal ambitions of the Warren Court and the expanded powers of the Cold War presidency made both branches considerably more imperial relative to both Congress and the states, and neither trend has been substantially reversed. Instead the political abdication of the Congress, the steady atrophy of legislative power and flight from legislative responsibility, means that America is increasingly governed by negotiations between the imperial presidency and whichever philosopher-king has the swing vote on the court.A dual imperialism is still a separation of power, and a decaying republic with two emperors by definition does not have its Caesar or Augustus yet. Nor are we about to get one: Because Trump is too politically weak to win a stark confrontation with the Supreme Court, and Roberts is temperamentally modest and consensus-oriented, their Twitter beef is an illumination of reality, rather than a step into crisis. So there is time for an anti-imperial rebalancing, in which a more assertive Congress somehow brings us back into constitutional equilibrium.But if Congress prefers abdication, a two-emperor system isn\u2019t built to last. Come a crisis, one (probably the one that commands the military and law enforcement) must be master, the other must submit. That\u2019s the important message of Trump v. Roberts. Let those with ears, hear.Advertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, won the five New York City counties, as well as Rockland and Westchester, but lost Putnam. Letitia James, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, won all four suburban counties bordering Putnam, but lost Putnam.The contrast was even more dramatic for Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who captured every county along the Hudson River and beyond, all the way to the Canadian border \u2014 except for Putnam.The county seems like a curious outlier, a land that Democrats forgot along the Metro-North line, a place that, at its southernmost point, is roughly 50 miles to the New York City border and yet a world away.Republicans, who outnumber registered Democrats in Putnam by about 3,000 people, have dominated politics there for decades; the only Democratic presidential candidate to win Putnam County in the last century was Lyndon B. Johnson.Ms. Fleming, who unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for county executive this year, and Ms. Croft, the county\u2019s Democratic elections commissioner, know what they are up against. But you don\u2019t have to be a politician to understand how the political dynamics can shape their lives.\u201cAs a general rule, I do avoid talking about politics because the majority of the people that live here are highly conservative, and their viewpoints are very different from mine,\u201d said Paula Bryan, a county resident who said she had been harassed in Facebook groups.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel like they can\u2019t come over because of the way that we feel,\u201d she added, noting that she has two children in the Brewster school district. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want people to not invite me over because they think I\u2019m some hippie liberal.\u201dThese demographics combined with a lack of urban centers, residents say, shape the politics of the county.\u201cI think the people in Putnam County really like what\u2019s going on here,\u201d said MaryEllen Odell, the Republican county executive who defeated Ms. Fleming in the November election. \u201cThey like the fact that crime is low. They like the fact that schools are performing. Students are doing well. Seniors are very well taken care of.\u201dMs. Odell also pointed to historical trends to explain Republicans\u2019 dominance in politics. She said that many public safety workers, particularly police officers and firefighters, moved to Putnam County in the 1960s from places like the Bronx, Queens and southern Westchester.Ms. Odell said the values of Putnam County were captured in her campaign platform: supporting seniors, respecting veterans and delivering services to taxpayers.See full results and maps from the New York midterm elections.Gun rights, she said, are also paramount in a county where hunting is popular. \u201cIt\u2019s generational,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about tradition, and it\u2019s about family values.\u201dBut some Democrats say the emphasis on tradition serves to exclude and divide residents, particularly newcomers and minorities.Melinda Montanaro, a Southeast resident, said that when she ran for local office last year as a Democrat, a voter told her to downplay her Puerto Rican background.\u201cSome people around here may not like that,\u201d Ms. Montanaro said she was told.Kathleen E. Foley, who managed Ms. Fleming\u2019s county executive campaign, said the lack of diversity \u2014 ethnic and economic \u2014 contributes to a sense of exclusivity.\u201cThere is the issue of a mentality that says I\u2019m escaping the bad that\u2019s happening in the city and I\u2019m coming up here to my lily-white community,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it has been mostly lily white.\u201dAnd yet, there seem to be signs of change.The number of new registered Democrats in the county is outpacing new registered Republicans. And this year, a Democrat in Phillipstown, a left-leaning town in Putnam, won a seat on the County Legislature, which had previously been all Republican.A Democrat also won the countywide sheriff\u2019s election last year, ousting a 16-year Republican incumbent who lost a defamation lawsuit after he accused the district attorney of interfering with a rape investigation.And with these changes, some residents say, divisions between longtime residents and newcomers have intensified.In Brewster, for example, other debates have raged \u2014 at school board meetings and in Facebook groups \u2014 over issues of student residency fraud, a topic that some say has become increasingly politicized.Last year, after concerns were raised regarding ineligible students attending Brewster schools, the school district conducted a residential reverification process, requiring all parents to provide proof of residency.Some residents argued allegations of residency fraud were thinly veiled racism, targeting Brewster because of its sizable Latino population.\u201cParents were complaining that there were a lot of children coming into the school district that didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Ms. Bryan, adding, \u201cIt was a very sly direct sort of shot at the immigrant population.\u201dProponents of the reverification disputed that notion, arguing the process was necessary because of lax enforcement in the past.\u201cThe verification process has nothing to do with race, religion or creed,\u201d said Wendy Lewis, who has had five children in the Brewster school system. \u201cThe only requirement is that you live in the district.\u201dThe school district has yet to identify any students who are not residents of Brewster, a spokeswoman for the school district said, but added that the re-registration process was still going on.Earlier this year, a raffle was held to benefit the Kent Volunteer Fire Department, with a Windham AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a 20-gauge shotgun slated as two of the prizes.Advertisement"}

Liars?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 Things We\u2019d Really Like to KnowFor better and worse, humans are only improving their ability to deceive themselves with technology.During the summer before the 2016 presidential election, John Seymour and Philip Tully, two researchers with ZeroFOX, a security company in Baltimore, unveiled a new kind of Twitter bot. By analyzing patterns of activity on the social network, the bot learned to fool users into clicking on links in tweets that led to potentially hazardous sites.The bot, called SNAP_R, was an automated \u201cphishing\u201d system, capable of homing in on the whims of specific individuals and coaxing them toward that moment when they would inadvertently download spyware onto their machines. \u201cArchaeologists believe they\u2019ve found the tomb of Alexander the Great is in the U.S. for the first time: goo.gl/KjdQYT,\u201d the bot tweeted at one unsuspecting user.Even with the odd grammatical misstep, SNAP_R succeeded in eliciting a click as often as 66 percent of the time, on par with human hackers who craft phishing messages by hand.A neural network can learn to recognize a dog by gleaning patterns from thousands of dog photos. It can learn to identify spoken words by sifting through old tech-support calls.And, as the two researchers showed, a neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets, Reddit posts, and previous online hacks.And a few we\u2019d rather not discuss\u201cIt would be very surprising if things don\u2019t go this way,\u201d said Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. \u201cAll the trends point in that direction.\u201dExperts have long had the power to doctor audio and video. But as these A.I. systems improve, it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content \u2014 images, videos, social interactions \u2014 that look and sound like the real thing.Inspired by the culture of academia, the top A.I. labs and even giant public companies such as Google openly publish their research and, in many cases, their software code.With these techniques, machines are also learning to read and write. For years, experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language. But the tide has shifted in recent months.This technology could improve phishing bots such as SNAP_R. Today, most Twitter bots seem like bots, especially when you start replying to them. In the future, they will respond in kind.Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, can see a not-too-distant future in which governments create machine-learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries, or force views onto their own people.\u201cThis is a new kind of societal control or propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments can start to create campaigns that target individuals, but at the same time operate across many people in parallel, with a larger objective.\u201dIdeally, artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation. Mark Zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities. But for the foreseeable future, we face a machine-learning arms race.Consider generative adversarial networks, or GANs. These are a pair of neural network systems that can automatically generate convincing images or manipulate existing ones.The second network does its best not to be fooled. As the pair battle, the image only gets more convincing \u2014 the A.I. trying to detect fakery always loses.Detecting fake news is even harder. Humans can barely agree on what counts as fake news; how can we expect a machine to do so? And if it could, would we want it to?Perhaps the only way to stop misinformation is to somehow teach people to view what they see online with extreme distrust. But that may be the hardest fix of them all.\u201cWe can deploy technology that patches our computer systems,\u201d Mr. Avin said. \u201cBut we cannot deploy patches to peoples\u2019 heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perversion of Fiscal Policy (Slightly Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAusterity in a slump, stimulus in a boom.Opinion ColumnistAs many people have pointed out, the Trump tax represented a total break with the normal principles of fiscal policy. Historically, we\u2019ve tended to run big deficits when the economy is weak, smaller deficits or surpluses when it\u2019s strong. But now the deficit is soaring even in the face of low unemployment. This is irresponsible, and shows that Republican handwringing over deficits was always phony \u2013 which some of us pointed out at the time.But something that has been pointed out less is that this is actually part of a broader story: fiscal policy has been off the rails since 2010, not because of what it has done to the national debt, but because of what it has done to the macroeconomy.Here\u2019s what fiscal policy should do: it should support demand when the economy is weak, and it should pull that support back when the economy is strong. As John Maynard Keynes said, \u201cThe boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity.\u201d And up until 2010 the U.S. more or less followed that prescription. Since then, however, fiscal policy has become perverse: first austerity despite high unemployment, now expansion despite low unemployment.What you can see in the chart is that during the first period (the blue line) high unemployment was met with fiscal expansion. This happened during the 2001 recession and aftermath, and again when the Great Recession struck. From this point of view the Obama stimulus was normal policy, applied in an exceptional situation.But then fiscal policy went off track, which you can see by the big red clockwise loop. The wrong turn actually, by this measure, began even before Republicans took the House of Representatives \u2013 mainly, I think, reflecting cutbacks at the state and local level. But it got much worse after the G.O.P. gained blockade power, forcing significant austerity even as unemployment remained extremely high.Meanwhile, the Fed couldn\u2019t cut interest rates any further, because they were already zero, and count me in the camp that\u2019s skeptical about the effectiveness of quantitative easing (which Republicans also fiercely opposed.) So this turn to fiscal austerity surely slowed growth and delayed the economy\u2019s recovery.And now, with unemployment very low but a Republican in the White House, we\u2019re getting the fiscal stimulus we desperately needed then \u2013 and don\u2019t need now. Fiscal policy, like so much of governance in America, has been perverted by right-wing partisanship.Advertisement"}

Fossils from long-extinct elephants, antelope and jaguars paint a prehistoric scene not of a barren wasteland, but of a flourishing savanna sprinkled with watering holes.Dr. Petraglia has searched the now-arid desert for evidence of a \u201cGreen Arabia\u201d for the past decade. Though the Arabian Peninsula is a key connector between Africa and Eurasia, human migration through it has not been studied as well as in the Levant. And for a while, it was thought the area was too arid for travel by early hominins. A few years ago he and his colleagues recovered fossils of several extinct Arabian mammals from a site in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Nefud Desert. Under a microscope, a rib bone was revealed to have cut marks from a sharp stone tool.\u201cI don\u2019t think I had realized the gravity of it yet,\u201d said Mathew Stewart, a doctoral student at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize this would be the oldest evidence of people in the peninsula to date and that no one had found anything like this before.\u201dAlong with the marked fossils, the team had found stone flakes, the waste product from stone tool making, at the site.\u201cThe stone tools add the nail in the coffin,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, providing evidence that hominins had butchered these bones.Tooth enamel grows incrementally, similar to tree rings, so it gives insight into changes over a period of time. The carbon isotope signatures provided data about the herbivores\u2019 diets. The oxygen isotope reflects the source water for precipitation, humidity levels and temperature.Dr. Roberts\u2019 analysis showed that the mammals had a diet of plants found in grasslands, suggesting that rainfall, where they lived, occurred during the warm season. And the oxygen isotopes indicated that conditions were much wetter in the region then.\u201cThese hominins were encountering things in Arabia that were quite similar to what we think of in the East African savanna today,\u201d said Dr. Roberts. \u201cThey aren\u2019t dispersing into a desert, we argue it\u2019s just part of a range expansion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But a new effort to focus attention on one of its oldest characters, Mickey Mouse, is truly something to behold.Disney executives describe the effort as a chance to polish the company\u2019s broader brand and remind people \u2014 as Netflix moves deeper into family entertainment and Disney prepares to unveil its own streaming service \u2014 that the Magic Kingdom has been serving up beloved characters for decades. Mickey made his official debut in 1928 in \u201cSteamboat Willie,\u201d Hollywood\u2019s first cartoon with synchronized sound.Disney has billions of dollars in merchandise sales to consider. Mickey and his friends (Minnie, Pluto, Goofy) make up Disney\u2019s top-selling consumer products franchise, generating annual retail sales of at least $3.2 billion, according to The Licensing Letter, a trade publication. That tally does not include the Disney Store chain or outlets at Disney\u2019s theme parks. Disney does not disclose sales information, although a spokeswoman said the franchise had been growing both domestically and overseas.\u201cThe challenge for any character, but especially for Mickey since he\u2019s so historic, is maintaining relevancy,\u201d said Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers\u2019 Association. \u201cAnd the adults are almost more important than the kids in that way.

{"Headline": "How Times Video Journalists Reconstructed the Timeline of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s Murder", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderFor over a month, a team of New York Times reporters investigated what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who disappeared at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.When did you start working on this story?It was late one evening, one week after Khashoggi went missing. Turkish media printed the names and photographs of the men they alleged were responsible for his disappearance and killing.Straight away we went to work with three goals in mind. One, to verify the names and information about these men, that they were indeed Saudis; two, were they Saudi officials and what were their positions in the government? And then three, what links did they have to the crown prince?We basically worked up a dossier \u2014 15 different names and photographs, and went to work trying to corroborate the information and find out as much as we could about them. That involved trawling social media for profiles and photos of the men and any news reports or government press releases naming them. As an example, we found an email address linked to social media accounts used by the autopsy expert, Salah al-Tubaigy. From this we found academic papers he had written, conferences he attended, state committees he sat on, news articles, a forensic pathologist fellowship he undertook in Australia, and other biographical information confirming that he held a senior government position. We received the phone numbers of several other suspects. Using a phone application that\u2019s popular in Saudi Arabia, we confirmed that many were members of the Saudi royal guard. We also found photographs of other suspects on Facebook and Twitter, some posted by official government agencies. At the same time, the Saudi Twittersphere took off and started researching the names, and doing the same thing \u2014 looking for what is called open source information, social media profiles, news reports, government press releases about these guys.It seems as if many different reporters at the paper, with many different kinds of sources, were involved in the reporting. Correct. Our Istanbul and Beirut bureaus teamed up with David Kirkpatrick and led most of our reporting through their sources. The Graphics team published interactives to bring clarity to the drip feed of evidence from Turkish media. The Visual Investigations team did more sleuthing to find out information about the hit men and verify the visual evidence. Many other reporters helped us to confirm leads we unearthed. Like Adam Goldman; he has great national security sources who provided helpful information. We were talking to Alissa J. Rubin in Paris. She had sources who knew the royal family and were able to provide information about some of the guards. National reporters in Seattle, Silicon Valley, Houston, Boston, New York \u2014 they were all trying to work their sources to find out what we could about these guys who traveled with the crown prince on his global and U.S. tour.We also had reporters in Washington leading coverage of the response by the Trump administration. And the Investigations team examined the relationship between western companies and the Saudi royal family.How did you finally break the story linking Mr. Mutreb to Crown Prince Mohammed?It was a huge team effort. Reporters were working their sources and doing research across Arabic media. Back here, we were looking through old photos and videos of the crown prince\u2019s royal trips, and we found Mr. Mutreb with him. But a visual match alone wasn\u2019t enough. We received information from an intelligence source that suggested he was present on those trips. Steven Erlanger in Brussels used his diplomatic sources to confirm the authenticity of a document naming Mr. Mutreb as a diplomatic attach\u00e9. And we spoke to a source who knew Mutreb and gave us visual confirmation of those photos. We also obtained passport documentation that David Kirkpatrick and the Istanbul bureau were able to corroborate through Turkish sources close to the investigation. And a phone number for Mr. Mutreb that we corroborated using a phone application that listed him as a senior official in the Saudi royal court.Was this similar to how you would typically approach a story?Pretty similar, though usually we gather audio and visual evidence first, organize it and break it down and then build out our reporting from there. It can be any sort of evidence \u2014 a YouTube video, an Instagram photo, a satellite photo, police scanner audio, a flight log, a PDF document, an online sun calculator to tell us the angle of a shadow. What we do is connect dots and spot patterns in that evidence that allows us to visualize and tell a more complete story.So for the Khashoggi story, I suppose, having all of that information and background on these guys and also having the drip feed of surveillance footage from the Turks, we were able to reconstruct the story using time stamps, locations, time and place and characters basically \u2014 who, what, where and when to rebuild the whole story.Why was a video investigation the right tool for this particular story? Because it was a complex story, with different flights and movements and characters and places. But there was a scattering of visual evidence to tie it together and explain it simply. And to us, the ruthless efficiency of the operation was amazing to see. On the Friday afternoon, just as Khashoggi was going to London, a spy is leaving and going straight to Riyadh. Just as Khashoggi is coming back to Istanbul, the teams that would eventually kill him are also converging. They almost passed each other at the airport. When he is going home to his apartment, they are checking into their hotels. And they\u2019re gone 15 hours later. It is just chilling to see the confluence of events and how they brazenly carried out his killing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: The Little Persian Cafe in Brisbane, Australia", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare11 PhotosBRISBANE, Australia \u2014 There\u2019s something about the Iranian dish fesenjan that tastes elemental, as if it might secretly be one of the building blocks of the universe. The stew\u2019s combination of walnut and the sweet-tart high frequency of pomegranate has the capacity to work its way into the crevices of your soul. At its best, the color is tawny, almost black, the chicken pieces cooked in such a way that the dark sauce becomes one with the bird, a great warming morass of nutty-meaty-fruity wonder.Great fesenjan is not easy to find \u2014 often it\u2019s too sweet, too light or not available at all. Especially in kebab-obsessed Australia, many Persian restaurants forgo Iran\u2019s many complex stews altogether, knowing that grilled meat on skewers rules the day.I\u2019ve found it difficult in Brisbane, in particular, to find the best everyday food \u2014 the local gems, the small edible wonders that make living in any city more pleasurable. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s that they\u2019re so rarely celebrated. Most guides list the same 40 or so restaurants, all of them trendy or expensive or both. Those places are fine, and some are better than fine, but the fesenjan at the Little Persian Cafe is vastly better than most of the food you\u2019ll find on those lists.The front counter is built mainly to support an espresso machine, which gives the cafe its primary purpose for a few hours each morning when commuters stream through to get their coffee fix on the way to work. For the rest of the day, it is fairly quiet, with only a handful of customers stopping in to sit and eat. The menu is written on a blackboard wall that frames the open kitchen in back. If you come during an especially slow time, you might have to stick your head into the kitchen to alert the owner or her mother that you\u2019re there.Australia\u2019s obsession with espresso has provided an obvious entry point for new restaurateurs. If you can make a decent flat white, that guarantees a customer base upon which a business might survive. Fittingly, the cafe has become the latest place where immigrant chefs present the food of their homelands, much as the milk bar or the fish-and-chips shop did in decades past. I\u2019ve had some of the most interesting Colombian, Japanese and now Persian food in spaces that also operate as standard Australian neighborhood cafes.The Little Persian Cafe, which opened in 2016, is owned and operated by Sarah Nowroozzadeh with help from her mother, Tara Sathali. Ms. Nowroozzadeh was born in Australia; her parents immigrated from Iran in 1978. For years, the family ran a takeout seafood restaurant \u2014 a fish-and-chips shop \u2014 on the same site where the cafe now stands. When the landlords tore down the old building and built a new development, the family decided to do something different in the space.For breakfast, they serve some classic Australian cafe fare: avocado toast; ham-and-cheese toasted sandwiches, commonly known as toasties. There\u2019s also a Persian omelet, filled with onion and tomato and a spice blend that Ms. Sathali came up with, and soft Persian potato cakes served with carrot pur\u00e9e, a poached egg, a pile of bacon and fantastically light Persian flatbread bubbled with char.The bread, from a local Persian bakery, is one of the many wonders of this place. (It comes with dips at dinnertime: mast-o-moosir, made with wild green garlic; or mirza ghasemi, with a base of charcoal-cooked eggplant.) And it accompanies the fesenjan and the ghormeh sabzi, a deeply intense lamb stew that tastes like the color green cooked down to its grassy herbal essence.Ms. Nowroozzadeh also makes a variety of sweets in-house, including coconut and walnut cookies with a crust that\u2019s almost stretchy and an interior so delicate they take on an ephemeral quality.The kind of care and talent on display at this modest cafe is rare. After I ate my first bowl of fesenjan here, I became newly obsessed, and have since visited every Persian restaurant I can find, in Brisbane and beyond.Time and again, I come across grand rooms swathed in brocade, grilled meats that are slightly too dry, leaden breads, and fesenjan that pales in comparison. (Ms. Nowroozzadeh guesses that this is perhaps because others don\u2019t put in the six to seven hours\u2019 cooking time that her family recipe requires.) Even the rice at the Little Persian Cafe is superior, its hint of saffron quiet and persistent and true, unlike the dyed yellow stuff I find elsewhere.If there\u2019s a downside to all this care, it\u2019s that the food can take a long time to arrive, and the atmosphere is as casual as a restaurant can be. This is a true family operation. One day, Ms. Nowroozzadeh closed up shop early; she had a funeral to attend, and because her mother was going with her there was no one to run the cafe.It didn\u2019t bother me. I came back the next day. I\u2019d wait 24 hours or more for that fesenjan, and feel lucky for the privilege of doing so.Advertisement"}

The floor ran deep with the bowels of cultural Marxism.\u201dWhat is \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d? And why does Mr. Lind fantasize about its slaughter?Nothing of the kind actually exists. But it is increasingly popular to indict cultural Marxism\u2019s baleful effects on society \u2014 and to dream of its violent extermination. With a spate of recent violence in the United States and elsewhere, calling out the runaway alt-right imagination is more urgent than ever.[Discover the most compelling features and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]According to their delirious foes, \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d are an unholy alliance of abortionists, feminists, globalists, homosexuals, intellectuals and socialists who have translated the far left\u2019s old campaign to take away people\u2019s privileges from \u201cclass struggle\u201d into \u201cidentity politics\u201d and multiculturalism. Before he executes the professors, the protagonist of Mr. Lind\u2019s novel expounds on his theory to their faces: \u201cClassical Marxists, where they obtained power, expropriated the bourgeoisie and gave their property to the state,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere you obtained power, you expropriated the rights of white men and gave special privileges to feminists, blacks, gays, and the like.\u201d It is on the basis of this parallel that the novel justifies carnage against the \u201cenemies of Christendom\u201d as an act showing that \u201cWestern culture\u201d is \u201crecovering its will.\u201dAnd while increasingly popular worries about cosmopolitan elites and economic globalization can sometimes transcend the most noxious anti-Semitism, talk of cultural Marxism is inseparable from it. The legend of cultural Marxism recycles old anti-Semitic tropes to give those who feel threatened a scapegoat.The results of such beliefs weren\u2019t pretty. According to Professor Hanebrink, many aspects of the Judeobolshevik fantasy survived the Holocaust it helped bring about, just with the role of the Jews implied more euphemistically or replaced by new adversaries. As in Judeobolshevism, cultural Marxism homogenizes vast groups of shadowy enemies and assigns them a secret design to upend society. As in Judeobolshevism, those supposedly under threat are invited to identify themselves with \u201cthe Christian West\u201d and surge in self-defense before it is too late.The defense of the West in the name of \u201corder\u201d and against \u201cchaos,\u201d which really seems to mean unjustifiable privilege against new claimants, is an old affair posing as new insight. It led to grievous harm in the last century. And though today\u2019s critics of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d purport to be very learned, they proceed seemingly unaware of the heavy baggage involved in alleging that conspiracies have ruined the land.That \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is a crude slander, referring to something that does not exist, unfortunately does not mean actual people are not being set up to pay the price, as scapegoats to appease a rising sense of anger and anxiety. And for that reason, \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is not only a sad diversion from framing legitimate grievances but also a dangerous lure in an increasingly unhinged moment.A previous caption for this article misspelled the name of the Norwegian far-right extremist.

{"Headline": "Facebook Thwarted Chaos on Election Day. It\u2019s Hardly Clear That Will Last.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftAfter an Election Day largely free of viral social media misinformation, and with little trace of the kind of Russian troll stampede that hit its platform in 2016, executives at Facebook may be tempted to take a victory lap.That would be a mistake.It\u2019s true that Facebook and other social media companies have made strides toward cleaning up their services in the last two years. The relative calm we saw on social media on Tuesday is evidence that, at least for one day, in one country, the forces of chaos on these platforms can be contained.But more than anything, this year\u2019s midterm election cycle has exposed just how fragile Facebook remains.Want a disaster-free Election Day in the social media age? You can have one, but it turns out that it takes constant vigilance from law enforcement agencies, academic researchers and digital security experts for months on end.I\u2019ve experienced Facebook\u2019s fragility firsthand. Every day for the past several months, as I\u2019ve covered the midterms through the lens of social media, I\u2019ve started my day by looking for viral misinformation on the platform. (I\u2019ve paid attention to Twitter, YouTube and other social networks, too, but Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla of internet garbage, so it got most of my focus.)A Facebook spokesman, Tom Reynolds, said that the company had improved since 2016, but there was \u201cstill more work to do.\u201d\u201cOver the last two years, we\u2019ve worked hard to prevent misuse of Facebook during elections,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said. \u201cOur teams worked round the clock during the midterms to reduce the spread of misinformation, thwart efforts to discourage people from voting and deal with issues of hate on our services.\u201dWhen the news on Facebook was not blatantly false, it was often divisive and hyperpartisan \u2014 exactly the kind of thing Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, has said he wants to combat by using Facebook to \u201cbring the world closer together.\u201d Nearly every day, the stories that got the most engagement across the network came from highly partisan sources \u2014 mostly conservative outlets like Fox News, Breitbart and The Daily Caller, with a handful of liberal pages like Occupy Democrats and The Other 98% thrown in \u2014 that skewed heavily toward outrage and resentment.Facebook has framed its struggle as an \u201carms race\u201d between itself and the bad actors trying to exploit its services. But that mischaracterizes the nature of the problem. This is not two sovereign countries locked in battle, or an intelligence agency trying to stop a nefarious foreign plot. This is a rich and successful corporation that built a giant machine to convert attention into advertising revenue, made billions of dollars by letting that machine run with limited oversight, and is now frantically trying to clean up the mess that has resulted.As the votes were being tallied on Tuesday, I talked to experts who have paid close attention to Facebook\u2019s troubles over the past several years. Most agreed that Election Day itself had been a success, but the company still had plenty to worry about.\u201cI give them better marks for being on the case,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet to be seen how effective it\u2019s going to be. There\u2019s an awful lot of disinformation still out there.\u201d\u201cFor blatantly false news, they\u2019re not even close to getting ahead of it,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cThey\u2019re barely keeping up.\u201dJennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies social media, said that Facebook\u2019s pattern of relying on outside researchers and journalists to dig up misinformation and abuse was worrying.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad sign that the war rooms, especially Facebook\u2019s war room, didn\u2019t have this information first,\u201d Professor Grygiel said.In some ways, Facebook has it easy in the United States. Its executives and engineers are primarily English-speaking Americans, as are many of the content moderators doing the work of policing the platform. The country also has a strong independent press, law enforcement agencies and other stable institutions that are capable of filling in some gaps. And Facebook is highly incentivized to behave well in the United States and Europe, where its most important regulators (and the bulk of its advertisers) are.It is hard to imagine Facebook extending the same kind of effort to prevent misinformation and interference in Madagascar, Armenia or El Salvador, all of which have upcoming elections. And if you think Facebook will spin up a 24/7 \u201cwar room\u201d to help stop meddling in Nigeria\u2019s February elections, I have a bridge in Lagos to sell you.It\u2019s worth asking, over the long term, why a single American company is in the position of protecting free and fair elections all over the world. But that is the case now, and we now know that Facebook\u2019s action or inaction can spell the difference between elections going smoothly and democracies straining under a siege of misinformation and propaganda.But Facebook would not have done this on its own. It took sustained pressure from lawmakers, regulators, researchers, journalists, employees, investors and users to force the company to pay more attention to misinformation and threats of election interference.Facebook has shown, time and again, that it behaves responsibly only when placed under a well-lit microscope. So as our collective attention fades from the midterms, it seems certain that outsiders will need to continue to hold the company accountable, and push it to do more to safeguard its users \u2014 in every country, during every election season \u2014 from a flood of lies and manipulation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Workers Reject Silicon Valley Individualism in Walkout", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is part of a growing movement,\u201d the organizers wrote in a news release, \u201cnot just in tech, but across the country, including teachers, fast-food workers and others who are using their strength in numbers to make real change.\u201dAt the beginning of their protest near the company\u2019s San Francisco offices, the organizers even expressed support for Marriott workers on strike in the city.For decades, Silicon Valley has been ground zero for a vaguely utopian form of individualism \u2014 the idea that a single engineer with a laptop and an internet connection could change the world, or at least a long-established industry. Class consciousness was pass\u00e9. Unions were the enemy of innovation, an anchor to the status quo.\u201cThe myth of Silicon Valley is that all the power you need is embodied in you as an individual \u2014 if you want more money, go somewhere else,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWhat they were saying here was that all the economic power they had as individuals wasn\u2019t enough.\u201dAnd the consequences of that dawning realization, Mr. Shaiken and other labor experts said, could reverberate across the entire tech sector.Google, for example, points to countless ways for workers to communicate with senior executives: Employees can raise a concern with the chief executive at a T.G.I.F. meeting that happens a few times each month. They can ask questions on an internal company platform before meetings, and management will respond to the ones that receive the most \u201cup-votes.\u201d Workers can even circulate petitions, and those that prove especially popular can earn their authors a sit-down with management.Underlying the back-and-forth is the belief that truth bubbles up from an unregulated exchange of ideas. But some employees complain that it rarely leads to lasting change.\u201cAs far as mechanisms for expressing feelings, there are plenty of them,\u201d said Meredith Whittaker, a 12-year Google veteran who oversees a research group at the company and helped organize the walkout. \u201cBut as far as opportunities for agency and power \u2014 for real power over decision-making \u2014 some of what you\u2019re seeing is a recognition that the former doesn\u2019t equal the latter.\u201dThough unusual, there is precedent for well-paid, in-demand workers who stand up to their employers.Two generations earlier, another group of affluent workers successfully faced down their employer: Major League Baseball players.\u201cFrom time immemorial, the baseball powers-that-be force-fed the players propaganda,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote in his autobiography, citing the claims that \u201cthe commissioner (although appointed and paid by the owners) represented the players\u201d and that \u201cplayers were privileged to be paid to play a kid\u2019s game.\u201dBut, according to Daniel A. Gilbert, an expert on the baseball union at the University of Illinois, the owners\u2019 demeaning posture helped galvanize members \u2014 including a famously counterproductive 1969 meeting in which the St. Louis Cardinals owner aired concerns that \u201cplayers are getting fat\u201d and that they \u201conly think of money.\u201d The players, many of whom were well compensated by this point, would within a few years overturn league rules that had prohibited them from accepting offers from rival teams.As in baseball, where African-American players were among the first to reject the owners\u2019 self-serving narrative, those on the margins of the tech world\u2019s largely white male establishment were quick to see the flaws in its meritocratic ethos, Ms. Whittaker said. They understood that just because anyone could offer an opinion didn\u2019t mean anyone\u2019s opinion would be taken seriously.The question is how far this sense of individual powerlessness has spread within Google. The walkout organizers argue that the feeling is quite widespread \u2014 extending from software developers to hardware engineers and from employees to contractors.Some observers agree. Michelle Miller, co-founder of CoWorker.org, which educates workers in tech and other industries on how to assert their labor rights, said that employees at Google \u201chad to start thinking of themselves as some kind of collective\u201d last year after a memo by an employee asserted that women tend to be innately less capable of certain technical work.Since Mr. Damore\u2019s ouster, Google workers have steadily received evidence that management will heed only collective action, Ms. Miller argued. That includes an ad hoc worker revolt that preceded the end of the company\u2019s controversial Pentagon contract.Google may have been uniquely vulnerable to a worker uprising given its ostensibly progressive values, including the company\u2019s longtime exhortation, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d and the openness of its corporate systems. Organizers note that they executed the entire walkout using Google\u2019s internal platforms and other company resources.They say they\u2019re confident that the protests will only escalate if the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and his team don\u2019t put forth a plan to act on some of their demands, among them a worker representative on the board of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and an end to employment contracts that prevent class-action lawsuits and require individual arbitration for discrimination and harassment cases.\u201cEmployees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in a statement. \u201cWe are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\u201dLabor experts said any changes precipitated by the walkout could spread through Silicon Valley.\u201cThese companies are competing for employees,\u201d said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board.\u201cIf employees at Facebook are looking at this and saying, \u2018Wow, that was impressive,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bodie said, then Facebook may have to follow suit.Still, Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm, expressed skepticism that Google would have to meet any of the organizers\u2019 demands. He pointed out that most employees appeared to enjoy working there and were satisfied with the way they were treated and compensated.\u201cIf I worked at Google, I\u2019d be upset and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they paid $90 million to a person who allegedly violated his employment agreement,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThen I\u2019d go back inside and be glad I work at Google and keep working, and I would think my management would respond to that message and never do that again.\u201dBut Mr. Kocher added that Google did not have a limitless ability to straight-arm angry workers and postpone substantive changes. If there are more walkouts, \u201cproductivity is impacted, recruiting gets harder,\u201d he said.Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Will Benefit From New York City. But What Does New York Get?", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe innovation myth used to involve the back of a suburban garage or an office park in Silicon Valley. The tech industry was incubated not on the mean streets of the big city, but in sleepy hamlets like Murray Hill, N.J., and Mountain View, Calif.So with Amazon splitting HQ2, its second headquarters, between Crystal City, a part of Arlington, Va., and Long Island City, in Queens, what are we to make of tech\u2019s steady migration to marquee cities?Amazon is hardly alone, after all. Google and Facebook already have headquarters here (established, not incidentally, without state subsidies). Google intends to double its work force in the city to nearly 20,000. Twitter\u2019s second-largest office is in Manhattan. Its largest is in downtown San Francisco.On one level, this all seems inevitable. A handful of the wealthiest American cities today have a magnetic attraction. Today\u2019s biggest tech platforms seek them out to recruit top talent and gain access, at scale, to housing, schools and transit. The process means the rich get richer, the biggest companies, bigger. And the gulf widens between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots.On another level, the tech industry isn\u2019t culturally urban. Its insularity, secrecy, its bedrock libertarianism and algorithmic notions about progress, land use and corporate independence have never easily meshed with the slow, open-society, regulatory-heavy, greater-good mission that defines city living. Disruption is a virtue and instrument of efficiency in tech circles. But it isn\u2019t necessarily welcome where protections and a focus on collective welfare remain abiding democratic ideals.That said, New York City is not Seattle or San Francisco. Here, tech is one sector in a megalopolis, sharing the limelight with finance, media, fashion, advertising and art. It\u2019s absorbed into the immensity.And Mr. Dorsey wasn\u2019t alone. In Seattle, Amazon raised a ruckus when officials proposed a tax on large employers to help pay for services to the homeless. The company threatened to halt construction on a new high-rise.So the city dropped the plan.This is certainly not how New Yorkers like to operate.Silly as it sounds, where bosses live turns out to be as good a predictor as any of where tech companies will settle.For years, suburbia has offered these companies acres of disposable, cheap, anonymous office parks: mostly one- or two-story concrete structures surrounded by loads of surface parking. These sites minimized costs, maximized security and allowed companies to scale up, contract or split into different units quickly \u2014 at the same time they promoted sprawl and traffic jams and transformed once-quaint bedroom communities south of San Francisco into phenomenally expensive places to live.Not that young tech workers, more and more of them immigrants, wanted to live in suburbia, anyway. Increasingly they demanded the diversity and benefits of city life. And so did successful innovation companies, following the lead of workers.Another way to put it is that companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became attracted to cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington because these cities had already made transformative public investments in assets like culture, parks, universities and transit.The question for city residents is what these companies give back. I\u2019m not saying companies move, or should be expected to move, for any reason other than to make money. Amazon promises tens of thousands of new jobs in New York, with all sorts of ripple effects beyond employing more coders, sales executives, baristas, nannies and yoga instructors. In one fell swoop, it bids to make good on 20 years of the whole post-Manhattan, cool-outer-borough narrative.But that isn\u2019t the only balance sheet. \u201cUrban life is built around a social compact,\u201d said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a Columbia professor and founder of the architecture firm PAU. Economic value creation in superstar cities like New York fuels a feedback loop that companies and cities both want to lean into.What does this mean? For starters, it means that the city and state now have even more reason to funnel money into subways, buses and a new tunnel under the Hudson River, and to pony up for the stalled BQX streetcar project linking Brooklyn and Queens, all of which would serve Amazon.In turn, Amazon, which dominates the book market, could, up front, make self-interested commitments in local school programs and, as Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University, advocates, in public libraries, our most vibrant, multipurpose community hubs.As for housing, the city\u2019s regulatory and zoning policies are more responsible for driving up costs than tech companies. But, in an ideal world, Amazon would reverse what it did in Seattle and commit resources to affordable housing in areas where its workers are moving; and it would pitch in for homeless services, which, by extension, would improve the daily lives of Amazon employees.Mr. Chakrabarti has a modest proposal, as well: The company could extend a hand toward Long Island City neighbors like LaGuardia Community College and Queensbridge, the largest public housing development in North America.There\u2019s no reason to presume Amazon will do any of this, of course.New York\u2019s abundance of resources, talent and ideas derives from its exceptional diversity and social infrastructure \u2014 urban virtues. Amazon could profit from its enhancement of New York as much as New York could profit from Amazon\u2019s presence. It\u2019s not how tech tends to work.But it\u2019s how this city works.Advertisement"}

One showed a group wearing sombreros, ponchos and dark mustaches; the other included staff members dressed in American patriotic gear standing behind what appeared to be a cardboard border wall.The photos of staff members from Middleton Heights Elementary School in Middleton, Idaho, were quickly met with outrage from the local Hispanic community and beyond.Josh J. Middleton, the superintendent of Middleton School District, has said the school district was investigating what had happened.\u201cDo I think there was a malicious intent in this poor decision? No, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said in Facebook video posted Friday. \u201cWas there a poor judgment involved? Absolutely.\u201d He added that he was \u201cdeeply troubled by the decision by our staff members to wear those costumes that are clearly insensitive and inappropriate.\u201d\u201cWe are better than this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe embrace all students. We have a responsibility to teach and reach all students \u2014 period.\u201dA letter addressed to the superintendent from 12 community groups \u2014 including the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, Planned Parenthood and Immigrant Justice Idaho \u2014 said that \u201cthe school and community climate in Idaho continues to grow more harmful against specific groups and identities, including our Latinx friends, family and neighbors.\u201d\u201cThe intent or misjudgments of the individuals involved does not undo the trauma experienced by students, families and communities,\u201d the letter said.Middleton, Idaho, is a city of 7,400 just over 20 miles northwest of Boise. During the 2015-16 school year, about 12 percent of students at Middleton Heights Elementary School were Hispanic, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.It was unclear why the employees dressed up the way they did. Two parents who visited the elementary school on Halloween, and who spoke only on the condition that their names not be used for safety reasons, said the faculty was having a costume competition where groups of teachers dressed up to represent various countries.State education officials said complaints \u2014 and any possible disciplinary or corrective action \u2014 would be handled by the local school board. Dr. Middleton and other school district officials, including board members, did not respond to requests for comment.J.J. Salda\u00f1a, who oversees education efforts for the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs, a state agency that serves the Hispanic community, said Friday that he had been inundated with calls from upset parents and community members.\u201cMy phone has been ringing off the hook all day,\u201d said Mr. Salda\u00f1a, who said he was collecting letters from community members.The photos were particularly concerning, he said, because anti-immigration messages have been used to bully Hispanic children in school settings. For example, he said, during basketball games involving schools with large Hispanic populations, crowds had at times referred to the border wall to taunt players.\u201cWe\u2019ve already been hearing since the last presidential election that Hispanic kids have been taunted with that: \u2018We\u2019re going to build a wall\u2019 or \u2018Your parents are going to be deported,\u2019\u201d Mr. Salda\u00f1a said. \u201cThey are still getting taunted and teased and bullied with that, so being an educator, an adult doing this, it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dJon Yorgason, who has children who attend Middleton Heights Elementary School, said the Halloween event was supposed to be fun, though part of it was mishandled.\u201cThis was just a Halloween dress-up day,\u201d he said. \u201cAdults have blown this out of proportion. This was really something fun for the kids \u2014 that was the intent.\u201dBut he said there was a difference between dressing up as another culture and depicting a border wall, which is one of the country\u2019s most sensitive and contentious political issues.\u201cThe wall \u2014 considering the current environment of our country, the political environment of our country \u2014 I would have hoped that some adults could have seen better to make a smarter choice on that,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Dutch Can Teach Us About Wildfires", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey\u2019re becoming a part of life in the West. But that doesn\u2019t mean they have to be so destructive.An associate professor of fire science at the University of Idaho and a former wildland firefighter.MOSCOW, Idaho \u2014 In one of his first public statements about the forest fires devastating California, President Trump tweeted that \u201cthere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.\u201d His comment reveals something pervasive and dangerous about how Americans have treated wildfire for more than 100 years: not as the natural hazard that it is, but as something we humans can control. With hotter and drier weather on the way, forest fires will be a part of life for tens of millions of Americans for the foreseeable future. We need a new way to deal with them \u2014 not just better management, as the president suggests, but an entirely different approach to where and how we live in fire-prone areas.The most common call, especially right after a major fire, is to restrict growth entirely in fire-prone areas. Practically speaking, that won\u2019t work: In the United States, we build and rebuild on earthquake faults, in tsunami zones, in Tornado Alley, along the hurricane-plagued Gulf Coast and in floodplains. New Orleans sits below sea level and it\u2019s not going anywhere. California is already one of the most expensive states in the country because of a housing shortage, and restricting growth in fire-prone areas \u2014 which includes most of the state \u2014 will only exacerbate that shortage, raise prices and further marginalize the most vulnerable populations. Many residents of Paradise, the town at the center of the Camp Fire, lived there specifically because they had been priced out of nearby cities.Instead, we should take a cue from the Dutch. Much of the Netherlands sits below sea level and is therefore prone to flooding, but the Dutch can\u2019t exactly move en masse next door to Germany. So they have learned over the centuries that the solution is to stop fighting the sea, and build their cities and towns to maximize saving lives through smarter planning and infrastructure. We could do the same with wildfire.Some parts of the country already follow the Dutch model, intentionally or not. The southeastern United States has not lost significant numbers of homes or lives to fire, despite its vast expanse of the \u201cwildland-urban interface\u201d \u2014 the mixture of rural homes and towns with wild vegetation. That\u2019s not because the region is immune to fire. It\u2019s because, in part, the Southeast uses prescribed fire across millions of acres each year to reduce how much vegetation is left to burn, effectively using intentional fires to limit out-of-control wildfire. In California, some communities aggressively prepare residents for the eventuality of wildfire. Montecito, a community east of Santa Barbara, saw the need to address wildfire risk following the 1990 Painted Cave Fire nearby, which killed one person and consumed 427 homes. The Montecito Fire Protection District works with residents to reduce vegetative fuels along roadsides, create \u201cfuel breaks\u201d \u2014 essentially areas where native shrubs have been thinned or removed \u2014 at strategic locations on private property, and harden homes against embers by putting screens over vents and replacing siding and roofs with less flammable materials.Fire personnel help residents create \u201cdefensible space\u201d around their homes by removing brush and dead trees. (As the name suggests, defensible space is an area where a home can be defended by firefighters.) The district also set up a neighborhood chipping program to help residents dispose of excess logs and branches. It created a robust evacuation plan and educated residents on how it worked. And it changed certain codes, requiring new driveways to be wider and with enough turnaround space for large fire engines. Those things make it safer and easier for residents to evacuate and firefighters to get in to protect lives and homes.All of this preparation was tested in the Thomas Fire last December. The ongoing drought had primed the vegetation for explosive growth. Downhill winds developed, gusting over 60 miles per hour, pushing the fire into the community and raining embers down on homes. It was the worst-case scenario imaginable. Fire-behavior models projected that hundreds of homes could be lost in such conditions. When it was over, however, Montecito emerged with no fatalities, no injuries and only seven homes lost.I was part of a team that reviewed how Montecito\u2019s preparation paid off, and I saw how well the multipronged approach had worked. Yes, firefighters still had to protect homes. But they were able to do so safely, and many homes withstood the flames without any firefighter support. A lot of things went right, and there is no question that the changes Montecito made over many years contributed to the outcome. As a former wildland firefighter, what I saw in Montecito was a community that prioritized life safety and made sure firefighters could do their jobs safely and effectively, and it made all the difference.In Colorado, communities are building fire breaks and \u201cgreenbelts\u201d of fire-resistant green grass that completely surround the community, creating the equivalent of a moat that fire can\u2019t easily cross. In the inland Northwest, rural farmers and ranchers have developed rangeland fire protection associations to prepare for and combat fast-moving rangeland fires with farm and construction equipment.The social science of fires has shown us that there is no panacea, no one fix that will work everywhere \u2014 some communities have different needs, others have different levels of resources. The key to solving the wildfire problem is to develop local solutions that work for a given location and topography and a given community. Fire isn't something we can stop completely; it's like a hurricane. Treating wildfire like the natural hazard it is will allow us to focus on saving lives and infrastructure. Science has demonstrated that wildfire occurs naturally in our fire-adapted forests and wildlands. But that doesn\u2019t mean people need to die from it.Crystal Kolden is an associate professor of forest, rangeland and fire sciences at the University of Idaho and a former wildland firefighter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of us are more equal than others, and they like Trump.Opinion ColumnistEveryone is delivering post-mortems on Tuesday\u2019s elections, so for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s mine: Despite some bitter disappointments and lost ground in the Senate, Democrats won a huge victory. They broke the Republican monopoly on federal power, and that\u2019s a very big deal for an administration that has engaged in blatant corruption and abuse of power, in the belief that an impenetrable red wall would always protect it from accountability. They also made major gains at the state level, which will have a big impact on future elections.But given this overall success, how do we explain those Senate losses? Many people have pointed out that this year\u2019s Senate map was unusually bad for Democrats, consisting disproportionately of states Donald Trump won in 2016. But there was actually a deeper problem, one that will pose long-term problems, not just for Democrats, but for the legitimacy of our whole political system. For economic and demographic trends have interacted with political change to make the Senate deeply unrepresentative of American reality.But here\u2019s the thing: The Senate, which gives each state the same number of seats regardless of population \u2014 which gives fewer than 600,000 people in Wyoming the same representation as almost 40 million in California \u2014 drastically overweights those rural areas and underweights the places where most Americans live.I find it helpful to contrast the real America, the place we actually live, with what I think of as \u201cSenate America,\u201d the hypothetical nation implied by a simple average across states, which is what the Senate in effect represents.As I said, real America is mainly metropolitan; Senate America is still largely rural.Real America is racially and culturally diverse; Senate America is still very white.Real America includes large numbers of highly educated adults; Senate America, which underweights the dynamic metropolitan areas that attract highly educated workers, has a higher proportion of non-college people, and especially non-college whites.None of this is meant to denigrate rural, non-college, white voters. We\u2019re all Americans, and we all deserve an equal voice in shaping our national destiny. But as it is, some of us are more equal than others. And that poses a big problem in an era of deep partisan division.So what happened Tuesday, with Republicans getting shellacked in the House but gaining in the Senate, wasn\u2019t just an accident of this year\u2019s map or specific campaign issues. It reflected a deep division in culture, indeed values, between the American citizenry at large and the people who get to choose much of the Senate.This divergence will have profound implications, because the Senate has a lot of power, especially when the president \u2014 who, let us not forget, lost the popular vote \u2014 leads the party that controls it. In particular, Trump and his Senate friends will spend the next couple of years stuffing the courts with right-wing loyalists.We may, then, be looking at a growing crisis of legitimacy for the U.S. political system \u2014 even if we get through the constitutional crisis that seems to be looming over the next few months.Advertisement"}

The success of the San Francisco soda tax, along with similar ballot measures in three other Bay Area cities, energized a national movement and spurred new drives to tax soda in municipalities around California.Then the soda industry fought back \u2014 using Hiram Johnson\u2019s favorite weapon.The high-stakes trade was the latest escalation in California\u2019s initiative-industrial complex, in which wealth and stealth often subvert the goals of Hiram Johnson\u2019s reforms. With enough money, almost anything can get on the California ballot. Over the last century, particularly the last four decades, initiatives have shaped nearly every facet of life in California. Ballot propositions, which can be amended only by another popular vote, have determined how property taxes are levied, the fate of bilingual education and even the size of chickens\u2019 cages (and thus the price of eggs).Today, those tools are expertly wielded by the moneyed interests whose power they were designed to counteract.Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Baxter, and the political-consultant industry they spawned, fueled a rapid growth in initiatives by the 1970s. Paid signature gatherers driven by financial incentive rather than moral conviction replaced volunteers who had once circulated petitions for their causes. The initiative \u201cis very rapidly becoming a tool of the special interests,\u201d Jerry Brown, then the secretary of state, testified at a 1972 state hearing where signature gatherers detailed a range of deceptive practices.The last initiative that got on the ballot through the effort of volunteers was a 1990 measure to protect mountain lions. Since then, petition gatherers wielding multiple clipboards have become ubiquitous at shopping malls, outside retail stores and at farmers\u2019 markets. They are paid per signature, rates that fluctuate as high as $6 per name, depending on how many initiatives are in circulation, how soon the petitions must be turned in and how difficult the sell. Signature gatherers who handle multiple initiatives have an incentive to push the ones that pay the most. The bidding wars and campaign high jinks can be fierce. They have included attempts to sabotage petitions by flooding them with false or duplicate names.Such campaigns are costly, in part because there are no limits on contributions. This November, in addition to the gas tax, voters will decide measures that affect issues including rent control, bonds for water projects and homeless housing, the size of cages for farm animals and the future of daylight saving time. As of the end of October, the amount raised to pass or defeat the 11 propositions was almost $368 million, about five times the amount raised by this year's two gubernatorial candidates.Figures in millions, as of Saturday.TOTALSPENT INSUPPORTSPENT INOPPOSITIONCalifornia Proposition 8Limits on dialysis clinics' revenue$130$19$111California Proposition 10Local rent control$1002575Nevada Question 3Changes to energy market$973364Arizona Proposition 127Renewable energy standards$552431California Proposition 6Future gas and vehicle taxes50545Florida Amendment 3Casino gambling48462Washington Initiative 1631Carbon emissions fee471631Florida Amendment 6Marsy's law crime victims rights37370Colorado Proposition 112New oil, gas and fracking projects33232Massachusetts Question 1Nurse-patient assignment limits301119TOTALSPENT IN SUPPORTSPENT IN OPPOSITIONCalifornia Proposition 8$130$19$111Limits on dialysis clinics' revenueCalifornia Proposition 10$1002575Local rent controlNevada Question 3$973364Changes to energy marketArizona Proposition 127$552431Renewable energy standardsCalifornia Proposition 6$50545Future gas and vehicle taxesFlorida Amendment 3$48462Casino gamblingWashington Initiative 1631$471631Carbon emissions feeFlorida Amendment 6$37370Marsy's law crime victims rightsColorado Proposition 112$33232New oil, gas and fracking projectsMassachusetts Question 1$301119Nurse-patient assignment limitsBy The New York Times | Source: Ballotpedia; Colorado Proposition 112 figures do not add up to the total because of rounding.Notable ballot initiatives up for a vote in states on Nov. 6.NONPARTISAN REDISTRICTINGMICH.UTAHCOLO.MO.Colorado has two proposals: Creating independent commissions to design districts for its congressional delegation and the State Legislature.VOTER REQUIREMENTS, BALLOT ACCESSExpand accessRestrict accessMICH.MONT.N.D.NEV.MD.N.C.ARK.LA.FLA.Arkansas and North Carolina initiatives would require voter IDs.

Nearly every place I go, I hear some version of this question: \u201cAre we going to be O.K.?\u201d What the questioner means is, given the current leadership of our country and the ugly undercurrent on which it thrives, is America as we know it going to survive? Yes, is the answer I give, without hesitation. We will recover. How long that takes is up to us, but I am optimistic.History shows us that America\u2019s progress in fulfilling our aspirations is an upward sloping line. Yes, our present has always fallen short of our values. After all, we were born in original sin \u2014 our nation\u2019s founders held inspiring truths to be self-evident while keeping human beings as slaves. But our history is one of continuous progress.Unfortunately, that line marking our progress is not a solid one. We make progress, then we regress, then we make progress again. The upward jag is always larger than the retreat, which is why the line has a positive slope upward across 242 years. But our line is jagged.Our country has changed dramatically in recent years. We elected a black man president for two terms and a woman won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. We legalized gay marriage, have an entirely new approach to work and technology and families, and we are on a path to the white majority becoming a minority. History shows us that with so much progress and change, a spasm of negativity and backlash was inevitable.We can\u2019t fully control the natural rhythms of human history. But what we can control is how long this period lasts before the line turns up again. The K.K.K. fever was broken in part because courageous leaders stood up to the Klan and brought millions of good people with them. And that pattern is also repeating itself.As I travel, I can feel something. If you imagine the ideology of Americans as a bell curve, our core values are secure in the middle with the giant lump of busy, normally disengaged, distracted people. They are voters and nonvoters on the center right and center left, which is a vast majority, in a country where the far-left and far-right wings usually do all the talking and shouting. Every so often in our history, that giant stirs. The murder of little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 stirred that giant, which led to bipartisan support in Congress to pass the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts that changed our country for the better.What the rest of us have to do is not become discouraged or complacent, or be provoked into reacting in ways that betray our values. It falls to all of us to awaken the giant so that we shorten the period before we resume our upward march. Every American should be speaking about our nation\u2019s values. Every American should be voting those values, which are far more important than even the most passionate policy differences. The history of America consoles us, but also calls us to action.James Comey is the former F.B.I. director and author of \u201cA Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The site of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 first band practice, on Avenue B, was just two blocks away from one of their lead singer Karen O\u2019s first New York apartments (which was above Odessa, the Avenue A diner where Henry Rollins was invited to audition for Black Flag). \u201cI don\u2019t want to belabor that point, but that band was very much a product of the neighborhood,\u201d Rifkin said of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. \u201cThe proximity of all of these spaces together.\u201dMusic-themed walking tours in New York are nothing new, but Rifkin\u2019s focus on indie rock signals a generational turning of the tide. As millennials creep into their 30s, with a different playlist of nostalgic musical favorites, the landscape where that music took seed is being transformed by buildings like 51 Astor \u2014 a black-glass mixed-use colossus that locals refer to as the \u201cDeath Star.\u201d And things that happened only 10 or 15 years ago are beginning to feel more like history.Back in New York, trying to figure out what to do with his life, he started reading music history books and taking walks to pass the time. \u201cWalking around and actually seeing this stuff \u2014 the geographic relationships, how close the clubs were to people\u2019s apartments or recording studios \u2014 was kind of a big \u2018aha\u2019 moment,\u201d Rifkin said. \u201cSeeing how somebody\u2019s life might have been lived in those circumstances made the idea of a right place and a right time a lot easier to pinpoint.\u201dOf course, there have been many right times in New York City\u2019s music history. One of Walk on the Wild Side\u2019s two most popular tours explores how the financial collapse of 1975 gave rise to the cross-pollination of post-punk, disco and hip-hop in NoLIta, SoHo and TriBeCa. The other, the Birth of Punk tour, guides listeners from the Velvet Underground\u2019s first residency at Cafe Bizarre in the West Village to the CBGB heyday of Patti Smith and the Ramones.People in their late 20s and early 30s, Rifkin said, form the core of his customer base \u2014 folks who want to approach the city\u2019s history from a \u201crecord-collector perspective, or who grew up reading music blogs every day.\u201dAnother was Alana Skyring, a 36-year-old from Brisbane who toured the globe as the drummer for the Australian garage-rock band the Grates before settling in Queens. This winter the Grates are going on a reunion tour, and Skyring said revisiting some of the band\u2019s old New York haunts from the late 2000s felt like a good way to prepare. \u201cFor a brief second, we were part of a whole bunch of stuff happening here,\u201d she said.There\u2019s a sense of loss running through Rifkin\u2019s tours \u2014 on Ludlow Street, a hotel parking lot obscures the former location of the music and comedy club Luna Lounge. But millennials aren\u2019t the first generation to feel like the New York where they came of age is disappearing in plain view, said Ada Calhoun, an East Village native and the author of \u201cSt. Marks is Dead: The Many Lives of America\u2019s Hippest Street.\u201d\u201cIf you were a hippie in the \u201960s, and you walked around in the early \u201970s,\u201d then you felt like \u201cit was done \u2014 the whole Summer of Love magic,\u201d Calhoun said in an interview. \u201cI can see how growing up with indie rock, and then walking past the Death Star, you\u2019d feel the same way.\u201dRifkin, for his part, reminds visitors that these movements were the product of people making the most of their unique time and place. Hearing him speak about Ryan Adams writing songs at the bar at Niagara or an early career Anohni starring in avant-garde theater performances at the Pyramid Club, familiar streets begin to feel a little more alive \u2014 full of connections to be forged, of fire escapes and community gardens brimming with secrets.A photograph with an earlier version of this article was published in error. The music venue Sin-\u00e9 was located in what is now the Holyland Market, not next door at the bar Bua. (Both businesses have the address of 122 St. Marks Place.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Thanksgiving Story You\u2019ve Probably Never Heard", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot everyone confessed the Pilgrim creed at the first gathering of what would become our national holiday. Maybe we don\u2019t have the pilgrims alone to thank for democracy. Mr. Kelly is the author of \u201cMarooned: Jamestown, Shipwreck, and a New History of America\u2019s Origin.\u201d The pilgrim William Bradford tells us about the first Thanksgiving. Winter was brutal. Snowbound in their hastily built houses, nearly every settler got sick; all were hungry, and half died. Spring followed, and with the help of Indians, the survivors reaped their first American harvest. English hunters went fowling in the woods, Massasoit brought in deer and about 90 Wampanoags, and everyone played games together and feasted for three days.No matter when our families emigrated to America, we acknowledge these spiritual ancestors in a national rite every November, when we crowd around our dining room tables and feast on a traditional Thanksgiving meal of turkey and fixings.As Nathaniel Philbrick put it in his best-selling \u201cMayflower,\u201d those odd, quaint fellows who had big-buckled shoes and hunted turkey with blunderbusses have come to \u201csymbolize all that is good about America.\u201dBut the pilgrims (Bradford called them \u201csaints\u201d) weren\u2019t the only settlers at the feast. Troublesome \u201cstrangers\u201d who did not confess the Pilgrim creed were there, too. One of the strangers was the historical figure you should be thinking about this Thanksgiving. You\u2019ve probably never heard of Stephen Hopkins. He might change the way you think about the national holiday. We don\u2019t know very much about him. Hopkins was born in 1581, about the same time Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway in Stratford. His family was neither poor nor rich. As a young man, Hopkins leased a farm, married, had children and lost his lease, and perhaps to mend his fortunes in 1609 he joined 500 other settlers headed for Jamestown, Va.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]They sailed into a hurricane. Most of the ships staggered into Chesapeake Bay with shaken passengers and sea-sodden cargoes, but the flagship, the Sea Venture, never arrived. Its disappearance triggered the notorious \u201cstarving time\u201d at Jamestown.The Sea Venture didn\u2019t sink. Sailors and passengers bailed water for three days and nights until their tired bones could work no more. Just as they gave in to drowning, the ship ran aground on a shoal in the Mid-Atlantic. Across a lagoon, about a mile away, the cedars of Bermuda beckoned.One hundred-fifty survivors found themselves marooned in a Garden of Eden. The uninhabited islands were full of pigs, fowl, fruit and fish. No turkey but plenty of pork to roast. Why not stay?Reasoning things out, Stephen Hopkins stumbled upon the idea that made America. The Virginia Company failed to deliver the settlers to Jamestown, he argued, which released the settlers from their contract. The shipwreck dissolved it. The castaways were free to work for the company if they wanted, or they could choose to work for themselves. On the deserted island, Hopkins came up with the social-contract theory of government about 40 years before Thomas Hobbes would write \u201cLeviathan,\u201d almost 80 years before John Locke wrote his \u201cTwo Treatises of Government\u201d and 166 years before Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence.In the wilderness of Bermuda, Hopkins persuaded most of the settlers to form a fledgling democracy.But the company wouldn\u2019t have it. The governor insisted they were still under contract and must help build a ship that would carry them to Jamestown. He gave orders. The settlers dragged their feet. He threatened. They fled into the woods. Finally, the governor and his cronies turned Bermuda into a slave labor camp, and after nine months, under the threat of guns, the castaways were forced to embark for Virginia.For his part in the \u201cmutiny,\u201d Hopkins was sentenced to death, but he talked his way to clemency. He kept his head down. He served out his term of years, and then he returned to England. Shakespeare mocked and misrepresented his political theory in one of the last plays he ever wrote, \u201cThe Tempest,\u201d but otherwise Hopkins fell out of history. At least for 10 years.Anchored off the coast of Massachusetts, William Bradford tells us, some \u201cdiscontented\u201d strangers started spreading a \u201cmutinous\u201d argument: Because the Mayflower had drifted so far off course, it was beyond the scope of the company\u2019s patent. \u201cWhen they came ashore,\u201d the strangers insisted, they could \u201cuse their own liberty\u201d to form a new government.On Nov. 21, 1620, a remarkable document did just that. \u201cWe whose names are underwritten,\u201d it said, \u201ccovenant and combine ourselves into a civil body politic.\u201d We know this document today as the Mayflower Compact, a flagstone on the road to the United States Constitution. Forty-one men signed it, both saints and strangers.Bradford said the \u201csaints\u201d wrote the compact to bring the \u201cstrangers\u201d in line, and Philbrick claims that the compact was modeled on the \u201cspiritual covenant\u201d that had bound the pilgrims together in Holland. His later book, \u201cBunker Hill,\u201d treats the American Revolution as if it were the end of a pilgrims\u2019 progress. Boston in 1776 was the \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d prophesied by John Winthrop.There\u2019s nothing radical about this version of history. Scholars have been telling us for the last hundred years that we can thank the pilgrims for democracy.And yet, I\u2019ve always thought it was a little odd that those secular ideals of natural rights so perfectly articulated by Thomas Jefferson started with people who outlawed dissent. Was freedom of religion really invented by people who hunted witches? Did our distinctly American notions of economic liberty come from people who scolded the poor for being discontent? Did democracy grow out of righteousness?Probably not. It turns out that one of the Mayflower Compact\u2019s signers was a man named Stephen Hopkins. Most scholars today think he was the same Hopkins who was marooned on Bermuda, and that puts a new spin on the story. After all, the strangers\u2019 complaints about invalid company \u201cpatents\u201d and settlers\u2019 liberty sound exactly like Hopkins\u2019s argument in Bermuda. And the Mayflower Compact itself establishes the same government of mutual consent that Hopkins nearly died trying to secure.We\u2019ve taken the Mayflower tale as gospel truth ever since it was rediscovered in the 1840s. But Hopkins\u2019s story suggests that we ought to take Bradford with a grain of salt. If we read with the slightest suspicion, we\u2019ll give credit where credit is due: More than likely, the Mayflower Compact was designed to protect the liberty of strangers from the tyranny of saints.Maybe it\u2019s time to start thinking of ourselves as the descendants of strangers, the castaways of Jamestown and the unanointed of Plymouth Plantation. Starting this Thanksgiving, maybe we should eat barbecue.Advertisement"}

But Australia could suffer if the conflict slows China\u2019s growth.YARRAGON, Australia \u2014 There are some 2,000 goats at the Gippy Goat Cafe farm in Yarragon, two hours east of Melbourne and deep into the hinterland of the state of Victoria. The hills gleam a deep emerald here, the soil hugs the boots \u2014 and Chinese \u201ckey opinion leaders\u201d line up to film the authentic source of goat milk formula that shoppers are buying for their infants back home.That interest from China presents an opportunity, one that could expand as the trade war between Washington and Beijing intensifies. Right now, the company competes in China against monoliths like Gerber of the United States and Danone of France that have a much greater share of the market. \u201cAustralia is one of the best-placed countries in the world to reap the gains of the trade war,\u201d said Jason Aravanis, a senior industry analyst in Melbourne for IBISWorld, a market research company. \u201cOver the long term, Australia is going to step in and replace a lot of these American exports.\u201dSome of that business could end up going to Australia. As Australia\u2019s largest trade partner, China already receives about 40 percent of Australia\u2019s fruit, making Australia the biggest competitor to American fruit exports there. And while China has raised tariffs on American goods, it has been reducing them on some Australian products, such as wine. Australia\u2019s wine exports to greater China \u2014 an area that includes Hong Kong, a growing wine import hub \u2014 have surged in recent years. \u201cWe\u2019ve closed many a deal standing right here on this farm,\u201d Ms. Carr said. \u201cAll the partners come here, we bring all the key opinion leaders.

{"Headline": "The Chemists\u2019 War", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "One hundred years after the end of World War I, the Army Corps of Engineers is still cleaning up the relics of experiments that helped develop chemical weapons to counter the Germans\u2019 gas attacks. Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Under a canopy of poplar and oak trees, a team of geophysicists surveyed the forest floor for century-old wartime relics. They positioned an electromagnetic scanner atop the carpet of leaves while the delicate instrument harvested data about objects in the soil beneath.\u201cThey were using cutting-edge technology 100 years ago developing chemical weapons,\u201d Mr. Zahl, 62, said in the air-conditioned trailer that serves as the cleanup headquarters. \u201cThat was high technology at that time, and here we are 100 years later using high technology again to remediate the material left behind.\u201dWorld War I, which ended with the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918, is infamous for its horrific battlefield conditions, its grinding, bloody clashes \u2014 the Battles of the Somme, Verdun, Passchendaele and others \u2014 and the resulting human slaughter. Some 8.5 million soldiers were killed and 21 million more were wounded.American scientists threw themselves into the war effort. Though few are household names today, top physicists, chemists and engineers volunteered. Many from prestigious universities were known as \u201cdollar-a-year men,\u201d paid a symbolic wage for their efforts.\u201cThe military had problems to solve that it couldn\u2019t solve on its own,\u201d said Daniel J. Kevles, emeritus professor of history at Yale and author of \u201cThe Physicists.\u201dTo correct those deficiencies, the War Department set up a laboratory, initially under the civilian Bureau of Mines, called the American University Experiment Station. It began modestly with one building and fewer than 100 researchers.Several years later, the Corps of Engineers reopened its examination of the area, acknowledging that it had prematurely shut down the cleanup. The contamination and debris proved more extensive than originally believed, sparking an uproar from residents and a pledge from the Army for more transparency and community participation. The environmental cleanup is also a kind of archaeological undertaking, a historical scavenger hunt for evidence of the scientific enterprise around chemical warfare.In the latest cleanup phase, the Army has begun examining the soil of about 91 properties beneath the cone of the artillery range. The scanning near the reservoir was at an early stage, using new technology that pinpoints buried metal objects and compares their digital profiles against a database of military munitions, such as mortar shells or 75-millimeter artillery rounds. If the item is deemed harmless \u201ccultural debris,\u201d in Army parlance \u2014 a discarded soda can, for example \u2014 then it won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave items in the ground that all this equipment says is cultural debris and nothing to do with World War I activities,\u201d Mr. Zahl said.On one Spring Valley property, some relics will likely never be removed. Last year, Elliot Gerson and his wife, Jessica Herzstein, bought the stately home where Ms. Herzstein\u2019s parents had lived for decades. The Corps has extensively investigated and cleaned up the property and says it has no health concerns. But three original structures from the Experiment Station remain.On the wooded slope above the driveway, weeds choke a concrete platform with an angled gutter in the middle \u2014 the launching pad for the experimental mortar range. Behind the house, two ivy-draped bunkers nestle in the woods, ferns poking through cracks.One afternoon, Mr. Gerson, 66, paused to reflect midway down a slate path leading to one of the structures. He called them \u201ca secret archaeological site in the forest,\u201d evidence of century-old scientific endeavors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice, Italian Style: 9 Years, 13 Trials and Few Answers", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileROME \u2014 Before her brother Stefano died in the prison wing of a Rome hospital on Oct. 22, 2009, Ilaria Cucchi lived what she described as a \u201cnormalissima\u201d life, as a model wife and working mother of two.That all changed after she saw her brother\u2019s body stretched out on a morgue slab, his face emaciated, his eyes ringed by dark purple bruises. It was immediately clear to her that he had been beaten after his arrest a week earlier \u2014 with a stash of hashish and cocaine that he said were for personal use \u2014 and that he might have died as a result.In that moment, she has said countless times in countless interviews and public encounters over the past nine years, looking at the \u201ctortured corpse\u201d of her brother, Ms. Cucchi vowed to establish how he had been allowed to die \u201cin solitude and indifference.\u201dThat quest \u2014 undertaken with unshakable determination \u2014 has transformed Ms. Cucchi into one of Italy\u2019s best-known and admired human rights crusaders. In her search for truth, she has coolly faced down antagonistic prosecutors, law enforcement officials, politicians and news media outlets.But still, after nine years, 13 separate trials and the attendant publicity \u2014 there is even a film about her brother\u2019s final days \u2014 such is the challenge of navigating Italy\u2019s multilayered judicial system that the truth of what happened has not yet fully emerged.\u201cPeople constantly stop and thank me on the street,\u201d she said in an interview in her comfortable Rome apartment this week. \u201cBefore, I\u2019d think, \u2018Why are you thanking me?\u2019 Now, I realize that they recognize what I am doing, what my family has endured. It\u2019s the frustration we all feel when we come up against hostile institutions.\u201dMs. Cucchi\u2019s public appearances draw hundreds, even thousands, of supporters at events, and she has been feted with commendations and awards. She has become a fixture on television talk shows, her appearances often coinciding with a spike in ratings. A Neapolitan street artist recently immortalized her along with Che Guevara and the soccer legend Diego Maradona.Italians have also responded to her indignation at her brother\u2019s death in the custody of institutions \u2014 law enforcement, legal and medical \u2014 that exist to protect citizens.\u201cHe died amid the indifference of others,\u201d Ms. Cucchi said during a break on Wednesday at yet another court hearing. \u201cStefano was seen by 150 people in the week between his arrest and his death \u2014 we counted \u2014 and all of them pretended not to see him,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only did they not act out of human compassion, but none did their duty as public officials.\u201dSome of those 150 people \u2014 medical staff members, social workers, prison guards, lawyers, prosecutors and judges, as well as the Carabinieri officers who first arrested and detained him \u2014 have already been tried in relation to his death. But in nearly all of those cases a final judgment has not been reached. In part, that is because prosecutors and Ms. Cucchi have challenged almost every acquittal, and new investigations have opened more leads.Ms. Cucchi, who is 44, sat attentively throughout Wednesday\u2019s daylong hearing, as she and her parents have done untold times during all those trials. \u201cWe\u2019ve never missed a hearing. Not even with a fever,\u201d she said.The courtroom was packed with television cameras and print reporters, as well as ordinary Romans attracted to the high-visibility case. Ms. Cucchi did not flinch when one witness, a male nurse, described finding her brother dead in his hospital bed during a routine morning call. She did, however, seek out her parents, sitting in the back row of the courtroom, whose suffering through the years has been discernible, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s their son\u201d being talked about, she said.Ilaria Cucchi never expected to end up as one of Italy\u2019s most famous human-rights activists. After high school she worked for her father, a surveyor, before taking a course to become a condominium administrator. She married her high school sweetheart and had two children, Valerio, now 16, and Giulia, 10. \u201cI was happy,\u201d she said.But Stefano\u2019s death and the years of legal battles have turned her life upside down. She separated from her husband, and is now romantically involved with Fabio Anselmo, her family\u2019s lawyer, whom she hired to take her brother\u2019s case. His first piece of advice to her had been to have photographs taken during the autopsy.Those graphic images, which show evident bruising on Stefano\u2019s face and back, did much to sway public opinion.

Three of them have been charged with involuntary manslaughter, the other two with slander and making false statements. The trial took an unexpected turn last month when it emerged in court that one of the five had given testimony last summer admitting to having witnessed two fellow officers brutally beating Stefano. It was the public admission that Ms. Cucchi had been waiting and hoping for.A parallel investigation is underway on a possible cover-up of the crime within the Carabinieri, and prosecutors are looking into accusations of false testimony and falsified documents that are making their way up the chain of command.If Stefano Cucchi\u2019s case was already well known here, thanks to his sister\u2019s perseverance, it became an even greater cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after the presentation in August at the Venice Film Festival of \u201cSulla Mia Pelle,\u201d (\u201cOn My Skin\u201d) a dramatization of his final days, directed by Alessio Cremonini.Ms. Cucchi and her family have also been subject to harassment, mostly through social media.

{"Headline": "Cancer Society Executive Resigns Amid Upset Over Corporate Partnerships", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A top official of the American Cancer Society has resigned in part because of concern over some of the organization\u2019s fund-raising partnerships.The official, Dr. Otis W. Brawley, an executive vice president and chief medical officer, resigned his post late last week after 11 years at the society. His departure was largely attributed to his dismay over some commercial partnerships, including with Herbalife International, the controversial supplements company, people close to him said.While he would not comment publicly, others said that he had become uncomfortable with the society\u2019s growing reliance on donations from businesses with questionable health credentials that he and others suspect are seeking to burnish their images.Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer at the society, said Dr. Brawley\u2019s resignation had hit his colleagues hard.\u201cIt\u2019s personally difficult and certainly for many in the organization it\u2019s difficult as well,\u201d Dr. Lichtenfeld said.Such donations and fund-raising partnerships have become more important in recent years as the organization\u2019s fund-raising has declined. Fund-raising income has gone down every year since its peak of just over $1 billion in 2007. In 2017, donations reached only $736 million, although the society made up for some of the loss by selling properties.Critics in and outside the 105-year-old organization have also protested its recent partnerships with Long John Silver\u2019s, a seafood chain best known for its batter-fried fish; and Tilted Kilt, a sports pub showcasing \u201cKilt Girls\u201d in skimpy red plaid.And Herbalife International has had a troubled history. The company donated $250,000 directly to the cancer society, and in October, started selling pink water bottles, that are co-branded with both the American Cancer Society and the Herbalife logo. Proceeds from the sales all go to the cancer society.\u201cThese water bottles are really a good way for people to show their support,\u201d said Sharon Byers, the society\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cOur intent with all of our partnerships is to generate as much revenue as we can to achieve our mission.\u201dIn 2014, the Food and Drug Administration told Herbalife to take down a YouTube video that featured a former F.D.A. official implying that the agency approved weight loss shakes and other supplements.Herbalife did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\u201cThe company is too controversial historically,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine. \u201cIt has a very non-illustrious history with regulatory bodies, association with a product of controversial and most likely dubious merit, and is not where the cancer society wants or ought to be.\u201dThe Herbalife Facebook page shows both the cancer society and the company\u2019s logo, with the phrase, \u201cWorking Together to Make the World Healthier and Happier and Free from Breast Cancer.\u201d It does carry a disclaimer noting the cancer society does not endorse Herbalife products.Dr. Caplan said the disclaimer isn\u2019t enough. \u201cSome people are going to think that there\u2019s an implicit endorsement,\u201d he said, \u201ceither because they don\u2019t look at the website or they just see the bottle and presume a partnership.\u201dHistorically, the cancer society\u2019s revenue was heavily reliant on walks, including Relay for Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, said Michael Reich, a spokesman for the organization. But during the past decade, he said, donations patterns have changed and walks, in particular, have become less popular.\u201cBecause A.C.S.\u2019s walks generated so much revenue and were such a large part of our portfolio, our declines were much more pronounced than some other organizations,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cWe have been re-engineering and diversifying our revenue portfolio, and partnerships are playing a key role. This takes time to build, but we are making tremendous progress.\u201dMs. Byers, the cancer society\u2019s chief marketing officer, said the organization does not form alliances with tobacco companies, but other than that, assesses each company individually.Mr. Reich also defended the arrangement with the Tilted Kilt.\u201cI can tell you that A.C.S. is proud of the partnership with Tilted Kilt, too,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cWe do not yet have a plan for 2019, but we would certainly work with them again.\u201dResponding to internal criticism about the Tilted Kilt, Mr. Reich said, \u201cWe know we\u2019re taking some risks. Not every partnership or initiative is for everyone.\u201dJanet Wilt, marketing director for the restaurant chain, said she was proud the company was a donor.\u201cCancer is a disease that has touched all of our lives and it does not discriminate based on who you are or where you work,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cFrankly, we are disappointed people are offended by any organization supporting efforts toward finding a cure.\u201dThe cancer society is not the only patient advocacy group struggling to expand its donor base without becoming tainted by associations with other groups.A Boston University study two years ago identified scores of patient advocacy groups and other health organizations, including the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, that accepted research funding from soda companies.One of the cancer society\u2019s new donors, Long John Silver\u2019s, was the subject of criticism for its use of trans fats, which it has since dropped. James P. O\u2019Reilly, the company\u2019s chief executive, notes that the restaurant now offers healthier choices, among them baked shrimp and cod and grilled salmon, and is expanding its grilled selections on the menu.\u201cLong John Silver\u2019s and its franchisees are proud to stand with the many millions of American families who battle cancer every day,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said in an email.Jonathan H. Marks, associate professor of bioethics, humanities and law at Pennsylvania State University, pointed to the partnership\u2019s conflicting messages.\u201cThe partnership with Long John Silver\u2019s undermines the integrity of the American Cancer Society,\u201d Dr. Marks said. \u201cThe American Cancer Society\u2019s website encourages readers to prepare fish and poultry by baking, broiling or poaching rather than by frying or charbroiling. But the society is partnering with a fast food company whose leading menu items are fried. Integrity requires consistency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Somali Pirates, a Kidnapping, Then a Facebook Message", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySomali pirates kidnapped and held Michael Scott Moore, a journalist, hostage for two-and-a-half terrifying years until a ransom payment secured his release in September 2014.Two months later, Mr. Moore received a surprising message on Facebook.\u201cHow are you, Michael?\u201d the message said. \u201cI am ur friend Mohammed Tahlil. I wants to speak with u.\u201dThe sender\u2019s Facebook page included his photograph. Mr. Moore recognized him as one of the men who guarded him during his captivity in Somalia. He decided to write back.What followed was an extraordinary exchange of Facebook messages between the journalist and his former captor. How long they communicated and where the conversation ultimately led has not been made public, but in the summer, the Somali was taken into custody by United States authorities and jailed in New York City, court records show.A federal indictment made public Wednesday charged the man, Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed, 38, with kidnapping, hostage taking, conspiracy and other counts. The authorities have not said where he was arrested or how he came to the United States.The indictment identified his hostage only as \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d but Mr. Moore confirmed on Thursday that he was the unnamed victim.When asked about the arrest of Mr. Tahlil, Mr. Moore replied, \u201cI\u2019m not as happy as you might imagine that he\u2019s in jail.\u201d He declined to comment further and would not say whether the Facebook exchanges had in some way led to Mr. Tahlil\u2019s capture or surrender.It appears from the Facebook exchanges \u2014 some of which are detailed in a criminal complaint and others in Mr. Moore\u2019s book \u2014 that the journalist developed a kind of affinity for Mr. Tahlil, who, in turn, provided Mr. Moore with information about his kidnappers.In his book, Mr. Moore, 49, described his captivity as full of terror, pain and close calls. One of his abductors broke his wrist during the kidnapping and it did not heal for weeks. He witnessed the torture of a fellow hostage, who was hanged upside down from a tree branch while a man beat him on the chest and feet with a bamboo cane.The criminal complaint is based largely on F.B.I. interviews with Mr. Moore after his release. It said some of Mr. Moore\u2019s Somali captors brandished AK-47 assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and handguns. One of them made threats that if the ransom was not paid, Mr. Moore would be sold to the Shabab, an Islamist extremist group.Mr. Moore was moved around to different locations in Somalia and also held for some time on a ship with other hostages, the complaint says.At one point, the kidnappers also demanded a letter from a \u201chigh-ranking U.S. government official,\u201d the complaint says, \u201cabsolving them of any consequences for the kidnapping.\u201d Mr. Moore\u2019s book identifies the official as President Obama.In the book, Mr. Moore wrote that Mr. Tahlil was \u201cthe boss\u201d of the Somali guards who watched him and other hostages. Mr. Moore described Mr. Tahlil as gentle with \u201ca shy, snaggletoothed smile.\u201dIt was in November 2014, after Mr. Moore had been released and had resumed using his Facebook account, that he heard from Mr. Tahlil. \u201cI recoiled from the message and ignored him at first,\u201d he said in his book. \u201cBut Tahlil had been gentle, even good-humored, so eventually I wrote back.\u201dMr. Tahlil wrote that he was in Hobyo, a Somali coastal town known as a pirate den.\u201cI hope u are fine,\u201d Mr. Tahlil said. \u201cThe pirates who held u hostage killed each other over group vendetta and money issues.\u201dThe criminal complaint said Mr. Tahlil\u2019s account of Mr. Moore\u2019s kidnappers attacking each other was consistent with reports that some of the pirates had been killed in a dispute over how to divide the ransom payment.In the ensuing months, Mr. Tahlil continued to communicate with Mr. Moore, even sending him photographs of individuals involved in his abduction, identifying some of them and describing their roles, the complaint said.One photo, Mr. Tahlil wrote, depicted the man who had broken Mr. Moore\u2019s hand when he was taken hostage, according to the complaint. In other photos, Mr. Moore recognized some of his former guards.Some of Mr. Tahlil\u2019s messages were written in broken English, the complaint notes, and others were in Somali, which Mr. Moore used an online translator to read.In another exchange, Mr. Tahlil recalled how he had obtained medication for Mr. Moore and given him a radio, books, pens and other items during his captivity. The complaint showed Mr. Moore responded with gratitude.\u201cYou also brought me a little bottle of medicine from Hobyo to the ship,\u201d Mr. Moore wrote back. \u201cAll you wanted was a box of biscuits in return. I remember.\u201dMr. Tahlil has been detained without bond pending further proceedings. He could face life in prison if convicted. His lawyer and federal prosecutors in Manhattan declined to comment.Advertisement"}

Yeats warned us it wouldn\u2019t. Didion reminded us. And now, in America at least, the center is a vast, smoking pit across which two furious armies block each other on Twitter. Jonathan Lethem\u2019s new book may be billed as a detective novel for simplicity\u2019s sake \u2014 and to remind us of his breakthrough, \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d \u2014 but when did Lethem ever do anything simple? In \u201cThe Feral Detective,\u201d a Manhattanite named Phoebe Siegler hires a private eye and searches the outskirts of Los Angeles and the Mojave Desert for a friend\u2019s runaway daughter. What she\u2019s really looking for is a way to understand the world after the ascension of Donald Trump. Along the way, the book grows menacing and allegorical, and winks Lethem-ly at so many storytelling archetypes \u2014 the road movie, the journey into darkness, the return of the king, the Mad Max-ish dystopia \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to imagine such a strange machine actually flying.And it doesn\u2019t, not without turbulence.\u201cThe Feral Detective\u201d is full of pleasures and annoyances. It\u2019s a frustrating novel and, when you set it on the bedside table for the night, you feel like telling it, \u201cYou stay there until you can behave yourself.\u201d But while it\u2019s not essential Lethem, the book grows in your estimation in retrospect, and upon rereading, because of its ambitions, its sneaky tenderness and the relevance of its questions about identity and tribal warfare.Lethem introduces Phoebe with hasty, anthropological brush strokes because he\u2019s eager to get to the weird stuff on the menu: She\u2019s a 33-year-old journalist and Harvard grad. She grew up on the Upper East Side, where old issues of The New Yorker congregated in the master bathroom. Both her parents are shrinks. (Oy.) As the novel opens, it\u2019s November 2016. Phoebe has been shaken by the presidential election \u2014 \u201cI blamed my city for producing and being unable to defeat the monster in the tower\u201d \u2014 and when her bosses at The New York Times invite \u201cthe Beast-Elect\u201d into the building for a meet-and-greet, she quits in protest. (\u201cI think I won Facebook for that day, for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d) Eager to know what lurks beyond her liberal comfort zone, she heads to Los Angeles to search for 18-year-old Arabella, who fled the grid for reasons of her own. This is very much a novel about the lost looking for the lost. As the feral detective himself tells Phoebe laconically, \u201cWho\u2019s not missing?\u201dPhoebe enlists the help of the private eye in question, Charles Heist, early on and their relationship drives the book \u2014 sometimes powerfully, sometimes off the road. Heist is \u201cferal\u201d in the sense that he\u2019s rootless, unpredictable and hairy. He\u2019s about 20 years older than Phoebe. There\u2019s a freaky tween girl sleeping in his office until he can find a safe place for her and an opossum with a urinary tract infection residing in one of his desk drawers. Phoebe is both intrigued and repulsed by Heist. Having seen movies, you will recognize this as the prelude to soulful sex in the detective\u2019s sketchy trailer.Lethem\u2019s chief metaphor in \u201cThe Feral Detective\u201d finds the \u201cwild edge\u201d of Los Angeles \u2014 i.e., the city\u2019s proximity to the ocean and mountains \u2014 standing in for all that\u2019s volatile and unknown beneath the surface of society. An acquaintance of Phoebe\u2019s announces this theme in neon: \u201cYou can feel the civilization as this kind of thin layer that\u2019s just been troweled onto the landscape. It\u2019s, like, everything\u2019s provisional.\u201d (That\u2019s a Didion-esque passage, of course; she hovers overs this novel like an archangel.) Phoebe shadows Heist on an ugly, downward-spiraling search for Arabella. They question dispossessed men and women living in tunnels, stumble on a ritualistic double murder atop Mount Baldy and descend into the thick of two tense, nomadic tribes in the desert. One tribe, called the Rabbits, is largely female and vegan; the other, the Bears, has more of a Hells Angels vibe. The plot is high on incident but feels meandering and oddly tension-less for the first half of the book. And Phoebe \u2014Phoebe can be a problem. She\u2019s our guide and conscience, yet Lethem colors her character in so slowly that she\u2019s on the edge of a breakdown before we can grasp who she is. Phoebe is sarcastic and occasionally vulgar. She makes dangerous choices. She loathes Heist for his taciturn masculinity, then yearns to jump him again: \u201cI wanted to slap him, but I might have damaged the tender flesh of my hand on his die-cut features, his Brillo sideburns.\u201d At times, she seems less like somebody destabilized by the new political order and more like somebody tapering off Zoloft. It\u2019s not a sexist portrayal, but in a blind taste test you would know that this book was written by a man. Phoebe appears to be a mouthpiece for Lethem\u2019s own rage, and she\u2019s not an especially convincing portrait of a woman. It\u2019s not enough to have her use the word \u201cmenstrual\u201d and read Elena Ferrante.As for the feral detective, he\u2019s an enigma by design. The true mystery of the novel is not what became of Arabella (which proves anticlimactic), but who Charles Heist is and how his life story intersects with the history of the Rabbits and Bears. Phoebe tries to plumb the detective\u2019s depths with both charm and fury, but she\u2019s out of her element: \u201cSoon Heist was silent while I railed at him, amid empty hills born to swallow human language, carved by time to make my protests small.\u201dHalfway through the novel, Lethem just about switches genres on us as Phoebe and Heist are drawn into a gladiatorial battle in the desert involving the Bear clan and its throne. Lethem has taken us so far from the liberal bubble so fast that you\u2019ve either got to go with it or go home. Go with it. Even the author seems to know that he\u2019s pushed the plot over the top because he punctures the savagery with humor, as when Phoebe screams at the Bears watching the fight, telling them they\u2019re insane and demanding to know if they even voted. At its best, though, \u201cThe Feral Detective\u201d is a worthy morality play about our warring impulses for conflict and comfort. It asks who we are when we lose, or cast away, everything that was propping us up.Phoebe\u2019s relationship with Heist turns out to be unexpectedly moving, and she\u2019s transformed in a way that feels authentic. \u201cThe dark opened my eyes,\u201d she says of the desert at night. \u201cThe sky flooded in, without boundary. It was sick with stars, a hundred for every one I felt ought to exist. I had to keep an eye on them all at once, in case they began to fall.\u201d Lethem is often praised for the breadth of his imagination. But the most resonant moments here are tender and capture people searching for solace after trauma: \u201cIt was incredible that such broken things would presume to care for one another.\u201dAs in Didion\u2019s vintage nonfiction, the characters in \u201cThe Feral Detective\u201d suffer from a disorder caused by history itself. In \u201cThe White Album,\u201d Didion wrote wryly of her trip to a psychiatric clinic: \u201cAn attack of vertigo and nausea does not now seem to me an inappropriate response to the summer of 1968.\u201d Phoebe could say much the same thing 50 years later. You can get dizzy staring into the void where the center used to be.Jeff Giles is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and the author of the series \u201cThe Edge of Everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the city has benefited from Mr. Peters\u2019s tenure. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration needs rigorous oversight, just as much as the administrations of his predecessors did.As if to illustrate this point, on Friday, the same day Mr. Peters was fired, police officials announced that they were removing Deputy Chief Michael Osgood as the head of the sex crimes unit. Chief Osgood had spoken to Mr. Peters\u2019s agency about how his years of requests for additional resources had fallen on deaf ears at Police Headquarters.Among advocates who support survivors of sex crimes, Chief Osgood was regarded as a compassionate detective who had professionalized the Special Victims Division.

Companies are buying back stock and business investment is a mixed bag. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth. Those results weren\u2019t a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.Ten months after the law took effect, that promised \u201csupply-side\u201d bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus. It\u2019s still early, but here\u2019s what the numbers tell us so far: Proponents of the tax overhaul said it would supercharge the recent lackluster pace of business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology. Such spending is crucial to keeping economic growth strong. And strong growth is central to Republican claims that the tax cuts would ultimately pay for themselves.Capital spending did pick up steam earlier this year. For companies in the S&P 500, capital expenditures rose roughly 20 percent in the first half of 2018. Much of that was concentrated: The spending of just five companies \u2014 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, and Facebook, Intel, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs \u2014 accounted for roughly a third of the entire rise. Much of that spending went toward technology, including increased investment in data centers and computing, server and networking capacity. For the full year, Goldman Sachs analysts expect that capital expenditures for companies in the S&P 500 will be up about 14 percent, to $715 billion. Research and development spending, another component of business investment, was expected to be up 12 percent, to $340 billion.For the economy as a whole, the surge in business investment was a bit less impressive. It\u2019s true that business spending on fixed investment \u2014 such as machinery, buildings and equipment \u2014 rose, jumping 11.5 percent and 8.7 percent during the first and second quarters. The first-quarter jump was the fastest for investment since 2011. But that pace fizzled during the third quarter. Recently data showed third-quarter business investment rose at an annual pace of 0.8 percent. The last quarter of the year \u2014 traditionally a big one for capital spending \u2014 will fill out the picture, but that data won\u2019t be released until early 2019. It will likely take years to get a better sense of whether the law fundamentally reshaped American corporate investment. But there\u2019s little clear evidence that it is drastically reshaping the way in which most companies invest and spend.The results of a survey published in late October by the National Association for Business Economics showed that 81 percent of the 116 companies surveyed said they had not changed plans for investment or hiring because of the tax bill. Cheerleaders for the tax cut argued that the heart of the law \u2014 cutting and restructuring taxes for corporations \u2014 would give the economy a positive bump, giving companies incentives to invest more, hire more workers and pay higher wages. Skeptics said that the money companies saved through tax cuts would merely increase corporate profits, rather than trickling down to workers. JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that in the first half of 2018, about $270 billion in corporate profits previously held overseas were repatriated to the United States and spent as a result of changes to the tax code. Some 46 percent of that, JPMorgan Chase analysts said, was spent on $124 billion in stock buybacks. Supporters of the tax cuts repeatedly claimed the bill would increase economic growth enough to offset the decline in tax receipts. \u201cI'm totally convinced this is a revenue-neutral bill,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, when a preliminary version of the bill was approved in the Senate in December 2017. It\u2019s highly unusual for deficits and borrowing needs to grow this much during periods of prosperity. A broad variety of analysts attribute the widening deficit to the tax cuts (along with increased military and other domestic spending ushered in through a bill Mr. Trump signed earlier this year). The growing budget gap means the Treasury must borrow more to keep the government running. The Treasury expects to borrow a total of $1.338 trillion from global investors this calendar year. That would be 145 percent higher than the $546 billion the federal government borrowed last year. That would be the highest level of borrowing since 2010, when the American economy was struggling to recover from the great recession. Data from large public companies, however, suggest that most workers received relatively small shares of their employers\u2019 corporate tax savings. Workers for those companies were more likely to see their wages rise if they lived in states where the minimum wage was relatively low \u2014 and where companies do not have to pay workers more to compensate for high housing costs. California workers at those companies saw an average benefit of about $160 each, which is less than half the average benefit for workers in Kentucky.Many companies also said they would use tax savings to create jobs. But the Just Capital research finds that, since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance. They have announced the elimination of nearly 140,000 jobs \u2014 which is almost double the 73,000 jobs they say they have created in that time. About half of those net losses came from companies in the restaurant and leisure industries, the analysis found. By Republicans\u2019 own economic theories, it should take a while for corporate tax cuts to translate into higher worker pay. First, the cuts need to stimulate increased capital investments, which in turn raise worker productivity. More productive workers would then see their wages rise accordingly. Productivity grew 3 percent in the second quarter of this year and 2.2 percent in the third \u2014 healthy numbers, which will need to continue apace to deliver the sort of long-term economic jolt Republicans promised.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dementia Is Getting Some Very Public Faces", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe new old ageStigma often prevents patients from acknowledging an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. A series of high-profile disclosures may help change that. \u201cAs this condition has progressed, I am no longer able to participate in public life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want to be open about these changes, and while I am still able, share some personal thoughts.\u201dIt meant something to Ms. Lynn\u2019s participants that the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court would acknowledge, at 88, that she had the same relentless disease that was claiming their husbands and wives (and that killed Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s husband, too, in 2009).\u201cThere\u2019s so much stigma,\u201d Ms. Lynn said. \u201cCaregivers feel so isolated and lonely. They were happy that she would bring light and public attention to this disease.\u201dJustice O\u2019Connor had joined a growing but still tiny group: public figures who choose to share a dementia diagnosis.\u201cIn opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition,\u201d the former president wrote. \u201cPerhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it.\u201dActor Gene Wilder\u2019s family waited until his death in 2016, explaining that they feared children might be disturbed by an ailing Willy Wonka.One might question what such actions actually accomplish for the people coping with dementia and those who shoulder their care.Already, Alzheimer\u2019s has become the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older \u2014 and the only one for which medicine can\u2019t yet offer prevention or treatment.One promising drug after another has proved ineffective in clinical trials. How can \u201craising awareness\u201d make any difference?But researchers and advocates argue that Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s forthright statement does serve a positive purpose.Among her Penn patients, \u201ca strong majority are hesitant to share the information with other people,\u201d Ms. Lynn said. They worry that others will treat them with pity or condescension, that their friends will drop away and their social lives shrivel \u2014 all justifiable fears. People often do withdraw as their neighbors and friends grow progressively more demented.But patients also think, \u201cIf someone very well known can say she has this, it might be O.K. for me to say it, too,\u201d Ms. Lynn said.Openness about dementia, instead of hiding it, could lead to earlier diagnoses, said Shana Stites, a clinical psychologist and researcher at the Penn Memory Center. She ticked off several ways that can help.\u201cA diagnosis explains what\u2019s happening, why you\u2019re not remembering, why you\u2019re behaving this way,\u201d Dr. Stites said. As dreaded as that news may be, patients and those around them sometimes feel relieved when their problems acquire a name and a medical label. Moreover, when people avoid knowing, \u201cit takes away the opportunity for the family to get prepared, for the person and the family to educate themselves,\u201d said Beth Kallmyer, vice president of care and support at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.Dementia care is a long haul. Understanding the disease and its prognosis allows time to assemble a health care team, to mobilize family, to seek legal and financial advice.Early diagnosis can benefit research, too, which increasingly focuses on people in the beginning stages of disease. That requires diagnosed participants willing to enroll in clinical trials.Finally, \u201cpublic figures who come forward do a lot to normalize the condition,\u201d Dr. Stites said. \u201cYes, this happens. It\u2019s reality.\u201dLet\u2019s not prettify that reality. True, people may have several years after diagnosis in which to enjoy their lives, to remain productive and engaged, before symptoms intensify.That shouldn\u2019t make it a source of shame, a whispered-about disease, as cancer was 60 years ago or AIDS was 30 years ago.Jeffrey Draine and his wife Debora Dunbar mustered their courage in 2016.Dr. Draine, a professor of social work at Temple University, had developed puzzling behavior \u2014 leaving the front door to their house ajar, neglecting the bills, driving uncertainly.It took several years to get a diagnosis: first mild cognitive impairment, then early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Dr. Draine, now 55, was still teaching. \u201cI wanted to be able to leave when I decided it was time, not when someone else thought it was time,\u201d he said.He sought accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act; the university provided an assistant to help him stay organized.Then, because \u201cI wanted to be the one who made the announcement,\u201d he faced his colleagues at a faculty meeting and explained his illness.\u201cI got really positive responses,\u201d Dr. Draine recalled. \u201cPeople acknowledged what I was doing and expressed respect and empathy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been beneficial to us as a family,\u201d Ms. Dunbar added. \u201cIt\u2019s made us feel encircled by a community that understands.\u201dIn the meantime, having people around us, famous or not, talk frankly about dementia may render the supposedly unspeakable a more everyday occurrence. Because it is one.\u201cThe benefits, what this does for others living with the disease, the example it sets for the general public \u2014 it\u2019s crucial,\u201d Dr. Stites said.Advertisement"}

The old but new Texas menu was scrumptious too: medallions of prime, aged beef tenderloin with zinfandel glac\u00e9 and horseradish basil sour cream paired perfectly with the jalape\u00f1o grits souffl\u00e9. And, the champagne was really, really good. It wasn\u2019t surprising that this crowd had repaid the honor of their presence with a tally of $5.4 million in donations to the Baker Institute.It was cozy and warm inside the tent, and not just because of the temperature: This was a bipartisan crowd of older and younger Bushies and big-ticket Obama backers, many of whom had known one another for ages and had managed to go along to get along, despite a few hitches during the \u201c43\u201d years.But despite all, the hint of a very chilly winter was in the air. Mr. Baker is still sharp at 88, and Barack Obama, though graying at the temples after eight years in office, is a mere 57, but you couldn\u2019t help feeling that the current climate \u2014 the metaphorical one \u2014 had left them, and their audience of political moderates, out in the cold.The contrast with the current administration was impossible to ignore. There was pointed observation from the dais that two men from different political parties could \u201creach across the aisle\u201d and have a civil discussion. There was all that erudition: three people on a stage who could discuss the post-World War II order with \u2026 actual facts and institutional knowledge. F.D.R.? Harry Truman? George Marshall? Seriously?And there was an abundance of good manners. Mr. Meacham slipped only once, referring to you-know-who as \u201cVoldemort.\u201d Mr. Baker noted that the 1986 Tax Reform Act he helped Ronald Reagan pass with the aid of the House speaker, Tip O\u2019Neill \u2014 you remember him, right? \u2014 was \u201crevenue neutral\u201d \u2014 which did not add gazillions of dollars to the deficit.Mr. Obama mentioned that \u201cnot only did I not get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted.\u201d It was a little like listening to your grandpa and your dad reminisce about the good old days.Still, it was clear that both men had been trying like hell to figure out Where We Went Wrong, how the world they had built was now broken in two, and the country they had tried so hard to strengthen had, just a day before, tear-gassed women and children to keep them from entering the United States via our southern border.Mr. Baker, the ultimate, indefatigable pol, was more inclined toward political failings: Our representatives don\u2019t live in Washington anymore or socialize with one another; gerrymandering, which guaranteed safe districts for members of both parties; the media. \u201cDivisiveness sells. Comity doesn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Obama, being himself, took a deeper cut. He, too, decried the perpetual campaign, the gerrymandering and the destructiveness of the dysfunction in Washington, which, he said, doesn\u2019t just weaken our influence globally, \u201cIt ramps up disorder all over the world.\u201d He was clearly trying out themes on the road for his next book; the word \u201cconsensus\u201d came up a lot, as in that historical consensus that had supposedly kept us together since World War II but wasn\u2019t working so well anymore.More willing to point the finger inward, Mr. Obama indicated that the economic differences between urban and rural folks in the United States created divisions that had gone unacknowledged for too long, as had the fault line of race. (\u201cIdentity politics,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cstarted with Jim Crow.\u201d) And then there was the gender issue: In the past, \u201cthere weren\u2019t any women to say what you guys are doing is stupid,\u201d he said, referring to Congress.\u201dThat got a big laugh, and the one-hour discussion earned a respectful standing ovation. This wasn\u2019t a foot-stomping, war-whooping crowd. The hour was late, and people were rushing for their cars, anxious to find their way home in the darkness.Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Couples and Wedding Planners Seek New Sites During California Wildfires", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was 10:30 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 12, and Hilary Wagner was getting choked up. She and her fianc\u00e9, Tyler Train, were driving to Pelican Hill Golf Club in Newport Beach, Calif., where they\u2019d be scouting the oceanside resort for their upcoming nuptials. Ms. Wagner\u2019s tears might have been happy ones if she and Mr. Train were making the trip willingly rather than under duress. But the pair, both 28, were dealing with the unthinkable: Less than a week ahead of their Nov. 17 wedding, they learned that their original venue, Saddlerock Ranch vineyard in Malibu, Calif., had been severely damaged in the Woolsey Fire, one of several violent infernos currently ravaging parts of the state.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get any real-time information about venues that had burned down,\u201d Ms. Wagner said. \u201cLast Friday we stayed up all night crying, but we kept holding out hope. We thought maybe Saddlerock was spared.\u201dSunday morning brought bad news directly from Saddlerock Ranch. It was closed, and it would stay that way as long as roads remain closed to the public. The revelation left them reeling, but Ms. Wagner and Mr. Train had 125 guests to think about. Half were traveling to California for the event from New York, Florida and their home state of Texas. And so they changed course. \u201cI started calling and emailing venues,\u201d Ms. Wagner said. \u201cI even put friends and family on it.\u201dAmong the 57,000 structures in the line of the Woolsey Fire, many were set to host wedding celebrations in the coming weeks, including the Lodge at Malibou Lake in Agoura Hills, Calif.\u201cBy 7 a.m. on Friday morning, my phone was blowing up,\u201d said Cordelia Culver, the Lodge managing director and caterer. \u201cThere was a huge amount of tension, not knowing whether our venue was being burned to the ground or not.\u201d Ultimately the structure was spared, but an evacuation forced Ms. Culver to cancel the next day\u2019s event. \u201cAt first you\u2019re like, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll be able to have a wedding,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen you just have to make the call that clearly that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dMs. Culver, 44, took to social media in the hope of finding a replacement venue for the Lodge\u2019s Nov. 10 client, which is when she teamed with Jessica Carrillo, the owner of Art & Soul Events in West Los Angeles and an administrator in the wedding-themed Facebook group \u201cSomething Borrowed, Something New.\u201dTogether they along with others in the events community became a de facto crisis response team, acting fast to compile a living document of bookable venues and vendors and make it available to the group\u2019s nearly 8,000 members. \u201cThere were so many things being retweeted that weren\u2019t true about which venues are standing and which ones aren\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Carrillo, 36, said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there are any sort of emergency help vendors, but if you\u2019re one of those couples who didn\u2019t hire a wedding planner, you\u2019re at a complete loss. So I thought, let me just get some names and dates and contact information for anyone that\u2019s scrambling.\u201dThanks to their quick thinking, Ms. Culver was able to move the Nov. 10 wedding to a space called the Holding Company in the Los Angeles suburb of Westlake. \u201cThe bride and groom were so thankful,\u201d Ms. Culver said. \u201cI\u2019ve been catering weddings for over a decade, and this is what you do. You produce. You make it happen. Our Sunday bride we refunded, though, because she couldn\u2019t let go of the dream of a Lodge wedding.\u201dMs. Wagner faced a similar internal struggle during the relocation process. \u201cWhat makes me most sad is that no matter where I go, I\u2019m giving up my vision,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the hardest thing. I had this dream of a winery wedding, and all of a sudden, it\u2019s gone.\u201dBut she\u2019s grateful to have some perspective. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the worst situation. People are losing their homes.\u201dMs. Culver feels similarly. \u201cIt\u2019s like triaging an emergency but also knowing this is a wedding,\u201d she said.\u201cEvery time I get an email from a vendor it makes me cry \u2014 they\u2019ve been so understanding,\u201d Ms. Wagner said. \u201cAnd the venues are jumping through hoops to make this happen. When we first got engaged our dream location was actually Pelican Hill, but it ended up being way too expensive. But as soon as I called and explained, they said, \u2018We have an opening Nov. 17, and we want to make it work.\u2019 I can\u2019t believe that out of all the craziness and devastation, our dream venue happens to be open, and they happen to be willing to throw us a bone. It\u2019s crazy how much good will people have in these situations.\u201dIn a state where wildfires are commonplace, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for couples to plan around fire season (which typically peaks in September and early October). And yet Ms. Culver finds such foresight to be a rarity. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody thinks about that,\u201d she sad. \u201cBut I think they will now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Bad Jokes Can Make Good Thanksgiving Wines", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of the TimesAgile, energetic wines that are versatile with many foods are best for the holiday feast. But with delicious food and lively company, it\u2019s hard to go wrong.Somewhere in this great land on Thanksgiving Day, a guest on the corny side will arrive at the feast, grinning and bearing a bottle of Turkish wine.\u201cTurkey for the turkey,\u201d he will say. The hosts will graciously accept the prize even as they groan inwardly. And yet, the jester might have it exactly right.At the wine panel\u2019s annual pre-Thanksgiving meal, where we test out wines to see what might go best with the turkey and sides, the guy who brought that wine was our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.Good Thanksgiving wines can come from anywhere, and anybody. They can be red or white, ros\u00e9 or orange, sparkling or still. As widely as the wines might range, we have, in the panel\u2019s many Thanksgiving run-throughs over the years, consolidated the characteristics that comprise the best Thanksgiving wines.Here\u2019s how our tasting works: Each member of the Thanksgiving panel \u2014 Florence Fabricant, Julia Moskin and Pete Wells, along with Bernie and me \u2014 brings two wines, a white and a red, each costing no more than $25.We imagine an unruly feast, with lots of people, perhaps served buffet-style. For a big group, chances are nobody will want an exorbitant wine bill, hence our price cap.Our feast is festive, but maybe not so grand. We imagine, with a crowd, that stemware might not be an option. If not, glass tumblers are fine for these wines. If you must use plastic, beware the flimsy pretend stemware. The benefits are negligible and not worth the risk of spills. Opt for tumblers instead.We emphasize that choosing wines for Thanksgiving is not an exercise in pairing. The meal \u2014 especially the sort of potluck buffet where guests bring all sorts of family favorites \u2014 is too complex and disparate to worry about precision matching.Instead, we suggest picking versatile wines that go with many different sorts of flavors. And we are wary of wines that are more than 14 percent alcohol.Some people argue that the alcohol level is meaningless, as long as the wine is balanced. I don\u2019t buy that in general. But Thanksgiving in particular is a long, fatiguing journey, literally and figuratively: Many people travel over hills, dales and interstates to feast on the myriad filling dishes that cover the table. Don\u2019t add to the languor with heavy, alcoholic wines.We prefer wines that are nimble and energetic, that refresh the palate rather than enervate. Usually, these are wines with lively acidity, which snaps the mouth to attention and merges well with many flavors. While acidity is a friend, pronounced tannins, oakiness and unbalanced sweetness are not. Avoid them if possible.Have plenty of both white and red. As this is not an exercise in pairing, give guests a choice. Many people prefer one or the other, sometimes for reasons that may seem specious, but this is not the occasion to argue a point. It\u2019s fine to add sparkling wine, ros\u00e9 or another bottle to the mix as accents or extras. For a small gathering, you can serve these additional selections with courses as you see fit. But for a big group, red and white are the way to go.The challenge is to add to the list. Julia succeeded admirably, at least with one of her wines, which turned out to be our top white. It was the 2016 Cuv\u00e9e de O from Avancia, made from godello grapes grown in the Valdeorras region of Galicia, in northwestern Spain.\u201cIt\u2019s got great balance, and is perfect for people who like wines that aren\u2019t fruity,\u201d Julia said.Neutral would also describe our No. 2 white, the 2015 pinot blanc from the excellent Eyrie Vineyard in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. It\u2019s a subtle, floral and mineral wine, which I brought and which Pete called \u201cmoody.\u201dFlorence\u2019s white, the 2017 Moulin de Gassac Guilhem Blanc from Mas de Daumas Gassac in the Languedoc, was actually a tried-and-true style, and it showed why. The wine, made about equally of sauvignon blanc, grenache blanc and clairette, was lively and pungent, and would be a crowd pleaser. At just $11 a bottle, it was also our best value among the whites.No. 4, the 2015 Polarity from Heart & Hands in the Finger Lakes, was an oddball. Though made of pinot noir, it was vinified as a white, with the grape juice immediately whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins. The wine was still a bit pink, more ros\u00e9 than white, and quite pleasant, if not memorable.In theory, it should have been a great match, but this particular Vouvray was not an inspiring effort. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent for people who don\u2019t like wine,\u201d Julia concluded.That left Pete\u2019s white, the Borealis from Montinore Estate in the Willamette Valley, a blend of M\u00fcller-Thurgau, gew\u00fcrztraminer, riesling and pinot gris from multiple vintages. It seemed a bit heavy and unbalanced.Pete said he was trying to demonstrate the utility of Alsatian-inspired wines, a point he made more successfully in 2014 when he brought an excellent gew\u00fcrztraminer from Eminence Road, a good Finger Lakes producer. I should add that both pinot noirs and rieslings from Montinore have done well in previous Thanksgiving panels.The wine was made mostly of cabernet franc, with some gamay thrown in, and was light-bodied and fresh, as might be expected from a project involving Steve Edmunds, who makes wonderful wines at Edmunds St. John.Our last two bottles were efforts by Florence and Pete to rehabilitate zinfandel as a go-to wine for Thanksgiving. It used to be highly recommended as the perfect all-American wine for this all-American holiday, and the impulse is not wrong. I have stepped away from recommending zinfandel, as most nowadays are too high in alcohol. Florence\u2019s bottle, Cline\u2019s 2015 Ancient Vines zinfandel from Contra Costa County, was bold and spicy, but also 15 percent alcohol.That\u2019s not such a bad way to give thanks.Balanced, textured and energetic, with a touch of refreshing bitterness. (Martin Scott Wines, New York)Well-balanced, with subtle aromas and flavors of flowers and pears, and an underlying minerality.Best ValueFresh, lively and pungent. A straightforward crowd-pleaser. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.)Made of pinot noir, and more ros\u00e9 than white, it is pleasant, with light mineral and herbal notes.Lightly sweet, lightly fruity, balanced and pleasant. (Esprit du Vin, Boca Raton, Fla.)Straightforward \u2014 though a bit weighty and a touch sweet \u2014 with floral, citrus and clove flavors.Balanced and energetic, with fresh red fruit aromas and woodsy, autumnal flavors.Lightly tannic, with flavors of fresh fruits, herbs and a pleasant touch of funk.

But some reviled Irving Berlin for his presumption, as an immigrant and a Jew, in having written it at all.Mr. Kaplan\u2019s biography of Irving Berlin, \u201cNew York Genius,\u201d will be published next fall.On Nov. 10, 1938, one day after Kristallnacht and the eve of Armistice Day, the radio and recording star Kate Smith, the \u201cSongbird of the South,\u201d spoke the following words on her weekly CBS show: \u201cAnd now it\u2019s going to be my very great privilege to sing for you a song that\u2019s never been sung before by anybody \u2026 It\u2019s something more than a song \u2014 I feel it\u2019s one of the most beautiful compositions ever written, a song that will never die. The author, Mr. Irving Berlin. The title, \u2018God Bless America.\u2019\u201dThe reaction was swift and powerful: America loved \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d The song quickly became omnipresent. Thousands of ordinary citizens sang it every day, in schools and churches and at all manner of public gatherings \u2014 even at least one meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution. \u201cWhen the song was played at Brooklyn\u2019s Ebbets Field Memorial Day,\u201d The New York Times reported, \u201cthe crowd rose and uncovered as if for the national anthem.\u201dBut Berlin changed his mind about putting the tune in the show: It felt \u201cjust a little sticky\u201d to him. He relegated it to his song trunk for 20 years \u2014 then, in the tense fall of 1938, Kate Smith\u2019s manager approached him, looking for a number for Smith to sing on Armistice Day. Berlin went to his trunk.It was a frightening time. A time when \u2014 right in Berlin\u2019s hometown \u2014 Fritz Kuhn\u2019s German-American Bund could draw a crowd of 20,000 homegrown Nazi sympathizers to a rally in Madison Square Garden. A rally where, in between \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d and \u201cThe Stars and Stripes Forever,\u201d Kuhn blamed \u201cJewish financiers\u201d for getting America into World War I; where the Bund\u2019s national public-relations counsel, G.W. Kunze, declaimed, \u201cIf Franklin Rosenfeld takes the place of George Washington, so in the cultural life Beethoven is replaced by Irving Berlin and the like.\u201dThis was the fringe, but the fringe was scarily close to the main fabric of American life in those prewar years. It was a time when Jews, even wealthy and famous Jews like Irving Berlin, had to watch their step \u2014 and very soon, worry about the times to come.And now our own frightening time. A time when a right-wing fringe, scarily close to the main fabric of American life and encouraged by our president, blames Jewish financiers for helping to bring immigrant hordes into the country. A time when some of that fringe\u2019s sympathizers are taking matters into their own violent hands. A time when, at a rally held by President Trump in Illinois last month, a little girl in a red T-shirt sat on her father\u2019s shoulders and listened to the president drum up fear about those immigrant hordes.

{"Headline": "Will Amazon Ruin or Revitalize New York City?", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York\u2019s not ready for Amazon\u2019s HQ2, but here\u2019s how the city can get there.After a nationwide campaign, Amazon selected Long Island City in New York as one of two locations for expanding its headquarters. The company\u2019s decisions about whom it hires and how quickly, and where those workers choose to live, will affect how much the expansion changes the city. Jenny Schuetz from the Brookings Institution and Elizabeth Goldstein from the Municipal Art Society offer two views on how to prepare.Ms. Schuetz is a fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program.Business, manufacturing and commercial zonesResidential and other zonesQUEENSMANHATTANAmazon\u2019sexistingManhattanofficeAmazon\u2019sproposedlocationGoogle\u2019sofficeTwitter\u2019sofficeFacebook\u2019sofficeBROOKLYNNew York1 MILEBusiness, manufacturing and commercial zonesResidential and other zonesMANHATTANQUEENSAmazon\u2019sexistingManhattanofficeAmazon\u2019sproposedlocationGoogle\u2019sofficeTwitter\u2019sofficeFacebook\u2019sofficeBROOKLYNNew York1 MILEBy The New York TimesWith Amazon\u2019s HQ2 announcement, residents of Long Island City, Queens, are worried that the rapid growth in housing prices that has plagued the South Lake Union area of Seattle, where Amazon has its headquarters, will soon come to their neighborhood.They certainly have cause for worry: The steepest increases in housing prices in Seattle have occurred in the past five years as Amazon has rapidly expanded. The expected buildup for Amazon\u2019s HQ2 outpost in New York, 25,000 employees over 10 years starting next year, mirrors the company\u2019s recent growth in Seattle.But there are no indications that the impact on New York will be apocalyptic. First, the number of jobs is small relative to the city\u2019s labor market and population. Second, Long Island City is better equipped than many parts of the city to accommodate a corporate campus and the additional office space, housing and services it would require. The neighborhood\u2019s zoning rules allow for taller buildings than in areas like, say, brownstone Brooklyn.Still, there are many unknowns.How many of Amazon\u2019s highly paid employees will want to live close to the campus? Young workers without children are likely to prefer living within one or two miles of the office, driving demand for studio and one-bedroom rental apartments, and amenities such as coffee shops, restaurants and bike paths.By contrast, highly paid employees with school-aged children are more willing to tolerate longer commutes to live in neighborhoods with larger apartments, high-performing public schools and family-friendly parks, such as TriBeCa, Carroll Gardens and Jackson Heights.Another question is how many lower-paid employees Amazon plans to hire. Administrative assistants and maintenance staff workers will earn much less than the $150,000 average salary Amazon promises for HQ2. The proposed campus is near the nation\u2019s largest public housing development, Queensbridge Houses, and the community district that includes Long Island City has nearly 19,000 subsidized housing units. But low- and moderate-income workers who don\u2019t already live in subsidized or rent-stabilized apartments may get priced out of the area.The city needs to build more housing, more cheaply, especially in affluent neighborhoods closer to business districts. The aging and dwindling supply of subsidized and rent-stabilized units will require infusions of public resources to remain habitable and affordable.Finally, it\u2019s not yet known how many current city residents Amazon will hire. If it recruits engineers from Google or Twitter in Chelsea, or from Facebook near Union Square, that won\u2019t create demand for new apartments, although those engineers might move to shorten their commutes.With so much unknown, the city and the state can make smart choices now by investing in more housing, school capacity and upgraded transit citywide.Ms. Goldstein is the president of the Municipal Art Society.Queensbridge Houses,the nation\u2019s largestpublic housing projectQUEENSAnable Basin,proposed locationfor Amazon\u2019s HQ2SPECIALPURPOSEDISTRICTEast RiverThe Special Long IslandCity Mixed Use Districtallows for taller buildingsand greater densityP.S. 78,which isalreadyat 131%capacity1,000 FEETQueensbridge Houses,the nation\u2019s largestpublic housing projectEast RiverQUEENSAnable Basin,proposed locationfor Amazon\u2019s HQ2SPECIALPURPOSEDISTRICTP.S. 78,which isalreadyat 131%capacityThe Special Long Island City Mixed Use District allows for taller buildings and greater density1,000 FEETNote: Area boundaries approximate. Sources: City of New York; Municipal Art Society of New York | By The New York TimesTo Jeff Bezos, I want to say, \u201cWelcome to Queens!\u201d I want to tell you more about the neighborhood you and Amazon are moving into.Long Island City is an exhilarating, diverse and rapidly growing community. Much of this growth was the result of a 2001 rezoning in which the city sought to spur commercial development in what had been a manufacturing area. But a boom in commercial development is not what we got.Instead, the zoning changes led to the construction of 10,000 new residential units, vastly more than the 300 projected, according to the Municipal Art Society\u2019s latest report. Residential neighborhoods need things that commercial districts do not, and it turns out that if you underestimate the number of new residences by more than 3,200 percent, something has to give.Your arrival may indeed catalyze the central business district envisioned in 2001. But Long Island City is now a primarily residential neighborhood with critical needs that must be addressed.Today, seven out of nine elementary schools in Long Island City are overcrowded; one of them operates at 212 percent of capacity. Ridership at the neighborhood\u2019s two subway stations, Court Square and Queensboro Plaza, has increased at seven times the citywide rate.With one-third of an acre of open space for every 1,000 people, Long Island City residents enjoy only one-fifth of the median open space available to New Yorkers. And the Anable Basin, on which Amazon\u2019s proposed campus sits, is within a federally designated high-risk flood zone.Meanwhile, median household income in Long Island City jumped to $123,000 from $53,000 from 2000 to 2016. The housing that has been built is largely high-end luxury, out of range for the average New Yorker.Even the affordable units planned as part of a recent rezoning of Anable Basin now appear to be in jeopardy, as the site will instead be used to create office space for as many as 25,000 Amazon workers.The company cannot insulate itself from the difficulties facing this neighborhood by relying on the same campus model used in Seattle and Silicon Valley. A self-contained office park is a distinctly un-New York concept. Amazon employees may want to live in Long Island City to be close to work, and the fragile state of mass transit and overburdened schools will be an everyday issue. Amazon won\u2019t be able to ignore the subway crisis with corporate shuttle buses.Mr. Bezos, your influence over the politics of New York is enormous right now. Our governor and mayor spent months to win you over, and your satisfaction is important to them.But you will also have to contend with a large and diverse City Council that has so far been cut out of the process that brought you here. Will you choose to leverage that attention to demand long overdue relief for the residents of this neighborhood, and work with our local leaders to build a vision for a strong city of the future?Elizabeth Goldstein is the president of the Municipal Art Society.

{"Headline": "Want Faster Airline Customer Service? Try Tweeting", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTired of endless phone trees and long hold times? You may find that using social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook is a better way to get attention from the airlines.The open-plan space on the second floor is crowded with workers\u2019 desks and lots of televisions turned to the AccuWeather channel. White noise is pumped overhead, sounding like the roar of a distant airplane, helping to mute the sound of a legion of employees monitoring the more than 6,700 flights the airline runs each day.Among the small group on the bridge this Monday morning is Lynn Stines, a social media customer service representative, whose job it is to translate the gripes and experiences of customers posted on social channels and relay them to the people in the room who can help them. Or as she put it, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to be the voice of customer.\u201dMs. Stines, 53, of Dallas, begins her day by scrolling through Snap, a program that allows her to interact with customers on Twitter. Snap displays users\u2019 bios, their number of followers, and the history of their conversation with American Airlines. The social care team fields 4,500 tweets per day and a clock on her screen indicated the average response time. On this morning, it was 15 minutes below the 30-minute response time goal the team has set for itself. No turbulence so far.After scrolling for a few minutes, Ms. Stines saw a tweet from someone who she suspected had a lot of \u201cchimers,\u201d or followers who like to \u201cchime in\u201d on conversations. Chimers tend to follow those with big social media presences: TV stars and professional video game players and Instagram celebrities, she explained. She likes to take care of users with potential chimers quickly, she said, to avoid future problems.When it comes to customer service, travelers are increasingly skipping calls to the airlines and are instead taking their requests to Twitter and Facebook. Airlines are responding by expanding their social media staff and empowering them with the resources they need to aid travelers.Michelle Mohr, the managing director of operations communications for American Airlines, said that social media members today \u201cmust be able to develop a sixth sense or an intuition of when something they see on social is going to be a trigger,\u201d and then quickly defuse it before it becomes viral. \u201cThey need a good knowledge of pop culture, a knowledge of politics, and a generally good understanding what\u2019s going on the in culture,\u201d she said.Mr. Rollason noted that an agent working on a private social channel can handle six conversations simultaneously compared to one over the phone.Among those who recently turned to social media in a crisis was Nikki-Colette Manzie, 28, when she was at Los Angeles International Airport, well past midnight, trying to rebook a trip to Flint, Mich., after missing her connecting flight. After looking at the long line of people in front of her at the American Airlines customer service desk, she decided to take to Twitter. She got out her phone, went to her Twitter app, and sent the airline a direct message about her dilemma. Within two minutes, she got back a response, \u201cWhat\u2019s your record locator?\u201d Three minutes after that, she was booked on a new flight.\u201cShout out to @AmericanAir for the fastest customer service I\u2019ve ever received,\u201d she tweeted out shortly afterward.Social media staffers said there are lots of things they can do that their colleagues on the phone can\u2019t, like send passengers a link so they can track checked bags or solve any problems from start to finish without transferring them to another department.And they said that they try to respond to every tweet directed at them. Even the nasty ones.\u201cA lot of people come here to vent,\u201d said Zachary Greiner, 22, a social media customer experiences representative. \u201cIts hard, but you can\u2019t take it personally.\u201dHis remedy for irate customers? An apology. \u201cA lot of time people just want someone to take responsibility for a mistake,\u201d he said.Ms. Stines, who has worked for American Airlines for 22 years, said she can even surprise herself. Recently, her Twitter feed was flooded with images of long lines at the TSA check in at St. Thomas, and many people were missing flights. She tipped off an airline manager who sent a plane down to the island and get travelers home.Ordering up a new plane? \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Be Grateful Without Rolling Your Eyes", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySure, telling dinner guests what you\u2019re thankful for can feel contrived. Do it anyway. Mr. Jacobs is the author of a recent book on gratitude.In our house, it has always been the most dreaded part of Thanksgiving. More painful than hand-scrubbing the casserole pan. More excruciating than listening to our libertarian cousin. I speak of the custom of forced gratitude \u2014 of going around the table and telling everyone what we\u2019re thankful for.For years, the Jacobs family responses, mine included, were almost always disappointingly bland (\u201cI\u2019m thankful for my family\u201d) or relentlessly inane (\u201cI\u2019m thankful for my Nintendo Switch.\u201d)Still, I believed it was a ritual worth saving. Not because I am particularly sentimental. But because there are so few moments in life when we battle our brain\u2019s built-in negativity bias.There are scientific and health benefits to gratitude, too. I\u2019ve discovered those in the past couple of years, as I\u2019ve been working on a book about gratitude. So I\u2019ve been on a campaign to update the gratitude ritual, to rescue it. My strategies:Embrace six degrees of gratitude. Our meals \u2014 along with every other thing in our lives \u2014 are dependent on hundreds of people that many of us take for granted.At Thanksgiving last year, we held a family competition to see who could come up with the most obscure person on our dinner\u2019s supply chain. My 12-year-old son thanked the farmer who grew the cranberries for the sauce (Not bad). Another relative thanked the trucker who drove the cranberries to the factory (Decent). Someone thanked the designer of the logo on the stop sign so the truck didn\u2019t get in an accident (Getting there). My nephew thanked the miner in South America who got the copper for the wiring in the traffic lights. (Pretty good).Obscurity, and unrecognized genius, surrounds us. You know that steel can of pumpkin pie filling? Someone designed the ribbing on that can \u2014 those horizontal ridges \u2014 because it makes the can more durable and resistant to dents. Those metal clips my sister-in-law uses to keep the tablecloth in place? There\u2019s no gravy in my lap, and I have the inventor to thank.I recently asked one of my smartest friends \u2014 a philosophy professor at Oxford \u2014 what he\u2019s grateful for. I expected something like \u201cthe capacity for human progress\u201d or \u201cthe fugues of Joseph Haydn.\u201d His actual answer? \u201cSometimes I\u2019m just grateful I have arms.\u201dIt\u2019s an odd response. But I love it. Arms are, in fact, something to be grateful for. And his response points out how important it is to be thankful for things so omnipresent that they can escape our notice.Reading the apocalyptic news, it can seem sometimes as though there isn\u2019t much to be thankful for, current events-wise.But the good old days were not good at all. They were violent, disease-ridden, smellier \u2014 and people were more sexist, racist and homophobic. Whenever I start to mythologize the past, I repeat a three-word mantra I made up: \u201cSurgery without anesthesia.\u201d And for fun and games, those 17th-century revelers didn\u2019t play Balderdash or touch football. A popular party game of the day was Kick the Shins, which is pretty much what it sounds like. You kick one another\u2019s shins till one of you falls down. Even \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops 4\u201d seems preferable.Go around the table, thanking A to Z. The first person must think of something to be thankful for that begins with the letter \u201cA\u201d (e.g., animal videos on YouTube featuring interspecies cuddling). The second with \u201cB\u201d (e.g., the \u201cBarry\u201d producers for casting Henry Winkler). You still may get inanities (\u201cE is for electronics, which I hope to be playing soon\u201d), but it will require some creativity.Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling down, I browse the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While I\u2019m still relatively healthy (despite the usual middle-age woes), I can give thanks I don\u2019t have dengue fever or lockjaw. Warning: This strategy can backfire if you have any hypochondriac tendencies.I\u2019m well aware there are serious problems in the world. I also know my mostly healthy family is on the lucky side. But I\u2019m still hopeful these gratitude reforms might catch on with others. After a couple of years of tinkering with this ritual, my family doesn\u2019t dread it. Some even like it. At worst, it\u2019s moderately painless, like cleaning a nonstick pan.A.J. Jacobs is the author, most recently, of \u201cThanks a Thousand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Portland, Ore., a French Restaurant Serves the Classics ", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Bistro Agnes, this city gets a Parisian-style restaurant with duck confit and beef short rib bourguignon starring on the menu.With several French restaurants and legends like the chef Gabriel Rucker already in residence in Portland, Ore., the city might not have expected the arrival of a newcomer, Bistro Agnes. But Greg Denton and Gabrielle Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez Denton, the couple who won a James Beard award for their Argentine-inspired restaurant Ox, believed that Portland had lacked French classics for a few years. They wanted to create, in their former SuperBite space downtown, a Parisian-style bistro with dishes like coq au vin, escargot and sole meuni\u00e8re. No modern riffs here: The menu is old-school.The Dentons \u2014 spouses, co-chefs and business partners \u2014 met when they were both cooking at Terra Restaurant in Napa Valley. On their days off, they liked to go to places like Bistro Jeanty for leisurely lunches. \u201cIt\u2019s the food we fell in love over,\u201d Ms. Denton said. \u201cWe have a passion for traditional French food. Portland was missing that.\u201dBistro Agnes opened in January, and tables have been full ever since. The dining room feels both French and Northwest, a classy bistro far removed from the nearby streetcar and freeway.On a late-summer evening, I met a friend there for dinner. Cavalier King Charlie (a purple cocktail) set the mood, French flag toothpick on the rim. A photo of Mr. Denton\u2019s grandmother, Agnes, graced the beverage menu.We ordered two of the lighter starters from 14 options. The local salmon carpaccio \u2014 cured and cold-smoked in-house \u2014 came with crunchy cucumber rounds, radish shavings, endive chunks, fresh dill and house-cured salmon roe. The plate was a lovely palette of orange, fuchsia, green and white.Red and yellow heirloom tomatoes were sweet and juicy from the summer sun. Tarragon leaves and roasted Oregon hazelnuts added punch. A generous croquette of goat cheese from Briar Rose Creamery nicely complemented the tomatoes.Beef short rib bourguignon was the star. Highlighting the Dentons\u2019 skill in traditional methods, this dish takes three days to make. The result is super tender meat with mushrooms and lardons in an unbelievably intense gravy.We were happy to find a 2006 Bordeaux by the glass on a wine list that skews Old World. The spirits menu runs 10 pages, not including a separate absinthe sheet.For dessert, we chose a riz au lait \u2014 creamy pudding with risotto-style rice and vanilla bean, drenched in salted caramel and dotted with almonds and fresh nectarines \u2014 which the Dentons say they order every time they go to Paris. Unfortunately, the service did not match the quality of the food. Our server was inattentive, and his timing was a bit off. Nevertheless, the meal was outstanding. Bistro Agnes, in the middle of my hometown, captures the old-school magic of Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Legions", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite their sudden rise, they didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.\u201cNot at all, no. There is no blame. There is no anything.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ll probably pass, thank you very much.\u201dThese exchanges raise the same two questions that have been posed repeatedly during the Trump presidency:How could this man have been elected to the highest office in the land? And how can Trump not only remain in office but, for the moment at least, appear to stand a reasonable chance of being renominated and even re-elected?To get some answers to these questions, I turned to a 2018 paper by Ronald Inglehart and two fellow political scientists at the University of Michigan, as well as to a new book by Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler, who are political scientists at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.The core of the Inglehart thesis is that scarce resources lead to \u201cmaterialist\u201d values, while abundant resources are conducive to \u201cpost-materialist\u201d values. Inglehart argues that before the Second World War.the unprecedentedly high levels of existential security experienced in developed democracies during the postwar decades were bringing an intergenerational shift from Materialist values that emphasized economic and physical security above all, to Postmaterialist values that gave priority to individual autonomy and self-expression. Rising emphasis on Postmaterialist values eventually brought massive social and political changes, from stronger environmental protection policies and antiwar movements, to higher levels of gender equality in government, business and academic life, greater tolerance of gays, handicapped people and foreigners and the spread of democracy. Postwar prosperity brought these changes with a substantial time lag, since they moved at the pace of intergenerational population replacement.Beginning in the 1970s, Inglehart writes, while economies continued to grow, in high-income countries virtually all of the gains have gone to those at the top. During the past three decades, a large share of the population has experienced declining real income and job security, in context with a massive influx of immigrants and refugees. This has fueled support for xenophobic populist authoritarian movements such as British exit from the European Union, France\u2019s National Front and Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican Party. Cultural backlash explains why given individuals support xenophobic populist authoritarian movements \u2014 but declining existential security explains why support for these movements is greater now than it was thirty years ago.The term \u201cfixed\u201d describes people who are warier of social and cultural change and hence more set in their ways, more suspicious of outsiders, and more comfortable with the familiar and predictable. People we call \u201cfluid,\u201d on the other hand, support changing social and cultural norms, are excited by things that are new and novel, and are open to, and welcoming of, people who look and sound different.Just over four in 10 voters, 42 percent, fall into the fixed worldview category. Just under a third (32 percent) of the electorate falls into the fluid category. The remaining 26 percent are categorized as being in the middle.Those with fixed worldviews voted 3 to 1 for Trump over Hillary Clinton, and those with fluid world views backed Clinton by the same 3-to-1 margin.As recently as 1992, Democratic and Republican voters included roughly equal numbers of those with fluid and fixed worldviews. By 2016, however, as the accompanying chart shows, those with a so-called fluid orientation showed a decisive Democratic partisan preference, while those with a relatively fixed orientation identified overwhelmingly as Republican.Two largely opposite views of society \u2014 one open to change, one resistant \u2014 used to be home to people of both major parties in close to equal proportions. Now they are more lopsidedly partisan.1992IndependentsPercent DemocratsRepublicans\u201cFluid\u201d views:open to diversity,changing norms113652\u201cFixed\u201d views: waryof cultural change,suspicious of outsiders 114049201671821Fluid views166025Fixed views1992Percent who were DemocratsIndependentsRepublicansPeople with \u201cfluid\u201d views:open to diversity,changing norms521136\u201cFixed\u201d views: waryof cultural change,suspicious of outsiders 491140201671821Fluid views251660Fixed viewsBy The New York Times | Source: Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; because of rounding, not all figures add up to 100 percent.The fixed-fluid divide has strong links to a wide range of views on public policy. \u201cWhen asked whether they thought China was a military threat, 54 percent of the fixed said the threat was \u2018major\u2019 while only 29 percent of the fluid saw it that way,\u201d the authors write.Along similar lines, \u201cfewer than 10 percent of people with a fluid worldview believe in the biblical account of creation\u201d compared with \u201c60 percent of those with a fixed worldview.\u201dFor those with more fixed worldviews, especially, threats to safety and security are omnipresent. If certain aspects of the Bill of Rights \u2014 such as related Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections against unwarranted search and seizure and in favor of due process \u2014 are just tools for terrorists to hide behind, then those who invoke them aren\u2019t just na\u00efve. They\u2019re acting in bad faith in order to hurt America.In other words, for a substantial percentage of voters, Trump\u2019s disregard for constitutional niceties is not a violation of a critically important democratic norm. Instead, from this particular conservative perspective, it is viewed as a safeguard, designed to prevent terrorist attacks and to save American lives.The 2016 election, in the authors\u2019 view, forced voters to choose between two extremes: \u201cTrump embodied the fixed worldview and Hillary Clinton the fluid one.\u201dEven more important, when it comes to taking liberal or conservative positions on issues of race, immigration, Islam and so forth, voters whose worldviews are midway between the fixed and fluid \u201care more like the fixed than they are the fluid.\u201dPut another way, the authors write, while many voters \u201cmay not have relished\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on racial and ethnic minorities,neither were they completely turned off by his comments. Indeed, they probably found them more palatable than the tendency of liberals to bend over backwards seemingly at every turn to defend groups of people who aren\u2019t exactly angels in the eyes of many Americans.Most voters may say that they prefer politicians who take moderate stands on these divisive issues, the authors argue, but when polarized nomination processes offer voters a choice between two extremes, the American electorate is more wary of the liberal extreme than of the conservative one.\u201cMembers of Trump\u2019s base,\u201d Hetherington and Weiler caution,are much more like the average American than are his staunchest opponents. A lot of Americans are susceptible to the kinds of rhetoric that won Trump the presidency: especially his appeals to people\u2019s innate xenophobia and fears of threats both internal and external. The liberals, people of color, and traditional conservatives who are outraged by Trump\u2019s comportment and who have avowed to oppose his every move \u2014 these are the real outliers.Hetherington and Weiler demonstrate in chart after chart that the views of those in the middle \u2014 comprising 71 percent of the electorate, including the evenly divided, the leaning fluid and the leaning fixed \u2014 view Trump\u2019s hard-line views more favorably than they do the liberal views of fluid voters.Take a look at the accompanying graphic on racial resentment, which, while not exactly surprising, is nonetheless revealing.Americans with \u201cfixed\u201d (and mixed) views of society have higher levels of racial antagonism than those with \u201cfluid\u201d views. The latter became markedly more tolerant in 2016.SCALE OF RACIAL RESENTMENT:MostresentmentFixed worldview(resistant to change)Mixed worldviewNeutralFluid worldview(open to change)20002004200820122016LeastresentmentSCALE OF RACIALRESENTMENT:MostresentmentFixed worldview(resistant to change)Mixed worldviewNeutralFluid worldview(open to change)20002004200820122016LeastresentmentBy The New York Times | Source: Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill\u201cPeople with fluid worldviews are now in a completely different world when it comes to race than other whites,\u201d according to the authors, who repeat: \u201cThey\u2019re the outliers.\u201dOr take the case of immigration:As out of bounds as Trump\u2019s constant pillorying of immigrants, especially the way in which he demonized \u201cMexicans\u201d to create an image of immigrants more generally as dangerous, might have seemed to the fluid, it didn\u2019t turn out to be disqualifying.These divisions have significant implications, especially for those who worry that Trump has undermined important American norms and traditions:This yawning gap between the country\u2019s fluid citizens and the rest of its population is very real, and it has put the country in a serious predicament. Trump\u2019s seemingly antidemocratic propensities have already led to attacks on cornerstones of American democracy, including the free press, the judiciary, and other political institutions. These propensities were obvious when he was a candidate for president, and they have only become more so since his election.Inglehart and his University of Michigan colleagues raise similarly pessimistic conclusions based on a division of the electorate between materialists and postmaterialists \u2014 analogous to the fixed-fluid division. They argue that the postmaterialist left \u2014 those most supportive of the civil, women\u2019s and gay rights revolutions, backers of environmental regulation and proponents of personal autonomy \u2014 have, in many respects, abandoned what had been the working class core of the New Deal era left:Traditionally, the left parties were based on a working class constituency, and advocated redistribution of income. In striking contrast, the postmaterialist left appeals mainly to a middle class constituency and is only faintly interested in the classic program of the left.Of critical importance to the rise of Trump and other right-wing populist leaders abroad, Inglehart writes, is that Postmaterialists are intensely favorable to major political and cultural changes that frequently repel the left\u2019s traditional working class constituency, stimulating the rise of authoritarian populist parties.Inglehart places strong emphasis on economic trends as a major factor in the emergence of authoritarian populism. He and his co-authors argue that as inequality has increased \u2014 and as parties of the left have shifted from economic to postmaterialist agendas \u2014 the populist right has filled the vacuum:For decades, the real income of the developed world\u2019s working class has been declining, while the material basis of what counts as an acceptable standard of living has been rising. They go on: Inequality and insecurity are likely to become even more severe as these societies move into a mature phase of the Knowledge Society \u2014 that of Artificial Intelligence Society.A theme common to both \u201cPrius or Pickup\u201d and of \u201cThe Silent Revolution in Reverse\u201d is that fear \u2014 fear of loss, fear of scarcity, fear of terrorism, fear of cultural challenge, fear of immigrants \u2014 is driving the least secure in society to the right, with significant support from those caught in the middle.And this insecurity is not limited to those with stagnant or diminishing economic resources. It also includes those who are doing well individually but who live in declining areas, those who fear the loss of white hegemony, and those who think they see a morally alien culture taking hold around them \u2014 on television, movies and the internet \u2014 and those who feel that their status is threatened by the rise of racial, ethnic and cultural minorities.On her way to work one morningDown the path alongside the lakeA tenderhearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snakeHis pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew\u201cOh well,\u201d she cried, \u201cI\u2019ll take you in and I\u2019ll take care of you\u201d\u201cTake me in oh tender womanTake me in, for heaven\u2019s sakeTake me in oh tender woman,\u201d sighed the snakeShe wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silkAnd then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milkNow she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrivedShe found that pretty snake she\u2019d taken in had been revived\u201cTake me in, oh tender womanTake me in, for heaven\u2019s sakeTake me in oh tender woman,\u201d sighed the snakeNow she clutched him to her bosom, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she cried\u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t brought you in by now you might have died\u201dNow she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tightBut instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite\u201cTake me in, oh tender womanTake me in, for heaven\u2019s sakeTake me in oh tender woman,\u201d sighed the vicious snake\u201cI saved you,\u201d cried that woman\u201cAnd you\u2019ve bit me even, why?You know your bite is poisonous and now I\u2019m going to die\u201d\u201cOh shut up, silly woman,\u201d said the reptile with a grin\u201cYou knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Metropolis of 200 Million Termite Mounds Was Hidden in Plain Sight", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat amount to garbage piles \u2014 some are 4,000 years old \u2014 are spread over an area the size of Britain in a remote Brazilian forest.Stephen J. Martin noticed large mounds, some 10 feet tall, 30 feet wide, along the side of the road as he drove through a remote part of northeast Brazil. He thought they might be piles of dirt displaced from the construction of the road. Instead, his companions told him, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just termite mounds.\u201dDr. Martin recalled his incredulous reply: \u201cAnd I went, \u2018You\u2019re really sure about that?\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. I think so.\u2019\u201dOn a subsequent trip, Dr. Martin met by chance Roy R. Funch, an ecologist at Brazil\u2019s State University of Feira de Santana who was already arranging to conduct radioactive dating to determine the age of the mounds. \u201cI said, \u2018Look at those, there must be thousands of these mounds. And he went, \u2018Nah, there\u2019s millions.\u2019\u201dDr. Funch undercounted too. How many mounds? Some 200 million, the scientists estimate.\u201cThey\u2019re all over the place,\u201d Dr. Funch said.The cone-shape mounds are the work of Syntermes dirus, among the largest termite species at about half an inch long. The mounds, spaced on average about 60 feet apart, are spread across an area as large as Britain. \u201cAs humans, we have never built a city that big, anywhere,\u201d Dr. Martin said.The scientists were also surprised when they received results of the radioactive dating of 11 mounds. The youngest was about 690 years old. The oldest was at least 3,820 years old, or close in age to the great pyramids of Giza in Egypt. \u201cThat just kind of blew me out of the water,\u201d Dr. Funch said.Dr. Martin said they used the minimum age suggested by the data, but the oldest mound could conceivably be more than twice as old.The scientists also estimated that to build 200 million mounds, the termites excavated 2.4 cubic miles of dirt \u2014 a volume equal to about 4,000 great pyramids of Giza. \u201cThis the greatest known example of ecosystem engineering by a single insect species,\u201d the scientists wrote.Another surprise was that the mounds turned out to just be mounds. Other termites build mounds with complicated networks of tunnels that provide ventilation for underground nests.But cutting through some of the mounds, Dr. Funch and Dr. Martin found only a single central tube leading to the top, and they never came across any nests. That might also explain the regular spacing between the mounds. At first, Dr. Funch and Dr. Martin thought that to be the result of competing colonies. But when they put a termite from one mound next to one from a neighboring mound, there was no conflict, indicating they were from the same family.They concluded the pattern was simply an efficient spacing of garbage piles.Young, active mounds grow to four to five feet tall in a couple of years, Dr. Funch said. Most of the older mounds appear inactive. The scientists do not know if that means the termites have left or if they simply have no need for additional digging in the area after constructing the needed tunnels.\u201cThat's why they were undiscovered for so long,\u201d Dr. Funch said. \u201cYou cannot see them in the native vegetation. And not many scientists pass this way.\u201dFor most of the year, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter, the trees are scorched white. The landscape turns green after a short rainy season, and then the leaves fall, and the landscape grows desolate again. \u201cThese termites live on dead leaves, and they get to feed once a year,\u201d Dr. Martin said.As parts of the forest were cleared, the mounds became visible, and about a decade ago, Google Earth\u2019s satellite images became sharp enough that Dr. Funch could spot individual mounds. He drove to some of the sites to verify that the mounds were there.Dr. Martin said he wanted to better understand the intertwining between the insects and the vegetation. When part of the forest is cut down, the mounds remain, but the termites move away as there are no longer any leaves for them to eat.They also want to observe the termites during the burst of feeding after the blooming of the forest and study what the termites are doing the rest of the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Hell Happened to Brazil? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did an up-and-coming economy suffer such a severe slump?Opinion ColumnistI think I can now take some time off from the U.S. political crisis to talk about events elsewhere. So, as the headline says, what the hell happened to Brazil?So what happened? There has been surprisingly little international discussion of the Brazilian experience, even though it was very severe and Brazil is a pretty big economy (G.D.P. at purchasing power parity about 10 times as large as Greece.) Maybe we\u2019re all too distracted by the political crisis in the West \u2014 Trump, Brexit, etc. Anyway, I\u2019ve been trying to put together a story of the Brazilian crisis, well aware that I may well be missing important aspects.Here\u2019s what it looks like to me: Brazil appears to have been hit by a perfect storm of bad luck and bad policy, with three main aspects. First, the global environment deteriorated sharply, with plunging prices for the commodity exports still crucial to the Brazilian economy. Second, domestic private spending also plunged, maybe because of an excessive buildup of debt. Third, policy, instead of fighting the slump, exacerbated it, with fiscal austerity and monetary tightening even as the economy was headed down.Maybe the first thing to say about Brazil\u2019s crisis is what it wasn\u2019t. Over the past few decades those who follow international macroeconomics have grown more or less accustomed to \u201csudden stop\u201d crises in which investors abruptly turn on a country they\u2019ve loved not wisely but too well. That was the story of the Mexican crisis of 1994-5, the Asian crises of 1997-9, and, in important ways, the crisis of southern Europe after 2009. It\u2019s also what we seem to be seeing in Turkey and Argentina now.We know how this story goes: the afflicted country sees its currency depreciate (or, in the case of the euro countries, its interest rates soar). Ordinarily currency depreciation boosts an economy, by making its products more competitive on world markets. But sudden-stop countries have large debts in foreign currency, so the currency depreciation savages balance sheets, causing a severe drop in domestic demand. And policymakers have few good options: raising interest rates to prop up the currency would just hit demand from another direction.But while you might have assumed that Brazil was a similar case \u2014 its 9 percent decline in real G.D.P. per capita is comparable to that of sudden-stop crises of the past \u2014 it turns out that it isn\u2019t. Brazil does not, it turns out, have a lot of debt in foreign currency, and currency effects on balance sheets don\u2019t seem to be an important part of the story. What happened instead?First of all, the global economic environment took a big turn for the worse. Brazil has diversified somewhat into manufactures, but it\u2019s still heavily dependent on commodity exports, whose prices have plunged. As Figure 1 shows, Brazil\u2019s terms of trade \u2014 the ratio of export to import prices \u2014 took a major hit.What really did Brazil\u2019s economy in, however, was the way it responded to these shocks: with fiscal and monetary policy that made things much worse.And on top of that, monetary policy also turned sharply contractionary, with a big rise in interest rates (Figure 3). What was that about?It\u2019s a remarkable and depressing story. And this combination of bad luck and bad policy surely played a role in the political disaster that followed.Advertisement"}

Yes, they are \u2014 as long as their arguments are made in good faith. But there are almost no good-faith climate-change deniers. And denying science for profit, political advantage or ego satisfaction is not O.K.; when failure to act on the science may have terrible consequences, denial is, as I said, depraved.But climate denial has sunk deeper political roots than cancer denial ever did. In practice, you can\u2019t be a modern Republican in good standing unless you deny the reality of global warming, assert that it has natural causes or insist that nothing can be done about it without destroying the economy. You also have to either accept or acquiesce in wild claims that the overwhelming evidence for climate change is a hoax, that it has been fabricated by a vast global conspiracy of scientists.Finally, I have the impression that there\u2019s an element of tough-guy posturing involved \u2014 real men don\u2019t use renewable energy, or something.Indeed, it\u2019s depravity, on a scale that makes cancer denial seem trivial.

He looked, at first glance, like the sort of intimidating figure who\u2019d fit in at a far-right rally.In fact, you might see him at such a rally \u2014 among the counterprotesters. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any question in anybody\u2019s mind in this country that fascism is here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s alive and well and marching us all towards somewhere that we don\u2019t want to be.\u201d That\u2019s part of the reason, he said, that he\u2019s into guns: \u201cI wear a pistol every day because I\u2019m a Jewish person in the South.\u201dIt was the Sunday after the terror-filled week that culminated in the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue. Oso was sitting with a handful of other members of the North Georgia branch of the Socialist Rifle Association, a new, swiftly growing left-wing gun group, in the backyard of an Italian restaurant in a gentrifying Atlanta neighborhood. (None of them wanted their last names used; Oso, Spanish for \u201cbear,\u201d is a nickname.)The mission of the S.R.A. is \u201cto arm and train the working class for self-defense.\u201dIt launched in its current form this spring \u2014 before that there was a Facebook group of the same name \u2014 and now has several hundred dues-paying members and over 30 chapters. This Monday, 28 new people joined, the group said.Brad, a 36-year-old math professor, is a founder of the S.R.A.\u2019s North Georgia chapter and a member of the S.R.A.\u2019s central committee. \u201cSome people are scared with what\u2019s going on in the country right now,\u201d he told me. He only recently started carrying a gun, after getting death threats for the socialist organizing he was doing in his small town. \u201cPeople want to be able to protect themselves,\u201d he said.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, parts of the radical left fetishized firearms. Back then, some conservatives supported gun control as a way to disarm African-American militants; Ronald Reagan signed a bill banning open carry of loaded weapons when he was governor of California. \u201cThe Black Panthers and other extremists of the 1960s inspired some of the strictest gun control laws in American history,\u201d the U.C.L.A. law professor Adam Winkler wrote in his book, \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201dSince then, however, gun culture has become virtually synonymous with American conservatism. The National Rifle Association is now perhaps the most powerful Republican lobby in the country, and its rhetoric increasingly echoes that of the apocalyptic far right. Over the last 20 or 30 years, Winkler told me, \u201cnot only has the N.R.A. become more and more associated with the right, but there\u2019s an increasingly militaristic, rebellious tone to the N.R.A. and the gun rights movement.\u201d It\u2019s become, he said, \u201call about arming up to fight the tyranny that\u2019s coming.\u201dMeanwhile, most of the left has embraced gun control, something that\u2019s unlikely to change anytime soon. But it was probably inevitable that, as our politics have become more polarized and violent, a nascent left-wing gun culture would emerge.As a squishy liberal, I generally find the idea of adding more guns to our febrile politics frightening and dangerous. But sometimes a small desperate part of me thinks that if our country is going to be awash in firearms, maybe it behooves the left to learn how to use them. If nothing else, an armed left might once again create a bipartisan impetus for gun control.Brad said they try to screen the people who are invited to their monthly range days, weeding out those who seem like \u201cadventurers.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want the John Wayne of the left showing up to our range,\u201d he said. Indeed, the S.R.A. comes off more like a wholesome civic organization than a revolutionary underground. It recently became a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, and its members spend a lot of time on mutual aid projects like collecting funds and supplies for hurricane relief.Part of the group\u2019s mission is to simply provide a home for people who want to shoot, or to learn about shooting, but who recoil at the right-wing trappings of mainstream gun culture. \u201cThis seems to be the antithesis of what happens at most Georgia gun ranges,\u201d said Steve, a 66-year-old paramedic and certified marksmanship instructor who recently joined the S.R.A. \u201cMine had a Brian Kemp day last Saturday,\u201d he added, referring to Georgia\u2019s right-wing gubernatorial candidate. \u201cI go in there, shoot, and leave.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What should we do?MOMKeep your children out of that family\u2019s car! We don\u2019t have enough information to conclude that the husband has a drinking problem (or that his wife is complicit in letting him get behind the wheel, for that matter). But you know more than enough to protect your own kids. If you see things taking the same direction again, ask for the car keys.As for the invitations: When people persist in issuing them, despite our repeated refusals (and lame excuses), it is a mercy to everyone to let your would-be hosts know, politely, that the get-together is never, ever going to happen. Here, say: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to invite the kids, but we don\u2019t like other people driving them. Let\u2019s plan something in town instead.\u201dThe weekend invitations will stop. The explanation is close enough to the truth to let you hold your head high (and share it with your children). It avoids unfounded assertions about the husband\u2019s drinking. And best of all, it prevents your kids from careening down the highway with a possibly unfit driver.My mother is dying of an aggressive cancer. She was told recently that she probably has less than a year to live. But she told us that she wants us to continue living our lives. My question: Should I take a 10-day international vacation that I\u2019ve been planning all year that is partly nonrefundable? I am close with my mother. Will I always regret taking 10 days away from her when I could be at home? On the other hand, she may live much longer. What do I do?ANONYMOUSSadly, I am as bad at predicting the future as everyone else. I have no idea what you will \u201calways regret\u201d or how long your mother will live. But my mother died a few years ago, and I can tell you definitively that I would choose 10 days with her at her house (which has zero Michelin stars) over the most luxurious international vacation.If this trip is enticing to you, under the circumstances, consider whether you have time enough to spend with your mother and take the vacation. There\u2019s nothing wrong with traveling now; you can\u2019t spend every minute with her. It\u2019s simply part of a sad balancing act that only you can perform.My BFF and I go to colleges in different states. For the last two years, she has been dating a guy who comes home with her pretty often. He and I are like oil and water. We bicker and full-on fight, and I know we make it unpleasant for people to be around us. He\u2019s not a bad guy, and my BFF loves him. But we just seem to trigger each other. Any ideas for making this better?J.T.First, some family history: Back when my parents were kids, Coca-Cola\u2019s slogan was \u201cThe pause that refreshes.\u201d And all through my childhood, my even-tempered father tried to head off snappish attacks by my occasionally trigger-happy mother. He\u2019d whisper: \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d It worked about 30 percent of the time.I will not ask you to count to 10 or walk around the block before you snap. But the next time the boyfriend bugs you and you\u2019re about to bristle, take a single, deep breath. In that small pause, you may find many options if you look: You can yell at him, let it go, or even feel sorry for him that he\u2019s so wrongheaded.But we don\u2019t have to share every conflicting opinion. I respect you for caring enough about your BFF to try to improve your relationship with her boyfriend. That\u2019s a big gesture. Now, try \u201cthe pause that refreshes,\u201d and let me know how it goes, O.K.?My home was under construction, so I asked my neighbor if I could store nine bottles of wine (that cost $35 each) in their large wine cooler. He agreed. But when I went back to pick them up, they were all gone! He said his son-in-law must have drunk them on a recent visit. His wife promised to pay me back. But after much thought, I took the high road and let it drop. Thoughts?SUSANI don\u2019t see the connection between the \u201chigh road\u201d and your missing wine, Susan. Buy nine comparable bottles and give your neighbors the receipt. They drank your booze and offered to pay for it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kyrsten Sinema Declared Winner in Arizona Senate Race", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat and former social worker, scored a groundbreaking victory in the race for a Senate seat in Arizona, defeating her Republican opponent after waging a campaign in which she embraced solidly centrist positions.Ms. Sinema\u2019s victory guarantees the Democrats at least 47 Senate seats. Republicans control 51, with two still undecided: Florida, where there is a recount, and Mississippi, where there is a runoff.The outcome in Arizona had been too close to call for nearly a week, as large numbers of early and mailed ballots were counted. Ms. Sinema had trailed slightly in initial tallies on Election Day, but later counting put her ahead by a growing margin. On Monday, The Associated Press called the race and Ms. McSally conceded.In a statement on Facebook Monday night, Ms. Sinema pointedly struck a nonpartisan note as she pledged to continue working in government to \u201cfind common ground.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the same approach I\u2019ll take to representing our great state in the Senate, where I\u2019ll be an independent voice for all Arizonans,\u201d she wrote.The victory by Ms. Sinema points to a remarkable shift in Arizona\u2019s political landscape. The state was a Republican bastion for decades, but Democrats are seizing on dissatisfaction with budget cuts and growing unease over the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown to make inroads with moderate voters.Voter drives to register more Latinos, who generally vote Democratic in Arizona, appear to have paid off for Ms. Sinema. About 2.1 million Latinos live in Arizona, about one-third of the state\u2019s population. Though Mr. Trump narrowly carried the state in the 2016 election, many Latinos in Arizona have expressed displeasure with the president.We\u2019re tracking the votes as they are tallied in two races for governor and two for Senate that have slim margins.Ms. Sinema, 42, won the race by about 1.7 percentage points amid increasing partisan tension. (Her lead could grow even larger as remaining votes are counted.) Some prominent Republicans, including Mr. Trump, claimed without offering proof that voting officials were engaged in fraudulent strategies to bolster Ms. Sinema, as the authorities struggled to count ballots following a surge in turnout.Michele Reagan, a Republican and the Arizona Secretary of State, dismissed those claims. She said it took time to count the hundreds of thousands of early ballots that were dropped off on Election Day at polling stations, after which county officials had to verify the signature on each ballot.In a twist to the race, Ms. Sinema easily outperformed Ms. McSally in her rival's own congressional district, which includes Tucson. In campaigning around Arizona, Ms. Sinema held up Senator Joe Manchin III, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia who won re-election this month, as a role model.After taking her seat in Congress in 2013, Ms. Sinema joined the Blue Dog Coalition, the most conservative group of House Democrats, and sometimes angered progressives, including immigration activists, by refusing to meet with them.Unlike other prominent Democrats in the state, Ms. Sinema also refused to back David Garcia, the party\u2019s nominee for governor. Mr. Garcia, who lost to the Republican incumbent, Gov. Doug Ducey, on Nov. 6, voiced support for liberal policies that stood in contrast to Ms. Sinema\u2019s positions.That strategy opened Ms. Sinema to substantial criticism from the left. The Green Party candidate in the Senate race, Angela Green, received more than 47,000 votes even though she dropped out of the race and endorsed Ms. Sinema.Even so, Ms. Sinema\u2019s supporters argue that her victory offers a path forward for Democrats seeking to win pivotal races in other Republican-held states.Meanwhile, some who voted for her want to see Ms. Sinema adopt a less accommodating approach to dealing with Republicans.\u201cI want them to put the president in check,\u201d said Laura Avila, 58, a faculty member at Gateway Community College, referring to Ms. Sinema and other Democrats who won in Arizona.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the college where Laura Avila is a faculty member.

The first, \u201cFolly,\u201d is the story of a love affair. It narrates the relationship between Alice, a book editor and aspiring writer in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a brilliant, geriatric novelist who is partly modeled on Philip Roth. The second section \u2014 \u201cMadness\u201d \u2014 belongs to Amar Jaafari, an Iraqi-American economist who is being detained at Heathrow. Halliday\u2019s prose is clean and lean, almost reportorial in the style of W.G. Sebald. This is a first novel that reads like the work of an author who has published many books over many years, and it manages to be, all at once, a transgressive roman \u00e0 clef, a novel of ideas and a politically engaged work of metafiction.Set in the Chicago of the mid-80s and Paris at the time of the 2015 terrorist attacks, Makkai\u2019s deeply affecting novel uses the AIDS epidemic and a mother\u2019s search for her estranged daughter to explore the effects of senseless loss and our efforts to overcome it. Her portrait of a group of friends, most of them gay men, conveys the terrors and tragedies of the epidemic\u2019s early years and follows its repercussions over decades. Empathetic without being sentimental, her novel amply earned its place among the contenders for the Booker Prize and the National Book Award.We know from the outset of this unnerving cautionary tale (winner of the Goncourt Prize) that a beloved nanny has murdered the two children in her care; but what\u2019s even more remarkable about this unconventional domestic thriller is the author\u2019s intimate analysis of the special relationship between a mother and the person she hires to care for her offspring. Slimani writes devastating character studies, and she also raises painful themes: the forbidden desires parents project onto their nannies, racial and class tensions. In this mesmerizingly twisted novel, only one thing is clear: Loneliness can drive you crazy.Orange\u2019s debut is an ambitious meditation on identity and its broken alternatives, on myth filtered through the lens of time and poverty and urban life. Its many short chapters are told through a loosely connected group of Native Americans living in Oakland, Calif., as they travel to a powwow. They are all, as in Chaucer, pilgrims on their way to a shrine, or, as in Faulkner\u2019s \u201cAs I Lay Dying,\u201d an extended family crossing the landscape. The novel is their picaresque journey, allowing for moments of pure soaring beauty to hit against the most mundane, for a sense of timelessness to be placed right beside a cleareyed version of the here and now.This transcendent work of empathy and imagination, the 2018 winner of Canada\u2019s prestigious Giller Prize, opens on a sugar plantation in British Barbados in the waning days of slavery and, against that backdrop of unconscionable brutality, quickly tips us into a new world of possibility: one in which men take to the skies in hot-air balloons, dive to mysterious ocean depths and cross the Arctic on foot. Most daringly, it is a world in which a white slave master\u2019s brother and a young black slave can forge an indelible bond. With subtlety and eloquence, Edugyan unfolds a wondrous tale of exploration and discovery.Westover\u2019s extraordinary memoir is an act of courage and self-invention. The youngest of seven children, she grew up in Idaho, in a survivalist family who lived so far off the grid that she lacked even a birth certificate and did not attend school until she went to college. Getting in wasn\u2019t obvious: At home, reading meant studying the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and much of her childhood was spent helping her mother, an unlicensed midwife, and her father, a paranoid man who maintained a scrap-metal junkyard. In recounting her upbringing and her triumph over it \u2014 she would earn a Ph.D. in history at Cambridge \u2014 Westover took great risks and alienated family members. The reward is a book that testifies to an irrepressible thirst to learn.A monumental work about a monumental figure. The charismatic Douglass was Abraham Lincoln\u2019s conscience, so to speak, and Blight\u2019s detailed, cinematic biography is the result of a lifetime of engagement with his subject. Douglass wrote three autobiographies himself, describing his rise from slavery to a role as one of the greatest figures of the 19th century, but Blight\u2019s work is fuller than any of those, relating both the public and private life in a way that Douglass either could not or would not undertake. The result is a portrait that is likely to stand as the definitive account for years to come.Best known for his work on the ethics of eating, Pollan delivers his most personal book yet, one that demanded he drop acid in full view of the reader. Exploring the history and science of psychedelics, he tells of the rise and fall and rise again of our societal interest in these drugs, which are now thought to have many benefits, from helping with addiction to easing the terror of the terminally ill. The book hits its high point when he examines the mysticism and spirituality of the psychedelic experience. What can we learn about ourselves when the part of our mind controlling the ego drops away? What is this older, more primitive part of the brain, which connects us to how a child sees the world? It\u2019s a trip that leads him to wonder about how, ultimately, we can get the most out of our existences as conscious beings in the world.Brennan-Jobs grew up shuttling between two starkly different worlds: the bohemian, peripatetic world of her mother, an unstable and impoverished artist, and the luxurious world of her cruel and increasingly wealthy father, Steve Jobs. She provides indelible portraits of both parents, recreating the fraught landscape of her childhood in Palo Alto through the careful accretion of exquisitely granular detail. Her memoir is a work of uncanny intimacy, the debut of a singular literary sensibility. Ultimately, though, it is her portrayal of Jobs as a man prone to mind-boggling acts of emotional negligence and abuse that gives this book its overlay of devastation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Is Shaken by Protests No One Saw Coming", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTraditional politics have been decimated. What\u2019s left behind is worryingly unstable.Ms. Poirier is a writer and political commentator.PARIS \u2014 Familiar Parisian images are back in the news: black smoke billowing from makeshift barricades on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es; cobblestones hurled at the police by protesters; the Arc de Triomphe disappearing behind a cloud of tear gas. But this time, the images feature something new: The protesters are wearing yellow, high-visibility vests.They aren\u2019t longhaired students or militant trade unionists or even angry farmers. They are unaffiliated with a political party and they come from a variety of class backgrounds. Leaderless, they have gathered thanks to social media and they have pointedly called themselves Gilets Jaunes, or Yellow Vests. They are shaking French politics to the core.The movement began about a month ago, with groups of friends on Facebook complaining about an increase in diesel prices put in place by the government of President Emmanuel Macron to try to curb carbon emissions. Seemingly from nowhere, the disparate conversations converged on a date for action: Nov. 17. Hundreds of thousands would gather around the country to demonstrate against the fuel price hike, which they feel unfairly burdens the millions of people who live in small towns and the countryside, where they can\u2019t get around by public transportation or electric scooters.Their high-visibility yellow vests \u2014 which French drivers are legally required to keep in their vehicle to make sure they are seen on the side of the road if their car breaks down \u2014 identify them as car drivers rather than metro riders. But they also send a clear message: They want to be seen by their young president.Almost 300,000 people took part in the Nov. 17 protests, blocking roads and highways. One protester was killed, run over by a panicked driver taking her child to the hospital and whose car had been set upon by angry people in yellow vests. The abnormally high number of casualties (600 people were injured) in a country that has long mastered the art of theatrical but safe demonstrations was disconcerting. A week later, the protesters gathered again, though in smaller numbers, with thousands coming from around the country to demonstrate in Paris. It\u2019s almost as if Mr. Macron, a centrist who rejects both right and left labels, has found in the Yellow Vests an opponent to his measure: a movement that refuses categorizing.Seizing the chance to capitalize on a protest nobody saw coming, both Marine Le Pen on the extreme right and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the radical left have tried to jump on the bandwagon, but to no avail. The protesters seem wholly uninterested in party politics. Their demands are as varied as they are vague. But they do have something in common with the extreme right and the radical left: a profound dislike of Mr. Macron.France\u2019s main center-right and center-left parties have largely collapsed, and Mr. Macron stepped into the void, offering a vision best described as nonpartisan centrism. But at the same time, he has put himself at the center of French politics, personalizing political life. The Yellow Vests are demonstrating exactly how dangerously unstable that could prove to be.Fuel taxes triggered their anger, but the Yellow Vests intended in fact to vent their general frustration with politics, taxes, stagnating incomes and a president who they believe is out of touch with a majority of the people.What they do generally have in common is where they come from: places that have not thrived as Paris and other major cities have in recent years, places where the post office, the hospital and the train station may have closed down, forcing them to drive farther to reach public services.Mr. Macron needs to take note. His 2017 election pulverized the French political landscape, sending both the center left and right into oblivion and leaving the far right and the far left as the most vocal and visible opponents to the president. As a result, Mr. Macron appears both omnipotent and terribly lonely. Though he has been able to rely on a large majority in the National Assembly, his party\u2019s members of Parliament are mostly new to politics and power. Can they help him weather the storm, or will cracks appear in the presidential majority as the protest continues to be supported by an overwhelming majority of French people?Invited to meet with government representatives this week, the Yellow Vests have come up with eight \u201cofficial messengers\u201d chosen by the movement\u2019s 44 regional leaders. Some have also called for another march in Paris next weekend \u2014 a sign that the movement is thinking about the future. With so much instability in the political system, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the Yellow Vests coalescing into something more durable, akin to Italy\u2019s Five Star. That party began as a largely inchoate, online-based movement before becoming a populist political party that now sits in the government in Rome in an alliance with the xenophobic far-right party The League.On Tuesday, the president announced that he is standing by his fuel tax hike, though he made some adjustments to the policy to ease the financial burden of the green transition on low-to-middle-income earners. That\u2019s a start. But he must do more to acknowledge the deep anxiety expressed by the Yellow Vests. He has to behave as if he has not only seen but also heard them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Trolls Were at It Again Before Midterms, Facebook Says", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A Kremlin-backed group of internet trolls that meddled in the 2016 presidential election appeared to be trying to influence American voters using Facebook days ahead of the midterm elections, the social network said Tuesday night.Just hours after most of the polls had closed, Facebook said it had blocked more than 100 Facebook and Instagram accounts \u201cdue to concerns that they were linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency,\u201d Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said in a statement.In February, more than a dozen members of the group, also called the I.R.A., were indicted in connection with a far-reaching conspiracy to illegally influence the 2016 election through elaborate social media campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.\u201cThis is a timely reminder that these bad actors won\u2019t give up \u2014 and why it\u2019s so important we work with the U.S. government and other technology companies to stay ahead,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said.It is also a reminder that despite Facebook\u2019s efforts to stem election meddling, the platform continues to be a battleground for mischief makers looking to spread disinformation to the widest possible audience.The accounts recently removed by Facebook were identified following a tip from law enforcement agencies. It was the first time the company had publicly acknowledged acting on an influence campaign based on intelligence received from a government agency.\u201cAmericans should be aware that foreign actors \u2014 and Russia in particular \u2014 continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions,\u201d the F.B.I. said in its statement, which was issue jointly with several other federal agencies. \u201cThe United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from Russia, China, Iran or other nations.\u201dWhile Facebook linked the new influence network to the Internet Research Agency, the company stopped short of fully tying the Russian troll farm to the activity. In the statement, Mr. Gleicher said that a website that claimed to be affiliated with the group appeared to take responsibility for some of the accounts Facebook had removed.The company has spent the past 18 months grappling with the scope of its disinformation problem, and it has spent millions on additional resources and employees to deal with it. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has compared the effort to an \u201carms race\u201d between company security teams and groups trying to spread disinformation.As far back as 2013, the Internet Research Agency has been linked to influence campaigns on social media. Based in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency served as a kind of professional online trolling network, carrying out information operations intended to sway public opinion among the groups it targets.The group, which has been linked to the Kremlin, specializes in pumping out legions of Twitter bots, YouTube videos and Facebook posts under the guise of activism, often posing as both far-right and left-wing groups.Last month, the Justice Department announced it had uncovered another attempt by Russian state-backed actors to meddle in the midterm elections.Since the 2016 election, Facebook has hired 10,000 people to work on security, and created tools dedicated to spotting disinformation around major elections. Last month, it unveiled a \u201cwar room\u201d at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, where employees would be monitoring the company\u2019s networks for disinformation.Facebook has announced a series of actions in recent months to remove active influence campaigns by foreign states.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a statement by the F.B.I. about fighting election interference.

Since children with disabilities are often judged as incapable of growing into self-sufficient adults, they would be considered a public charge more often than their nondisabled peers. Fortunately, the proposal has not yet been approved. And those who oppose this attack on American families with immigrants, including people with disabilities, can work together to stop it. We must continue to push back. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed public charge regulation says people with disabilities aren\u2019t valuable members of American society. What he doesn\u2019t seem to realize is that Americans with disabilities and our families are a powerful force that will fight back when he mocks or marginalizes. We must recommit to being a country where everyone is valued, where people with disabilities can fully contribute and where all can thrive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS Says It Was Behind Deadly Attack on Christians in Egypt", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Islamist gunmen killed at least seven Coptic Christian pilgrims in Egypt on Friday and wounded at least 16 in an attack later claimed by the Islamic State.It was also a setback for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has put security concerns at the heart of his autocratic style of rule and has repeatedly vowed to protect Christians, a minority in the country, from attack.The shooting occurred as two buses carrying pilgrims left the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor, 85 miles south of Cairo, in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, claimed responsibility on its Amaq news service.A video circulating on Facebook from the site of the attack showed a man slumped over the steering wheel of a bus. Two other bloodied, inert figures lay on the back seats. A door of the vehicle, apparently ripped from its hinges and covered in blood, lay on the ground.The Interior Ministry said the attackers appeared to have used a secondary road to approach the bus in the vicinity of the remote desert monastery south of Cairo.Ambulances carrying three people seriously injured in the attack pulled into Cairo\u2019s Sheikh Zayed Specialized Hospital on Friday evening. Nader Adel, a volunteer who accompanied a wounded teenage boy to the hospital, said the boy described the ambush to him.By that account, masked gunmen riding a pair of small, off-road vehicles stopped the buses as they left the monastery. The gunmen stepped up and opened fire. One of the buses managed to speed away, but the other, in which the seven people were killed, did not. People were injured on both buses.Visits to desert monasteries, which have surged in number in the past 50 years, play a central part in the religious practice of many Egyptian Copts, who make up an estimated 10 percent of the country\u2019s population.The Copts have also been staunch supporters of Mr. Sisi, although their backing has been shaken by violent attacks in the past two years. Friday\u2019s attack coincided with the start of one of Mr. Sisi\u2019s prestige events \u2014 the World Youth Forum, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, where he is expected to address thousands of young Egyptians this weekend.In a statement, Mr. Sisi condemned the attack as an act of \u201cblack terrorism\u201d carried out by forces that were \u201cseeking to undermine the cohesive fabric of the homeland.\u201d He vowed to find and prosecute the perpetrators.The attacks on Christians are viewed as an attempt by the Islamic State to widen its campaign of violence beyond Sinai, where the group has been fighting the Egyptian military for years, and to exacerbate religious divisions in Egyptian society, much as it did in Iraq and Syria.In the past two years, Islamist suicide bombers have hit prominent churches in Cairo, Alexandria and Tanta, a city in the Nile Delta, killing at least 100 people.Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalsh.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slow-Cooking History ", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI add the leaf of the cocoyam plant to dried mudfish, mushrooms and snails, and think of my indomitable ancestors. Ms. Attah is a novelist who grew up in Ghana and lives in Senegal. Not much has been written about the history of West African cuisine, and a lot of what is considered historically West African is quite new. My Akan ancestors left Sudan around the 10th century \u2014 possibly fleeing forced conversion to Islam \u2014 and moved into the forest. Their original diet would have been considerably different from what they would come to find and create there. Their cattle would have suffered in the humidity and constricted spaces of the forest, and many succumbed to death by tsetse fly. My ancestors\u2019 groundnuts and millet and rice seeds would have sprouted mold. To stay alive, I imagine a matriarch \u2014 Akan women have always been indomitable \u2014 whipping up the young to forage for edibles, which she would throw into a clay pot: snails crawling and mushrooms sprouting from the forest floor.Snails became an item for bartering. Many rivers traversed the forest, and from them my people extracted fish, which they learned to conserve through smoking. They found old cocoyam and began to cultivate it. The historian Ivor Wilks posited that the Akan were the first to begin cultivating plants in the forests of pre-colonial Ghana.It would take trial and error to get the proportions right, to prevent death by poisoning. For centuries we pounded our plantain and cassava because that was the way things had always been done. Only later would we learn that cassava contains cyanide; soaking, boiling and pounding it all help to temper or expel its poison.Cassava was also an introduction from the Americas, made popular in the region because it grew fast. It became an essential food source during times of strife, such as after displacement by slave raids. The machine behind these raids was not only European: The Ashanti (the word is a corruption of \u201cosa nti,\u201d a people brought together because of war) had one of the most fearsome armies in pre-colonial West Africa and became one of the largest slave-owning ethnic groups in West Africa. Part of the reason they had slaves was to cultivate their farms.These days, rice is more common in Ghana than fufu. Soups are often spiced with shrimp or chicken bouillon cubes (Maggi! Jumbo! Onga!) as a shortcut to flavor, and my indomitable ancestress spins in her grave.I have a recurring dream in which I am driving with my maternal grandmother. The road is walled with tree trunks and tall green weeds. We end up in what must be our family home, which is teeming with relatives cooking. Nothing quite happens in the dream, but I keep coming back to it, to the journey through the forest, its saturation and promise, and to the food being prepared: fufu and ebunuebunu and boiled green plantains with cocoyam leaf sauce.The Ashantis believe that dreams represent our souls traveling as we sleep, or invisible threads connecting our pasts and our futures. Capt. R.S. Rattray, a Scottish anthropologist, compiled Ashanti dreams and their interpretations in \u201cReligion and Art in Ashanti,\u201d published in 1927, and included a reading that could be applied to mine: \u201cIf you dream that you are eating and you see one of your ancestors hiding himself (perhaps you only see his feet or hands), that means he is hungry. You give him fish and water on a table in your room or at his grave, and when you put the food down you call all your ancestors\u2019 names, then you will not dream of any of them again for some time.\u201dBut I never get to eat in my dream, and apart from my grandmother, who was alive when these dreams began, I can\u2019t identify which ancestors are lurking there.Advertisement"}

Mr. Suderman is the managing editor at Reason.com.To put those numbers in context, this year\u2019s biggest Marvel film, \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d grossed about $640 million worldwide in its opening weekend. In popular entertainment, nothing is bigger than video games, and the holiday shopping season is when many of the year\u2019s most anticipated releases hit stores. Yet video games remain something of a second-class cultural medium, even as geek culture has otherwise ascended into the mainstream. Today\u2019s elite tastemakers might be perfectly comfortable discussing the inner workings of the banking system in Westeros, but gaming is still stigmatized, at best as a guilty pleasure, and at worst as a psychologically destructive hobby for socially stunted young men. So the perception is that video games don\u2019t really matter, because they have nothing \u2014 or at least nothing important \u2014 to say.Like the classic westerns and gangster stories it draws from, it can be crude and violent. But it is also richly cinematic and even literary, serving up breathtaking digital vistas reminiscent of John Ford films along with a mix of deftly scripted stories about outlaws, immigrants, hustlers, con artists, lawmen and entrepreneurs, all trying to eke out an existence on the edges of civilization. It\u2019s a game about power, violence, frontier justice and murky moral choices \u2014 a new American epic for the digital age.As a technical achievement, it has no peers. Red Dead Redemption 2 teems with life. Towns have daily rhythms, tied to time and weather, that seem to go on without you. Wildlife roams the countryside, growing skittish if you move too close. Many video games allow players to interact with other characters only by attacking them; here, every character, even the least important digital extra, can be spoken to, and often conversed with at length. There is a big narrative difference between games and novels and movies: Instead of consuming a story, in a game you become part of it, choosing how it will unfold \u2014 even, in some cases, changing how it ends.Most choices, however, are smaller in scale, focused on the mechanics of interacting with the world. In both Red Dead Redemption 2 and Fallout 76 \u2014 an ambitious open-world game set in a post-apocalyptic West Virginia released this month \u2014 the emphasis is on staying alive: While playing, you must manage virtual campsites, and eat or drink to avoid in-game penalties. These activities can feel like chores, but they also nudge players into a more contemplative style of play, forcing them to slow down and explore their surroundings, scrounging for supplies instead of running toward the next objective. These games are existential journeys built on the rhythms of survival.Gaming\u2019s cultural reputation is born partly from the sense that playing is a way of avoiding responsibility, of escaping into virtual worlds where nothing matters. But Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game about both making choices and living with them, about taking responsibility for how you\u2019ve lived. It\u2019s a game, in other words, that implicitly tells its players to grow up \u2014 and it\u2019s as sure a sign as any that video games are starting to do just that.Peter Suderman (@petersuderman) is the managing editor at Reason.com.Advertisement"}

My mom was there to help. She started referring to me as \u201cmommy\u201d to them. (\u201cMommy\u2019s making you a snack now.\u201d) I\u2019ve only known these kids for a year, since dating their father. They like me, but their mother is very much alive; they spend half the week with her. When I challenged my mother later, she said she\u2019d \u201ctry to remember\u201d not to do it again. What\u2019s to remember? I am 40 with a Ph.D., and I don\u2019t want children of my own. I think she was punishing me for not having kids. You?ANONYMOUSYou may be right. But here\u2019s another take: As a terribly self-centered child myself, it took me ages to realize that not everything my parents did was about me. Here, for instance, your mother may long for grandchildren and simultaneously support your decision not to bear them. Resolving her disappointment may take a minute, but why assume that she\u2019s punishing you (or even judging you)?Referring to you as \u201cMommy\u201d was clearly inappropriate. She may have been trying it on for an afternoon or working out her relationship to these kids. (Odd? You bet.) As you point out, these children have a mother, and she and your boyfriend would likely be upset if they heard about your mom\u2019s nickname for you.As for you \u201cchallenging\u201d her word choice, I hope you did it by explaining the trouble she may cause for you with your boyfriend. You could also remind her gently that you understand her desire for grandchildren but that your life has taken you in another direction that you really like. Of course, you know her better than I do. But don\u2019t rush to judgment. She helped you babysit, after all.My wife and I give an \u201corphan\u2019s Thanksgiving,\u201d inviting friends and colleagues who don\u2019t have another place to celebrate the holiday. It\u2019s usually wonderful. But last year, I had a terrible time, arguing with one guest for most of the afternoon about politics. Now I\u2019ve learned that my wife mistakenly invited this guy back again. Is there any way to rescind this mistaken invitation?JAMESYou twice refer to the invitation as a mistake, James. But I wonder: Did your wife use the wrong list, or was she simply hewing closer to the spirit of your kindhearted gathering by including those without another place to go? In either case, taking back an invitation seems at odds with the event\u2019s origin story.If you\u2019re worried about spending another afternoon feuding with this fellow, call him and say: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re joining us again. Can we agree to steer clear of politics this year? I found it upsetting last time.\u201d Either he will, or he can find someone else to debate over dessert.My partner and I have a very cute Brussels Griffon dog. The breed is uncommon where we live, so he attracts a lot of attention. Many people are eager to touch him, which our dog doesn\u2019t like. When people ask to pet him, we say he\u2019s not friendly or joke that \u201che doesn\u2019t like people messing up his hair.\u201d Still, people try to touch him anyway, and our dog growls or snaps. Then they\u2019re upset! Should we train our dog to be friendlier with strangers or be more direct with them?TROYAssuming your adorable dog is on a leash and doesn\u2019t snap without provocation, no need for further training. Simply amend your response to include the word \u201cno.\u201d (May I touch him? \u201cNo, he snaps.\u201d) Skip the cutesy grooming talk; it minimizes the danger.For the rest of us: It can feel great to smile and nod at passers-by on the street. But that doesn\u2019t give us license to touch them, their dogs or their children, or to tell them that they\u2019d be prettier if they smiled. It\u2019s called personal space, people.My (same-sex) girlfriend and I are sophomores in college. We\u2019ve been going out for over a year. She\u2019s close to her mother, so she goes home for Thanksgiving. And I\u2019m close with my family, so I take a bus home to see them. But this fall, my (straight) sister, who\u2019s still in high school, just started seeing a boy, and he was invited to Thanksgiving at our house. And he\u2019s coming! This seems unfair to me. What do you think?J.J.The world is rough enough without shopping for grievances. If I understand you correctly, you and your girlfriend are both happy traveling home to celebrate Thanksgiving with your respective families. Neither of you was slighted, or asked your family for an invitation that didn\u2019t materialize.As a high school student, your sister probably lives closer to her boo (and asked your parents if it was O.K. to invite him). Also, he wanted to come; that\u2019s the main difference. No foul here! But if you like, invite your girlfriend to spend another weekend with your family.

{"Headline": "Iran & Saudi Arabia, Thelma & Louise", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe made two bets, and the Iranians and the Saudis responded with their worst impulses.Opinion ColumnistWith each passing day, U.S. policy toward Iran and Saudi Arabia more closely resembles the 1991 film classic \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201dFor those too young to remember, the movie starred Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, two gal pals, whose fishing trip turns dark after Sarandon\u2019s character shoots a would-be rapist, triggering one of the all-time great movie lines: \u201cYou shoot off a guy\u2019s head with his pants down, believe me, Texas ain\u2019t the place you want to get caught.\u201d This eventually prompts the women to escape the police by dramatically driving their 1966 Thunderbird off a cliff into the Grand Canyon to their deaths.What\u2019s this have to do with Iran, Saudi Arabia and the U.S.? Well, if you look back at U.S. Mideast policy over the last decade, what do you see? You see the Obama team looking at Iran and Saudi Arabia and saying: The Saudis are drifting and will never deliver on Arab-Israel peace or real reform at home, so let\u2019s bet on Iran \u2014 let\u2019s bet that the best way to tilt the region onto a better path is by promoting denuclearization and reform in Iran, which is a real civilization, with empowered women and a pro-Western middle class.So, the Obama team forged the Iran nuclear deal, which curbed Iran\u2019s development of nuclear weapons for at least 15 years, in return for a lifting of U.S. sanctions \u2014 and with the hoped-for byproduct of opening Iran up to the world, thereby strengthening moderates there against the hard-line Revolutionary Guards.And how did that work out? Iran\u2019s imperial overstretch was halted only by the Israeli Air Force dealing a heavy blow to Iranian units in Syria when Iran sent missiles there to attack Israel.I thought the Iran deal was a bet worth making. No regrets. It did curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 a big deal \u2014 but it did nothing to moderate Iran\u2019s regional behavior, which was never part of the pact. Indeed, it may have been the price of it, as Iran\u2019s supreme leader seemed to compensate for making the deal with the \u201cAmerican devil\u201d by allowing the Revolutionary Guards a freer hand to project their power.Then came President Trump.He tore up the Iran deal, reimposed sanctions on Tehran and vowed to advance U.S. interests in the region by selling $110 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and betting on the young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, M.B.S., who had removed the religious police from the streets in Saudi Arabia \u2014 a big deal \u2014 granted women the right to drive and brought cinema and Western-style concerts to the desert kingdom, all while snuffing out any dissent.And so, like the Iranians, M.B.S. used his carte blanche from America to project power and stretch far beyond his capabilities: intervening in Yemen, blockading Qatar, abducting the prime minister of Lebanon, cracking down on women driving activists and permitting, if not ordering, his team to murder moderate Saudi democracy advocate Jamal Khashoggi.Do you see a pattern here?To put it cinematically, Iran and Saudi Arabia did the full Thelma & Louise. But, this being the Middle East, they did it in separate cars.I note this not to distract from the Saudi murder and unspeakable dismemberment of Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia, and whoever was involved there, must be punished for that. (This was no rogue operation. There has never been such a rogue operation in the history of Saudi Arabia.)\u201cPeople talk as if America\u2019s choices in the Middle East are between \u2018good allies,\u2019 like Saudi Arabia, and `bad adversaries,\u2019 like Iran, but our actual choices are between bad allies and bad adversaries,\u201d observed Karim Sadjadpour, Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment.But it was all far beyond the competency of the Saudi Air Force, Saudi diplomats and Saudi intelligence services, and it all ended up in the crazy, vile, incredibly stupid murder of Khashoggi in the Saudis\u2019 own consulate in Istanbul, with only implausible deniability.An American president\u2019s job is to understand that all the key players out there have multiple agendas. Some agendas align with our interests \u2014 did we forget that Iran helped us defeat the Taliban after 9/11? \u2014 but many conflict with them.We need to extract the best we can from them, curb and offset their worst impulses \u2014 and get off oil as fast as we can to reduce our exposure to this madness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the strategic questions that matter in the Middle East, the president is cleareyed.Mr. Doran is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. Mr. Badran is research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.That\u2019s nothing to cheer. But it is vitally important to evaluate the policy on its merits more than its mode of expression. And the truth is that on the big strategic questions, Mr. Trump is cleareyed and right.Let\u2019s start with the question of honesty. Critics focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe may never know all of the facts surrounding\u201d Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, highlighting the contradiction between this energetic uncertainty and the reported assessment of the C.I.A.Presidents, however, routinely advance useful fictions.The true test of whether a presidential fiction is acceptable is whether the strategy it serves is sound.In Mr. Obama\u2019s case, the answer was no, because his policy did not actually stop Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It only delayed it, and, in the meantime, strengthened Iran without moderating Tehran\u2019s fundamental anti-Americanism. But Mr. Trump understands the centrality of Riyadh in the effort to counter a rising Iran and he is rightly unwilling to allow the murder of Mr. Khashoggi to imperil that strategy.Mr. Trump\u2019s critics counter with the claim that he is emboldening evil. Samantha Power, former ambassador to the United Nations, cited autocrats like Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Vladimir Putin of Russia, in addition to Prince Mohammed, in saying that \u201cTrump\u2019s siding with the meanest and nastiest out there\u201d will \u201cleave the world even nastier.\u201d His statement, she said, \u201cis a green light for would-be murderers in countries that have things Trump thinks we need.\u201dNotably absent from Ms. Power\u2019s list of evildoers, however, are Iran and its proxies. The omission is telling. As part of its pivot toward Iran and away from the Sunni states and Israel, the Obama administration turned a blind eye to the slaughter in Syria that Moscow, Tehran and its proxies unleashed, and, thanks to the nuclear deal, delivered countless billions to the Iranian war machine.His critics would say that Mr. Trump is now similarly emboldening a reckless Saudi regime.This is a false analogy. The Saudis are not the moral equivalents of Iranians and the Russians. The kingdom has sheltered comfortably for over 75 years under the American security umbrella, which the United States happily extended not least because the Saudis and their oil have played a pivotal role in American economic strategies. Mr. Trump\u2019s statement acknowledged that the Saudis are assisting him with stabilizing global oil prices as he seeks to quash Iranian oil sales. Whatever Prince Mohammed\u2019s faults may be, he actively supports the American regional order that the Iranians openly seek to destroy.Mr. Trump\u2019s critics are asking us to believe that the priority for stabilizing the Middle East today is distancing the United States from one of its oldest allies and instead working to achieve a balance of power between Riyadh and Tehran. The Saudis, they claim, need us far more than we need them.This is a dangerous assumption that is not born out by experience. In recent years all of America\u2019s allies, from Mr. Sisi in Egypt to Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey to Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, have begun spending as much time in Moscow as in Washington. Why would we think the Saudis might not also seek protection from Russia if they are shunned by America?Instead of standing with the Saudis, Mr. Trump\u2019s critics call for, as Senator Lindsey Graham recently did, sanctions that would persuade King Salman to appoint a new crown prince. But King Salman is not the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia; Prince Mohammed is. A policy that seeks to change the king\u2019s mind is based on a delusion that is far more deranged than anything in Mr. Trump\u2019s statement.In all likelihood, sanctions would simply embitter Prince Mohammed, who would respond by tacking toward Russia and China. The United States could console itself by celebrating its staunch commitment to principle, but its influence would diminish considerably.Less likely but worth keeping in mind is the worst-case scenario. Prince Mohammed\u2019s enemies, inside and outside the kingdom, are numerous, and American sanctions on him would put a target on his back. In a violent succession battle, what horrific forces would be unleashed? Outside actors, such as Iran and Russia, coveting control of the kingdom\u2019s oil wealth and influence over the Islamic holy cities, would rush in. The United States would find itself embroiled in another civil war as in Syria.In either scenario, Iran would rejoice. Critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s Saudi policy are already demanding that the United States pressure the kingdom to end the war in Yemen without so much as mentioning the need to ensure that the country does not become another base, like Lebanon, for Iran.The murder of Mr. Khashoggi was a brutal and grotesque act. The United States has registered its feelings loudly and clearly by putting sanctions on the 17 men who were directly involved in the killing. Punishing the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia will not bring justice for Mr. Khashoggi, nor will it make Saudi Arabia a more dependable ally. It will simply diminish the influence of the United States and embolden its enemies. The biblical advice to be as \u201cwise as serpents, and harmless as doves\u201d offers sound counsel to anyone who seeks to see their principles influence the world. The advice of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics is long on abstract morality but lacking in strategic wisdom.Michael Doran is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

{"Headline": "\u2018Enough Is Enough\u2019: Science, Too, Has a Problem With Harassment", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScience Times at 40Many women in science thought that meritocracy was the antidote to sexism. Now some have decided on a more direct approach.At 71, she still remembers an unwanted sexual remark from a graduate-school professor she had sought out for advice on her astrophysics research. And over the last few years, she has listened to stories \u2014 so many stories \u2014 shared by younger scientists at conferences for geologists and astronomers.So last month, Dr. C\u00f3rdova enacted the kind of structural change experts say is a prerequisite to increasing the ranks of women scientists, who hold only about 30 percent of senior faculty positions in colleges in the United States.The move may seem like a no-brainer, but it may be the most consequential action any of the nation\u2019s science agencies have yet taken to hold academic institutions explicitly accountable for sexual harassment. Other agencies require notification if a scientist can no longer work on a grant, but do not track the reason.For the N.S.F., which distributed grants to some 40,000 scientists at 2,000 institutions in 2017, the goal is also a shift in a scientific culture that has long sought to evaluate scientists without consideration for their personal conduct.\u201cWe were raised with letting the water run off of our back,\u201d recalled Dr. C\u00f3rdova, whose resume includes stints at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and NASA as its chief scientist. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re harassing me? I\u2019m going to ignore you. I\u2019m going to go do my research somewhere else.\u2019\u201d\u201cWell, enough is enough.\u201dThat the N.S.F.\u2019s new sexual harassment policy was put in place by a woman who controls a $5 billion research budget captures the bittersweet nature of the #MeToo moment for many scientists.As they grapple with the field\u2019s big challenges, ridding it of the gender inequities that many believed would by now be a thing of the past ranks high on the list.\u201cI think when my generation came along, we thought, if we put our heads down and did a good job, things would get better,\u201d said Cori Bargmann, a neurobiologist who heads the $3 billion science arm of the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropic organization.\u201cI even feel personally responsible, like I let these younger women down. I thought I would fix it by doing O.K. And clearly that\u2019s not enough, so we\u2019ve got to do more.\u201dAt one recent meeting, Dr. Bargmann recalled, a distinguished male scientist told her that she held a particular opinion on gene-editing embryos because she was a woman, and \u201cwomen are more conservative.\u201d\u201cI looked at him and thought, \u2018And that\u2019s your opinion because you\u2019re a dinosaur,\u2019\u201d she said.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussDr. Burnell believes her own insights grew from her outsider status in the Cambridge lab of her thesis supervisor, who received the Nobel Prize for their shared work in 1974.The widely held conviction that science, unlike any other field, will reward whoever advances the collective search for truth may not help.\u201cThere is this belief that science is noble and unbiased, and if I\u2019m good, I\u2019ll be recognized,\u2019\u2019 said Margaret Rossiter, an emerita historian of science at Cornell. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s true \u2014 Marie Curie came along and got two Nobel Prizes. But often it turned out not to be true, and women were disillusioned.\u2019\u2019Much has changed for women in science, of course, since the 1970s, when Dr. C\u00f3rdova approached a senior male scientist for advice on her graduate thesis and was taken aback by a comment that she describes as \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d and \u201cout of left field.\u201dIn 1970, the \u201czeros list\u201d published annually by the Women\u2019s Committee of the American Chemical Society reported that chemistry departments in 113 of the nation\u2019s leading universities had zero women on their faculty.Now, women account for about 20 percent of senior faculty in math, computer science and physics. They have received around half of doctorates in the life sciences for the last decade, and they constitute about half of assistant professor positions.But the representation of women overall decreases among associate professors and declines to 33 percent among full professors. (And only 3 percent of the women employed as full professors are African-American.)Defined as \u201cverbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility, objectification, exclusion or second-class status,\u201d it is far more common in science settings, the report said, than forms of harassment like sexual coercion or unwanted touching: less often a come-on than a put-down.\u201cI had always been thinking that sexual harassment was putting hands on people,\u2019\u2019 said Carol Greider, a molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the \u2018leaky pipeline\u2019 for years, and this may turn out to be the big gushing hole.\u2019\u2019Dr. Greider is one of several senior women scientists who said in interviews that male scientists frequently talk over female colleagues, including them, apparently without realizing it. She believes that pressure must be brought to bear on universities from the outside, and so she is co-organizing a small meeting next month to brainstorm solutions to gender discrimination in science with lawyers, economists, behavioral scientists and activists.Erin O\u2019Shea, appointed in 2016 as the first woman to head the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an influential biomedical research organization, has instituted a new program to support women and underrepresented minorities as postdoctoral fellows and young faculty, when they may be most likely to drop out of the pipeline or be diverted to less elite labs at lower-ranking institutions.\u201cMy interest is in capturing as much talent as possible for science,\u201d said Dr. O\u2019Shea. \u201cIf you want to capture the best talent, you don\u2019t want groups de facto excluded.\u2019\u2019For her part, Dr. C\u00f3rdova said the N.S.F. is working on additional plans to combat gender harassment.In an interview last week, she said she had not previously shared publicly the story of her own incident of harassment. Nor had she told anyone what happened decades later, when she found herself sitting on the high-level committee evaluating candidates for an award for which, it turned out, her harasser had been nominated.\u201cI explained to the group that I thought his conduct was not becoming of a scientist,\u2019\u2019 Dr. C\u00f3rdova said. \u201cSo that was my little thing. I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll do this for the rest of the gals.\u2019\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

I texted my mom. \u201cI\u2019m really sad,\u201d I told her.\u201cIt is so sad,\u201d she responded. \u201cThe synagogue is desecrated. How can the congregation go back to services?\u201dAbove is a portrait of my grandmother with her friends in Memel, Lithuania. She is now 93 and lives in Pennsylvania. The other two died in concentration camps.The Jews in Memel thought of themselves as German. Memel was part of Germany before World War I, and they went to German schools and identified with German culture. They were fluent in several languages, dressed in the latest fashions, and spent summers on the Baltic Sea. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the shtetl,\u201d my grandmother said. \u201cI think the Jews invented snobbery.\u201dHer father was a textile distributor and traveled for work, importing wool from Britain and lace from Belgium. This gave him a vantage point many in Memel did not have, and he saw Europe becoming gripped by anti-Semitism.As a 13-year-old, she felt anti-Semitism creep into her own life. She started noticing other students at her school were blonder than her. She remembers the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d salute being introduced in the classroom, without explanation, while the Jewish children stood by uncomfortably, knowing somehow it wasn\u2019t for them. One day she was beaten and spat on as she walked home from school, her attackers calling her a \u201cdirty Jew.\u201dBut at the same time, I was, and still am, a middle-class white girl living in America at a time when everything is in my favor. Most of the times I\u2019ve felt like an outsider were in my head. I moved to New York City when I was 20 and only then began to appreciate my heritage. I found, to my surprise, that there were a million other Jews just in New York, and millions more people of every country and faith imaginable, and for the most part everyone lived in peace.When Donald Trump was elected president my grandmother said, \u201cEveryone laughed at Hitler, too.\u201d Everyone in Memel had a beautiful life and no one thought anything could ever happen there.

{"Headline": "Thanksgiving Deer Hunt? Sounds Like a Great Time to Talk to the Kids About Guns", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q\u2019SWhen your child expresses anxiety about a family tradition filled with firearms, it\u2019s worth having a discussion about it.We were finalizing our travel plans for Thanksgiving, which we spend with my family in Vermont. Our 13-year-old son, who usually loves going, was hesitant about the trip this year, but he wouldn\u2019t say why. So, we asked his older sister to investigate; they\u2019re close. She told us his reluctance has to do with a family deer hunt that the men and boys go on the morning after the holiday. We told him he didn\u2019t have to go hunting, but he doesn\u2019t want to be around guns at all. Any advice for dealing with this?PETEI\u2019m just speculating, Pete. But if I were your adolescent son, and my short lifetime had included a terrifying spate of school and mass shootings, I would be skittish around guns, too. (Hunters: I\u2019m definitely not equating you with school shooters!) But there\u2019s only one way to figure out what\u2019s really going on here.Parents have to talk with their children about guns and gun violence in an age-appropriate way. Given the frequency of tragedies, it\u2019s only natural for kids to be anxious, even if they never bring the subject up. (It\u2019s often the scariest things we don\u2019t talk about.) Ask your son: Is it hunting that bothers you, or guns in general? How do you cope with your feelings? What can we do to help?The fact that he confided in his sister suggests that he may be ready to explore his feelings. An open conversation with you and his mother may be useful for both kids. If you need help preparing, reach out to a school counselor for resources.In my experience, engaging with fears also helps us manage them. Maybe your family can get involved with a gun safety initiative in your area. Together, talk and action may reduce your son\u2019s stress level (and possibly produce a fix for Thanksgiving).I am a woman in my 20s. Often I plan meals with friends who have their phones out the whole time: scrolling and texting, chatting with me, and eating at the same time. I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve also started dating a guy who seems to think we have to document every date with multiple selfies and post them on social media. I like him, but his posting habit is ridiculous. I know the stuff I\u2019m complaining about is pretty common. But can I get people to tone it down?ALIPossibly, but don\u2019t get your hopes up. I, too, find it annoying when people can\u2019t commit to me (for an hour!) without multiple phone checks. Every glance fractures the conversation. And I\u2019m not shy about speaking up: \u201cLet\u2019s put away our phones. They\u2019re distracting.\u201d Some people can oblige, while others experience immediate phantom phone pain.Here\u2019s the thing: We can be in the moment with someone or on the lookout for moments to post for other people. Many folks try to do both, but multitasking is a slippery tightrope. Consider a compromise with your boyfriend. Dates are just for you two (maybe one post allowed?). If he wants, he can live the rest of his life selfie by selfie.My husband and I eloped. We never hosted a celebratory party, but most of our relatives sent gifts \u2014 except for one branch of the family in California (including a cousin whose wedding we attended and to whom we gave a generous gift). Now, another cousin from the California branch is getting married, and we\u2019re invited. We\u2019re torn about attending and giving a gift. Are we being too sensitive?ANONYMOUSDefinitely! The whole point of eloping is to escape the rituals of a traditional wedding, one of which, typically, is collecting presents from those who attend. It seems that you wanted it both ways: forgo the occasion and still collect the gifts.It\u2019s terrific that your family was mostly generous with you. And you needn\u2019t attend weddings of people who hurt you. But I\u2019d make that decision based on overall feelings of closeness, not just whether they spontaneously sent a gift-wrapped package.My friend became a vegan recently. She goes on at length about the cruelty of killing other living creatures for our food. My husband is skeptical about her conversion at age 40. He thinks she\u2019s jumping on a bandwagon. Problem: She\u2019s giving a potluck dinner and asked guests to bring vegan dishes only. My husband thinks it would be funny to bring meat. (They have a teasing relationship.) You?J.Q.I think your husband needs to punch up his material before he pitches a comedy special to Netflix. Bringing meat would be disrespectful, not hilarious. The terms of the party are pretty clear: Come with a vegan dish or decline the invitation. Your call! But judgments about your friend\u2019s diet are not necessary, and needling her would be a lame gag.Advertisement"}

Photographers have also chronicled the attendant resistance to racism and anti-Semitism, showing how Americans protest and resist bigotry in ways that can be quiet or outspoken, but always principled.The juxtaposition of these distinct types of images shows the reality of hate, the possibility of defeating it and photography\u2019s role in spurring change. The photographer Judy Glickman Lauder explores that contrast between the human capacity for virulent bigotry and the courage necessary to transcend it in \u201cBeyond the Shadows: The Holocaust and the Danish Exception\u201d (Aperture). In her examination of this paradox, Ms. Glickman Lauder looks not to the present, but to an earlier and different era, when the Nazis exterminated millions in their demonic quest for religious and racial purity.\u201cBeyond the Shadows,\u201d which includes text by Ms. Glickman Lauder, Michael Berenbaum, Judith S. Goldstein and Elie Wiesel, alternates between two types of images. There are dark and evocative photographs, taken over the past 30 years, of Nazi concentration and extermination camps in Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia, as well as portraits and stories of Danish citizens who, under German occupation 75 years ago, bravely resisted the Third Reich by transporting to safety the country\u2019s Jews, some of whom are also profiled.Ms. Glickman Lauder\u2019s haunting photographs of death camps \u2014 many rendered through the otherworldly glow of infrared film \u2014 make visible the mechanics of genocide: the Nazis\u2019 gas chambers, dissection tables and crematories. Other images preserve the disturbing relics of those who died, from piles of shoes and luggage to a mound of human ash. These stark, atmospheric photographs are devoid of people, yet resonate with history and humanity. They are inhabited by ghosts \u2014 not only of innocent victims, but of the men and women who imprisoned, tortured and murdered them.\u201cIn the late 1980s, when I first visited Warsaw and Krakow, Auschwitz and Birkenau, I could almost hear the cries and feel the presence of what had occurred before me,\u201d Ms. Glickman Lauder wrote. \u201cThe buildings, the rooms, the objects, the earth itself, the stones, the trees, the mass graves, and the ashes \u2014 all bore witness to the darkest period in our recent human history.\u201dMs. Glickman Lauder\u2019s photographs of Denmark\u2019s survivors tell another story, one of considerable daring and fortitude. The only country in World War II to defy Hitler\u2019s order to deport its Jews, Denmark shielded the vast majority of its Jewish population thanks to a network of Danish resisters who used small boats to spirit some 8,000 Jews to politically neutral Sweden.Beyond the rescue, the Danish government, despite its accommodation with the Germans, took the unusual step of refusing to acknowledge its Jewish population as different, undermining a central tenet of Nazism: that Jews were racially inferior. \u201cIn Denmark, we were always regarded as normal citizens,\u201d Rabbi Bent Melchior recalled in a 2017 interview. \u201cIf a neighbor was being persecuted, you helped your neighbor.\u201dUltimately, the Danish resistance was a unique effort to stand up to Nazi degeneracy. \u201cIn the service of Christian and Democratic ideals \u2014 through a unique configuration of individual and institutional initiatives \u2014 Danes achieved collective morality in the pursuit of collective resistance, resilience, and rescue,\u201d Ms. Goldstein wrote.The photographs and stories in \u201cBeyond the Shadows\u201d are not just a reminder of how racism and anti-Semitism can foment violence and murder, but a warning for our uneasy present, when white nationalism and neo-Nazism are on the upswing. These stories are also a primer on how to stand up to prejudice, transcend tribalism and embrace our shared humanity.\u201cHatred, injustice, and genocide did not end with World War II, and evil is present with us today in too many parts of the word\u201d Ms. Glickman Lauder wrote. \u201c\u2018The other\u2019 continues to be vilified. We must challenge ourselves to step out of the comfortable role of bystander, and to stand in the way of all forms of hate. We need the moral courage to act against all injustice\u201dIn a sad twist, the book is also a reminder that history is not always destiny. As Ms. Goldstein observed, the righteousness of the Danish rescue, once seen as a model of minority protection, no longer endures: \u201cToday Denmark has closed its borders to refugees to preserve its welfare state and cohesive tribal identity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEuropean countries are in crisis over diversity and national cohesion and security. The stability of Europe, torn over diversity, is once again at stake.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "Why the Perfect Red-State Democrat Lost", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaylor Sappington is exactly the kind of candidate his party should want in Ohio. But he couldn\u2019t get union support.Mr. MacGillis is a political reporter.Taylor Sappington heard the call like so many other Democrats in the year after Nov. 8, 2016. He had seen Donald Trump coming, homing in on his little town, Nelsonville, Ohio, in the state\u2019s impoverished Appalachian southeast. The town of 5,300 people had voted for Barack Obama twice by large margins.Mr. Trump was Nelsonville\u2019s pick in 2016, though it was more by default than acclamation. Mr. Trump won there with less than a majority, with 30 percent fewer votes than Mr. Obama had gotten four years earlier.Mr. Sappington, a 27-year-old Ohio native, took this as evidence that Nelsonville was not beyond redemption, that the town where he had grown up in hard circumstances \u2014 the son of a single mother who was for a time on food stamps, living deep in the woods in a manufactured home \u2014 wasn\u2019t really Trump country.The state\u2019s makeup had been trending red, too. At a time when the share of white voters without college degrees \u2014 who are fast becoming the Republican base \u2014 decreased nationwide, it held strong in Ohio. The state was drawing relatively few immigrants, its education system was sliding in national rankings and, with its smaller cities and towns falling far behind thriving Columbus, it was losing many young college grads to jobs out of state.Not Taylor Sappington, though. He wanted to stay. He had gotten hooked on national politics in high school, around the time he read a book on Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s 1968 campaign. And he had gotten out of Nelsonville, winning nearly a full ride to George Washington University.But he felt out of place in D.C. \u2014 the wealthy students who abused expensive drugs and thought nothing of paying big cover charges at clubs, the dead-eyed people in suits rushing down the sidewalks \u2014 and he\u2019d come back to finish at Ohio University, down the road from Nelsonville, in Athens. He took a break from school to work for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign in Ohio. And even before he had his diploma in hand, he\u2019d run for, and won, a seat on the Nelsonville City Council.The Council seat came with only a $100 monthly stipend. So Mr. Sappington kept working as a waiter at the Texas Roadhouse in Athens. Later on, he added another gig: fixing broken smartphone screens in partnership with his younger brother, who drove an hour each way to work as a correctional officer at the prison in Chillicothe.Mr. Sappington was content to stick with this combination for a while. He scratched out a living while pushing his agenda on the Council: finding the money to fix the town\u2019s rutted roads, demolishing vacant homes, pushing for a mayoral system of government.Then came 2016, which gave Mr. Trump an eight-percentage-point win in Ohio and swept in a new state representative for the district that included Nelsonville, which had been held by a Democrat for the previous eight years.It was now held by a young Republican, Jay Edwards, who had been three years ahead of Mr. Sappington at Nelsonville-York High. He was a star quarterback who\u2019d gone on to play linebacker at Ohio University, the scion of a prosperous local family.Mr. Sappington was still mourning the election when, just a few weeks later, he confronted darkness of a different order. His longtime boyfriend \u2014 a gentle autodidact who had taught himself to build furniture and musical instruments when not working at Ruby Tuesday \u2014 committed suicide, at age 25. At the next council meeting, Mr. Sappington spoke about the death, and the need for better mental health services in southeast Ohio. Jay Edwards was in the audience, as both Mr. Sappington and another council member recall, and stood up to leave in the middle of his remarks. (Mr. Edwards declined to comment on the record about that meeting or the race.)The gloom seemed relentless. Mr. Sappington decided the best way to fight it was to have something else to think about. Late last year, he made up his mind to run against Mr. Edwards, to reclaim the 94th House District in the Ohio Statehouse for the Democrats.What he didn\u2019t reckon with was that those organizations were already making a very different sort of calculus about his district, and about Ohio in general. The video was so powerful that the Ohio House Democratic Caucus played it at a fund-raiser in the capital. Mr. Sappington learned of this secondhand, he said, because he wasn\u2019t invited to the event. In general, he was having difficulty getting assistance from party leaders in Columbus, who seemed to be ranking candidates\u2019 eligibility for support based in large part on the money they\u2019d been able to raise. It wasn\u2019t easy for a waiter in the poorest corner of the state to get people to write him checks, but Mr. Sappington had been prepared for that challenge.What he hadn\u2019t been prepared for was the lack of organizational support. Progressive groups in Washington and New York were focused mostly on congressional seats \u2014 never mind that it was state legislatures that would determine congressional lines for the next decade. Mr. Sappington was stunned. He was about as pro-union as one could be. In his video, he had mentioned his earlier activism against the law that Ohio Republicans had pushed through in 2011 eliminating collective bargaining for public employees, which was later overturned by referendum. His mother had been active in Afscme; his brother belonged to the Civil Service Employees Association. And Mr. Sappington himself was a low-wage service worker. Yet he was losing labor support to a Republican who had supported a state budget that effectively reduced funding for education. What he learned when he asked around, and what I later confirmed, was that the unions were, in many cases, making a grimly pragmatic decision in his race and others around the state. The Democrats had fallen to such a woeful level in Ohio state government that unions felt as if they had no choice but to make friends, or at least nonenemies, with some Republicans, in hopes of staving off anti-union measures such as \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation and elimination of prevailing-wage standards.For years, unions in the Midwest have rightly prided themselves on delivering the Democrats far higher margins among white working-class union members than among their nonunion brethren. But Mr. Trump had strained that bond in some unions, drawing support from many members even as their leaders had remained nominally committed to Hillary Clinton. Most unions were back on board with the Democrats in Midwestern federal and statewide races this year. In state legislative races in Ohio, though, unions hedged their bets. The Ohio Education Association, for instance, endorsed 13 Republicans in State House races and three in State Senate races, while staying neutral in some others.\u201cIf we were just looking at this as a partisan exercise and \u2018to the winner go the spoils,\u2019 we\u2019d have been on the outside looking in, and we can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d said Scott DiMauro, vice president of the Ohio Education Association. \u201cRepublicans have supermajorities in both houses, and we\u2019ve got to work with both parties to make progress on key issues.\u201d Joe Weidner, communications director for Afscme\u2019s statewide Council 8, gave a similar rationale. \u201cWe don\u2019t just push the button for the Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the people who are behind us and will support us and we\u2019ll support them. Party is important for us; we align a lot with the Democrats. But we also have Republicans we align with.\u201dSeen from one side, this was realpolitik. Seen from another, it was self-fulfilling fatalism, consigning the unions\u2019 Democratic allies to permanent minority status.Mr. Sappington forged on without the unions. His campaign\u2019s slogan: \u201cHealth Care. Infrastructure. Integrity.\u201d He had the help of a dedicated band of supporters, including an Ohio University student, Jordan Kelley, who was on leave from his studies while he saved money for his final semesters working at Buffalo Wild Wings. Bit by bit, Mr. Sappington raised money, bringing in about $80,000. That was enough for radio ads, postage for thousands of handwritten postcards and stipends for campaign workers.But it was far less than the $430,000 that Mr. Edwards had raised since 2016, nearly half of which was from unions. He shared much of this largess with others in his party, which meant the unions\u2019 money was also helping Republicans who were less pro-labor than Mr. Edwards.Other organizational backing remained slow in coming. The state House Democratic Caucus sent a young campaign manager and paid half of his salary, but Mr. Sappington found him to be ill suited to the race and replaced him after six weeks. Mr. Sappington struggled to get Democratic candidates for statewide office to campaign alongside him in the district. One national progressive group whose help he had sought sent no money, but did send, as a gesture of moral support, a package that included nuts and dried fruit.On the night before the election, when other candidates might have done final phone-banking, Mr. Sappington had to report to Texas Roadhouse for a staff meeting on new food-safety measures. The next day, he traveled around the district to check on turnout levels. At night he headed to a vacation cabin in the woods that he had rented to watch election returns. His friends and family assembled to eat his mom\u2019s chili and watch MSNBC.Mr. Sappington sat with a laptop, monitoring the numbers trickling in from around the 94th District. Athens had turned out strongly, and he\u2019d racked up big majorities there. But he\u2019d been swamped in the rural areas. Mr. Edwards\u2019s margin was the exact same as it had been against a different Democrat two years ago; 58 percent to 42 percent.The numbers were bleak for Democrats across the state. Sherrod Brown had won re-election to the Senate against a flawed opponent, by about six percentage points, but he was an anomaly. Democrats had not managed to win a single one of those gerrymandered congressional seats. They still held only four of 16, despite winning 48 percent of the congressional vote. They had lost not only the election for governor but also for every other statewide office. They\u2019d picked up only four seats in the state House and lost one in the Senate, leaving Republican supermajorities in both chambers \u2014 this despite Democrats having won a near majority of total votes in those races, a sign of just how effectively gerrymandered districts were. In a way, the Democrats\u2019 failure to make big gains had affirmed the unions\u2019 self-protective strategy; but that failure had been partly abetted by the unions themselves.There was another aspect, though, to the failure of the unions, state party leaders and progressive organizations to strongly support candidates like Taylor Sappington. He is a native of small-town Ohio, working-class not only in his roots but in his own livelihood: exactly the sort of elected official whom Democrats say they need to cultivate in areas where the party is losing ground. At 9:45 p.m., Mr. Sappington slipped out of the cabin to call Jay Edwards and concede the race.When he came back into the cabin, his face was drawn. He said that Mr. Edwards hadn\u2019t immediately known who was calling, and a hard conversation was made harder.\u201cHey, Jay,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cIt\u2019s Taylor Sappington.\u201d\u201cTaylor who?\u201d said Mr. Edwards.Advertisement"}

But based on news reports, he said, Dr. He appeared to have \u201cblatantly violated China\u2019s relevant laws and regulations\u201d and broken \u201cthe bottom line of morality and ethics that the academic community adheres to,\u201d the state broadcaster China Central Television reported on Thursday.\u201cIt is shocking and unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Xu was quoted as saying. \u201cWe are resolutely opposed to it.\u201dThe suspension follows international condemnation from scientists who maintain that Dr. He\u2019s conduct was unethical. They say there are serious unanswered questions about the safety of embryo editing and a need to make sure that such research is conducted in a transparent, monitored way so the technology is not misused.Mr. Xu had said earlier that Chinese regulations issued in 2003 permitted gene-editing experiments on embryos for research purposes, but only if they remained viable for no more than 14 days.On Monday, a group of 122 Chinese scientists issued a statement calling Dr. He\u2019s actions \u201ccrazy\u201d and his claims \u201ca huge blow to the global reputation and development of Chinese science.\u201dAt the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Dr. He acknowledged that he had not made his university in China aware of the research he was doing. He said he had initially paid for the research himself, then later from his university funding.Dr. He pushed back against suggestions that he had been secretive about his work, saying that he had presented preliminary aspects of it at conferences and consulted with scientists in the United States and elsewhere. He said he had submitted his research to a scientific journal for review and had not expected to be presenting it at the conference.One of many areas of confusion about Dr. He\u2019s research was the status of a possible pregnancy of a second woman he said he had implanted with an edited embryo. On Wednesday, under questioning from scientists after his talk, Dr. He said there had been a second implantation in an early stage.When asked by Robin Lovell-Badge, a professor of genetics and embryology at the Francis Crick Institute in London, whether by early stage Dr. He meant a \u201cchemical pregnancy\u201d or early miscarriage, Dr. He said \u201cyes.\u201dOn Thursday, however, Dr. Lovell-Badge told reporters that he could not be sure that Dr. He understood that \u201cchemical pregnancy\u201d referred to a pregnancy that was lost.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t necessarily know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Dr. Lovell-Badge said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. He said he confirmed that essentially they\u2019d done the hormone test for whether or not the woman was pregnant. And the answer is yes. But it\u2019s very early, so it could turn into a chemical pregnancy meaning there was a miscarriage. Many embryos fail to survive.\u201dDr. He had been scheduled to speak again at the conference on Thursday, but his talk was canceled.Dr. Robin Lovell-Badge, who moderated the Wednesday session, said in an email that \u201cit would have been difficult to have sufficient security\u201d for a second talk. He said that Dr. He had decided not to attend after he was told about the security arrangements.Dr. Lovell-Badge said Thursday that the organizers had felt it was \u201cimportant to give Dr. He a platform to present what he had done.\u201d\u201cWe therefore do not regret at all allowing him to present yesterday, but giving him a second opportunity today might also have been viewed as support for him,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is another reason the committee did not want him back today.\u201dTiffany May contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

Scanner", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers got an inside look at beatboxers\u2019 lips, mouths and throats as they performed. It\u2019s not every day that scientists get a beatboxer to perform inside an M.R.I. machine. But the researchers who did got to see a show, and now so do you (we recommend you watch this short video with the sound on).Beatboxing, in which artists use clicks, rolls and their own breath to create the sounds of a drum machine or other effects, has long been used by performers of jazz, hip-hop and other genres. Virtuosos can effectively accompany themselves, mimicking the sound of an entire band\u2019s worth of instruments.Beatboxing has been studied before, but usually with data from only a single performer. Timothy Greer, the computer science graduate student at the University of Southern California who presented the research, and colleagues worked with a diverse array of beatboxers: two experts, two novices and an intermediate-level performer (who is a member of the research team). Importantly, one of the performers speaks two languages in addition to English; the researchers are curious to see whether knowing other languages influences how a beatboxer moves their mouth in creating a given sound.Beatboxers had been thought to draw on sounds from human languages \u2014 a reasonable supposition, because the same throat and mouth structures are used in both speaking and beatboxing. But instead the team has observed that some of the techniques the performers are using to make their sounds are quite different from speech.\u201cThey\u2019re coming up with ways to create these really complex acrobatic sounds by taking approaches drawn from different parts of the mouth that they don\u2019t use in any language, and nobody uses for any language,\u201d Mr. Greer said.The researchers are also comparing what the mouth and throat look like just before a beatboxer lets out a beat and just before he or she speaks. By observing the differences in these actions, they hope to understand what makes beatboxing distinct from speech cognitively \u2014 how the sounds a person intends to make are reflected in the way they shape their vocal tract.\u201cWe also want to look at how beatboxers acquire new skills, which we hypothesize may bear resemblance to learning a new language,\u201d Mr. Greer said.Mr. Greer does not beatbox seriously himself, though he plays the piano and the saxophone. But he admitted: \u201cI found myself doing it more in the shower now that I study it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s Why Election Day in Florida and Georgia Has Turned Into Election Week and a Half", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Florida and Georgia, two outsize states in the Deep South, Election Day hasn\u2019t actually ended.What voters did not know when they cast their ballots on Nov. 6 was that nearly 10 days later, they would not know the outcome of Florida\u2019s high-profile Senate race or Georgia\u2019s contentious contest for governor.The races for office became races to the courthouses as dueling campaigns battled to answer the most basic question of democracy: Which ballots count?In a state with a reputation for tight races, the blistering Senate race between Gov. Rick Scott and the incumbent, Bill Nelson, a Democrat \u2014 appeared headed for a recount by the end of election night. Before long, the recount included three statewide races and three legislative contests.The results of the machine recount had to be turned in by 3 p.m. on Thursday. Just hours before, the Democrat\u2019s hope of extending the deadline was dashed by a federal judge. All but two counties \u2014 Palm Beach and Hillsborough \u2014 completed the count and tried to submit their results. Broward County, hammered by President Trump as a den of voter fraud, finished Thursday, but the recount was submitted two minutes late and the state refused to accept it.If a county can\u2019t meet the recount deadline, the previous unofficial results stand \u2014 those filed on Saturday. But \u2014 and there is always a \u201cbut\u201d in Florida \u2014 under state statute, even if a recount is not finished by the deadline, it must be completed eventually. Elections supervisors had already been scheduled to count overseas mail ballots through 10 days after the election, which is Friday. The formal election results won\u2019t be certified by the secretary of state until Tuesday.Secretary of State Ken Detzner ordered a manual recount in the race, as well as in the contest for state agriculture commissioner. The deadline for the manual recounts will be noon Sunday. The Nelson campaign intends to fight until all legal options are exhausted, according to several Democratic officials in Florida with knowledge of his plans.Advisers say Mr. Nelson, who trails Mr. Scott by 12,603 votes, still believes he will prevail, and hopes to add several thousand votes after a federal court ruling on Thursday allowed reviews of up to 4,000 ballots whose signatures had not been validated. His biggest hope \u2014 which he shares with Mr. Gillum \u2014 is that an as-yet-unknown number of votes, previously uncounted, will emerge during the recount, according to people close to the three-term senator. He is also closely watching the outcome of a lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach County, that would require state elections officials to count mail-in ballots not received by the deadline.The South Florida county whose hanging chads held a presidential election hostage 18 years ago is at the center of another election. This time, it\u2019s all about a recount, old machines and an unyielding deadline. The supervisor of election, Susan Bucher, said her aging and prone-to-overheating equipment had failed to count a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of ballots, so they were unable to complete the recount. About 585,000 votes were cast in Palm Beach, a Democratic stronghold. Hillsborough County did not submit recount totals in time for the deadline because the count had resulted in 846 fewer votes than originally counted, possibly because of two power failures.Mr. Nelson sued hurricane-ravaged Bay County \u2014 where Mr. Scott won \u2014 for the second time in 24 hours on Thursday, just one in the dizzying count of lawsuits filed. Collectively, the lawsuits challenge everything from Thursday\u2019s recount deadline, to ballots rejected for mismatching signatures, to votes received by email. The judge handling the federal cases said he expected to hold hearings every day, including over the weekend. The question now is, what happens to the lawsuits? \u201cI think fluid is the best word. A few will become moot, but the meatier ones that deal with process and standards and voter rights will linger after the election,\u201d said the University of Miami law professor, Frances Hill. \u201cAnd I expect even more lawsuits from both sides and public interest groups that will seek to enjoin the certification of the election based on access to vote, processes and procedures, some of the same things considered in the 2000 election.\u201dJudge Mark Walker of the Federal District Court in Tallahassee ruled that voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected because of mismatches would have until 5 p.m. Saturday to resolve the problem and have their votes counted. The court ruled that the portion of voters \u2014 it was not clear how many \u2014 who were not notified in enough time to fix their signature problem would be given the additional time.The pre-Election Day polls said Georgia\u2019s race for governor was too close to call. Almost four million votes later, it is clear that the polls were correct.The Republican nominee, Brian Kemp, leads his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, by about 55,000 votes. Democrats do not expect to pick up all of those votes; instead, they are hoping to gain about 17,800 votes to force a Dec. 4 runoff, or the roughly 15,400 they need to set off a recount.The Abrams campaign, citing the extensive litigation and Georgia\u2019s patchwork of elections procedures, has been adamant that it believes there are enough pending ballots to lead to a runoff. Mr. Kemp\u2019s campaign has asserted that he has an \u201cinsurmountable lead.\u201dThe courts have been considering Georgia\u2019s voting system since well before the first general election ballots were cast. But in the aftermath of Election Day, federal judges have been among the most important figures in determining which ballots are counted and how quickly elections officials can carry out some of their duties.The most consequential ruling, at least in terms of setting a timeline for the race, came late on Monday, when a judge in Atlanta ruled that the secretary of state could not certify the election results until at least Friday at 5 p.m. (The state had been expected to finalize the outcome on Wednesday.)Other judges have issued rulings on matters like whether to count out-of-county provisional ballots (no), or whether absentee ballots with minor errors involving dates should be tabulated (yes).Mr. Kemp and his aides have projected him as the inevitable 83rd governor of Georgia. Standing next to the retiring Republican governor last week, Mr. Kemp announced that he had hired a chief of staff and a transition team leader. He also said he had resigned as secretary of state, the post in which he oversaw the election and, according to his critics, actively suppressed the vote.\u201cWhile his opponent is trying to find new votes and undermine the election, Kemp is focused on leading Georgia forward,\u201d a spokesman, Ryan Mahoney, said.Ms. Abrams has largely been in seclusion. She has not appeared before reporters since the early-morning hours of Nov. 7, but on Sunday, she spoke out in a brief video posted to her campaign\u2019s Facebook account.\u201cWhat matters is that we know where every vote is, and that no one\u2019s vote gets discarded because it\u2019s time up, because that\u2019s not how this works,\u201d Ms. Abrams said. \u201cI want Georgia\u2019s democracy to work for all of us, and I want that to mean something. And that means we\u2019re going to keep fighting, we\u2019re going to keep investigating and we\u2019re going to keep reporting the truth.\u201dAnd with Mr. Kemp\u2019s allies assailing her for refusing to concede, Ms. Abrams acknowledged the personal struggle to maintain a campaign.\u201cThis is hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to just reach for closure and say, \u2018Oh, well.\u2019 It\u2019s hard not to just give up.\u201dReporting was contributed by Patricia Mazzei, Frances Robles and Glenn Thrush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This City\u2019s Overdose Deaths Have Plunged. Can Others Learn From It?", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Treatment GapDayton, Ohio, had one of the highest overdose death rates in the nation in 2017. The city made many changes, and fatal overdoses are down more than 50 percent from last year.\u201cThey just began to abruptly drop off,\u201d said Dr. Marriott, who oversees the handoff of patients from local rescue squads to Premier Health, the region\u2019s biggest hospital system.While it\u2019s too soon to know if the improvement is part of a long-term trend, it is clear there are some lessons to be learned from Dayton. The New York Times spent several days here interviewing police and public health officials; doctors, nurses and other treatment providers; people recovering from opioid addiction and people who are still using heroin and other drugs. They point to a variety of factors they believe have contributed to the sharp drop in mortality.Mayor Nan Whaley thinks nothing has had as big an impact on overdose deaths as Gov. John Kasich\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid in 2015, a move that gave nearly 700,000 low-income adults access to free addiction and mental health treatment.In Dayton, that\u2019s drawn more than a dozen new treatment providers in the last year alone, including residential programs and outpatient clinics that dispense methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, the three medications approved by the F.D.A. to treat opioid addiction. \u201cWe have medication-assisted treatment programs, withdrawal management \u2014 come see me,\u201d a representative for one program, Project Cure, urged the two dozen people present.\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in Narcan training, we\u2019re going to get started in a few minutes \u2014 you can bring your food with you,\u201d offered a representative of another program.Gov. John Kasich has said the state is spending $1 billion a year to address the opioid epidemic, and a big chunk of that is Medicaid funds. With Medicaid now paying for nearly all low-income residents who need it to get addiction treatment, Ohio has been able to go beyond the basics in spending its share of several billion dollars in the opioid grant money the Trump administration has been giving to states. One example: paying for people who go to jail and lose their Medicaid coverage to stay in treatment with their regular provider while they\u2019re incarcerated.During that period, carfentanil was showing up regularly in Dayton\u2019s street drugs, including methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl. Nobody has figured out why Ohio saw more of it than anywhere else, but there\u2019s no question it played a huge role in the explosion of deaths in Dayton early last year.By mid-2017 carfentanil\u2019s presence was fading \u2014 maybe in part because traffickers realized how much of their customer base it was killing, said Timothy Plancon, the Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of Ohio. The news is not all good. Cocaine and particularly meth use is rising fast in the Dayton area, as it is nationwide. And they\u2019re often mixed with fentanyl; 77 percent of the overdose deaths in Montgomery County from January through April involved fentanyl, roughly the same as during the same period last year. The national data also suggests overdoses involving fentanyl continue to rise, along with those involving cocaine and meth, while deaths involving heroin and prescription drugs are falling slightly.By now, most Americans have heard of naloxone \u2014 also known by the brand name Narcan \u2014 the medication that reverses opioid overdoses if administered quickly enough, by injection or nasal spray. But few American cities have blanketed their neighborhoods with naloxone like Dayton has. Montgomery County agencies distributed 3,300 naloxone kits last year, and are on course to more than double that number this year, holding trainings at treatment centers and 12-step meetings as well as at local businesses and schools.\u201cWe really jumped on it because we saw it as absolutely consistent with our public mission to save lives,\u201d Chief Biehl said.But as fentanyl analogs \u2014 whose chemical structure is slightly different and can be more lethal \u2014 started entering the drug supply in Dayton, it became harder to revive overdose victims with the standard dose of naloxone. So the city, with state support, has spent a lot more to provide higher doses \u2014 $350,000 last year.The investment has paid off, said Helen Jones-Kelley, executive director of Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services for Montgomery County. \u201cIf nothing else, you get that second chance with them \u2014 and in some cases that third or fourth chance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives people the opportunity to get connected to services, who would not otherwise have had that chance at life.\u201dEven though there are many more treatment options here now, that doesn\u2019t mean people stay in treatment as long as they should. But the city has an unusually large network of recovery support groups, including neighborhood clubs that provide space for Narcotics Anonymous meetings to Ms. Erion\u2019s group, which has thousands of members in Montgomery and four surrounding counties. Dayton is also investing heavily in peer support \u2014 training people who are far enough along in their recovery to work as coaches or mentors for others who are trying to stop using, including in emergency rooms.One example is an initiative called G.R.O.W. \u2014 Getting Recovery Options Working \u2014 that dispatches teams of social workers, medics, police officers and people in recovery to homes of people who have recently overdosed. The teams offer to help them get into treatment and to drive them to a program. They also supply them and their families with naloxone to have on hand in case it\u2019s needed.\u201cI just stop and plant a little seed,\u201d said Darcy Shepherd, a peer supporter who went through treatment for opioid addiction almost five years ago. \u201cI will pull up to them, ask how they are doing and if they are ready for treatment, and when they are, to give me a call.\u201d\u201cThere are more addicts coming out of the shadows,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stigma\u2019s being broke.\u201dWhen Sam Quinones, the author of \u201cDreamland: The True Tale of America\u2019s Opiate Epidemic,\u201d testified before Congress earlier this year, he said that \u201cthe more cops and public health nurses go out for a beer, bridge that cultural chasm between them,\u201d the better chance the country had at solving the problem.While other cities, including Charleston, W. Va., and Santa Ana, Calif., closed their needle exchanges this year because of opposition, including from the police, Dayton\u2019s program continues to operate at two sites, each open once a week. The needle exchanges also help clients sign up for Medicaid and connect them with addiction treatment.\u201cIf it\u2019s about conserving and protecting life\u201d Chief Biehl said, \u201cit has to be considered as an option.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Usually those first snowflakes have people reaching for comforting soups and stews, but some, myself included, may still yearn for lighter fare. Personally, I always want a salad, whatever the weather.But the other day, one of my favorite market stands was offering gorgeous spinach with medium-size crinkled, curly leaves. Freshly picked, this spinach had enough body to stand up to a forceful vinaigrette. You certainly can\u2019t say that about the ubiquitous packaged baby spinach that more or less wilts on contact with dressing. I prefer the larger leaves for a chewy salad with crunch.If you can\u2019t find hearty spinach leaves like that, choose another kind of green with texture, such as Japanese jagged-edged mizuna, a member of the mustard family; Napa cabbage, sliced into wide ribbons; or large arugula leaves. A mix of several kinds of sturdy greens is another possibility.I considered what kind of salad to make: Of course, there\u2019s the classic spinach salad tossed with crisp sizzled bacon and a hot dressing made in the skillet with bacon fat and cider vinegar. I often serve a spinach salad dressed with a zippy mustard vinaigrette, chopped hard-cooked egg and shavings of Gruy\u00e8re cheese or provolone. With or without bacon, it makes a great first course or light lunch. Delicious as those may be, I craved something with a fresher feel.On this particular day, I wanted a salad substantial enough to be a main course, and came up with this one, which takes cues from Japan. I enhanced the gingery, garlicky dressing with miso, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and splash of sake for good measure. For texture, I added chopped cucumber, thinly sliced daikon radish and edamame beans, along with a shower of sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds and peanuts. To make it even more of a meal, I tucked in slices of baked marinated firm tofu.The hearty, handsome salad fulfilled the urge for something green, healthy, vegetarian and light, even with a chill in the air. For that matter, though, this exceedingly satisfying spinach salad could easily be served year round.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How WhatsApp Leads Mobs to Murder in India", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "In India, false rumors about child kidnappers have gone viral on WhatsApp, prompting fearful mobs to kill two dozen innocent people since April.One of the first to be killed was a 65-year-old woman named Rukmani.She and four family members were driving to a temple in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in May. A mob on this road mistook them for \u201cchild lifters\u201d and assaulted them.\u00a0We went to the village where Rukmani was attacked to see how WhatsApp and local authorities have struggled to contain the false messages, which have circulated throughout India for months.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has a quarter billion users in India alone. Some of the false messages on the app describe gangs of kidnappers on the prowl. Others include videos showing people driving up and snatching children.This clip went viral. It was produced as part of a public service announcement in Pakistan, but it was edited to look like a real kidnapping. The authorities don\u2019t know who altered the video.False information has flooded social media in recent years, inciting violence from Brazil to Sri Lanka. The messages in India have preyed on a universal fear: harm coming to a child. And the millions of poorly educated Indians coming online for the first time mean many are quick to believe what is on their phones.Venkatesan, Rukmani\u2019s brother-in-law, was in the car with her and was injured during the beating. He described the attack to us.\u00a0As they got close to the temple, the family stopped to ask for directions. A grandmother nearby grew suspicious and called her son, who raised the alarm.\u00a0The family became nervous and decided to turn back. By the time they got to the next village, a crowd was waiting for them.\u00a0They were stripped naked and beaten with iron rods, wooden sticks, bare hands and feet. Videos of the attack were circulated widely online.\u00a0When it was over, Rukmani was limp and lifeless. The others were left for dead. Their red sedan was crushed, and their belongings were stolen.\u00a0The region\u2019s top government official said the police had gone around for weeks before the attack warning people not to believe the false kidnapping rumors. But they were no match for WhatsApp. \u201cWe could not compete,\u201d he said.WhatsApp\u2019s design makes it easy to spread false information. Many messages are shared in groups, and when they are forwarded, there is no indication of their origin. The kidnap warnings have often appeared to come from friends and family.WhatsApp said it was horrified by the killings.\u00a0Last week, it began labeling all forwarded messages. It also took out newspaper ads to educate people about misinformation and pledged to work more closely with police and independent fact-checkers.Authorities across India have tried curbing the attacks. Besides warning people of the false rumors, they have arrested some who spread them. In a few places, they briefly shut down the internet. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court urged the government to use \u201can iron hand\u201d against mob violence.The police have arrested 46 people for the attack on Rukmani and her family and are pursuing 74 more.\u00a0Venkatesan, 52, who had lived in Rukmani\u2019s house since he was 15, still doesn\u2019t understand why they were assaulted. \u201cThey just wanted to kill us,\u201d he said.Gajendran, Rukmani\u2019s son-in-law, was gravely injured in the attack. He was in a coma for weeks and remains in the hospital.\u00a0The most recent mob attack was on Friday. A software engineer was killed and three companions were injured after giving chocolates to children outside a school.Vindu Goel is a technology correspondent in Mumbai.

{"Headline": "Michael Bloomberg: Why I\u2019m Giving $1.8 Billion for College Financial Aid", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s eliminate money problems from the admissions equation for qualified students.Mr. Bloomberg is the founder of Bloomberg LP and served as mayor of New York, 2002-2013.Here\u2019s a simple idea I bet most Americans agree with: No qualified high school student should ever be barred entrance to a college based on his or her family\u2019s bank account. Yet it happens all the time.When colleges review applications, all but a few consider a student\u2019s ability to pay. As a result, high-achieving applicants from low- and middle-income families are routinely denied seats that are saved for students whose families have deeper pockets. This hurts the son of a farmer in Nebraska as much as the daughter of a working mother in Detroit.America is at its best when we reward people based on the quality of their work, not the size of their pocketbook. Denying students entry to a college based on their ability to pay undermines equal opportunity. It perpetuates intergenerational poverty. And it strikes at the heart of the American dream: the idea that every person, from every community, has the chance to rise based on merit.I was lucky: My father was a bookkeeper who never made more than $6,000 a year. But I was able to afford Johns Hopkins University through a National Defense student loan, and by holding down a job on campus. My Hopkins diploma opened up doors that otherwise would have been closed, and allowed me to live the American dream.I have always been grateful for that opportunity. I gave my first donation to Hopkins the year after I graduated: $5. It was all I could afford. Since then, I\u2019ve given the school $1.5 billion to support research, teaching and financial aid.Hopkins has made great progress toward becoming \u201cneed-blind\u201d \u2014 admitting students based solely on merit. I want to be sure that the school that gave me a chance will be able to permanently open that same door of opportunity for others. And so, I am donating an additional $1.8 billion to Hopkins that will be used for financial aid for qualified low- and middle-income students.This will make admissions at Hopkins forever need-blind; finances will never again factor into decisions. The school will be able to offer more generous levels of financial aid, replacing loans for many students with scholarship grants. It will ease the burden of debt for many graduates. And it will make the campus more socioeconomically diverse.And until recently, by some estimates, half of all high-achieving low- and middle-income students have not even been applying to top colleges \u2014 largely because they believe they can\u2019t afford it, doubt they\u2019ll be accepted, or aren\u2019t even aware of their options.As a result, they often lose out \u2014 and so do colleges that would benefit from their talents and diverse perspectives. Our country loses out, too.As a country, we can tackle this challenge and open doors of opportunity to more students by taking three basic steps:First, we need to improve college advising so that more students from more diverse backgrounds apply to select colleges. Through a program called CollegePoint, my foundation has counseled nearly 50,000 low- and middle-income students about their options, and helped them navigate the financial aid process. Third, we need more graduates to direct their alumni giving to financial aid. I\u2019m increasing my personal commitment \u2014 the largest donation to a collegiate institution, I\u2019m told. But it\u2019s my hope that others will, too, whether the check is for $5, $50, $50,000 or more.But these steps alone are not sufficient. Federal grants have not kept pace with rising costs, and states have slashed student aid. Private donations cannot and should not make up for the lack of government support.Together, the federal and state governments should make a new commitment to improving access to college and reducing the often prohibitive burdens debt places on so many students and families.There may be no better investment that we can make in the future of the American dream \u2014 and the promise of equal opportunity for all.Michael R.

Cities throughout the United States increasingly look to their own streetlight poles to meet this challenge. Because of their optimal height and access to power, the poles can enable emerging telecommunications technologies to deliver high-quality cellular and data service (and eventually 5G service) using small cell devices, and public broadband using Wi-Fi-transmitting hardware. In addition, the ubiquitous presence of streetlight poles can make it easier to deliver high-quality wireless and internet service more equitably throughout a city and connect those low-income neighborhoods that remain vastly underserved.Sensing this enormous opportunity, many mayors in the United States have welcomed the opportunity to partner with the private sector to equip their city-owned streetlight poles with these new technologies and achieve more equitable access in their communities. However, the telecommunications industry has quietly worked to usurp control over these coveted public assets and utilize publicly owned streetlight poles for their own profit, not the public benefit.In the East San Jose Union High School District, for example, the Digital Inclusion Fund will help us install more Wi-Fi-transmitting hardware on public street poles to provide internet access to the homes of predominantly low-income students. We will also use the fund to expand the distribution of free internet hot spots and devices through schools serving our poorest students and increase the availability of our popular after-school coding classes at libraries.We can do better. The F.C.C.\u2019s new rules represent a triumph of corporate self-interest over principle. Throughout the nation, local taxpayers will bear the cost of this subsidy to Big Telecom.

But that doesn\u2019t mean we can ignore the veterans who fought in it.Mr. Sides is the author, most recently, of \u201cOn Desperate Ground: The Marines at the Reservoir, the Korean War\u2019s Greatest Battle.\u201dSANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 Although more than 1.8 million Americans served in the Korean War \u2014 and more than 33,000 were killed in action \u2014 it is still our Forgotten War, a kind of also-ran in our historical consciousness.The South Koreans lavished them with free flights, five-star hotels, air-conditioned coaches, bullet train excursions. At the DMZ, across snarls of concertina wire, we gazed upon the police state that South Korea might have become. We were dazzled by the coruscating metropolis of Seoul, which, the last time these men saw it, lay smoldering in ruins. The veterans seemed tremendously moved to learn firsthand: They aren\u2019t forgotten after all.By and large, though, these stoic, thick-skinned men have come to accept that their achievements will probably always play second fiddle to those of World War II, the marquee event their uncles and older brothers and cousins \u2014 the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d \u2014 fought.Climbing aboard the truck, Private Chapman could see hundreds of Chinese pressing in, with bugles blaring and bullets sputtering across the snow. He swiveled the big gun and fired. Manning a weapon as lethal as this, Private Chapman knew it was only a matter of time before the Chinese found him. They shot him in the left arm, then the right leg, then the right arm. A medic treated his wounds, and Private Chapman climbed back on the truck. This time he was hit in the hip, then took numerous pieces of shrapnel. He had just finished reloading when a bullet struck his forehead, embedding itself in his skull. It knocked him off the truck, rendering him unconscious. The Chinese overran his unit and cut it to pieces. The engagement, known as the Battle of Hellfire Valley, had ended. Hours later, Private Chapman awoke to find himself with 10 other captives, hunched on the dirt floor of a farmhouse. Chinese guards marched them on mountain trails for 19 days until they reached a place called Kanggye, near the Manchurian border. Private Chapman languished there for nearly three years.When he returned from the war, no parades or celebrations greeted him. His heroics weren\u2019t written up in newspapers or magazines. He quietly went about his life. He joined the Air Force and served for nearly 16 years. When he kept having debilitating headaches, a surgeon removed the bullet lodged in his skull. He keeps it as a relic.Mr. Chapman, who is 85 and mostly homebound, suffers from neuropathy in his feet from frostbite, a common malady among Korean War veterans. His body is a miscellany of aches from his war wounds and his years in the prison camps. He has also experienced PTSD, although through most of his life the condition wasn\u2019t dignified with a name. It seems somehow apt, for a Korean veteran, that he now suffers from severe memory loss. Sometimes he can\u2019t recognize his own daughter. But his recollections of his war experiences are stark and vivid. Men like Jack Chapman are gradually exiting our stage. They\u2019re unassuming, uncomplaining men who answered the call and fought for a principle, long ago and far from home, in a war that was not \u201cofficially\u201d a war \u2014 a war that curiously became a dormant account in our public memory bank.

But Mr. DeSantis responded to Mr. Gillum on Twitter, accepting his concession anew.\u201cThis was a hard-fought campaign,\u201d Mr. DeSantis wrote. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring Florida together.\u201dEven Mr. Trump, who days before the election referred to Mr. Gillum on Twitter as a \u201cthief,\u201d complimented the Democrat hours before his concession, congratulating him for his \u201creally tough and competitive race.\u201d\u201cHe will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future \u2014 a force to reckon with!\u201d the president wrote.In a nod to the stressful 11 days after Election Day, Mr. Gillum said the state would have to look at how it conducts elections.\u201cWe need to update Florida\u2019s elections system and bring it into the 21st century,\u201d he said.Broward County\u2019s elections supervisor, Brenda C. Snipes, again had to defend her office\u2019s work when a small batch of ballots from the Senate race appeared Saturday during the recount for the agriculture commissioner race.Ren\u00e9 D. Harrod, a deputy county attorney, said 47 manila envelopes containing ballots for the Senate race had been inadvertently assembled for manual counting alongside envelopes for the agriculture commissioner race. \u201cSomebody took the wrong box off the shelf,\u201d Ms. Harrod said, adding that the mistake was caught right away.\u201cNo harm, no foul,\u201d she said.In Palm Beach County, elections officials planned to take the day off Sunday, because they had no chance of making the noon deadline for submitting a new tally in the agriculture commissioner race.The governor\u2019s race between two young and energetic politicians \u2014 Mr. DeSantis, a Trump acolyte who adopted elements of the president\u2019s white-hot style, and Mr. Gillum, a liberal darling running to be Florida\u2019s first black governor \u2014 was widely seen as a proxy battle between competing ideological visions of the country\u2019s future, one diverse and progressive, the other conservative and quick to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist policies.It was also an unexpected matchup. Neither Mr. Gillum nor Mr. DeSantis was viewed as his party\u2019s likely nominee when the primary season began. Mr. Gillum defeated a field of rivals that included a former House member and the mayor of Miami Beach. Mr. DeSantis, after gaining the endorsement of Mr. Trump, easily turned back the state agricultural commissioner, Adam Putnam, who had been viewed as the likely nominee.Mr. DeSantis, a Harvard- and Yale-educated former Navy legal officer at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, had represented the Sixth District, centered on Daytona Beach, since 2012. He ran for the Senate in 2016 but dropped out after Marco Rubio, the Republican incumbent, decided to run for re-election.In Mr. Gillum, voters were presented in many ways with Mr. DeSantis\u2019s opposite. As an elected official in Tallahassee since 23, he embraced liberal positions \u2014 like higher corporate tax rates, legalization of marijuana, tighter gun control and Medicare for all \u2014 that thrilled the Democratic Party\u2019s activist base. But they also gave Mr. DeSantis more than enough material to portray him as a radical leftist out of step with a quintessential swing state.And he campaigned on a promise to support military veterans, defend a scholarship program that pays private school tuition for low-income students and appoint \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d judges to the State Supreme Court, a promise that echoed a similar one made on the campaign trail in 2016 by Mr. Trump.Mr. Gillum said on Saturday that he remained committed to pushing for societal change \u2014 if not as the next governor, then as an advocate.\u201cAlthough nobody wanted to be governor more than me, this was not just about an election cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows the voices of everyday people to show up again in our government. We know that this fight continues in spite of the outcome of this election.\u201dAt 39, he remains young enough to run again, for the governorship or some other office.\u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be more to come.\u201dGlenn Thrush reported from Tallahassee, Fla., and Liam Stack from New York.

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Defends Facebook as Furor Over Its Tactics Grows", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, held a conference call with reporters to discuss how the social network manages problematic posts and its community standards.The call quickly went sideways. For more than an hour, the 34-year-old billionaire instead fielded questions about how he and his No. 2, Sheryl Sandberg, obfuscated problems such as Russian interference on Facebook and how the company had gone on the attack against rivals and critics. In response, Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 at times defiant and at times conciliatory \u2014 defended the social network, Ms. Sandberg and his own record.\u201cThe reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people is that you\u2019re not going to know everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d he said at one point.Yet even as Mr. Zuckerberg was making his case, a furor against his company was gathering momentum.In Washington, Republicans and Democrats threatened to restrain Facebook through competition laws and to open investigations into possible campaign finance violations. Shareholders ramped up calls to oust Mr. Zuckerberg as Facebook\u2019s chairman. And activists filed a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about the social network\u2019s privacy policies and condemned Ms. Sandberg, the chief operating officer, for overseeing a campaign to secretly attack opponents.\u201cFacebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee. \u201cThis staggering report makes clear that Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers.\u201dBut while previous scrutiny of Facebook largely focused on its business model and how its platform promotes viral posts and ads, the latest fallout was directed specifically at Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg.That has raised questions about the accountability of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. Mr. Zuckerberg exercises near total control of the social network because he owns 60 percent of its voting shares and is the head of the board. Ms. Sandberg is his handpicked No. 2.On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s board said it supported Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. While the board acknowledged that the two executives responded slowly to Russian interference on Facebook and that directors had pushed them to act faster, it said in a statement that \u201cto suggest they knew about Russian interference and either tried to ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened was grossly unfair.\u201dIn his conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg echoed similar sentiments. \u201cTo suggest that we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth, or to hide what we knew, is simply untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a much stronger place today than we were in 2016.\u201d\u201cIn general, we need to go through all of our relationships and evaluate what might be more typical D.C. relationships and decide if we want to continue with them,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.He declined to answer questions about personnel changes, but said Ms. Sandberg was \u201cdoing great work for the company.\u201d\u201cI did not know we hired them or about the work they were doing, but I should have,\u201d Ms. Sandberg wrote. \u201cI have great respect for George Soros \u2014 and the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories against him are abhorrent.\u201dShareholders said they were concerned about Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s concentration of power at Facebook. Last month, several shareholders filed a joint resolution to remove him as board chairman.On Thursday, one of those shareholders, Scott M. Stringer, the comptroller of New York City, who administers the city\u2019s public pension fund, said Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grip over Facebook protected him from being answerable for the company\u2019s mistakes.\u201cRenegade executives who are focused only on growth regardless of the risks \u2014 and withhold information from the board \u2014 put their company, shareholders and, in Facebook\u2019s case, our democracy in jeopardy,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. The New York City pension fund owns 4.5 million shares of Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg said on the conference call that he was not willing to step down as chairman.\u201cI don\u2019t particularly think that that specific proposal is the right way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am quite focused on ways to get more independence around our systems in different ways.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg may have other trouble on his hands. Facebook, which has grown tremendously as a business in recent years, is dealing with a slowdown. And advertisers, the lifeblood of the company\u2019s $40 billion business, are increasingly criticizing its tactics.\u201cUp to now, whatever you said about Facebook, you couldn\u2019t say it was a two-faced company,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief growth officer for the Publicis Groupe, one of the world\u2019s biggest advertising groups.But now it is clear that \u201cit says one thing to you and does something completely different,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said. \u201cThis is very hard if you are a marketer.\u201dIn Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike blasted Facebook. Senator Rand Paul, Republican from Kentucky, said in an interview on CNN that he was concerned over Facebook\u2019s power as a \u201cmonopoly.\u201dSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, said at a hearing on Capitol Hill that she planned to ask the Justice Department to investigate whether Facebook\u2019s hiring of opposition research firms to influence politicians violated campaign finance rules.A coalition called Freedom From Facebook, which represents public interest groups like Demand Progress and Public Citizen, also filed a complaint on Thursday with the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s violations of users\u2019 privacy. And Color of Change, a civil-rights group that has been critical of the company, blasted it for hiring Definers to discredit the group.\u201cFacebook is violating its most fundamental mission of building human connection, as well as the trust placed in it by billions of people, by advancing extremist far-right conspiracy theories that are aimed at denigrating Jews and belittling people of color,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change.Damian Collins, the British lawmaker leading the effort, said in an interview on Thursday that The Times\u2019s article appeared to contradict Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s previous statements to regulators about his knowledge of Russia\u2019s interference on the site.\u201cPeople at the top of the company were aware of what the Russians were doing and sought to keep it to themselves for commercial reasons, and that\u2019s a betrayal of trust,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cThey now need to fully account for what they knew about Russian activity on Facebook, when they knew it and why they did not report it to authorities much sooner.\u201dCecilia Kang and Matthew Rosenberg reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Even Fox News Stops Running Trump Caravan Ad Criticized as Racist", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMajor television networks and Facebook have taken the unusual step of rejecting an inflammatory ad by President Trump\u2019s political team that effectively closes a fiercely fought midterm campaign with a message portraying immigrants as a violent threat.The 30-second political spot, which mirrors the president\u2019s apocalyptic warnings about a caravan of asylum seekers in Mexico, was widely denounced as racist and misleading after Mr. Trump shared a longer version of it last week.Even Fox News, which has made warnings about the migrant caravan a staple of its prime time coverage of the midterms, felt compelled to distance itself from the ad. The network\u2019s president of ad sales, Marianne Gambelli, said in a statement that the network had stopped airing it on Sunday. \u201cIt will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network,\u201d she wrote.\u201cYou\u2019re telling me something I don\u2019t know about,\u201d he told reporters on Monday before boarding Air Force One. \u201cWe have a lot of ads, and they certainly are effective, based on the numbers that we\u2019re seeing.\u201dAsked about critics who called the ad offensive, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cA lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times so, you know.\u201dDivisive, over-the-top political ads have been a hallmark of this year\u2019s age-of-rage midterm battle, as candidates across the country accused their opponents of being terrorists, criminals, and in one case, deserving of a golf spike to the face.But Mr. Trump\u2019s ad, which aired on NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d the top-rated program, sparked a particular outcry \u2014 and a debate over the limits of paid political speech hours before voters head to the polls.The N.F.L. issued a statement disavowing any knowledge that the Trump commercial had been slated to run during its premiere game of the week. \u201cThe N.F.L. played no role in the airing of the spot,\u201d a league spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said. \u201cThe N.F.L. has no approval rights regarding campaign ads.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Trump seized on the rejection to rally voters against news organizations and tech companies that they argue are biased against the president.He also said that the Trump campaign could benefit.\u201cThe day before the election, there\u2019s not enough time to air the ad and have it make a difference,\u201d Mr. Castellanos said. \u201cBut if it becomes controversial, a lot of people will see it who otherwise would not.\u201dThe rejected commercial features footage of an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, Luis Bracamontes, bragging about his murder of two California police officers in 2014. Ominous music plays, followed by images of the caravan that originated in Central America.\u201cDangerous illegal criminals like cop-killer Luis Bracamontes don\u2019t care about our laws,\u201d the ad said. The final onscreen message: \u201cStop the caravan. Vote Republican.\u201dOn Monday, NBCUniversal said that \u201cafter further review\u201d the ad would no longer be shown because of its \u201cinsensitive nature.\u201d The network had previously approved the ad, which aired during a matchup between the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers, and several times on the cable news channel MSNBC.Facebook, which had been paid by the Donald J. Trump for President campaign to target the spot in electoral battlegrounds like Florida and Arizona, issued a similar note. \u201cThis ad violates Facebook\u2019s advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that users were still free to post the video on their personal pages.The 53-second version, which Mr. Trump has featured atop his Twitter page, has been viewed about 6.5 million times.He added: \u201cRemember this on Tuesday. #vote.\u201dJason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, said the reaction from the networks and Facebook could end up amplifying Mr. Trump\u2019s closing argument, rather than smothering it.Because of the controversy, he said, the ad was \u201cspreading like wildfire \u2014 for free.\u201dReporting was contributed by Daniel Victor, Sapna Maheshwari, Edmund Lee and Kevin Roose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Trump Voters Go For Democrats", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy is the Rust Belt trending blue for the midterms? The collapse of community may provide an answer.Even as Republicans grow hopeful about at least keeping the Senate during the midterm elections, one part of America looks sure to be brutal for their party: the Rust Belt. Democrats this November could conquer this region that was central to Donald Trump\u2019s shocking win in 2016. The prospect of another pendulum swing back to blue illuminates what Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016 really meant.Rust Belt voters in the last election and in this one were and are declaring a deep dissatisfaction that persists even in good economic times, because it is grounded in something cultural and deeply local: the collapse of community.The picture is similar in Rust Belt Senate races: Democrats will easily win Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, and they will probably win Wisconsin.Mr. Trump\u2019s election two years ago was billed as a \u201crealignment\u201d of the rural and suburban working-class whites in this region. But these states don\u2019t appear to be realigning.Take Wisconsin. Six rural counties in the northwest of the state flipped from Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 to Mr. Trump in 2016. The nearly 15,000-vote swing in those six counties accounted for two-thirds of Mr. Trump\u2019s statewide margin of victory.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]It\u2019s easy to assume that Rust Belt voters have soured on the president, that blue-collar voters are upset Mr. Trump never Made America Great Again. But it\u2019s not about the president: Mr. Trump still has extraordinarily high approval ratings among those who voted for him. The problem for the Republicans is that Mr. Trump made these Rust Belt voters into Trump voters, but he never made them Republicans. I visited Uniontown, Fayette\u2019s county seat, just before the 2016 election, and found a uniformly pro-Trump clientele at Smitty\u2019s Bar and Restaurant. I also found widespread alienation. The clich\u00e9 of small-town rural America\u2019s neighborliness wasn\u2019t evident here.\u201cHeroin and pills, that\u2019s all Fayette County is,\u201d one patron told me.\u201cI don\u2019t talk to none of mine,\u201d the bartender said of her neighbors. \u201cI got one who lives behind me who I think deals drugs. I got quacks who live below me.\u201d\u201cI got a loaded .22 right by my door,\u201d a man said over his vodka and tonic. \u201cI don\u2019t trust nobody in my apartment complex.\u201dLow social trust and low civic engagement defined the places that swung hardest to Mr. Trump. Because the vote was an expression of alienation and dissatisfaction, rather than an expression of partisan fealty, many of those places will swing back enough to give Democrats statewide wins on Election Day.It\u2019s a mistake to assume that all places swing back and forth in the same way. The tight community bonds that define upper-middle-class, highly educated places \u2014 and that anchor a community\u2019s party allegiance \u2014 are absent in these rural and suburban deserts of social capital. They don\u2019t have the robust youth sports leagues, the bustling PTAs, the dynamic local governments that white-collar America is used to.The politically swinging places like Fayette County also don\u2019t have the strong religious institutions present in more consistently conservative places like Western Michigan and Salt Lake City. Mr. Trump\u2019s core voters in the Republican primary, according to the Voter Study Group, were religious, but they were less likely than other Republican primary voters to attend church \u2014 another sign of alienation from community.It\u2019s no surprise Donald Trump couldn\u2019t solve these voters\u2019 problems. No president could fix a problem as local as the collapse of community institutions. And life in these alienated places is bleak enough that it\u2019s no surprise people keep voting for whoever is offering something different from the status quo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Well After Election Day, Florida and Georgia Voters Still Wonder Who Won", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Two days after Election Day, the 31 million residents of Georgia and Florida still could not say for sure who had won three of their marquee political contests. Razor-thin and shrinking leads in the vote tallies on Thursday unleashed hordes of lawyers, talk of recounts and runoffs, and the kind of bickering over ballots that brought back memories of the 2000 presidential contest.The two states\u2019 races for governor and Florida\u2019s Senate race hung in the balance, and the stress was palpable for politicians and voters alike.Officials were still counting absentee, provisional and overseas ballots, and the partisan camps were disputing how to go about it and whether those votes could still change the outcome \u2014 even in the race between Ron DeSantis and Andrew Gillum for governor of Florida, which Mr. DeSantis seemed on Tuesday night to have won.\u201cWhen I saw Gillum concede, I started screaming to myself, \u2018No! It\u2019s Florida! Let them do a recount!\u2019\u201d said Sherry Shepard, 44, a real estate agent from Miami Gardens, Fla.Though she is a Republican, Ms. Shepard said she voted for Mr. Gillum, a Democrat, to protest the angry rhetoric of her party\u2019s candidate, Mr. DeSantis, a congressman who allied himself with President Trump. She described the two days since then as a roller coaster of emotions.\u201cI am trying to figure out what happened, and honestly, I am suspicious of what might have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI have gone from hopeful to completely disappointed, to wait-and-see to back to hopeful.\u201dIn Florida\u2019s Senate race, just 15,175 votes were separating the front-runner, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, from the Democratic incumbent, Senator Bill Nelson, on Thursday evening, out of more than eight million cast. At just 0.18 percentage points, Mr. Scott\u2019s margin had become so narrow that a more thorough manual recount is required.That probably means hand-to-hand legal squabbling over individual paper ballots, and the strongest flashbacks to the surreal legal melee over Florida\u2019s presidential votes in 2000.Mr. Scott, who claimed victory on Election Day, bitterly criticized elections officials in two Democratic-leaning counties, Broward and Palm Beach, on Thursday evening, and suggested that his lead was being whittled away by \u201crampant fraud.\u201d\u201cNo ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from D.C. will be allowed to steal this election from the voters of this great state,\u201d said Mr. Scott, visibly agitated, at a news conference in Tallahassee. He said he was filing suit against officials in the two counties, which were centers of the 2000 election intrigue, over their handling of ballot counting.In the race for governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate, was leading Stacey Abrams, his Democratic rival, by about 63,000 votes on Thursday night and had 50.3 percent of the total, according to an unofficial tally by the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office \u2014 which Mr. Kemp headed throughout the campaign. He resigned the post on Thursday.But Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign insists that when all the votes are counted, Mr. Kemp\u2019s share may yet fall below 50 percent, which under Georgia law would require a runoff in early December.Monica McRae, 49, who said she had voted for Mr. Kemp, said she would not be surprised by a runoff, and in fact would welcome one, because it could give Mr. Kemp\u2019s victory more legitimacy.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fair election,\u201d she said, noting that she did not question Mr. Kemp\u2019s integrity. \u201cThe voters showed up to vote for who they wanted to vote for.\u201dExactly how many Georgia votes remain to be counted is a topic of hot dispute. The Kemp campaign says that there are fewer than 25,000, not enough to change the outcome, but the Abrams side insists that the figures are almost certainly incomplete and that no one could yet know the precise figure.The Abrams team has been blanketing the state\u2019s airwaves with ads exhorting voters who cast provisional ballots to do what is required to make sure they are counted. The state Democratic Party filed a lawsuit on Thursday hoping to extend a deadline for absentee ballots in a county affected by Hurricane Michael. Lawyers elsewhere are scrutinizing the methods some counties used to reject absentee ballots.As prominent Republicans sent congratulations to Mr. Kemp on Thursday, Democrats did little to hide their disgust at his claim of victory, which they say is premature. And in neighborhoods across Atlanta, few residents seemed to have removed the campaign signs from their front lawns.Ms. Abrams hopes to become the first black woman elected governor of any American state, and Mr. Kemp, who is white, has been pilloried by liberals for what they say have been voter suppression tactics on his watch that disproportionately affected minority voters.Mr. Kemp ignored calls throughout the campaign to step aside from a post that made him the supervisor of an election in which he was a candidate. But on Thursday, facing a federal lawsuit seeking to force him out, he announced his resignation.It was hardly enough to placate the Abrams camp, which continued with a program that it said amounted to \u201cprotecting our democracy.\u201d Mr. Kemp\u2019s visit to the governor\u2019s office on Thursday particularly rankled.\u201cHe gets up at a press conference and thinks we\u2019re all just supposed to believe that we\u2019re moving on and this is a resolution,\u201d said Lauren Groh-Wargo, Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, at a news conference.Republicans, for their part, insisted that the contest was over.\u201cThere are not enough votes out there to make a difference,\u201d said Brian Robinson, a former spokesman for the outgoing Republican governor, Nathan Deal.In its lawsuit, the Democratic Party of Georgia argued that officials in hurricane-ravaged Dougherty County should count valid absentee ballots if they were postmarked by Tuesday and arrive by Friday, after the normal deadline, because the storm had disrupted the mail system.Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for Mr. Kemp, said that Ms. Abrams was \u201cdesperately trying to steal this election in the courtroom,\u201d and, for good measure, described her campaign\u2019s news conference as an event where \u201cangry campaign staff and liberal lawyers doubled down on desperation and conspiracy theories.\u201dIn Florida, the gaps between Mr. Scott and Mr. Nelson in the Senate race and Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Gillum in the governor\u2019s race have been narrowing as the state\u2019s largest counties tally ballots that were mailed in or cast provisionally on Election Day. Florida\u2019s 67 counties have until noon on Saturday to submit unofficial totals to the state\u2019s division of elections.Along with those races, four more \u2014 for agriculture commissioner, one State Senate seat and two State House seats \u2014 are also likely to be headed for recounts in Florida, a state known for close races and contentious vote-tallying.Marc Elias, Mr. Nelson\u2019s elections lawyer and a veteran of prominent recounts around the country, said Thursday that it was a \u201cvirtual certainty\u201d that the Senate race would go to a hand recount. \u201cI think that it is fair to say right now that the results of the 2018 Senate election are unknown,\u201d he said, adding that he believed that Mr. Nelson would come out on top in the end.Mr. Scott\u2019s campaign has dismissed the possibility that Mr. Scott, who won his two races for governor by one percentage point, could lose his lead now. In a statement on Thursday, his team called Mr. Elias \u201ca hired gun from Washington, D.C., who will try to win an election for Nelson that Nelson has already lost,\u201d and added, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: When Elias says \u2018win,\u2019 he means \u2018steal.\u2019\u201d\u201cI think we had over 58 percent of our voters voted, and each voter received a ballot package of either five or six pages,\u201d she said when asked about why counting was taking so long. \u201cIt\u2019s volume that causes this.\u201dThe uncertainty was beginning to get to Jennifer Dupoux, a salon owner in the Broward County city of Tamarac. \u201cWe are three days out, and we still don\u2019t know who is going to lead Florida,\u201d Ms. Dupoux said. \u201cI have been voting here since I was 18, and I don\u2019t know what to think. This has been so stressful. I can\u2019t even look at the news because it\u2019s so upsetting.\u201dA statewide machine recount in Florida would have to be completed by 3 p.m. on Nov. 15, Mr. Elias said. If that process yields a margin of less than 0.25 percentage points in any federal or state races, manual recounts would then be conducted for what are known as undervotes and overvotes \u2014 ballots where optical scanning machines picked up no selection, or too many, for the race. Those recounts would have to be completed by Nov. 18.Florida voters fill in paper ballots by hand using a pen, and no longer cast the punch-card ballots that produced the infamous \u201changing chads\u201d in the 2000 presidential election.State Democrats dispatched lawyers to county canvassing boards and sent volunteers to campaign offices to track the counting of provisional ballots. And Mr. Gillum addressed supporters on Facebook on Thursday afternoon.\u201cIn spite of the fact that we\u2019re a little bit down in the numbers, we\u2019re hopeful that every single vote will be counted in this race,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way, all of us can walk away extremely confident about what each and every one of us did.\u201dMr. DeSantis, for his part, has already announced his transition team.Beyond Florida and Georgia, the drama of a down-to-the-last-ballot race was also playing out in Arizona, where the Senate race between the Republican, Martha McSally, and the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, remained too close to call. Ms. Sinema was ahead by about 9,600 votes, Thursday night.Richard Fausset and Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Patricia Mazzei from Tallahassee, Fla. Audra D. S.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Real Political Divide Is Generational", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYounger voters are fed up with the country\u2019s history of pessimism and oppressive consensus. Ms. Marinic is the author, most recently, of \u201cMade in Germany.\u201dFor years, the fear has been that anyone who tries to move beyond the country\u2019s dark past is opening the door to a resurgence of far-right nationalism. But there are younger generations now, people who are fed up with German angst and pessimism and in utter need of 21st-century political leadership and debate. Standing in their way are the baby boomers, those born during the postwar German economic miracle, who see themselves as the guardians of German memory. One of them, Chancellor Angela Merkel, recently announced the beginning of her withdrawal from German politics. In line to replace her are Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, and Friedrich Merz, 63, roughly her same age and outlook. And while a younger generation of politicians is rising \u2014 including another potential Merkel successor, Jens Spahn, just 38 \u2014 the boomers still hold tight to the levers of power.Germany looks less and less like the country boomers remember, or imagine. A majority of Frankfurt residents, for example, have an immigrant background, including three-quarters of children under 6. Other cities are trending rapidly in the same direction. Not only is it harmful to the recently arrived, but the insistence on a coherent, centrist German political establishment masks the fact that nationalist, authoritarian and xenophobic beliefs have long been present in the German middle class. Not until 1985 were German citizens ready for a president like Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker who would clearly state that the end of World War II was not a defeat but a step toward freedom and democracy. More recently, when anti-immigrant protesters \u2014 many of them baby boomers or older \u2014 began their wave of protest marches in 2015, most of the people in Germany and abroad were surprised. But the authoritarianism and the anger about foreigners had been there all along; as the protesters themselves said, the problem was no one listened. And no one provided hope.Bavarian voters aren\u2019t alone: Recent polls show that as many as 50 percent of Germans can at least imagine voting for the Green Party, particularly because of its progressive position on migration and diversity. Put differently, the real challenge in Germany is not so much the left-right divide as it is a generational split. The older generations, reared on consensus, are not used to open public debate, let alone diversity. But the younger ones are opting for a new social order that includes people of other ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations. They do not fear immigrants as much as they fear the fact that they can\u2019t afford housing or taking care of their parents once they get old.Younger generations have always had different needs from their elders, but in the past the establishment has found ways to meet those needs without ceding power. That\u2019s no longer acceptable to young Germans. They don\u2019t just demand a more equitable, open society. They want to shape it. If Germany\u2019s establishment resists them, it will set the country on the path to years of social turmoil.Advertisement"}

That included Senate contests in Florida and Arizona, the closely watched governor\u2019s race in Georgia, and House races in California, New York, Utah and elsewhere.As election workers count provisional and absentee ballots, and in some cases prepare for recounts, it could be weeks before some results are known. Here is a look at the state of play in some of the races that have yet to be decided.We\u2019re tracking results as they are tallied in Florida, Georgia and Arizona.State law requires a recount when two candidates are separated by half a percentage point or less, and on Saturday, three of the state\u2019s races \u2014 agriculture secretary, the governorship and a U.S. Senate seat \u2014 were within that margin.Read the latest on Florida here.

A federal judge ruled Friday that regular absentee ballots in one southwest Georgia county, delayed because of Hurricane Michael and other circumstances, could be counted if they arrived by Friday.Results aren\u2019t expected in the Seventh District, which covers part of Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs, until early next week. Election officials are counting provisional ballots from Forsyth and Gwinnett counties and will announce their findings either Monday or Tuesday.

Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]\u201cThis solidifies New York\u2019s importance and significance in tech,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\u2019s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \u2014 major employers in New York \u2014 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts.

But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700.

New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\u201cNew York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The rise of New York\u2019s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \u2014 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\u2019s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\u2019s appeal to Amazon.After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\u2019s board.For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\u2019s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\u201cEverything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\u201d said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\u2019s Data Science Institute. \u201cBut the East Coast is more well rounded.

Mike Isaac here, your trusty, San Francisco-based reporter covering all things Facebook, ride-hailing and other Silicon Valley ephemera. It has been a while since I wrote my last newsletter, so bear with me if I\u2019m a bit rusty.Social media was the thing to watch this week. The midterm elections finally took place, with Americans poised to see whether or not a widely predicted \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democrats would sweep the country. As it turned out, that wave was more of a choppy surf; Dems took back the House, while Republicans held onto their majority in the Senate.As Americans made their way to the polls on Tuesday, another big story was whether we would see a repeat of the 2016 presidential election: Everyone was looking for trolls and disinformation.Facebook, home to more than two billion regular users, was the obvious target. Since Russian-backed trolls succeeded in a widespread influence campaign that reached millions of Americans in 2016, Facebook has been under pressure to safeguard its network against the threat of further foreign meddling. The company, to much ado from the press, set up a \u201cWar Room\u201d to catch any last-minute information operations.Jair Bolsonaro, often called the Donald Trump of Brazil, surged to an Election Day victory, aided \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by voter suppression and disinformation tactics that flooded private groups in WhatsApp. That problem is more difficult to deal with on WhatsApp because it is encrypted. And users generally trust private messaging services more than they do more public venues like Facebook.Election Day in the United States was indeed a spectacle for Facebook, but for different reasons than we thought. Save for one episode, the day went off without much of a hitch. We\u2019re still holding our breath, but according to Facebook, there were no enormous reveals, no last-minute election night disasters, nothing that seemed to throw the electoral process completely off the rails.I guess we should be happy that things didn\u2019t go completely sideways after two years of scrutiny and preparation. Perhaps, at least for a moment, we can breathe a collective sigh of relief.Here are a handful of other things you may have missed last week:When Nintendo\u2019s game designers were struggling to name the character, Mr. Segale knocked on their office door.

{"Headline": "Specter of Meddling by Beijing Looms Over Taiwan\u2019s Elections", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 As Taiwan prepares to hold local elections on Saturday, concerns are growing that Beijing\u2019s long effort to sway the island\u2019s politics has been armed with a new weapon: a Russia-style influence campaign.Taiwan officials say the population of 23 million is regularly fed misleading information in the news media and on social networks that range from unverified footage of large-scale Chinese military drills to false reports of stranded travelers being abandoned by the island\u2019s government.The onslaught of misinformation seems aimed at undermining the Tsai administration and her governing Democratic Progressive Party, which that leans toward independence, while helping politicians deemed more sympathetic to Beijing and unification who are typically with the opposition Kuomintang.China\u2019s ruling Communist Party considers Taiwan part of its territory, and wants to bring the democratic island under its control. Ms. Tsai became president in May 2016 and has refused to meet China\u2019s demand that she endorse Beijing\u2019s so-called One China principle, which holds that the mainland and the island are part of a single country.Taiwan\u2019s government fears the use of social media misinformation campaigns are a new front for meddling.Beijing denies engaging in any kind of interference in Taiwan.A spokesman for China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, described Ms. Tsai\u2019s Facebook comments as \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cnot even worth refuting.\u201dMr. Ma said wider allegations about meddling were \u201ccompletely fabricated out of thin air. We hope our Taiwanese compatriots won\u2019t believe it.\u201dBut the propaganda war goes back seven decades, with attacks originating from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.In 1996, by which time the Kuomintang had effectively given up its claim on the mainland, China fired missiles toward Taiwan in the days before the island\u2019s first democratic presidential election in an attempt to intimidate voters from casting ballots for the democratic reformer Lee Teng-hui. But the effort backfired, and Mr. Lee won a resounding victory.Taiwan leaders say the propaganda is now carried over the strait through posts on Facebook, the chat app Line and a popular online bulletin board known as P.T.T.In September, P.T.T. drew scrutiny for carrying a widely shared post that claimed that Taiwanese travelers stranded in Japan were being rescued by buses sent by China\u2019s consulate \u2014 but only on the condition that they declared themselves Chinese. The post, which was carried by Chinese media, led to criticism from the Taiwanese public that their government had failed them.Concerns about Chinese meddling have grown as the election race heats up. Of particular concern to Ms. Tsai and her party is the mayoral race in the southern city of Kaohsiung, where Han Kuo-yu, a Kuomintang candidate, has enjoyed a surprising surge in popularity. Mr. Han\u2019s victory would end two decades of D.P.P. control of the city, and be a significant setback for Ms. Tsai.In October, lawyers for Chen Chi-mai, the D.P.P. candidate originally seen as a shoo-in for Kaohsiung mayor, told reporters they had evidence that misinformation defaming Mr. Chen that had spread widely on Taiwanese social media had originated from overseas accounts, including some with mainland IP addresses.It\u2019s difficult to determine exactly how much influence Beijing is having on the Kaohsiung race. Nathan Batto, who has been following Taiwan elections since the 1990s, said that is because discussions often take place in closed, private groups.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to look in from the outside and see exactly how much there is and exactly how much influence it\u2019s having,\u201d said Mr. Batto, an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica, Taiwan\u2019s most distinguished scholarly society. \u201cWe have some sort of fuzzy idea that they\u2019re helping Han Kuo-yu in Kaohsiung quite a bit \u2014 but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s why he\u2019s surged in the polls or not.\u201dPart of Taiwan\u2019s challenge, experts say, lies with weak media literacy and a hypercompetitive news industry that sometimes compromises editorial standards in the race for traffic.Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s International Cyber Policy Center, said that Taiwan\u2019s government should work harder to raise public awareness of covert influence operations.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the Taiwanese government being able to successfully counter such operations if most citizens don\u2019t actually understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Since then, I\u2019ve provided financial guidance and emotional support. He was able to graduate from college debt free and has a good job. Against my advice, he used his savings for a down payment on a house I don\u2019t believe he can afford. He is now planning an expensive wedding to his fianc\u00e9e, who has substantial student debt. He asked if I would pay for their rehearsal dinner. I was outraged and refused! I will attend the wedding, but I don\u2019t believe people should buy things they can\u2019t afford. Was I wrong?MARYWhen we become parents (or surrogate parents, Mary), we do what we can to teach our kids the lessons we think will serve them best in life. In your case, it\u2019s pretty clear that drilling fiscal responsibility into your nephew was a key part of your relationship.But the miserable injustice of having children is that there comes a point when we have to let them go, fully aware that they may commit every folly under the sun. I\u2019m sure your nephew knows that you opposed his home purchase (and probably his wedding, too). A parent\u2019s job, though, also includes being as supportive as we can be, within the bounds of plausible authenticity.You have no obligation to subsidize this wedding party. (It is probably obvious to every reader that a fancy dinner is just the sort of frippery for which you have no use.) But your nephew\u2019s marriage is a big deal, and you should celebrate it if you can. How about making a gift consistent with your sensible outlook: by paying down a small part of his mortgage, maybe, or his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s student debt?My boyfriend and I are moving in together. He is wonderful, thoughtful and brilliant. Just one problem: He has the worst taste in decorating! His current place is filled with African masks and murals of hunters and gatherers. (I should mention that his mother\u2019s home is decorated similarly.) I prefer a more contemporary, less carnivorous vibe. But he\u2019s very defensive about his taste. How do we find common ground?SAMANTHAStart by bringing down your snark level about your boyfriend\u2019s taste by 65 percent. (Who died and made you the queen of HGTV?) We are all entitled to live with the art and objects that make us happy. Personally, I love African masks. And though I can\u2019t quite picture these murals, I bet they beat not having a terrific boyfriend.The fix here is dosage. Walk through your new place together, room by room, and haggle over how few of his pieces your boyfriend needs, and how many you can tolerate. When you are both thoroughly unhappy, you will have succeeded. Welcome to cohabitation! (And one note on his mother: Make her your friend. Trust me.)Two months ago, I received a text message at 3 a.m. I turned off my phone without reading it. When I saw the message a few days later, I was horrified to learn that it was from a good friend who was writing to vent about the fact that her family had put her grandmother in critical care without consulting her. I called immediately and sent a sincere apology. No reply. Since then, I have called and texted several times, apologizing and asking about her grandmother. Still no reply. When do I give up?AMANDAI would say now. It is a sad fact of life that we are rarely able to meet all of our friends\u2019 expectations, reasonable or otherwise. And when we are extremely upset, as your friend probably was, distinguishing between those categories can be tough. Your story is plausible, your regret is palpable, and I take you at your word that your apologies have been sincere (and not laden with mitigating excuses).But now, the ball is in your friend\u2019s court. She may be furious with you (which seems unreasonable), fully consumed with her grandmother\u2019s care (which is possible) or surrounded by pals who are more dependable texters at 3 a.m. For now, give her space. And check back in with her in a few months.I swim laps at the Y.M.C.A. There is a sign at the pool that says: \u201cAll swimmers must wear swim caps.\u201d But a man who swims regularly and shaves his head doesn\u2019t wear a cap. When I spoke to him about this, he said the rule does not apply to him because he doesn\u2019t have any hair. That may be true, but what about the sign?ANONYMOUSYou, my friend, have an admirable penchant for rules that will undoubtedly irritate many of those in your social orbit. No need to be literal about this one. The swim-cap code is designed to prevent hair from clogging drains or floating annoyingly on the water\u2019s surface. By shaving his head, the man has taken himself out of the rule\u2019s reach (and undertaken a pretty big daily commitment). Let him swim in peace.Advertisement"}

Macedonia aspires to join the European Union, and his trial was widely seen as sending a clear message that even the most powerful politicians could not act with impunity.The Hungarian government, which initially took nearly two days to confirm that Mr. Gruevski was in Budapest, did not respond to requests for comment on his claim of asylum. But a pro-government newspaper, Magyar Id\u00f6k, reported that the Hungarian Immigration and Asylum Office had established that the legal conditions to grant him asylum had been met.The paper said that his case was heard on Nov. 12 by the authorities, who found there was a legitimate threat to Mr. Gruevski\u2019s life if he stayed in Macedonia, and that the local authorities could not provide the protection he required.\u201cI have not fled from justice, but I have used internationally regulated methods to continue my quest for justice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have decided not to grant their wish to see me in prison, where, from what I have learned, I was to be eliminated, while they are taking the country apart.\u201dMacedonian government officials \u2014 who were caught by surprise when Mr. Gruevski managed to flee the country and shocked that he would seek asylum in a European Union nation \u2014 were aghast at reports that his bid had been accepted. They said there was no truth to his allegations.The Macedonian government had submitted a request on Monday that Mr. Gruevski be returned to the country. In public statements, American and European diplomats said that the trial had been fair and that he should face justice in Macedonia.Renata Deskoska, Macedonia\u2019s justice minister, pointed out that asylum procedures usually take a considerable amount of time. \u201cIf he really got an asylum,\u201d she said, \u201cit must have been done quite expediently for some reason.\u201dThe government said in a statement that Mr. Gruevski had been convicted in \u201ca fair and transparent procedure\u201d and that he had \u201cnever reported any threats for his life.\u201d\u201cThe only reason why he escaped is to avoid justice,\u201d it said.Mr. Gruevski\u2019s choice of Hungary was not without irony: Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the country has instituted draconian measures to keep out refugees fleeing war and starvation.Mr. Orban also frequently says that no nation should interfere in other countries\u2019 internal affairs, noted Edit Zgut, a foreign-policy analyst in Warsaw. \u201cBut this is exactly what they have just done by giving asylum for a convicted politician,\u201d she said.While Mr. Orban has battled with Brussels on what it means to be a member of the European Union \u2014 notably around immigration policy and rule-of-law issues \u2014 his decision to grant asylum to a former political ally still came as a surprise to many.Macedonia is in the midst of one of the most trying times in its young existence as a nation. The government recently reached an agreement with Greece that would allow it to chart a course to join NATO. But to win Greek approval, it agreed to change its name, a highly divisive issue that stirs deep passions in both countries.Mr. Gruevski\u2019s escape spurred a host of conspiracy theories about how he was able to leave Macedonia on the eve of going to prison, including speculation that he had dressed as a woman to flee across the border, that he had the assistance of the secret services of foreign countries, and even that he had been kidnapped.In the end, it appears that his escape was less dramatic, if still complex.According to the authorities in Macedonia, Hungary and other neighboring countries, it appears that he was able to escape into neighboring Albania and \u2014 despite his passport being confiscated \u2014 travel with his own identification card with the help of the Hungarian diplomatic network to Montenegro, Serbia and, finally, Hungary.Aleksandar Dimishkovski reported from Skopje, and Marc Santora from Prague.

{"Headline": "China and Trump, Listen Up!", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth sides need to be smart and honest about how the countries became economic successes. Opinion ColumnistHONG KONG \u2014 I\u2019ve been in Tokyo and Hong Kong this week, and if I were to distill what echoed in all my conversations, it would sound something like this:From Chinese business and government types, some real anxiety \u2014 \u201cCan you please tell me what is President Trump\u2019s bottom line in this trade war? Is this about rebalancing trade or containing China\u2019s rise?\u201d \u2014 combined with some real bravado \u2014 \u201cYou realize that you Americans are too late? We\u2019re too big to be pushed around anymore. You should have done this a decade ago.\u201dFrom the Japanese it was gratitude \u2014 \u201cThank God for Donald Trump. Finally we have a U.S. president who understands what a threat China is!\u201d \u2014 combined with real anxiety \u2014 \u201cPlease, please be careful. Don\u2019t go too far with Beijing and break the global trading system.\u201dAnd from a smart European consultant it was bewilderment \u2014 \u201cBoy did the Chinese have a failure of intelligence. They had no clue just how much both Democrats and Republicans, and Europeans, all want to see Trump hammer China in these trade talks. But please, please don\u2019t start a cold war with China that will force us to choose sides.\u201dAnd from me to both my Chinese and Japanese interlocutors: I\u2019m glad Trump is confronting China on its market access barriers. Those are the real issue \u2014 not the bilateral trade imbalance. This is long overdue. But trade is not a zero-sum game. China can thrive and rise, and we can, too, at the same time. That\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for the past 40 years. But we\u2019d be even better off if China offered the kind of easy access to its market for U.S. manufacturers that it enjoys in America. It\u2019s time to recalibrate U.S.-China economic ties before it really is too late.That\u2019s why this may be as consequential a moment as America\u2019s decision to contain the Soviet Union 70 years ago. We don\u2019t want to be containing China. But to avoid going down that path, both countries have to be smart and honest about how we got here: China has to be a lot more humble about how its economy got so big so fast, and Trump has to be a lot more sophisticated about how America got so strong for so long.What do I mean? China\u2019s formula for success had three pillars. The first was a lot of hard work; delayed gratification; high savings; smart investments in infrastructure, education and research; and a Darwinian system of capitalism. In China\u2019s \u201cjungle capitalism,\u201d 30 companies in the same business emerge and compete to see which becomes the alpha male and wins the government\u2019s backing to go global. This system has produced high levels of innovation \u2014 Alibaba, Tencent, DJI \u2014 despite a censored internet, lack of a free press and an authoritarian government.The second pillar was a system of cheating on World Trade Organization rules; the forced transfers of technology; the stealing of the intellectual property of others; nonreciprocal trade rules; and massive government support for the winners of both its Darwinian competitions and inefficient state-owned industries.The third pillar \u2014 never acknowledged by China \u2014 was a stable global trading system built by U.S. statesmen and sustained by the U.S. Navy. It\u2019s been the U.S. Navy in the Pacific that has assured China\u2019s trading partners there that China\u2019s economic domination wouldn\u2019t result in China\u2019s geopolitical domination over them \u2014 and therefore made them open to massive trade and investment from China.America\u2019s formula for success, which dates from our founding, also had multiple components: We always educated our children to take advantage of the prevailing technology of the day.When it was the cotton gin that meant universal primary education; when it was the factory, it meant universal secondary education; once it was the computer, some form of universal postsecondary education was required; and now that it is becoming big data and artificial intelligence, it\u2019s going to be lifelong learning.We also always aspired to have the best infrastructure (roads, ports, airports and telecom), the most government-funded basic research to push out the frontiers of science so our companies could innovate further and faster, the best rules and regulations to incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, and the most open immigration system to attract both high-energy low-skilled workers and high-I.Q. risk-takers.Finally, we always stood for universal values of freedom and human rights, always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary, and therefore always had enduring allies \u2014 not just intimidated neighbors and customers like China does.And all our strengths were enabled by a democratic system and political class that at key moments always found ways to compromise to renew the elements of our growth model. We had not yet become what we are today, what Francis Fukuyama calls a \u201cvetocracy\u201d \u2014 where the two national political parties often just veto each other, making it impossible to reinvest in our formula for success.This trade war can end well only if China is honest about all the pillars of its formula for success and if Trump is honest about all of ours. We can get tons of trade concessions from China, but if we get away from the formula that actually made us great, we\u2019re not going to enjoy sustainable, inclusive growth.So when I watch this spiraling trade war and listen to both sides, I want to tell the Chinese: You didn\u2019t get here with just hard work; the barriers you put up were not an entitlement that you\u2019re allowed to keep forever, and the global economic system you grew into was not one you built. Your biggest customer and rival did that \u2014 America.And to Trump I want to say: America became great with a formula that every great American president refreshed and reinvested in. And you\u2019re not doing that. You\u2019re actually undermining and neglecting some of its key elements \u2014 immigration, allies, rules and regulations.In sum, I worry that America has become so focused on who the Chinese are and what they\u2019re trying to become that we\u2019ve lost sight of who we are and how we got here. That's the biggest threat to our economy and our future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Last Statesman of the Venezuelan Democracy", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA restless defender of democratic values, Teodoro Petkoff never stopped criticizing Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s autocratic tendencies and never gave up on his country. A Venezuelan journalist wrote that he felt orphaned. Another called Mr. Petkoff, a fierce critic of the country\u2019s autocracy, \u201cone of the last beacons of democratic integrity.\u201d And the secretary general of the Organization of American States lamented that Mr. Petkoff left his country \u201cwithout a mandate on social commitment, political coherence and defense of democratic values.\u201dMr. Petkoff would have disagreed. One of the many lessons of his legacy is that there is never a time to give up on Venezuela.I met Teodoro, as everyone called him, 12 years ago. By that time he had earned his place in Venezuelan history many times over. A vocal member of the Venezuelan Communist Party during the dictatorship of the 1950s, then a Marxist guerrilla fighting against Venezuela\u2019s fledgling democracy in the 1960s, by the age of 40 Teodoro had renounced armed struggle. \u201cOnly fools don\u2019t change their minds\u201d he said of his own about-face. With the zeal of a convert, Teodoro spent the next 45 years fighting for democracy in Venezuela.Teodoro renounced Communism, but he remained the face of Venezuela\u2019s left-wing opposition, committed to a pragmatic socialism that made M.A.S. unique among leftist parties in Latin America. It was Teodoro\u2019s face on bright orange M.A.S. posters in the 1980s, when he twice ran for president. One might have thought that the icon of Venezuela\u2019s left-wing opposition would have rejoiced at the rise of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a leftist opposition candidate who surged in the polls before the 1998 presidential election. One might have thought that Teodoro would have joined some of his former guerrilla comrades in backing Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.Instead, Teodoro pleaded with the M.A.S. not to endorse Mr. Ch\u00e1vez. His pleading flickers on a fading tape in the archive of a television station: Teodoro sweating at the party convention, imploring hundreds of party militants to see that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was a populist autocrat. The crowd booed and heckled, until Teodoro shouted: \u201cHey, chicos! Calm down. Or are you worried that I\u2019ll convince you to change your minds?\u201dHe did not change their minds. The M.A.S endorsed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, and Teodoro quit the party he had founded. After a full four decades as the icon of Venezuela\u2019s left-wing opposition, when a leftist opposition finally seized power, Teodoro found himself fighting the government once again.From his desk, Teodoro could hear the news streaming from a small television in the adjoining office of Azucena Correa, his assistant of three decades, and whatever else he was doing, he digested the headlines at the same time. He would interrupt himself: \u201cOh, my god, the cardinal is denouncing Ch\u00e1vez!\u201d And he jumped up to alert his staff.The rhapsodic obituaries published over the past week belie the fact that Teodoro had few allies in Venezuelan politics. Conservative opponents of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez saw Teodoro as a barely reformed Communist. They liked him most for the moments that he considered mistakes, such as when he momentarily accepted a coup that briefly removed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez from power. Many Chavistas saw him as a sellout, a former comrade who had traded in his leftist bona fides for a taste of power in the 1990s, when he held a post in the cabinet of Rafael Caldera, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s predecessor.For all of these reasons, one would have forgiven Teodoro for turning to pessimism. And when I last saw him, on a rainy afternoon in 2012, I thought for a moment that he had. I asked him who among Venezuela\u2019s young politicians might carry on his work. He looked blank. I mentioned several names, and he shook his head at each one.Teodoro leaned back in his chair and looked away from me, a rare moment of silence in our interviews. I braced myself for a dark prophecy, for the words of a politician who would die with possibly no successors. Instead, he said, \u201cAparecer\u00e1n,\u201d a word that means \u201cThey will appear.\u201d Then he said it again: \u201cThey will appear.\u201dDorothy Kronick is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}

She said that Mr. Chau put these people in grave danger and he should have never visited.\u201cThere is no question that this attempt to make contact was totally wrong and a major violation of their human rights to autonomy,\u201d he said. \u201cOutsiders need to respect their wishes and treat them with dignity as fellow human beings.

How long can the Indians keep people away from the island? Mr. Hill\u2019s solution is to learn what the islanders want so that they can make the decision about their future.\u201cHumans are an extremely social species,\u201d he said. \u201cNo groups want to live isolated forever. They do it out of fear.\u201d \u201cIt takes a certain amount of courage and hard thinking,\u201d Mr. Pandya said about the next step. \u201cIt has to start with gift giving, years of gift giving, then the language has to be learned through this gift giving. You have to make an effort to engage in dialogue. It\u2019s not easy, but everybody is entitled to think about their future, that is the first right, the right to have rights.\u201dWhen I asked Mr. Pandya whether the island was beautiful \u2014 the few photos I\u2019ve seen show tantalizing white beaches and Windex-blue seas \u2014 he snapped back: \u201cNo, it\u2019s filthy.

{"Headline": "When Will We Solve Mental Illness?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 things we\u2019d really like to knowBiology was supposed to cure what ails psychiatry. Decades later, millions of people with mental disorders are still waiting.Nothing humbles history\u2019s great thinkers more quickly than reading their declarations on the causes of madness. Over the centuries, mental illness has been attributed to everything from a \u201cbadness of spirit\u201d (Aristotle) and a \u201chumoral imbalance\u201d (Galen) to autoerotic fixation (Freud) and the weakness of the hierarchical state of the ego (Jung).The arrival of biological psychiatry, in the past few decades, was expected to clarify matters, by detailing how abnormalities in the brain gave rise to all variety of mental distress. But that goal hasn\u2019t been achieved \u2014 nor is it likely to be, in this lifetime.Still, the futility of the effort promises to inspire a change in the culture of behavioral science in the coming decades. The way forward will require a closer collaboration between scientists and the individuals they\u2019re trying to understand, a mutual endeavor based on a shared appreciation of where the science stands, and why it hasn\u2019t progressed further.\u201cThere has to be far more give and take between researchers and the people suffering with these disorders,\u201d said Dr. Steven Hyman, director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard. \u201cThe research cannot happen without them, and they need to be convinced it\u2019s promising.\u201dThe course of Science Times coincides almost exactly with the tear-down and rebuilding of psychiatry. Over the past 40 years, the field remade itself from the inside out, radically altering how researchers and the public talked about the root causes of persistent mental distress.The blueprint for reassembly was the revision in 1980 of psychiatry\u2019s field guide, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which effectively excluded psychological explanations. Gone was the rich Freudian language about hidden conflicts, along with the empty theories about incorrect or insufficient \u201cmothering.\u201d Depression became a cluster of symptoms and behaviors; so did obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism and the rest.This modernized edifice struck many therapists as a behavioral McMansion: an eyesore, crude and grandiose. But there was no denying that the plumbing worked, the lighting was better, and the occupants had a clear, agreed-upon language. Researchers now had tidier labels to work with; more sophisticated tools, including M.R.I.s, animal models, and genetic analysis, to guide their investigations of the brain; and a better understanding of why the available drugs and forms of psychotherapy relieved symptoms for many patients.Science journalists, and their readers, also had an easier time understanding the new vocabulary. In time, mental problems became mental disorders, then brain disorders, perhaps caused by faulty wiring, a \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d or genes. But the actual science didn\u2019t back up those interpretations. Despite billions of dollars in research funding, and thousands of journal articles, biological psychiatry has given doctors and patients little of practical value, never mind a cause or a cure.Nonetheless, that failure offers two valuable guideposts for the next 40 years of research. One is that psychiatry\u2019s now-standard diagnostic system \u2014 the well-lighted structure, with all its labels \u2014 does not map well onto any shared biology. Depression is not one ailment but many, expressing different faces in different people. Likewise for persistent anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and personality issues such as borderline personality disorder.As a result, the best place for biological scientists to find traction is with individuals who have highly heritable, narrowly defined problems. This research area has run into many blind alleys, but there are promising leads. \u201cWe are now following up hard on that finding,\u201d said Dr. Hyman. \u201cWe owe it those who are suffering with this diagnosis.\u201dScientists also foresee a breakthrough in understanding the genetics of autism. Dr. Matthew State, chief of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, said that in a subset of people on the autism spectrum, \u201cthe top 10 associated genes have huge effects, so a clinical trial using gene therapies is in plausible reach.\u201dAnd a few we\u2019d rather not discussThe second guidepost concerns the impact of biology. Although there are several important exceptions, measurable differences in brain biology appear to contribute only a fraction of added risk for developing persistent mental problems. Genetic inheritance surely plays a role, but it falls well short of a stand-alone \u201ccause\u201d in most people who receive a diagnosis.Many participants are veterans of the psychiatric system, people who have received multiple diagnoses and decided to leave medical care behind. The study will analyze their experiences, their personal techniques to manage distress, and the distinctive characteristics of the Hearing Voices groups that account for their effectiveness.\u201cWhen people have an opportunity to engage in ongoing, in-depth conversation with others with similar experiences, their lives are transformed,\u201d said Dr. Hornstein, who has chronicled the network and its growth in the United States. \u201cWe start with a person\u2019s own framework of understanding and move from there.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe have underestimated the power of social interactions. We see people who\u2019ve been in the system for years, on every med there is. How is it possible that such people have recovered, through the process of talking with others? How has that occurred? That is the question we need to answer.\u201dTo push beyond the futility of the last 40 years, scientists will need to work not only from the bottom up, with genetics, but also from the top down, guided by individuals who have struggled with mental illness and come out the other side. Their expertise is fraught with the pain of having been misunderstood and, often, mistreated. But it\u2019s also the kind of expertise that researchers will need if they hope to build a science that even remotely describes, much less predicts, the fullness of human mental suffering.Advertisement"}

Videos that circulated on social media showed several protesters hurling rocks at heavily armed soldiers who then shot fleeing demonstrators in the back.The Nigerian military said three protesters were killed, but the toll appears to have been much higher.Amnesty International and leaders of the protest said more than 40 people were killed at the march and two smaller marches, with more than 100 wounded by bullets. A Reuters reporter counted 20 bodies at the main march.Human rights activists and many Nigerians were outraged at the military\u2019s response, which echoed a similar confrontation in 2015, when soldiers killed nearly 350 protesters from the same group, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, the largest and most recognizable face of Shiite Islam in the country. The group organizes frequent protest marches.Early Friday morning, the military responded to the criticism.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to put up with that,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the clip. \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back.\u201dOn Friday, John Agim, a spokesman for the Nigerian Army, said the initial posting of the video was a response to Amnesty International, which had criticized what it called the military\u2019s use of excessive force.\u201cWe released that video to say if President Trump can say that rocks are as good as a rifle, who is Amnesty International?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are they then saying? What did David use to kill Goliath? So a stone is a weapon.\u201d\u201cOur soldiers sustained injuries,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Shiites even burnt one of our vehicles, so what are Amnesty International saying?\u201dThe army has said as many as six soldiers were wounded during the protest after \u201cthousands\u201d of members of the sect overran a police checkpoint and blocked traffic along a highway.Soldiers had arrived to assist the police, a news release said, and were met with protesters who threw canisters of fuel, \u201clarge stones, catapults with dangerous objects and other dangerous items.\u201dThe military posted photos of six slingshots and one pocketknife on its Facebook page as evidence.\u201cThey wanted to take over the checkpoint with their weapons,\u201d Mr. Agim said. \u201cThey knew it was there. We responded to them.\u201dIbrahim Musa, a spokesman for the Shiite group, said that on Monday security forces refused to let protesters, who numbered about 1,000, pass the checkpoint as they marched toward their destination. He said 13 protesters were killed during two other marches this week, one before and one after Monday\u2019s deadly march.\u201cRocks are not equal to bullets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe use of force is disproportionate. I don\u2019t think President Trump is a good example \u2014 even in America many are critical of him. I am surprised that the army will use Trump as a role model.\u201dThere was no immediate comment from the White House on the Nigerian Army\u2019s posting. But asked on Friday about whether he condoned American soldiers\u2019 firing on migrants in a Mexico caravan if they attempted to cross the United States border, Mr. Trump said: \u201cThey won\u2019t have to fire. What I don\u2019t want is, I don\u2019t want these people throwing rocks.\u201dA State Department official in Washington, responding to the Nigerian shootings, said in a statement that the United States \u201csupports regional efforts to fight terrorism and protect civilians, employing our full tool kit \u2014 including diplomacy, foreign assistance, senior military engagement, and security assistance.\u201dThere was a conspicuous lack of comment on both the killings and the Nigerian Army\u2019s response from President Buhari and Atitku Abubakar, his main challenger in elections scheduled for next February.Their silence may partly reflect the antipathy toward the Islamic Movement of Nigeria in their own bases of support.There were also social-media expressions of support for the military\u2019s response.A recent report mandated by Congress on the American strategy to improve security in Nigeria played down Nigerian military abuses, said Matthew Page, a former State Department expert on the region who is now an associate fellow in the Africa program of Chatham House, a British research group.Mr. Page said that even under the Obama administration, Washington sent mixed signals to Nigeria on human rights, adding that diplomats and policymakers have been \u201chouse-trained by the Nigerian government to avoid public condemnation.\u201d\u201cSuch concerns are now voiced in private, if at all. Detainee deaths and child imprisonment continues, and extrajudicial killings by Nigerian soldiers are not even covered up anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the Trump administration, any senior-level squeamishness about Nigerian military abuses has evaporated.\u201dAlmost 20 years after the end of military rule in Nigeria, protests are still viewed by many as a public disturbance and threat to the authorities.Additionally, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria is seen as a threat by some Nigerians to the Sunni form of Islam that is dominant in Nigeria\u2019s north. The group does not recognize the Nigerian Constitution, claiming it excludes protections for minorities. Many Nigerian authorities say the group has the larger aim of creating an Islamic republic inspired by Iran.In his meeting with President Buhari at the White House this year, Mr. Trump commented on the killings of Christians in Nigeria\u2019s Middle Belt, where clashes over land use have broken out between mostly Christian farmers and mostly Muslim herdsmen.\u201cWe have had very serious problems with Christians who are being murdered in Nigeria,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Nigerian president, who is Muslim.While many farmers have died, the clashes also have killed scores of Muslim herders.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of protesters at the Monday march. It was about 1,000, not 200.Dionne Searcey reported from Dakar, and Emmanuel Akinwotu from Lagos, NigeriaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study of Cellphone Risks Finds \u2018Some Evidence\u2019 of Link to Cancer, at Least in Male Rats", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany caveats apply, and the results involve radio frequencies long out of routine use.The experiment, by the National Toxicology Program, found positive but relatively modest evidence that radio waves from some types of cellphones could raise the risk that male rats develop brain cancer.\u201cWe believe that the link between radio-frequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real,\u201d John Bucher, a senior scientist at the National Toxicology Program, said in a statement.Experts say it is not unusual for cancer patterns to vary between sexes in both people and animals, including the study\u2019s mice and rats.The rodents in the studies were exposed to radiation nine hours a day for two years \u2014 far longer even than heavy users of cellphones. For the rats, the exposures started before birth and continued until they were about 2 years old.Some 2 to 3 percent of the male rats exposed to the radiation developed malignant gliomas, a deadly brain cancer, compared to none in a control group that received no radiation. Many epidemiologists see no overall rise in the incidence of gliomas in the human population.The rats were exposed to radiation at a frequency of 900 megahertz \u2014 typical of the second generation of cellphones that prevailed in the 1990s, when the study was first conceived.The toxicology agency is building smaller exposure chambers that will let it evaluate newer technologies in weeks or months, instead of years. These future studies are to focus on measurable physical signs, or biomarkers, of potential effects from radio-frequency radiation, including DNA damage, which can be detected much sooner than cancer.During a telephone news briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Bucher, the senior scientist at the toxicology agency, said evidence of DNA damage from the current study needed further examination.He said the overall findings of the study \u2014 384 pages devoted to rats, 260 to mice \u2014 had been conveyed to the Federal Communications Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, which regulate cellphones and gauge any risks to human health. Dr. Bucher declined repeatedly to assess the hazard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Male Insect Fertility Plummets After Heat Waves", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers say that temperature\u2019s effects on sperm production could be one factor behind the decline in the world\u2019s insect populations.For years, insect populations have been dropping worldwide without a clear explanation. A new paper suggests male infertility is at least one factor behind that decline, as warmer-than-usual temperatures take a disproportionate toll on males of some insect species.After a lab-simulated heat wave, researchers from England\u2019s University of East Anglia found that male flour beetles produced vastly less sperm. But they also found that the damage wasn\u2019t confined to the males. Sperm inside a female\u2019s reproductive tract became less viable and the sons of the males that endured the hotter temperature became less fertile, too.It\u2019s long been known that heat can affect sperm quality in mammals. \u201cThere\u2019s a good reason the testes are outside the body,\u201d noted Dr. Gage, adding that this keeps the sperm 6 to 10 degrees cooler than body temperature.But no one had previously looked to see whether coldblooded males were also affected, even though most of life on Earth is coldblooded, he said. And the flour beetles that Dr. Gage studied are used to warm environments, living in places that regularly reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit.His team simulated a heat wave in their lab, raising temperatures by about 9 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit for five days \u2014 roughly equivalent to a temperature spike in England last summer, Dr. Gage said.After the heat exposure, sperm production in the flour beetles dropped by half, the study showed. A second heat wave nearly sterilized them.\u201cWe thought they might have hardened to temperature extremes,\u201d Dr. Gage said. \u201cWe found the opposite.\u201dFemales appeared unaffected by the heat themselves. But if they had already been inseminated, their fertility fell by 30 percent after the heat exposure. This suggests that heat affects not just the manufacture of sperm, but also its later viability, Dr. Gage said.The sons of the males who endured the heat wave produced 20 percent fewer offspring than males that hadn\u2019t undergone that stress. Dr. Gage said he\u2019s not sure whether the sperm suffered DNA damage from the heat wave that could not be repaired, or if changes on top of the DNA \u2014 so-called epigenetic changes \u2014 affected their sons\u2019 fertility.\u201cThe transgenerational effects are exciting and scary,\u201d said Scott Pitnick, a professor of biology at Syracuse University in New York, who was not involved in the research. He added that sperm with DNA damage might still be able to fertilize females and yield offspring.Dr. Gage said he thinks that such heat response may account for at least some of the population decline seen in insects.Curt Stager, a professor at Paul Smith\u2019s College in Paul Smiths, New York, said he\u2019s not ready to accept the idea that global climate change is the primary cause of this drop.\u201cGlobal-scale insecticide usage is, to me, a more convincing cause for a widespread, across-the-board insect decline,\u201d Dr. Stager said. Heat waves, he said, have not occurred universally enough to cause widespread decline.Dr. Pitnick said that given how sensitive sperm is to temperature change, and that coldblooded insects are less able to protect their sperm, it was smart to \u201cexplore detrimental effects on sperm as a candidate cause of widespread decline of invertebrate populations in response to climate change.\u201dNext, Dr. Gage said he wants to see if the same trends will apply in a more natural setting than a research lab.\u201cWe think it probably does apply, but we haven\u2019t proven it yet,\u201d he said.He also said he doesn\u2019t know how insects in colder climates will respond to temperature spikes, but he intends to investigate. Additionally, he wants to study how long the effects of heat waves last. Quick reproducing insects may be able to rapidly adapt to such temperature spikes, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brent Taylor, Utah Mayor Killed in Afghanistan, Was on 4th Deployment", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORTH OGDEN, Utah \u2014 The call had come again. Brent Taylor, the mayor of North Ogden and a major in the Utah National Guard, would be going to Afghanistan for his fourth deployment.He told his constituents about it on Facebook in January, leaning into the camera to explain that he had been called to serve his country \u201cwhenever and however I can\u201d and that he would be gone for a year, as part of a team helping to train an Afghan Army commando battalion. \u201cService is really what leadership is all about,\u201d he told them.He said goodbye to his wife, Jennie, and their seven children, and turned over his municipal duties to his friend Brent Chugg. \u201cYou need to keep safe,\u201d Mr. Chugg told him. \u201cI will,\u201d Major Taylor replied.He did not make it home. Major Taylor, 39, was killed on Saturday in an insider attack, apparently by one of the people he was there to help.The Pentagon did not say right away who had been killed. But the news that it was Brent Taylor was soon all over Utah, relayed in expressions of remorse by politicians and civic leaders.In a nation already riven with anxiety over a heated midterm election, a synagogue mass shooting and high-profile bomb scares, Major Taylor\u2019s death and the wounding of another service member in the same attack sent up a fresh wave of grief. It was a brutal reminder of a 17-year-old war that has carved gaping holes in communities across the country, with little end in sight.His death hit particularly hard in Utah, where a widely shared Mormon faith binds many of its three million residents in a way that is rare for the modern era. On Saturday, when Mr. Chugg arrived at the home of Jennie Taylor, they embraced and she began to sob.\u201cWe are overwhelmed with heartache, but not regret,\u201d Ms. Taylor\u2019s sister, Kristy Pack, said on Sunday, standing outside the modest brick house. Even though Major Taylor died in a suspected insider attack, Ms. Pack said, \u201cin our view there is not a whole lot of room for anger.\u201dMs. Taylor now faces the task of raising the couple\u2019s children: Megan, 13; Lincoln, 11; Alex, 9; Jacob 7; Ellie, 5; Jonathan, 2; and Caroline, 11 months.At a news conference at the Utah National Guard headquarters outside Salt Lake City, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said he knew Major Taylor personally, calling him \u201cthe personification of love of God, family and country.\u201dGovernor Herbert said he knew that some friends had tried to persuade Major Taylor not to return to Afghanistan, arguing that he had done enough for his country. But Major Taylor wanted to go, the governor said, and had his wife\u2019s support for the decision, because he loved the people of Afghanistan and thought he could do some good there.A Utah law permits elected officials who belong to the Reserves or the National Guard, like Major Taylor did, to retain their civilian posts while deployed by temporarily ceding authority to a surrogate.North Ogden is a middle-class suburb of about 19,000 people north of Salt Lake City at the foot of the Wasatch Range. On Sunday, residents rose at dawn to carry American flags on towering poles through the foggy streets, driving them into the cold ground along the road to City Hall.Then they dispersed to the many churches in the town, where they bowed their heads as their leaders called on \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d to pray for Brother Taylor and his family. It happened to be a Fast Sunday, when Mormons skip meals and donate food to the hungry. At one service, somber boys in crisp white shirts circled the pews with the sacrament.\u201cI just don\u2019t know of a finer man,\u201d said Clark Skeen, a resident of North Ogden.Major Taylor, who grew up in Arizona, enlisted in the military after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. So did his five brothers. Before his last tour, he had served twice in Iraq and once in Afghanistan.He joined the City Council in 2009, was chosen as mayor in 2013 and was re-elected in 2017, building a reputation as a hands-on leader and careful listener, someone who would be seen in the streets before dawn to direct snow plows on stormy days.Mr. Chugg said that as mayor, Major Taylor was dogged in pursuit of city improvements, building an amphitheater, a public works building and new roads. Other city officials, he said, had been satisfied with the status quo: \u201cNot Mayor Taylor.\u201dA small memorial began to form on Sunday outside City Hall, below a soggy American flag lowered to half-staff. One woman, Deborah Eddy, 63, dropped off a bright yellow lily in a flowerpot. Another, Judy Viskoe, 36, stood by, gripping a black umbrella.\u201cI cried all day yesterday,\u201d Ms. Viskoe said. \u201cI don\u2019t politically align with him. He\u2019s a Republican. But I noticed in his running of this town that he treated everyone with respect, and he listened, and he didn\u2019t bring his politics into the mix. He\u2019s just unlike any other mayor I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201dThe number of American troops in Afghanistan has fallen to fewer than 14,000 in 2018, from about 100,000 in 2011, when American forces were still officially engaged in a combat mission there. All but a few large bases have been shuttered, and the main role of the remaining American troops is to advise and train Afghan forces, not fight the Taliban themselves.The change in mission has also changed the mix of troops who are in harm\u2019s way. The Americans who are training Afghan troops are often older, higher-ranking and more experienced than before.And those are the troops who, being surrounded by armed Afghans, tend to face the biggest risk from insider attacks, a persistent threat in the country. Nearly half of the American combat deaths in Afghanistan this year have come in suspected insider attacks.Together, those trends have led to a steady climb in the average age and rank of American casualties.Major Taylor\u2019s body is scheduled to arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday at 9:45 p.m. Members of his family and representatives of the Utah National Guard are expected to be on hand.\u201cUtah weeps for them today,\u201d Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox wrote on Facebook after receiving word of the major\u2019s death. \u201cThis war has once again cost us the best blood of a generation.\u201dWhen Major Taylor left North Ogden in January, hundreds of residents lined the street to see him off, and the local police gave him an escort.\u201cRight now there is a need for my experience and skills to serve in our nation\u2019s long-lasting war in Afghanistan,\u201d he wrote at the time, adding that his work would fulfill President Trump\u2019s order to expand the capabilities of the Afghan forces.Rather than disappear into a war zone, Major Taylor kept up a steady stream of Facebook posts while he was deployed, connecting his community to a conflict that is off the radar of many Americans.In what turned out to be his final public post, on Oct. 28, he tapped out a message about the recent Afghan election.\u201cIt was beautiful to see over 4 million Afghan men and women brave threats and deadly attacks to vote in Afghanistan\u2019s first parliamentary elections in eight years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany American, NATO allies, and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this possible.\u201dThen he turned to his own country.\u201cAs the USA gets ready to vote in our own election next week, I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.\u201dHe concluded: \u201cGod Bless America. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\u201dFollow Julie Turkewitz on Twitter: @julieturkewitz.Contributing reporting were Fahim Abed and Mujib Mashal from Kabul, Afghanistan; Dave Philipps from Colorado Springs, Colo.; Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Washington; and Jennifer Dobner from Draper, Utah.

Contributing Opinion Writer Fast forward 25 years, and a new supervillain, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, known as El Chapo, sits in a federal court in Brooklyn, accused of trafficking enough heroin, cocaine, marijuana and crystal meth to Americans to have made $14 billion over two and a half decades. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s infamy, including escaping from two maximum-security prisons in Mexico, puts him alongside Mr. Escobar and indeed the bootlegger Al Capone as the most notorious traffickers of modern times.In the years between Mr. Escobar\u2019s death and Mr. Guzm\u00e1n \u2019s trial, which began this week, the war on drugs has stumbled on. In terms of taking down kingpins and burning heaps of their narcotics, it has been a stunning success. It terms of reducing the number of Americans killed from overdoses or Latin Americans murdered over smuggling profits, it has been a resounding failure.Most drug lords who are extradited to the United States cut deals. But Mr. Guzm\u00e1n pleaded not guilty, forcing prosecutors to put together a case scheduled to last months. They say they will call witnesses, including his fellow traffickers, to describe how he smuggled dope in ingenious ways \u2014 such as in cans of jalape\u00f1o chilies \u2014 bribed Mexican officials at every level and masterminded the brutal murder of his enemies.The prosecutors may well prove that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is guilty of heinous crimes. But they\u2019re also likely to inadvertently highlight the decades of failure to stop either the flow of drugs or the bloodshed, as well as particular D.E.A. tactics and the aid to Mexican security forces that suffer from corruption. As the world watches, it will be difficult not to wonder whether Mr. Guzm\u00e1n \u2019s case is actually putting the war on drugs on trial.That is not to say that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n does not deserve to spend his life in prison if the jury finds him guilty. Covering cartel violence in Mexico since 2001, I have stared at hundreds of bloody corpses and heard the anguish of too many of their loved ones, which brings home the immense human cost. And D.E.A. agents risk their lives trying to stop this menace.But even if Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is sentenced to a maximum-security prison, it will not save families on both sides of the border from more drug overdoses and more drug violence. The victims deserve more.Working out a better drug policy is a tough challenge, but we have a historic opportunity. Just a decade ago, many observers said that any drug legalization was a nonstarter. But on Nov. 6, Michigan became the 10th state to legalize recreational marijuana; Canada has legalized it and Mexico is taking steps in that direction.A first step is simply to acknowledge that the current drug policy is failing. If it continues stumbling on, in another 25 years we\u2019ll probably be focused on a new kingpin, along with more tales of drug money, police corruption and mountains of corpses. Advertisement"}

Also the prequel, the reboot, the reunion, the revival, the remake, the spinoff and the stand-alone franchise-adjacent film. Canceled television shows are reinstated. Killed-off characters are resuscitated. Movies do not begin and end so much as they loiter onscreen. And social media is built for infinite scrolling. Nothing ends anymore, and it\u2019s driving me insane.Today the tradition of the novel has been supplanted by that of the comic book: Stories extend indefinitely, their plot holes patched through superpower, magic and dreams. Or maybe every story is a soap opera now: Nobody dead is dead forever, not Dan Conner of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and definitely not all of the superhero genocide victims of \u201cInfinity War.\u201d Of course, to Hollywood\u2019s bean counters, sequels are mere brand extensions of intellectual property. But something bigger is happening, too: The logic of the internet is colonizing everything.At the same time, social media is pushing the limits of limitlessness. What Instagram has branded \u201cStories\u201d is an endless feed of images, one-liners and special effects that carries no pretense of progression. All it does is continue.The novel\u2019s bounded story was a technological innovation as much as a formal one. Benjamin wrote of it skeptically, charting its rise alongside the spread of the printing press. But even in 1936, a new form was on the horizon: what he called \u201cinformation.\u201d A novel must end because the physical object of the book will eventually run out of pages. But news wires and radio reports just keep coming, and, as Benjamin put it, \u201cBy now almost nothing that happens benefits storytelling; almost everything benefits information.\u201dFor Hollywood branders, the appeal of endlessness is obvious. And for creators, it can present a tantalizing opportunity: a do-over. A series that was canceled too soon, without the closure of a real ending, can claim one now: \u201cDeadwood\u201d will soon be extended as a TV movie. One that was pushed too far \u2014 like \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d which aired a disappointing final season without its creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino \u2014 can attempt to overwrite the bad feelings with fresh plots.And what do we get? Something to talk about. A Silicon Valley buzzword \u2014 \u201ccommunity\u201d \u2014 seems to apply increasingly to our cultural properties, too. While Mark Zuckerberg sells us his morally suspect advertising vehicle under the banner of global connectivity, Hollywood launders its tedious installments and revivals through appeals to fan service. Marketers may love franchises for their ability to break through the clutter \u2014 a revival sells itself \u2014 but audiences, too, cling to these comforting cultural billboards. The security of recognizable characters and a built-in community that understands the same reference points can supersede the material itself. Criticism gives way to fan theories, with endless possibilities but little significance.At least this story ends.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Was Trump\u2019s Tax Cut a Fizzle?", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe G.O.P.\u2019s only legislative achievement has been a big disappointment.Opinion ColumnistLast week\u2019s blue wave means that Donald Trump will go into the 2020 election with only one major legislative achievement: a big tax cut for corporations and the wealthy. Still, that tax cut was supposed to accomplish big things. Republicans thought it would give them a big electoral boost, and they predicted dramatic economic gains. What they got instead, however, was a big fizzle.The answer, I\u2019d argue, is that business decisions are a lot less sensitive to financial incentives \u2014 including tax rates \u2014 than conservatives claim. And appreciating that reality doesn\u2019t just undermine the case for the Trump tax cut. It undermines Republican economic doctrine as a whole.About business decisions: It\u2019s a dirty little secret of monetary analysis that changes in interest rates affect the economy mainly through their effect on the housing market and the international value of the dollar (which in turn affects the competitiveness of U.S. goods on world markets). Any direct effect on business investment is so small that it\u2019s hard even to see it in the data. What drives such investment is, instead, perceptions about market demand.Why is this the case? One main reason is that business investments have relatively short working lives. If you\u2019re considering whether to take out a mortgage to buy a house that will stand for many decades, the interest rate matters a lot. But if you\u2019re thinking about taking out a loan to buy, say, a work computer that will either break down or become obsolescent in a few years, the interest rate on the loan will be a minor consideration in deciding whether to make the purchase.And the same logic applies to tax rates: There aren\u2019t many potential business investments that will be worth doing with a 21 percent profits tax, the current rate, but weren\u2019t worth doing at 35 percent, the rate before the Trump tax cut.Also, a substantial fraction of corporate profits really represents rewards to monopoly power, not returns on investment \u2014 and cutting taxes on monopoly profits is a pure giveaway, offering no reason to invest or hire.The key word here is, however, \u201cappear.\u201d Corporations do have a strong incentive to cook their books \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, manage their internal pricing \u2014 in such a way that reported profits pop up in low-tax jurisdictions, and this in turn leads on paper to large overseas investments.So the basic result of lower taxes on corporations is that corporations pay less in taxes \u2014 full stop. Which brings me to the problem with conservative economic doctrine.That doctrine is all about the supposed need to give the already privileged incentives to do nice things for the rest of us. We must, the right says, cut taxes on the wealthy to induce them to work hard, and cut taxes on corporations to induce them to invest in America.But this doctrine keeps failing in practice. President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts didn\u2019t produce a boom; President Barack Obama\u2019s tax hike didn\u2019t cause a depression. Tax cuts in Kansas didn\u2019t jump-start the state\u2019s economy; tax hikes in California didn\u2019t slow growth.And with the Trump tax cut, the doctrine has failed again. Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to get politicians to understand something when their campaign contributions depend on their not understanding it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thai Paradise Gains Reputation as \u2018Death Island\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKOH TAO, Thailand \u2014 Promoters call the Thai island of Koh Tao a paradise. Dive resorts boast of its crystal-clear waters, and Western tourists flock to its lively beach bars.But among some foreigners, Koh Tao has taken on a more sinister reputation. At least nine European tourists have died or disappeared there since 2014. British tabloids began calling it Death Island.Now, the claim of a 19-year-old British tourist that she was raped on Koh Tao in June has again focused attention on the island\u2019s troubled history and called into question police handling of serious crimes against tourists.Initially, the police denied that a rape occurred and arrested a dozen people for posting about it on Facebook. The police also issued arrest warrants for an online newspaper editor in Britain and a Facebook page administrator in California.After opening an investigation and interviewing the young woman in Britain, the police said last month that they had found no evidence to support her claim and closed the case. They said they would reopen the case if new evidence emerged.The decision disappointed and angered the young woman\u2019s mother, who insists that the 19-year-old is telling the truth. She accused the police of mishandling the investigation and covering up crime on the island.\u201cThe whole thing has been a farce from the very beginning,\u201d she said by phone from Britain. \u201cWhy on earth would someone make this up?\u201d(The New York Times does not generally identify victims or possible victims of sexual abuse, and is not identifying the woman\u2019s mother for the same reason. Through her mother, the young woman declined to speak with The Times.)Thailand, with about 35 million visitors last year, is one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations and promotes itself as the \u201cLand of Smiles.\u201d The government, which has been run by a military junta since 2014, is sensitive to criticism that could undermine the country\u2019s reputation.Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, questioned the attire and behavior of foreign female tourists shortly after the killing of two British backpackers, David Miller and Hannah Witheridge, on Koh Tao in 2014. Ms. Witheridge was raped before she was killed.He later apologized, saying that he meant only that foreign visitors should be careful.The eldest to die was a 33-year-old Moldovan man, Alexandr Bucspun, who drowned in October after he went swimming late at night. The police ruled out foul play.In some cases, family members challenged the police findings.Koh Tao, a ferry ride from better-known Koh Samui, has long had a reputation as a home for organized crime, and as a place where the police protected local interests.The police major general who headed the rape investigation, Surachate Hakparn, said in an interview with The Times that the police have cracked down on crime syndicates on Koh Tao since the backpackers\u2019 double killing.\u201cWe admit that in the past, there was a mafia there that took advantage of tourists,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we have gotten rid of them.\u201dThis past summer, the young woman from Britain came to Koh Tao in June with a group of male friends. She and one of the friends, Martin Phu, went to a popular beach bar and ordered drinks after midnight on June 26, according to their accounts. They soon began feeling woozy, left the bar and passed out on the beach.When the young woman woke up some hours later, Mr. Phu was not there. But an unfamiliar man was watching her and quickly left, she said. Her underwear had been removed and she knew immediately that she had been raped, her mother said. Her phone, cash and credit cards were gone.She returned to the hostel where they were staying and Mr. Phu arrived soon after. She was visibly upset and told people there she had been raped. Another friend and Mr. Phu collected her shirt, which was stained and potentially held DNA evidence, they thought.\u201cI think that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Mr. Phu said. \u201cIf you want to cover up a problem, you wouldn\u2019t create a bigger problem.\u201dThe hostel manager, Pattara Jamtrakul, urged her to report the rape to the police. But the young woman wanted to leave Koh Tao on the next ferry, for which the group already had tickets.The next day on neighboring Koh Phangan, she and Mr. Phu went to the police to report the rape and robbery, according to their account. The officer took their robbery report but wouldn\u2019t accept a rape report, or the possible DNA evidence that they had collected, and told them they must report the rape on Koh Tao.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t offered any kind of medical assistance or examination,\u201d her mother said.General Surachate, the police officer who headed the investigation, contested their version of events.\u201cShe did not report about being raped at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI called the officer on duty and questioned him myself.\u201dAbout a week later, the young woman returned to Britain and Mr. Phu returned to Koh Tao, where he tried to report the rape to the police with the help of Ms. Pattara, the hostel manager.The officer refused to take his report or the shirt with the potential DNA evidence because only a victim can file a police report.In Britain, the young woman told her mother that she had been raped. She received a medical exam and sought counseling from a rape center, which led to her telling a British police officer of the rape. Eventually she and her mother gave her account to the British media, which had extensively covered the deaths on Koh Tao.Responding to the news reports, the Thai police said a rape could not have occurred because the tide on the beach was exceptionally high that night and the tourist area was crowded.The police sent an investigator to Britain to interview the woman and retrieve the shirt. General Surachate said analysts recovered male DNA from the shirt but found no semen. The police said they compared the DNA to that of 20 men on Koh Tao who are commonly suspected of crimes but found no match.He said the police interviewed about 200 people and found no evidence to corroborate her account.\u201cThere is no new evidence that clearly shows that a rape really occurred,\u201d said the general, who was recently promoted to immigration commissioner.He defended the arrests of the 12 Facebook users, saying that the post they shared wrongly identified a suspect, causing him to lose work.They face up to five years in prison.One person still sought by the police is Suzanne Buchanan, editor of The Samui Times, an online news outlet that has reported on the deaths and the rape case.She said the warrant would not affect her since she lives in Britain.\u201cThey are accusing me of peddling fake news when it is not fake,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they are accusing me of committing a crime in Thailand when I haven\u2019t been there in two and a half years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Defeat for White Identity", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by What the midterms tell us about racial backlash and economic populism.Opinion ColumnistRunning for president in 2016, Donald Trump sold two kinds of populism. One appealed to white tribalism and xenophobia \u2014 starkly in his early embrace of birtherism, recurrently in his exaggerations about immigrant crime, Muslim terrorism and urban voter fraud.The other was an economic appeal, aimed at working-class voters hit hard by de-industrialization who found the existing Republican agenda too libertarian. Trump promised to protect entitlements and replace Obamacare with something more generous; his anti-immigration arguments were about jobs as well as crime; he promised lavish infrastructure spending and trade deals that would bring back factory jobs; he pledged to make the G.O.P. a \u201cworker\u2019s party.\u201d When this combination of appeals delivered victory, it set off an interminable debate about whether to look at Trumpian populism primarily through the lens of race or economics. Interminable, but crucial, because the answer would say a lot about whether a less tribal political alignment is possible \u2014 with Democrats winning back blue-collar whites or Republicans building a pan-ethnic nationalism \u2014 or whether we\u2019re doomed to a permanent racial polarization of the parties.The strongest argument for privileging economics is a simple one: Trump won millions of working-class white voters in the Midwest, the constituency and the region hit hardest by globalization, who had previously voted for Barack Obama. If you voted twice for the first black president, this argument goes, your main political motivation probably isn\u2019t racism, and the fact that Trump ran as an economic populist seems like a more important explanatory fact.The rebuttal, the case for privileging race, relies on a raft of studies, the most recent one summarized by Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp just weeks before the midterms, which show that those Trump-Obama switchers were more likely to express racially conservative attitudes and hard-line anti-immigration views than they were to have suffered recent economic setbacks.The hypothesis floated by these studies' interpreters is that the combination of Obama's presidency and Trump's deliberate race-baiting had an activating effect on white anxiety. Racial backlash against the first black president was more limited in 2012 because Romney didn't play to racial fears, but the backlash escalated, and flipped more white voters, once the next Republican nominee did. Which brings me to the recent midterms, which offered a natural experiment in the race-versus-economics question \u2014 because, as president, Trump has been more plutocratic than populist on many issues, even as he has kept up the tribalist provocations and, just before the midterms, used the migrant caravan as an excuse for race-baiting.If the Obama-Trump voters were primarily motivated by racial anxiety, you would expect his approach to consolidate them for the G.O.P. \u2014 especially with a strong economy, with the Democrats putting up lots of minority candidates, and so on. But white identity politics failed to hold Trump\u2019s gains. Some of the biggest swings against the G.O.P. were among middle and lower-income Americans, not just among affluent suburbanites. The Upper Midwest swung back toward Democrats. And among whites without college degrees, Democrats improved on Hillary Clinton\u2019s showing by eight percentage points \u2014 identical to their gains among college-educated whites. This doesn\u2019t mean that the racial fears Trump stoked didn't bring some Republican voters to the polls. But it proves that white-identity politics isn\u2019t simply destiny, that Democrats can reach wavering white-working class voters instead of writing them off, and that if Republicans want to hold them, then actual economic populism \u2014 with its potential pan-ethnic rather than racially polarizing appeal \u2014 is a better bet than what we\u2019ve gotten too often from his White House.In what is not the most optimistic time for race relations in America, I call that good news.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Mitt Romney was the Republican nominee for president. It was 2012, not 2016.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do You Have a Moral Duty to Leave Facebook?", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe platform has been used to disrupt elections, disseminate propaganda and promote hate. Regular users should ask if they are implicated in these failings.Dr. Liao is a philosopher.I joined Facebook in 2008, and for the most part, I have benefited from being on it. Lately, however, I have wondered whether I should delete my Facebook account. As a philosopher with a special interest in ethics, I am using \u201cshould\u201d in the moral sense. That is, in light of recent events implicating Facebook in objectionable behavior, is there a duty to leave it?From the perspective of one\u2019s duties to others, the possibility of a duty to leave Facebook arises once one recognizes that Facebook has played a significant role in undermining democratic values around the world. For example, Facebook has been used to spread white supremacist propaganda and anti-Semitic messages in and outside the United States. The United Nations has blamed Facebook for the dissemination of hate speech against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar that resulted in their ethnic cleansing. Facebook also enabled the political data firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal information of millions of voters in the United States so they could be targeted with personalized political advertisements. A significant amount of fake news can be found on Facebook, and for many users, Facebook has become a large echo chamber, where people merely seek out information that reinforces their views.Some people might think that because they mostly share photos of their cats on Facebook, such concerns do not apply to them. But this is not so, for three reasons. First, even if one does not contribute directly to the dissemination of fake news or hang out in echo chambers, simply being on Facebook encourages one\u2019s friends to stay on Facebook, and some of those friends might engage in such activities. This influence on others is known as a (positive) network effect, where increased numbers of people improve the value of a product.Second, by being on Facebook one serves as a data point for Facebook\u2019s social media experiment, even if one encounters none of Facebook\u2019s experimental manipulations. In doing so, one could be helping Facebook to refine its algorithms so that it can better single out specific individuals for certain purposes, some of which could be as nefarious as those of Cambridge Analytica.Consider an analogy. When testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs, subjects are randomly assigned either to an experimental group or a control group, and only subjects in the experimental group receive the new drug. Nevertheless, the subjects in the control group are essential to the experiment.Third, using Facebook is not just an individual action but also a collective one that may be akin to failing to pay taxes. A few people failing to pay taxes might not make much of a difference to a government\u2019s budget, but such an action may nevertheless be wrong because it is a failure to participate in a collective action that achieves a certain good end. In a similar vein, choosing to remain on Facebook might not directly undermine democratic values. But such an action could also be wrong because we might be failing to participate in a collective action (that is, leaving Facebook) that would prevent the deterioration of democracy.So do we have an obligation to leave Facebook for others\u2019 sake? The answer is a resounding yes for those who are intentionally spreading hate speech and fake news on Facebook. For those of us who do not engage in such objectionable behavior, it is helpful to consider whether Facebook has crossed certain moral \u201cred lines,\u201d entering the realm of outright wickedness.For me at least, Facebook would have crossed a moral red line if it had, for example, intentionally sold the data of its users to Cambridge Analytica with the full knowledge that company would use the data subversively to influence a democratic election. Likewise, Facebook would have crossed a red line if it had intentionally assisted in the dissemination of hate speech in Myanmar. But the evidence indicates that Facebook did not intend for those things to occur on its platform.That said, we should not place the responsibility to uphold democratic values entirely on Facebook. As moral agents, we should also hold ourselves responsible for our conduct, and we should be reflective about what we say, react to and share when we are on social media. Among Twitter users, a common refrain is \u201cretweets are not endorsements.\u201d In a similar manner, one might also think that \u201csharing\u201d or \u201creacting to\u201d are not \u201cendorsements.\u201d This is a mistake. By sharing or reacting to a post, even if one explicitly criticizes the post, one is amplifying the message of that post and signaling that the post warrants further attention.For now I\u2019m going to stay on Facebook. But if new information suggests that Facebook has crossed a moral red line, we will all have an obligation to opt out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Resistance Strikes Back", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "OpinionTwo years of progressive organizing built the blue wave.Supported byOpinion ColumnistIn April 2017, progressives across America turned toward Georgia\u2019s Sixth District for the race to fill the House seat vacated by Tom Price, who\u2019d become President Trump\u2019s (short-lived) secretary of health and human services. That affluent, highly educated district in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs had been solidly Republican for decades; Newt Gingrich had held it for 20 years, and Price won his 2016 election by more than 23 percentage points. But Trump had prevailed there only narrowly, and Democrats dreamed of using the special election to rebuke him.He lost. Afterward, people complained \u2014 often on cable TV \u2014 that Democrats had squandered their money. But last week, some of that investment finally paid off.On Thursday we learned that a year and a half after Ossoff\u2019s loss, Lucy McBath, an African-American gun control advocate, had flipped the seat.McBath\u2019s victory was emblematic of the Resistance triumphs in the midterms. There was no immediate catharsis on Tuesday, no definitive national rebuke of a president whose bottomless depravity continues to dumbfound more than half the country. But the steady work of citizens who\u2019ve been trying, over the last two years, to fight the civic nightmare of Trumpism bore fruit. It was a slog, pockmarked with disappointments. At the end, though, there was hope.During the Ossoff campaign, \u201cwe built an army of volunteers,\u201d said Stacy Efrat, a mother of three with a full-time job who\u2019d organized voter registration drives most weekends this year. \u201cWe built the Resistance in the Sixth District, and we already had our infrastructure in place to work on the Lucy election.\u201dIt took a while for the conventional wisdom of the American political class, accustomed to treating Democrats as hapless and disorganized, to catch up to what the Resistance had accomplished all over the country. There was an initial sense on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning that the midterms had been a letdown for Democrats, a blue trickle rather than a wave. Three of the marquee candidates progressives were most excited about \u2014 the gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia, and the Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas \u2014 seemed to fall short. (As of this writing, Gillum\u2019s race appears headed for a recount, and there\u2019s a possibility of a runoff election in Georgia.)Some of the first bellwether races to be called, including Amy McGrath\u2019s challenge to Representative Andy Barr, a Republican, in Kentucky, left progressives dispirited.By the end of the night, it was clear that Democrats won the House, but not by how much.In the following days, however, new races kept being called. McBath\u2019s victory was especially sweet. She\u2019d become an activist after the 2012 murder of her son, Jordan Davis, by a white man who, angry over loud music, shot up a car Davis was riding in. Running in her son\u2019s memory, she beat an incumbent with a top rating from the National Rifle Association in a largely white district.As I write this, Democrats have flipped at least 30 House seats, and their total haul could go as high as 40. Democrats virtually wiped out the Republican Party in the Northeast, but they also won new seats in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and South Carolina. The party is on track to make more gains in the House than it has in any election since Watergate's aftermath. Across the country, Democrats flipped at least 333 statehouse seats, a third of all those lost over the course of Obama\u2019s presidency.The seeds of this success were planted after Trump\u2019s election, when all over America scared, angry people searched for mechanisms that could constrain him. The democratic institutions that should have thwarted an authoritarian demagogue like Trump had failed, said Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, which would quickly become one of the most important Resistance groups. People were \u201clooking around to see who or what was going to come and save them,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd the answer was nothing. The answer was that they had to do it themselves.\u201dIndeed, it\u2019s hard to remember now, but last year, many people thought it highly unlikely that Democrats could win the House, since Republicans had engineered a significant structural advantage. \u201cUltimately, Trump\u2019s approval rating probably needs to be at or below 35 percent for the House to flip,\u201d said The Cook Political Report.Levin recalled a meeting last year with allies and supporters in California. He told them that because grass-roots passions had grown so intense, \u201cI think we can take the House.\u201d But the notion felt so wishful, he recalled, \u201cYou had to say it in hushed tones. You couldn\u2019t say it out loud.\u201dSince then, Resistance energy has kept building on itself. Last year, Erin Zwiener, a children\u2019s book author, three-time \u201cJeopardy\u201d champion, and Indivisible activist in Texas, launched a campaign for state representative in her Republican-controlled district south of Austin. \u201cParticularly at the beginning, it definitely seemed uphill,\u201d she told me this week. But while her district had voted for Trump, the margin had been only about 4.5 percentage points, \u201cand we were seeing folks rise up against the presidency.\u201dO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, like Ossoff\u2019s before it, was not a waste. He became a vessel for masses of people who\u2019d felt alienated from their state\u2019s harsh right-wing politics, who longed for something more inclusive and humane but weren\u2019t sure it was possible. \u201cWhat I think was so important about Beto running is that it gave everybody hope,\u201d said Zwiener. \u201cBeto running made it so much easier to recruit statehouse candidates. Beto running made people feel like it was worth their time to come out and volunteer for candidates.\u201dThe movement he leaves behind is likely to endure. Senator Ted Cruz beat O\u2019Rourke by less than three percentage points, which makes an eventual Democratic majority seem newly imaginable. \u201cWe will definitely win something statewide within the next two cycles,\u201d Zwiener said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to predict which thing. But we will win something.\u201dShortly after the Sixth District was called for McBath, I asked Efrat if she was going to take a break. \u201cNow we\u2019re scrambling trying to get the provisional vote counted for Abrams,\u201d she said, referring to the fight over the tally in the Georgia governor\u2019s race. Consumed with that work, she felt bad about missing the protests on Thursday against the firing of Jeff Sessions that had sprung up all over the country at a moment\u2019s notice. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ecosystem in Immigrants\u2019 Guts Is Shaped by the Place They Call Home", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy studying the relationship among ethnicity, migration history and the digestive system\u2019s microbiome, researchers hope to gain insights on health disparities in diverse communities.Bodies that migrate across borders undergo tremendous change. Immediately, feet alight on alien terrain, ears channel novel sounds and noses breathe in unfamiliar scents. More gradually, daily routines fall into new rhythms, cultural norms hybridize and dreams evolve. While many factors may influence how this change occurs, the studies suggest that scientists should consider individuals\u2019 migration status and ethnic origin as they aim for clinical interventions based on the gut microbiome. Between ethnic groups, the researchers discovered significant differences in overall gut microbe composition. Of the various factors studied, ethnicity was the strongest determinant of gut microbial makeup.One community, the Hmong, began arriving in Minnesota in the 1970s as refugees from the CIA-backed Secret War and Vietnam War, which ravaged their communities in Laos. The second group, the Karen, arrived in Minnesota in larger numbers in the past decade, fleeing human rights abuses in Myanmar.Stool samples and other data from more than 500 women revealed that immigrants from these groups began losing their native microbes almost immediately after resettling. They picked up American microbes, but \u201cnot enough to compensate for the loss of native strains, so they end up losing a substantial amount of diversity overall,\u201d Dr. Knights said. Furthermore, losses were greater in obese individuals and children of immigrants.Separately, advisory boards of Hmong and Karen health professionals and community leaders gave input, resulting in a project conducted largely by and for the communities it studied, said Houa Vue-Her, a Hmong advisory board member.The study would not have worked otherwise, she added. Some Hmong with traditional spiritual beliefs might resist giving samples for laboratory testing, for instance, out of fear that it would interfere with reincarnation. Lingering trauma from the wars and the federal government\u2019s secrecy might prevent many others from trusting outsiders.The most obvious culprit behind the loss of native gut microbes is diet. Along with native gut flora, immigrants lost enzymes linked to digesting tamarind, palm, coconuts and other plants commonly eaten in Southeast Asia, the study found. The longer immigrants lived in Minnesota, the more their gut microbiomes shifted to one reflective of a typical American diet high in sugars, fats and protein.But diet alone could not explain all of the changes, Dr. Knights said. Other factors might include antibiotic medications, different birthing practices and other lifestyle changes.There are many, many microbial species living in or on your body. What secrets can they tell?Dr. Deschasaux noted that her study and Dr. Vangay\u2019s reach somewhat contrasting findings. While she found that immigrants maintained ethnic-specific microbiome profiles, even after decades in Amsterdam, Dr. Vangay found that the gut microbiomes of Hmong and Karen immigrants steadily assimilated to their new locale.The divergence might relate to differences in typical Dutch and American diets \u2014 with perhaps less sugar, fat and meat and more raw vegetables in Dutch diets \u2014 and possibly lower rates of acculturation by the Dutch immigrants compared with Hmong and Karen refugees, Dr. Deschasaux speculated.Yet both studies have implications for health disparities. Obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome all have been linked to the gut microbiome, and the ethnic groups Dr. Deschasaux studied in Amsterdam experience varying degrees of these conditions. Compared to the ethnic Dutch, for instance, Dutch Moroccans in her study had a higher prevalence of obesity, and South-Asian Surinamese had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\u201cIt was actually a challenge finding participants who fell in the normal range of body mass index for the study,\u201d said Mary Xiong, a second-generation Hmong American and a community researcher in the Minnesota project. \u201cThat opened my eyes about how much of a concern this is.\u201dThat urgency in part motivated Dr. Vangay and her collaborators to relay their results back to community members.\u201cMany of these communities are not even aware that the gut microbiome exists,\u201d Dr. Vangay said.In addition to being packed with probiotics, zaub qaub \u201cis one of the most iconic Hmong dishes,\u201d as kimchi is to Koreans, Mr. Vang said. \u201cWhen I eat it, I\u2019m partaking in the history of our people.

Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force.Amazon\u2019s so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington.Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company\u2019s ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city.In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google\u2019s main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57.The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier.St. John\u2019s Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature.As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent.New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment \u2014 with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader.But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)Advertisement"}

They barked, wagged their tails and jumped on their hind legs as a black Toyota 4Runner pulled up to the curb.The dogs made a beeline for Andrea Klein, 33, the founder of My Dog Hikes, and her lead hiker, Mia Godwin, 27, who guided them into the back seat and secured them with tether-like seatbelts clipped to their harnesses. \u201cClosing!\u201d Ms. Klein said in her alpha-dog voice, as her charges tucked their paws under their furry bodies.Some of the dogs have more pampered lives than others. Leo Moon, an Australian labradoodle who hikes weekly, appeared in an anti-fur campaign with Gisele B\u00fcndchen last year.With everyone buckled in, they drove to the Upper West Side to pick up four more dogs. Among those waiting was Elena Atkin, 59, a homemaker who works with various charities. She and her husband, Doug, a venture capitalist, adopted Emy, a Labrador mix, from a rescue organization in Sag Harbor, N.Y., but they didn\u2019t want her sitting around the apartment all day.So eight years ago, they signed Emy up for three hikes a week with My Dog Hikes.

Whether this drama plays out as comedy or tragedy is up to the court.\u201cComedy\u201d may be an odd word in this context, but I have to confess that I\u2019ve been more than a little amused by the administration\u2019s frantic and largely failed effort to enlist the justices in keeping the public from learning how the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census actually came about.Last month, with a trial date approaching for the New York lawsuit, the administration went to the Supreme Court with a request to block the plaintiffs from taking pretrial testimony from Secretary Ross and John Gore, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Federal District Judge Jesse Furman, presiding over the case, had refused to block the depositions on the ground that the plaintiffs had already made a sufficiently \u201cstrong showing of bad faith\u201d on the part of the two officials to justify further investigation of the decision-making process. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Judge Furman\u2019s order.It takes the votes of five justices to grant any kind of stay. Conspicuously missing from the votes on the administration\u2019s side were Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and his newest colleague, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The majority\u2019s silence gives no hint of their reasoning. Maybe the chief justice and Justice Kavanaugh simply found Solicitor General Francisco\u2019s hyperbolic rhetoric unpersuasive. Or maybe it was something deeper, a sense that a 5-to-4 vote to shield the Trump administration from ordinary legal process would have been a needless step on the road to disaster for a court already seen as polarized by political allegiances. By just such incremental developments will the line between comedy and tragedy be etched by the newly constituted Roberts court.But for those of us hanging on the court\u2019s every move, there was hardly time to catch our breath before the Trump administration was back at it again, trying to bend the court to its will. On Monday night, it filed three highly unusual petitions at the court, this time seeking immediate review of decisions by three Federal District Courts that have prevented the administration from shutting down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. All three decisions, from courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, are already in federal appeals courts, with one appeal having been argued and another scheduled to be heard in January. So what\u2019s the rush?Or maybe they make no such assumptions, but simply want to try and see \u2014 to test the line between comedy and tragedy.Advertisement"}

But there are some options in the area for vacationers looking for a winter getaway.\u201cOur windows were all blown up, pieces of sliding doors all blown out, with these gaping holes between. If you\u2019re outside,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see what\u2019s left of the unit looking inside through what had been a wall. All of the furniture had been strewn away. It\u2019s just terrible.\u201dMr. Allen, who lives in Tennessee, rents out his two-bedroom Florida property \u2014 just a flight of stairs above the sand, with a balcony overlooking the ocean \u2014 to snowbirds each winter. His next guests were scheduled to arrive on Dec. 1 for a three-month stay. But after the Category 4 hurricane devastated this part of northwest Florida, destroying swaths of Bay and Gulf counties, Mr. Allen and many others in the storm\u2019s path no longer have anything to lease.The Panhandle, known for its postcard-quality beaches and charming seaside towns, is a year-round destination. And the final stretch of 2018 \u2014 including Thanksgiving weekend and the upcoming holiday break \u2014 would ordinarily be no exception. But following Hurricane Michael, the most severe storm in the history of the Panhandle, some mainstays in and around the \u201cEmerald Coast\u201d will not be able to welcome their usual crowds, a major financial hit for local homeowners and establishments.Despite being evacuated or experiencing outages during the hurricane, the communities along 30A, the scenic highway between the city of Destin in the west and Panama City Beach about 50 miles to its east, were largely unscathed. And Panama City Beach, with the exception of some wind and water damage on its east end, was also spared. But just a couple miles away, Panama City suffered a tremendous blow. The infrastructure there, and in nearby Mexico Beach, will take years to rebuild. Beyond Bay County, recovery efforts are ongoing in Gulf County, which includes Port St. Joe, Cape San Blas and other inlets, with some businesses up and running again and others closed indefinitely.\u201cWe will have no rental business this year,\u201d Mr. Allen, 62, said of Mexico Beach, where he said he and his wife will lose about $10,000 this winter on their now-uninhabitable unit. \u201cThere\u2019s no infrastructure that a tourist would want or need for this winter. There\u2019s no restaurants, the mom-and-pop shops are virtually all gone, so if I\u2019m a tourist, as much as I love Mexico Beach, I wouldn\u2019t go there.\u201d VRBO is advising those who have reserved rentals in the area to contact the homeowners to check the status of not only the property itself, but also the nearby beaches and businesses. \u201cWhether or not a traveler can get a trip refunded or rescheduled depends on the cancellation terms they agreed to with the owner in checkout or in the rental agreement,\u201d said Melanie Fish, a VRBO spokeswoman.Tourism boards are heartily encouraging people to visit and reassuring vacationers of their offerings and resilience.Lynne Andrews, a homeowner in Santa Rosa Beach who rents out her three-bedroom cottage for more than half the year, said she is already booked for Thanksgiving through VRBO. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge more for Mexico Beach and Panama City Beach,\u201d she said. \u201cI do suspect that some of those renters will probably shift out to 30A.\u201dFor Mr. Allen, who had been renting out his Mexico Beach home for eight years, the finish line to recovery is not near, and the future of the community is uncertain.\u201cThe beauty of Mexico Beach is that it was this throwback to the old Florida of the 1960s and 70s \u2014 they didn\u2019t allow chain restaurants or chain stores there; everything in Mexico Beach was mom-and-pop,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cAnd so I think the big question is: Now that it\u2019s almost entirely wiped out, what will it be in the future? Will it somehow try to recapture the quaintness that it was and that appealed to us as a family, or will some big developer come in and make it an extension of Destin and Panama City?\u201dThe answer, he added, is that there isn\u2019t one \u2014 at least not yet.Advertisement"}

They were nurses, social workers, professors and retirees who had spent the last two years learning the science of campaigning from scratch and the last few months doing the grueling work.\u201cNo matter what happens,\u201d said Beth Dabruzzo, who hand-wrote thousands of postcards to voters encouraging them to vote for Democrats, \u201cI literally could not have done anything more than I did.\u201dWhat followed were three-plus hours of whiplash: Cheers at the victory of some House candidate somewhere, even if the crowd in the back couldn\u2019t hear the name of the state. Groans as Republicans kept winning seats in the Senate. Choice words for Texas and Florida.Their state, Pennsylvania, delivered what they wanted, by and large \u2014 but not in a number of the races that Ms. Dabruzzo and other people gathered at the party had spent the last few months of their lives on.The lights were turned on, the balloons popped and the candles blown out and Ms. Dabruzzo looked over the results.\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to think,\u201d she concluded.This was a sentiment shared nationwide, for Republicans as well as Democrats. No one could seem to say whether a decisive message had been sent in the election results, or if so, what that message was. Some developments were surprising, others surprisingly predictable, but none of it seemed to add up to a satisfying verdict.\u201cAll right, guys,\u201d summed up Marie Norman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh whose two-year-old grass-roots group, Order of the Phoenix, was the host of the party. \u201cWe tried. We won some big ones.\u201dLike many of the people around her at the party, Ms. Dabruzzo, 48, had never before experienced an election this way. She had voted before, sent money to candidates a time or two, maybe put up a sign.But this election had consumed her lunch hours, nights, weekends and holidays. On Oct. 1, she counted: 1,347 postcards, most of them written at night while her husband was at work and she sat in front of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d They were sent to voters in a neighboring congressional district. She estimated she wrote and sent another thousand in the weeks after that.Later that month, she took a week\u2019s vacation from her job to go with her husband, Jim, 45, an X-ray technologist, to knock on doors in the district, hundreds of them. They were both brand-new to the game, and they both loved it.But it meant a lot more nerves on a night like Tuesday.\u201cI tend to get overly excited about things, and when they don\u2019t happen, get that much more depressed,\u201d she said beforehand. \u201cSo I\u2019m trying to think not that far ahead.\u201dThe 2016 election had flipped a switch for her. She felt \u201csick, like the country was sick,\u201d like things had gone badly wrong. It was not mere partisanship \u2014 she had voted occasionally for Republicans before; Mr. Dabruzzo had even voted for Rick Santorum, \u201cbefore he went crazy.\u201d But the Trump victory was different.This was the case for nearly all the people at the bar on Tuesday night. Most had done almost no political work before 2016, certainly not knocking on strangers\u2019 doors. Then President Trump came and with it \u201cthis knot in my stomach,\u201d Professor Norman said.The morning after that election, Professor Norman and her husband created the Order of the Phoenix at their kitchen table. It was named after the secret society in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, which was set up to fight the villain, Lord Voldemort. It would go on to have more than 7,000 members on Facebook, including Ms. Dabruzzo, all of whom would write postcards, campaign and canvass in local elections.It was springtime for grass-roots groups in those first months of the Trump presidency. All across the city and suburbs they sprouted: Progress PA, 412 Resistance, Mt. Lebanon Rise Up and many, many more, thousands of mostly middle-aged, mostly college-educated women with little or no prior organizing experience, meeting at marches, huddling on Facebook and setting off on a rapid nuts-and-bolts education in electoral politics that would lead to a massive regional ground game. Some of these new activists would run for office (and indeed some won on Tuesday night).\u201cWe felt like we could really accomplish something,\u201d said Cindy Callahan, a member of the Order of the Phoenix, who was helping put up balloons as the party got underway on Tuesday night. \u201cWe were the biggest percentage of canvassers in Washington County!\u201dWith a margin of 755 votes in Mr. Lamb\u2019s race, everyone involved felt like they could have made the final difference. And in a district as Republican as his, it seemed that the direction of the country was truly in the hands of the highly motivated volunteers. It was this kind of optimism that drew Ms. Dabruzzo to the campaign of Ron DiNicola, the Democrat running in the 16th district, a half-hour from where she lives. It was a district much like Mr. Lamb\u2019s, and so it, too, could possibly be swung with enough effort.\u201cYou have power in numbers,\u201d Ms. Dabruzzo said. \u201cWhen you get together with other people you can actually do something.\u201dAs Tuesday night wore on, that sense of control had faded somewhat.Ms. David was sounding a common note: A single American may not have power over Florida, or Texas, or the presidential election, or the races around Philadelphia, but that does not mean the only option is to sit back and despair. That is why so many joined the movement in Pennsylvania, because \u201cit\u2019s therapy,\u201d as Ms. Dabruzzo said: Because doing something is not only better than sitting at home, but, as Mr. Lamb\u2019s election showed, it can actually pay off.Still, some of the races in which she had put in hours and hours of work were slipping away. The State House campaigns she had adopted, always long shots, were falling short, in some cases badly. And Mr. DiNicola, who had been leading in the returns all night, started to trail as the last votes came in and the bar in Homestead was closing down.\u201cWe didn\u2019t knock on enough doors,\u201d Ms. Dabruzzo said to herself.In their car on the dark street outside, Mr. Dabruzzo looked into the glow of his phone and confirmed: Mr. DiNicola had conceded. it was over.Ms. Dabruzzo sighed. \u201cBack to the drawing board,\u201d she said.Not that she was done with politics. Not at all. On Wednesday morning, she was already conferring with her fellow activists. A special election was coming for the State Senate district just next door.

{"Headline": "What a Kenyan Slum Can Teach America About Politics", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDon\u2019t put your hope in elected officials. Real change has to start locally.Mr. Odede is a co-founder and the chief executive of Shining Hope for Communities.Many Americans who voted in last week\u2019s midterm elections were hungry for change. They pinned their hopes on politicians who they felt embodied the values and diversity of the nation as a whole, and who could lift up their communities. The result will be a Congress significantly more representative of America today. But merely putting people in office will not produce the seismic change needed to sufficiently improve local communities and the lives of the most disenfranchised people. The stunningly diverse 116th Congress, which starts in January, was made possible by grass-roots community organizing around the country. But those same communities can\u2019t stop there. Real change must come from the ground up.We saw this in Flint, Mich., where political leaders failed to maintain safe water infrastructure for poor and black residents. As a result, children and families drank water contaminated with lead, poisoning a generation. Elected officials at the state and federal levels did nothing. I\u2019ve seen this same dynamic in my hometown, Kibera, one of the largest slums in Kenya.As in Flint, clean water is not easily accessible to Kibera residents; without formal piping into the slum much of our water is easily contaminated with disease. To make things worse, enterprising locals tap into the nearest pipes and re-sell contaminated water as \u201csafe,\u201d at exorbitant prices.With each election cycle, my community placed faith in politicians who promised to provide clean water, as well as to tackle systemic poverty, endemic corruption and myriad other problems that plague our society. But time and again they struggled to deliver.Tired of waiting for those solutions, my mother took matters into her own hands. She organized a group of women who gathered each week to pool their money to help start a business, care for a sick child or buy school supplies. They were mostly illiterate; since I could read and write, they asked me, a 9-year-old, to keep the books. One day, many years later, a woman in the community proposed expanding on the group\u2019s model, making it more of an official, organized operation, with an agenda we could present to the public and politicians. I saw an opportunity to combine the efforts of Kibera\u2019s many community groups \u2014 churches and mosques, groups of young people and old, community centers, and assemblies of craftspeople. We created a unified urban movement.Flint and Kibera are reminders that the power of politics is the people. The process of community organizing will bring forth the leaders who can truly represent their communities and advocate change, whether or not those leaders hold political office. Many of the most impactful leaders never wanted to be politicians. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Muhammad Ali and, in Kenya, heroes like the environmental activist Wangari Maathai \u2014 their legacies speak to the truth that political office is not everything.

{"Headline": "Meet the Spiders That Feed Milk to Their Young", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe jumping arachnids\u2019 secretions have four times as much protein as cow milk.The act of breast-feeding is so fundamental to being a mammal that we named ourselves after it. (\u201cMammalis\u201d translates to \u201cof the breasts.\u201d) But over time, scientists have discovered that other animals also produce nutrient-rich elixirs to feed their young, including flamingos, cockroaches and male emperor penguins.The latest addition to the cast of organisms that lactate \u2014 or something like it \u2014 is a species of jumping spider.Though the spiders aren\u2019t using mammary glands to produce the fluid, and hence are \u201clactating\u201d in name only, the findings should prompt scientists to reconsider what they know about nursing and how it evolved, the researchers said.\u201cFinding such mammal-like behavior in a spider, or in any invertebrate for that matter, was a surprise,\u201d said Richard Corlett, a conservation biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an author of the study. Jumping spiders are the single largest group of spiders in the world, with more than 5,000 species and a presence on nearly every continent. The tiny T. magnus, also known as the black ant mimicking jumper, looks like an ant, walks like an ant and even waves its front legs in the air like a pair of antennas (it jumps when threatened or hunting). The species is found mostly in Southeast Asia.The study came about after the lead author, Zhanqi Chen, also of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, noticed that young T. magnus seemed slow to leave the breeding nest, suggesting the mothers were providing some sort of extended child care. That hypothesis received a boost when he and his colleagues observed newborns in the lab and found that neither they, nor their mother, left the nest to find food for the first 20 days.Looking closer, they found that during the first week, the mother was depositing droplets of fluid from her underside onto the nest that the hatchlings would come and drink. After the first week, the offspring would drink the fluid directly from the mother\u2019s body.Adding to their surprise, the researchers found that the mother continued to provide the fluid even after her young began leaving the nest to forage at about 20 days old. The suckling finally ceased at 40 days, though the offspring still used the nest at night for another 20 days.The extended nursing may be an evolutionary response to the creatures\u2019 tiny size and vulnerability.\u201cWe think that it may reflect the high risk of juvenile spiders becoming prey themselves if they have to hunt for their own food,\u201d said Dr. Corlett.It\u2019s also unclear how the T. magnus generates the fluid, which contains 2 milligrams of sugar per milliliter of liquid, 5.2 milligrams of fat and a whopping 124 milligrams of protein. The researchers suspect it may have evolved from trophic eggs \u2014 unviable eggs that some insects produce to feed their young \u2014 because the fluid emerges from the same opening that produces eggs.Though further study is needed to understand how and why the T. magnus generates the fluid, the study should further challenge the assumption that lactation is a uniquely mammalian trait, said Dr. Corlett. \u201cOur findings suggest that \u2018lactation\u2019 may arise in non-mammals when it provides a significant advantage in offspring survival.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Top Facebook executives including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg were not aware of the specific work being done by Definers, the person said.In a statement, Facebook said it had not hidden its ties to Definers and disputed that it had asked the firm to spread false information.\u201cIt is wrong to suggest that we have ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf, or communicate anything untrue,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in the statement.\u201cThe relationship with Facebook was well known by the media \u2014 not least because they have on several occasions sent out invitations to hundreds of journalists about important press calls on our behalf,\u201d the spokeswoman added.Facebook initially hired Definers to monitor news about the social network. It expanded its relationship with the firm in October 2017 when scrutiny of Facebook was increasing over how Russian agents had used the social media site to sow discord before the 2016 United States presidential election.The Times reported on Wednesday that earlier this year, a conservative website called NTK Network began publishing stories defending Facebook and criticizing Facebook rivals like Google. NTK is an affiliate of Definers.In addition, Definers circulated a research document this summer casting Mr. Soros, the billionaire liberal donor, as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement. Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros and groups that had criticized Facebook, including a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son and Color of Change, an online racial justice organization.An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but that no grants had been made to support campaigns against Facebook.\u201cWe are proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services. All of our work is based on publicly available documents and information,\u201d a Definers spokesman said in a statement.He added, \u201cThe document referenced in the Times story regarding the anti-Facebook organization\u2019s potential funding sources was entirely factual and based on public records.\u201dAfter the Times article, other organizations also began re-evaluating their relationship with Definers. One of those was Crooked Media, which runs the popular political podcast Pod Save America. Mr. Miller is a frequent contributor to the podcast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Need a Suburban Agenda", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese voters are leaving the Republican Party and we need to win them back. Mr. Cantor is a former Republican House majority leader.An election provides a certain definitiveness for political candidates, win or lose. I know from experience, having lived through both the ups and the downs. For political parties, elections also provide a chance to reflect, learn and move forward with the business of attracting more voters next time. Or at least they should. For Republicans, losing the House majority in last week\u2019s midterm elections is a clear demonstration that the party must do more to appeal to suburban voters, especially college-educated women. Once a Republican mainstay, this group has been slowly moving away from us for the past few cycles.The data is indisputable, and Republicans must address it. We need a Republican suburban agenda.There is no doubt that some of the loss in support this year from college-educated women, for example, is a result of the negative opinion these voters have of President Trump. But it is also true that Republicans have not had much to offer suburban voters on what they consistently say are their top issues, including health care, child care, education, the environment and transportation.A suburban agenda would not just address pre-existing conditions in insurance coverage but also commit to medical research that offers treatments for a child with a chronic disease or a cure for a parent\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s. Republicans also need to unify around a plan to ensure that every woman who needs it has access to paid maternity leave from her job and addresses the cost of child care for working families. You wouldn\u2019t know it from most 2018 campaigns, but Republicans actually doubled the child tax credit in last year\u2019s tax bill. No one likes spending time in traffic, but that is exactly where suburban voters are stuck a lot of the time. Republicans need to think about investments in infrastructure not just as an economic issue but also to improve the quality of life of their voters \u2014 and the people we need to bring back to our party. Finally, we should continue our commitment to reducing energy costs using an all-of-the-above approach, but emphasize energy efficiency and sustainable, renewable power.Republicans, however, are not alone in not being able to reach people for whom their message used to resonate. The Senate results demonstrated that the Democratic Party continues to suffer from its loss of non-college-educated white men. Exit polls showed these men favored Republicans by a whopping 34 points. A decade ago, these voters split pretty much evenly between the parties. Not surprisingly, of the Senate seats that flipped to Republican, the share of non-college-educated white men in each state exceeds the national average by 2 points.What does the Democratic Party have to say to non-college-educated white men who so often see the party as hostile to them on social and cultural issues and out of touch on issues like securing the border and law and order?Unfortunately, in the past week, both parties have so far sought to explain where they fell short in the midterms by placing the blame on factors outside of their direct control. House Republicans have linked the loss to a record number of retirements and open seats. Senate Democrats have attributed their poor night on the \u201cmap\u201d and having to defend so many seats in states President Trump carried in 2016.There are some truths in both excuses, but those small truths mask the bigger picture: Both parties have given up on competing for large portions of the electorate. Instead, it\u2019s all about maximizing turnout for each side\u2019s most partisan supporters.There is a better way. Two of the most popular Republican governors, each re-elected in a landslide on Tuesday, happen to be from two of the bluest states in the country \u2014 Massachusetts and Maryland. They have figured out how to maintain support among base Republicans while still appealing to independents and even Democrats. In my home state of Virginia, the suburbs throughout the state have been trending blue for some time. Last year in the race for governor, Democrats faced a choice: Double down on the gains they had made in the suburbs of Washington, Richmond and Norfolk or try to hold those voters while simultaneously appealing to rural areas.On election night, our Republican nominee got more votes than any candidate for governor in the history of the commonwealth except one, our current Democratic governor. Both sides turned out their core voters, but the Democrats won in part by reducing the Republican margin of victory in some of the reddest areas of the state. Put another way, they broadened their appeal.The 2020 election season has now begun. After last week\u2019s niceties of calls and congratulations, what comes next will foreshadow whether these lessons were internalized or ignored. Will Republicans have something to offer suburban, college-educated women? Will Democrats have anything to say to white, non-college-educated men in the rural areas? There is an added bonus for all the beleaguered voters who aren\u2019t quite ready to dive back into a divisive political process: A campaign where you\u2019re trying to bring more people into your party tends to be more civil and less toxic than what we just experienced.Eric Cantor represented Virginia in the House from 2001 until 2014.

{"Headline": "How to Turbocharge Flu Protection (Llamas Required)", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by matterA giant antibody created in the laboratory shielded mice against dozens of flu strains, offering new hope against a winter misery. This year\u2019s vaccine significantly reduces the odds of getting sick \u2014 and you should get one now if you haven\u2019t already \u2014 but it\u2019s far from perfect. And if a new strain of the flu were to strike, it might take months to develop an effective vaccine \u2014 plenty of time for the virus to sweep the globe, claiming hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives.It\u2019s an important step toward a type of flu shot that scientists have long sought: a shield against whatever flu strain people happen to pick up.\u201cThere\u2019s no one study that\u2019s going to be the Holy Grail,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBut there are going to be key studies upon which others can build. And this is one of them.\u201dBirds host a vast variety of flu strains, which are constantly mutating and mixing genes into new combinations. Sometimes these viruses manage to infect people; on occasion, they go on to evolve the molecular equipment necessary to travel from person to person.Vaccines significantly reduce the death toll by coaxing the immune system to make protective antibodies. These antibodies seek out a target on the virus: a knob on its shell (scientists often call it a spike) called hemagglutinin. The antibodies attach to the tip of the knobs, making it difficult for flu viruses to enter cells. Unfortunately, each strain has a different sort of knob tip, and so an antibody effective against one flu strain often will not work against others. Making matters worse, mutations can alter a strain\u2019s hemagglutinin knob from one year to the next. As a result, vaccine makers must guess which strain will dominate the coming flu season and plan accordingly.The authors of the new study wondered if they could string together these broadly neutralizing antibodies into a sort of mega-antibody. They isolated four of them, and then they created a gene that manufactured all four as a single mega-antibody.The scientists then tested the creation against 60 flu strains spanning the genetic diversity of influenza. The mega-antibody grabbed tightly onto 59 strains, preventing them from multiplying in cells. (The only strain the mega-antibody didn\u2019t work on is a type of bird flu that has never been known to infect people.)\u201cThat\u2019s something that made this quite a unique antibody,\u201d said Joost A. Kolkman, an antibody engineer at Janssen, the pharmaceutical company, and a co-author of the new study, published in the journal Science. \u201cWe saw a coverage that has never been seen before.\u201dThe investigators loaded the gene into a harmless virus and sprayed it into the noses of mice. The viruses slipped into cells lining the nasal cavity, and they began producing mega-antibodies.Then the real test: The scientists sprayed flu viruses into the nostrils of the mice. The team used some of the deadliest strains and delivered what should have been a lethal dose of each.But the new antibodies grabbed hold of the viruses and prevented them from multiplying. The treated mice were entirely protected from lethal doses of the flu.Kevin Hollevoet, a bioengineer at Leuven University in Belgium who was not involved in the new study, noted that this strategy has been used to produce antibodies against other infections, such as H.I.V.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that it also works for flu,\u201d said Dr. Hollevoet. But earlier studies relied on antibodies naturally made by the immune system, he added. Coaxing mice to make a complicated, engineered antibody \u201cis certainly an upgrade.\u201dBut success in mice is no guarantee of success in people.For one thing, the antibodies that the researchers used to create their mega-antibody come from llamas, rather than people. The researchers gave the llamas flu vaccines and then gathered antibodies from their blood, including some that were effective against more than one strain.Their choice of llamas was very practical. Llamas and related mammals have evolved to make small antibodies, making it easier to snap them together into a mega-antibody. But it\u2019s possible that the human immune system will look at antibodies from llamas as foreign. If so, they might attack, causing a potentially dangerous reaction.Human trials will be needed to determine how safe the new antibodies are. Even if it pans out, scientists would have to figure out what dose is effective in people, as opposed to mice.Still, given the toll of seasonal flu and the potential devastation of a new pandemic, Dr. Hollevoet hoped that the new experiment would spur more research.\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t take them ten years to push it forward,\u201d he said.Advancing flu vaccine research further will require a bigger commitment, Dr. Osterholm said. He noted that last year the United States government only spent $100 million on the field as a whole. \u201cI would argue that\u2019s not nearly enough,\u201d he said.Not only does war on flu need more funds, Dr. Osterholm added, but it needs more coordination between researchers, pharmaceutical companies and philanthropists.\u201cWho\u2019s going to provide the air-traffic control leadership?\u201d he asked.Advertisement"}

Much depends on how quickly and how well they are carried out, and what happens to the economy.Dennis Culhane, an expert on homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania, says there is also a much more unappreciated factor: demographics.A previous bout of severe homelessness came in the 1980s, when the second half of the baby boomers were in their 20s.These large groups of young people can push up rents as they search for apartments, aggravating the housing shortage.\u201cWe certainly see that homelessness in this population is bigger relative to the generation before them,\u201d Dr. Culhane said.And by dint of their numbers, millennials may be also straining the mental health system.\u201cThere is anecdotal evidence from cities I\u2019ve been to where people are saying that this young adult population with severe mental illness is overwhelming the health system,\u201d Dr. Culhane said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take many people to have a big impact.\u201dWhat does demography say about the future of homelessness in California?Nationally, births declined for seven years from the millennial generation peak of 4.2 million. There may be some hope in that. Yet the millennial cohort will be with us for decades longer \u2014 and Dr. Culhane believes it will take a \u201cmassive infusion of resources\u201d to assist the neediest among them.\u201cAt the scale of homelessness we are witnessing on the West Coast, little pilot efforts here and there are not going to make a dent,\u201d he said.This is the 10th and final puzzle in our series of California-themed crosswords, written by the veteran Times crossword constructor and San Diego resident Bruce Haight.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If you happened to be wandering around downtown San Francisco on Halloween night, you might have noticed an unusual sight at the top of Salesforce Tower: flames with an ominous flickering eye in the middle.\u201cIt has been said that bonds are formed through shared experiences, the strongest of which are forged in fire,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cWe ask of you to help us unite the city, and raise the torch on Halloween night as one community, together.\u201dPerhaps it was the petition\u2019s begrudgingly inclusive ending that persuaded the Salesforce gods: \u201cOakland can come, too.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "What America Owes Frederick Douglass", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "OpinionSupported byMr. Blight is a professor of history at Yale and the author, most recently, of \u201cFrederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom.\u201dAt the end of the memoir, Douglass admitted that he had, until recently, fought only with \u201cpen and tongue.\u201d But now, in the roiling crises over slavery in the 1850s \u2014 fugitive slave rescues, violent clashes in Kansas over slavery\u2019s expansion and a nation enthralled by the antislavery novel \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d \u2014 the author announced his new \u201cdisposition.\u201d He had discovered the force of politics in a republic dominated by slavery. He wished to add his own story to the nation\u2019s \u201cblood-written history\u201d as clouds of \u201cwrathful thunder and lightning\u201d hovered over the land. Then he gave voice to his life\u2019s work. He would, as long as \u201cheaven\u201d gave him the ability to speak and to write, fight for abolition and the beginning of black equality with \u201cmy voice, my pen, or my vote.\u201d So much of Douglass\u2019s life echoes down through American history, but especially this week, perhaps nothing more so than those words. All those Americans voting across our country right now, and especially those whose votes are thwarted by people who still refuse to accept historical verdicts a century and a half old, owe Douglass a nod of recognition. In 1866-67, the United States had no obvious path ahead in the wake of the Civil War. A people \u2014 North and South, black and white, still mourning 700,000 dead \u2014 faced elections without clearly defined rules about who could vote. Nearly four million former slaves, many living in physical hardship and under the threat of terror and violence in the South, did not yet know what \u201cfreedom\u201d would mean, nor what kind of civil and political rights they might exercise.Americans ached to be put back together in some new, reimagined way. Hundreds of thousands had fled their homes during the war. The nation\u2019s politics was shredded into blood-born hatreds and seemingly hopeless polarization. Its national and state governments had to be remade. Racism, fear and hope all marched together as traumatized soldiers from both sides made their way home to farms in a thriving Northern economy but an utterly devastated South. The party in power in Washington was led by a group of visionaries, the \u201cradical\u201d Republicans who had championed the cause of emancipation during the war and believed in an interventionist federal government as a means of fashioning a second American republic out of the destruction of the first. They imagined at least the beginning of a revolution in racial equality. The war was over, but everything still seemed at stake in the struggle over Reconstruction. Whether free exercise of voice, pen and vote would really be protected for all remained to be seen.The president was Andrew Johnson, a Tennessean who had been invited onto Abraham Lincoln\u2019s ticket in 1864 because he had been the sole senator from a Confederate state who did not secede with it. Johnson\u2019s support of the Union notwithstanding, he was a staunch proponent of states\u2019 rights, a virulent white supremacist and a believer in limited federal government. Johnson grudgingly accepted the end of slavery but denounced the extension of civil and political liberty to black Americans. His spirit lives on today, in more subtle ways, in the voter suppression practices of the Republican Party and in the desire to revoke birthright citizenship.As Johnson and the radical Republicans locked horns over fundamentally different visions of Reconstruction in the winter of 1866, Douglass led a delegation of 12 black leaders to the White House. Hoping for an honest hearing of their hopes and grievances, they received a barrage of vitriol from an angry racist who hoped to thwart any revision of the Constitution that would guarantee rights for blacks. Johnson and his anxious conservative followers desired an America that was largely pre-1861, a society many Northerners believed had been buried by the sacrifices at Antietam, Fort Wagner and Gettysburg. Douglass led off the encounter by respectfully informing the president that they had come to ask for \u201cequality before the law,\u201d and to be \u201cfully enfranchised throughout the land.\u201d \u201cExtend us the ballot,\u201d Douglass pleaded, \u201cwith which to save ourselves.\u201d Johnson interrupted and for the next 40 minutes harangued and insulted his guests. He was willing to be their \u201cMoses,\u201d he declared. His \u201cfeelings\u201d had always been with blacks. \u201cI have owned slaves, and bought slaves, but I never sold one,\u201d he assured the delegation. He did not like being \u201carraigned\u201d by one \u2014 Douglass \u2014 \u201cwho could get up handsomely rounded periods and deal in rhetoric.\u201d If his guests pursued their goals of equality it would cause \u201crace war,\u201d and he insisted that the only good solution was for blacks to leave the country. As Douglass looked at him in disgust, Johnson asserted that in his relationship with blacks, \u201cI have been their slave instead of their being mine.\u201dJohnson then made a fierce defense of states\u2019 rights. The federal government could not force a state to follow its dictates, the president claimed. The \u201claw\u201d and majorities must be obeyed. As if he had not offended Douglass and his colleagues enough, Johnson then maintained that the truest victim of slavery and the war was the poor, non-slaveholding Southern white: \u201cThe colored man and his master combined to keep him in slavery.\u201d As this disastrous meeting came to an end, Douglass did manage one direct claim to Johnson\u2019s face. \u201cThe very thing Your Excellency would avoid\u201d \u2014 a race war \u2014 \u201cin the Southern states can only be avoided by the very measure that we propose,\u201d i.e., black suffrage, Douglass said. As the delegation walked out, the president was overheard saying: \u201cThose damned sons of bitches thought they had me in a trap. I know that damned Douglass; he\u2019s just like any nigger, and would sooner cut a white man\u2019s throat than not.\u201dIn the wake of this worst-ever meeting between black leaders and an American president, Douglass did what he so frequently did in the middle of crises \u2014 he went to his desk, wrote a remarkable speech and took it out on the road. From Brooklyn to St. Louis, Douglass, who called his speech \u201cSources of Danger to the Republic,\u201d skewered Johnson as an \u201cunmitigated calamity\u201d of a president under whom, for now, the nation \u201cmust stagger.\u201d A constant refrain in this and other postwar speeches was his claim that \u201cslavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot.\u201dDouglass\u2019s words echo on today. Are our institutions adequate to the challenges presented by a president animated by a combination of authoritarianism and ignorance? Is the right to vote really safe and free? Are our political parties disintegrating? Is our free press robust enough to withstand the attacks upon it and the technology revolutionizing the dissemination of information? David W.

Our picture of Sheryl Sandberg has just gotten a bit more complicated, has it not?She was a feminist leader, corporate path-breaker and spiritual superempath all rolled into one. A Gloria Steinem-Amelia Earhart-Oprah Winfrey Thanksgiving turducken.This was not the intrepid Wonder Woman we\u2019d been reading about. This was a person who was easily rattled and consumed with both her reputation and her company\u2019s. When Facebook\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, told the board that the company had yet to contain Russia\u2019s meddling, the board lit into Sandberg, who in turn screamed at Stamos the following day for humiliating her. (\u201cYou threw us under the bus!\u201d she reportedly said.)Then Sandberg spun into P.R. fifth gear, outsourcing the nasty business of protecting her company\u2019s image to a Republican-run opposition research goon squad that felt no compunction about trafficking in anti-Semitic memes (George Soros is behind anti-Facebook activism!) while simultaneously charging Facebook\u2019s critics with anti-Semitism.But here\u2019s a question: Was it ever realistic to expect Sandberg to behave differently?Why do we assume female leaders are inherently gentler and less egomaniacal? With so few examples to draw from, how on earth would we even know?Sandberg\u2019s reputation as a formidable chief operating officer burnished her reputation as a towering feminist; her reputation as a towering feminist burnished her reputation as a formidable chief operating officer. But there was always going to be a gulf between celebrity Sandberg and businesswoman Sandberg. The two, arguably, even lived in tension with each other, with conflicting prerogatives.Much of the advice Sandberg gives in \u201cLean In\u201d is, frankly, unapologetically strategic. And why ever not, when the obstacles to female advancement can seem as high as the moon? But controversially, much of it was also retrograde, a nod to realpolitik: Ask for a raise because women as a group tend to be underpaid, not because you personally deserve it. Note that someone more senior to you suggested that you ask for this salary negotiation in the first place. Be \u201crelentlessly pleasant,\u201d to borrow a phrase from Mary Sue Coleman, president of the Association of American Universities. Only when women are represented at the top in greater numbers, she argued, will they be allowed to lobby for themselves without self-consciousness.\u201cRelentlessly pleasant\u201d is exactly how Sandberg has been in her dealings with Congress. The Times investigation notes that she sends personalized thank you notes to lawmakers she meets.What makes Sandberg\u2019s current behavior so unsavory is that she put corporate interests \u2014 and her own image \u2014 ahead of the needs of democracy. She would sooner downplay Facebook\u2019s involvement in a national security crisis than compromise the integrity of her reputation. And in so doing, Sandberg, one of the country\u2019s most influential and renowned feminists, may have contributed to the historic loss of the first viable female candidate for president of the United States.Among them: The book was geared mainly to white-collar women with means. The book also assumed that women could navigate corporations if only they had the gumption. In the age of #metoo, that idea didn\u2019t age very well. Some impediments to female advancement aren\u2019t simply female inhibition.And yet Sandberg has also been protected \u2014 by her grief, by her special status as a female leader in a seascape of men. Perhaps that\u2019s the most poignant paradox of all. The same feminism that has subjected her to so much scrutiny over the years may also have insulated her from it \u2014 and at just the moment when it was most urgent.Advertisement"}

The company will also require verification that they are citizens, legal residents or groups lawfully allowed to participate in the election.The European Parliament elections, in May, will be for 705 seats across 27 countries. The vote doesn\u2019t often draw widespread attention, but the coming campaign is being closely watched as a wider referendum on the role of the European Union in the region. On one side is an emerging populist wing, represented by anti-immigration groups in Italy and Germany, that\u2019s wary of the influence Brussels carries in the region. On the other side are supporters of a more united Europe, such as President Emmanuel Macron of France.Google said that the transparency rules will take effect in January, but that users might not see any spending disclosures until February or March, depending on when campaign advertising ramps up.\u201cWe\u2019re thinking hard about elections and how we continue to support democratic processes around the world, including by bringing more transparency to political advertising online, by helping connect people to useful and relevant election-related information, and by working to protect election information online,\u201d Lie Junius, director of public policy for Google in Europe, said in the blog post on Wednesday.Facebook is also expanding many of its election protection efforts for the European Parliamentary campaign, including removing fake accounts and working with fact-checking organizations to flag misinformation.

{"Headline": "With Sessions Out, What Happens to Mueller?", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress and the public must now push for protections for the special counsel.Mr. Wertheimer is the president of Democracy21. Norman Eisen is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.Despite the extraordinary success of the special counsel, Robert Mueller \u2014 or more likely because of it \u2014 faces his most serious threat yet: the forced resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Early last year, Mr. Sessions, as a former Trump campaign official, recused himself from the Russia investigation, handing over its oversight to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. As acting attorney general in that capacity, Mr. Rosenstein has overseen and vigorously defended the investigation, led by Mr. Mueller. After requesting and receiving Mr. Sessions\u2019s resignation on Wednesday, President Trump wasted no time in naming Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, as acting attorney general, and shifted the oversight role from Mr. Rosenstein back to the attorney general\u2019s office and its new acting head.No prosecutor \u2014 or indeed governmental official of any kind \u2014 should work on a matter under these circumstances. Mr. Whitaker must step aside. His conflicts are just as worrisome in their own way as Mr. Sessions\u2019s conflict was, maybe more so. Whether or not Mr. Whitaker steps aside, Mr. Trump\u2019s audacity now demands additional safeguards. Congress must quickly put in place a plan to protect the Russia investigation before President Trump makes any further efforts to control the special counsel\u2019s office. The Bork order contained much stronger provisions to protect the independence of the special prosecutor investigation than is now found in the Department of Justice guidelines that govern the Mueller inquiry. These enhanced protections should be demanded from any new person given responsibility to oversee the Mueller investigation:\u25cf The attorney general, acting or permanent, will not remove the special counsel except for extraordinary improprieties.\u25cf The investigation by the special counsel shall continue until he determines that it and all prosecutions and other proceedings within his jurisdiction have been completed or, in his discretion, have been reassigned in the Justice Department.\u25cf The special counsel may from time to time make public such statements or reports as he deems appropriate and shall upon completion of his assignment submit a final report to the appropriate people or entities of Congress and may make such a report public.This is all common sense, but the problem is that it also runs counter to the president\u2019s stated reasons for getting rid of Mr. Sessions \u2014 namely, that Mr. Sessions wouldn\u2019t intervene in Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry. So why would anyone designated as acting attorney general by Mr. Trump, let alone the president himself, go along with such an order?Congress has an important role to play in answering that question. Members of both chambers should demand, including in oversight or other hearings, a commitment, given under oath, from any new person overseeing the Mueller investigation to protect the investigation along the lines of the Bork protections.Legislation also should be pursued to impose the Bork protections on the Mueller investigation. (Alternatively, existing bipartisan legislation to protect the investigation should be renewed.)And the public has a role to play as well. Americans must make it clear that any attack on the special counsel\u2019s office is an attack on the fundamental principles of the rule of law. A number of Democratic and Republican members of Congress have spoken out about the importance of allowing Mr. Mueller to complete his work without interference, and the Bork solution is the logical means to that end. These members need to move into immediate action. This is not about partisanship. The strong protections against interference in the Watergate investigation were given by an acting attorney general, a Republican, to protect the independence of a special prosecutor investigating a Republican president. Nearly 50 years later, the American people should ask no less.Fred Wertheimer is the president of Democracy21, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that promotes government integrity, accountability and transparency.

Other concerns involve contaminated water, stress, trauma and depression.As smoke contaminated the air, mothers feared for their babies\u2019 health.\u201cI was afraid that the smoke would cause her asthma,\u201d Ms. Tellez Flores, 24, said.Like Ms. Tellez Flores, Kamber Wright, 31, was supposed to deliver in Paradise.

It took her more than four hours to drive from Paradise to Chico \u2014 time spent worrying that she\u2019d go into labor as her house (and the baby\u2019s jungle-themed nursery) turned to ash in the rearview mirror.Her son, Grayson James, was born on Nov. 13.\u201cHe\u2019s too small to wear a mask,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cWe wrapped three blankets over the top of his car seat to really make sure no smoke would get to him.\u201dDr. Leslie Moroz, director of the Mothers Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said whether a disaster environment could have a long-term effect on a newborn depends on the length and severity of exposure.

{"Headline": "James H. Billington, 89, Dies; Led Library of Congress Into Digital Age", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames H. Billington, the librarian of Congress for nearly three decades, who led the nation\u2019s treasure house of knowledge into the digital age and added millions of books, films and cultural artifacts to its historic collections, including a trove of tweets, died on Tuesday in Washington. He was 89.His daughter Susan Harper Billington said the cause was complications of pneumonia.Mr. Billington, a distinguished authority on Russian and Soviet history, was named by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 as the 13th director of the library, the repository of the American experience founded in 1800 under legislation that shifted the capital from Philadelphia to Washington.He arrived at the dawn of a new era. The internet was in its infancy, newspapers and printed books were thriving, computers were relatively unsophisticated, and Google, Facebook and Twitter were still over the horizon. For all its millions of books and manuscripts in 450 languages, its 550 miles of shelves and 19 reading rooms, the Library of Congress was terra incognita to most Americans, even to many scholars.Unlike thousands of public libraries in America \u2014 descendants of the one founded by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia in 1731 \u2014 it was never a lending library. Begun as a research arm of Congress, the Library of Congress evolved into a resource for the government and scholars, a custodian of the nation\u2019s written, artistic and cultural heritage, with the added duty of overseeing the United States Copyright Office.\u201cFifty or 100 years from now,\u201d Mr. Billington told a Senate panel in his appropriations request in March 2015, \u201cmembers and constituents will turn to the national collection to read, learn from and build upon the creative output of American authors, composers, filmmakers, artists and others \u2014 just as citizens today are reaping the value of creative works that were added to the collections in 1965 and in 1915.\u201dMr. Billington, who succeeded the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, was not a librarian. He was 58 at the time and had studied, written and taught Russian history for most of his life, notably at Harvard and Princeton. He was fluent in Russian and skilled in Polish, German, Italian, French, Yiddish and Dutch. He had also led the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution for 14 years and advised President Reagan on Soviet Russia.Supervising 3,100 employees and a $600 million budget as the librarian of Congress, Mr. Billington was the library\u2019s chief public relations promoter and protagonist in the annual fight for funding from Congress. He usually projected increasing expenses, rising tides of acquisitions and dwindling staffs to cope with problems of storage, preservation and services to library users.Like his predecessors, Mr. Billington had the task of preserving the world\u2019s greatest collection of books, maps, manuscripts, photographs, prints, recordings, motion pictures and other artifacts, and of cataloging all of it to keep the materials safe and retrievable.He was also charged with enlarging that trove, and he did so energetically. Under his watch the collections almost doubled in size, growing to 160 million items, from the 85 million he had inherited in 1987. His critics said his acquisitions became an unmanageable torrent of 12,000 new items a day.In many ways Mr. Billington had to reinvent the job. He had many materials copied digitally, making them available to wider audiences. In 1991, he linked the library to educational institutions around the country. He also took advantage of the end of the Cold War, which enabled the library to create links to institutions in Russia and former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe, and to exchange materials and help them establish parliamentary libraries.Accessing archives of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Mr. Billington and other scholars hoped to answer questions of history: Did the American diplomat Alger Hiss spy for Moscow? How many people died in Stalin\u2019s purges in the 1930s? What Kremlin secrets can be told of the Berlin crisis of 1958-61 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962? And how did the Soviet Union last so long and fall apart so fast?Mr. Billington also promoted the American Memory National Digital Library program, which since 1994 has made many of more than 24 million books and historical and cultural documents from the library and other research institutions available online.The digitized items, only a fraction of the library\u2019s holdings, are used in classrooms across the nation. They include manuscripts by Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, the Gettysburg Address and photographs of the Civil War, the wreckage of the Johnstown Flood of 1889, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and Atlanta in 1864, before Sherman\u2019s infamous march to the sea.\u201cLibrarians are the gatekeepers to the new technological possibilities of the electronic culture,\u201d Mr. Billington told Library Journal. \u201cBut they are also the dream keepers. They are the custodians of the past.\u201dFilm and broadcast holdings were given particular emphasis under Mr. Billington. In 1989 he created the National Film Registry, which has added 25 movies each year. In 2007, David W. Packard and the Packard Humanities Institute gave $155 million, the largest gift in the library\u2019s history, to create the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Va. It has six million films, television broadcasts and recordings, including Al Jolson singing \u201cSwanee\u201d and Edward R. Murrow broadcasting from London in the blitz.Expanding into social media, the library in 2010 acquired Twitter\u2019s digital archive of billions of tweets from around the world sent since the company\u2019s inception in 2006. Among them is President Barack Obama\u2019s celebratory election-night tweet from 2008.Responding to a barrage of derision for linking the likes of Thucydides and the founding fathers with Justin Bieber, Mr. Billington said the tweets would be valuable to historians someday. \u201cThe Twitter digital archive has extraordinary potential for research into our contemporary way of life,\u201d he said.Though Mr. Billington was rarely a focus of controversy, the library\u2019s inspector general, in a 2013 audit, warned that millions of items, some acquired as long ago as the 1980s, remained piled up in overflowing buildings and warehouses, virtually lost to the world.And the Government Accountability Office in 2015 accused Mr. Billington of mismanaging the library\u2019s information technology systems, and of ignoring for years a legal requirement to hire a chief information officer. In three years, the report said, there had been five acting information officers, each without full authority to manage the library\u2019s systems.\u201cThe library does not have the leadership needed to address these I.T. management weaknesses,\u201d the G.A.O. said after its yearlong investigation.Mr. Billington defended his management but did not fulfill a promise to develop a new digital information plan and hire a permanent chief information officer.He retired on Sept. 30, 2015, and in 2016 President Obama nominated Ms. Hayden, the longtime head of Baltimore\u2019s library system, to fill the post.James Hadley Billington was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on June 1, 1929, to Nelson and Jane (Coolbaugh) Billington. His father, an insurance executive, was a descendant of Mayflower pilgrims; his mother was a writer and a homemaker.Though his father never attended college, he instilled a love of books in James, who attended public schools in the Philadelphia area and was valedictorian of his class at Lower Merion High School in 1946 and then at Princeton in 1950. He studied at Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship, earning a doctorate in 1953. He then joined the Army and became a first lieutenant.In 1957 he married Marjorie Anne Brennan, who survives him. In addition to her and his daughter Susan, he is also survived by another daughter, Anne Billington Fischer; two sons, James Jr. and Thomas; and 12 grandchildren. Mr. Billington, who died in Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, lived in McLean, Va.He taught history at Harvard from 1957 to 1962, then moved to Princeton, where he taught until 1974. He was a visiting professor at universities in Helsinki, Leningrad, Moscow and Paris.As director of the nonpartisan Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars from 1973 to 1987, he founded the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies and The Wilson Quarterly. He received more than 40 honorary degrees.Mr. Billington wrote six books on Russia and revolutionary traditions. His \u201cMikhailovsky and Russian Populism\u201d (1958) was the first major biography of the 19th-century Russian social critic Nikolai Mikhailovsky. In \u201cThe Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture\u201d (1966), he examined 1,000 years of intellectual life in Russia. Leonard Shapiro, in The New York Review of Books, called it a \u201cmagisterial survey of the past.\u201dMr. Billington\u2019s other books were \u201cFire in the Minds of Men: Origins of the Revolutionary Faith\u201d (1980), which assessed revolutions in many countries over 200 years; \u201cRussia Transformed: Breakthrough to Hope, August 1991\u201d (1992); \u201cThe Face of Russia\u201d (1998), a companion to a PBS documentary that he wrote and narrated; and \u201cRussia in Search of Itself\u201d (2004), a post-Soviet analysis.His family said he had been writing his memoirs in retirement.Ana Fota contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Like dozens of other survivors, he found refuge in the field by the local Walmart.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d live in a tent city,\u201d said Mr. Winter, 39, a Marine Corps veteran and software developer who had recently emerged from a stretch of homelessness, only to lose everything he owned in the devastating Camp Fire, the deadliest California wildfire on record. \u201cI mean, this is America; we\u2019re not supposed to live this way. But here we are, man, the new normal.\u201dFirefighters are still battling the colossal blazes in California that have already claimed 80 lives, 77 of them in Butte County north of Sacramento, where the Camp Fire has raged. Nearly 1,300 people remain missing and unaccounted for.As of Sunday evening, the Camp Fire, which has already burned nearly 150,000 acres, was about 65 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.While the struggle to contain the fires continues, many evacuees are collecting in makeshift settlements outside the scorch zones, and wondering how they will pick up the pieces to extricate themselves from this tragedy.Some who fled from Magalia, Paradise and other burned towns in the forested Sierra Nevada foothills of eastern Butte County are staying in the tent city at the Chico Walmart. Others sleep in their cars over at the Target parking lot. Then there are those who are relying on the kindness of strangers, or going from one shelter to the next.California is the richest state in the country, home to technology giants like Google and Facebook and the multimillionaires who lost luxury homes around Malibu to wildfires this month. But the blazes are also laying bare the economic inequality that distinguishes the state, as shallow-pocketed survivors grasp for the kinds of ad hoc strategies commonly seen after disasters in the developing world.\u201cWe were always a paycheck-to-paycheck kind of town,\u201d said Anjeanette Ramey, 30, who had worked in customer service in Magalia but was unemployed when the fire hit.\u201cAll I made it out with were the clothes on my back,\u201d she said on Sunday morning, gazing at the Walmart tent city, where she has stayed for several days. \u201cMy house, my car, gone. No money, no job. I have no idea what happens next.\u201dHer boyfriend\u2019s reaction was more about suspicion and anger. He declined to give his name, saying he didn\u2019t want to be known as a victim, and said the couple was avoiding formal shelters because he thought they were unsafe for people like him and his neighbors, who he thought counted for little with the rich and powerful.With reliable information in short supply, dark rumors and speculation spreads easily in the tent city and other places where evacuees are camping.People in the tents said there had been talk a few days ago that the authorities were planning to clear them out. But guards with the private security firm that patrols the Walmart property said there were no plans to evict the evacuees.Clad in bulletproof vests, they pointed to the portable toilets that had been set up in the parking lot, and the donated food and clothing that had been made available to those in the tents.The Walmart lot, which had emerged as an unofficial distribution site for aid, also features a whiteboard with names of people who are missing from the fires, and a list of shelters that have available beds.Some of the tent people say they have not gone to shelters because they find security in numbers at the Walmart; others say they like being near friends and neighbors who also lost their houses.\u201cThis is my home now,\u201d said James Reed, 65, a retired tow-truck driver, pointing to his 1968 Chevrolet El Camino. His house in Magalia, bought two years ago, was destroyed, he said, and \u201cbeing here, in this parking lot, I\u2019m reminded I\u2019m not the only one.\u201dMr. Reed, wearing an AC/DC baseball cap, said he was still trying to make sense of what had happened. He said he was getting used to sleeping in his car, enduring temperatures that have been dipping down close to freezing at night.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m like a snake on a rock, warming up a little bit,\u201d Mr. Reed said around midday. \u201cGetting out of that fire was like a B-rated horror movie. I never thought I\u2019d see something like this in this country.\u201dThe camp at the Walmart has become a place for fire evacuees to connect and share information with another group they suddenly have a lot in common with. People who were already living on Chico\u2019s streets before the blazes started have flocked to the parking lot, not least to partake in some of the free food.Robert Talk, 61, a former amusement park worker, said he enjoyed telling jokes and sharing gossip with the evacuees. He said that his small dog, Princeton Peabody, interacts effortlessly with strangers, making it easy to start conversations with people in the camp.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of all in the same boat now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Mr. Talk remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s good for normal folk to realize we\u2019re just like them. A lot of us are in this situation through no fault of our own. Maybe this\u2019ll open eyes, so we can start helping each other more.\u201dOne new resident of the tent camp, Kelly Clark, said that she appreciated meeting Mr. Talk and his dog and talking about how the fires were still raging around them. With a smile, she pointed to her tent and said: \u201cLook at my new condo. Luxurious, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Clark, 39, said that money was now a problem after the house where she lived with her boyfriend was destroyed. She said she was unemployed, and wondered how much longer they could sleep rough outside the Walmart. She, too, was wary about going to one of the shelters, saying she had heard talk that viruses were spreading there.\u201cI just feel freer out here, like I\u2019m not locked up inside with a bunch of other people crying about what they lost,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cWhen it starts raining, maybe then we\u2019ll make a move. But until then, we\u2019re staying put.\u201dThere is rain in the forecast for Wednesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Use of Facebook Data Broke British Law, Watchdog Finds", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica violated British law when it used improperly harvested Facebook data to aid Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, and would face a significant fine if it were not already in bankruptcy, Britain\u2019s top data protection watchdog found Tuesday.According to the commissioner\u2019s office, the company, Eldon Insurance, shared private email addresses to be sent campaign messages on behalf of Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group, months before the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union.The commissioner\u2019s investigation revealed that political campaigns in Britain had exercised little restraint in exploiting consumer data, despite the European Union\u2019s relatively strict data laws. Political groups were acting more like online businesses and internet marketing firms to target and engage voters, the report concluded.\u201cWe have uncovered a disturbing disregard for voters\u2019 personal privacy,\u201d the commissioner found.Now Mr. Banks\u2019s insurance company and the Leave.EU campaign are facing total fines of 135,000 pounds, or about $177,000, for the privacy breaches, which occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The insurance company owned by Mr. Banks will also be audited, the report said.But the commissioner rejected accusations that Leave.EU secretly employed Cambridge Analytica \u2014 and possibly exploited its Facebook data haul \u2014 during the Brexit campaign, potentially violating British election disclosure laws. Though Cambridge Analytica considered working with Leave.EU, and even sent one executive to appear with Leave.EU officials at a news conference, the data company never reached an agreement with the campaign, the commissioner found.But investigators specifically described an improper intermingling of data between Eldon Insurance, Mr. Bank\u2019s company, and the Leave.EU campaign he co-founded.Investigators said more than one million emails sent to Leave.EU supporters over two separate periods had also included marketing for Eldon Insurance services. Eldon customers also were sent a Leave.EU newsletter, an incident the company described as a mistake in managing an email distribution system.The two organizations were already known to have close ties, including sharing board members.The investigation began last year to look into the potential misuse of data in the British referendum on leaving the European Union. But it took on new urgency when The Times, The Observer and The Guardian revealed in March that Cambridge had improperly harvested the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.The British investigation involved 71 witnesses, 30 organizations whose data practices were reviewed and 700 terabytes of data \u2014 the equivalent of 52 billion pages.In addition to the new details about Mr. Banks, Tuesday\u2019s report provides more information about the investigation into how Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user data.The investigation found that Cambridge had nimbly evaded what few restrictions Facebook imposed by contracting with an academic researcher working at Cambridge University, who used an app to harvest the data, almost all of it without the users\u2019 explicit consent.The political consulting firm teamed up with the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, who had created an application that collected demographic information, News Feed posts, friend lists, pages that users had liked and other data.The information was used to create physiological profiles that could guide the targeting of political messages.In March, officials obtained a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices, getting access to mobile phones, storage devices, computers and financial records. At one location, the authorities said, they discovered a number of physically damaged servers, from which investigators were able to recover information.Investigators said the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office needed more to time to review evidence, including Cambridge Analytica\u2019s email system, to better determine who had access to data on Facebook users.\u201cThere are several strands that will take us into the future,\u201d said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner.In its report on Tuesday, the information commissioner said that had the company still existed, it would have faced \u201ca substantial fine for very serious breaches\u201d or Britain\u2019s data protection laws. The company, the report added, engaged in \u201cunfairly processing people\u2019s personal data for political purposes, including purposes connected with the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns.\u201dThe report did not draw any conclusions about whether data mining techniques used by Cambridge Analytica and others had determined the outcome of elections in the United States or Britain, but the regulator called on policymakers to draft new laws to restrict how data is collected and shared for political purposes.\u201cWe may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the U.K. E.U. referendum or the U.S. election campaigns,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.\u201dAdam Satariano reported from London, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.

Writing without mentioning the emotion was how I got started. I knew what happened in Somalia, and I could put down the events. But context, emotion, bringing in my own family background and making it a personal memoir \u2014 balancing all those things had to come in stages, one thing at a time. I thought of it as sediment, as putting down layers. I couldn\u2019t sit there and have it all come out at once, even in rough draft.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?People would ask me: \u201cHow have you changed?\u201d Before I finished the book, I don\u2019t think I could answer how. I certainly didn\u2019t think about it while I was going through it; it was just a matter of survival day to day. And afterward, how I had changed is not the first thing I had to wonder about every morning. The surprising answer was that I learned to live without hope. I had to detach myself from the cycle of hope and despair. That\u2019s one way I survived. And I only realized that when I wrote the book.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I certainly never wanted to write a hostage memoir. I set out to write a book that was not about me but about Somali pirates and how they fit into the history of piracy \u2014 what made them different and what made them the same. Luckily, I\u2019m able to answer that question in the book, but I really wanted to spend more time on it, and on the trial in Hamburg, too, which I had thought about for a year. And those take up no more than a few pages in the book.All three of my books are very different from each other, but one thing they have in common is that they seem to be obsessed with the idea of freedom. When I set out to write about pirates, that\u2019s not what I had in mind. But the end result is that I\u2019ve written a book that says a few things about freedom.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read \u201cThe Desert and the Sea\u201d in 50 words or less.If it sounds grim or boring, I worked hard to not make it that.

{"Headline": "A Clearer Message on Cochlear Implants", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisabilityPortrayals of this technology as a \u201cmiracle\u201d for deaf people overlook its potential downsides and challenges. Ms. Novic is a deaf writer and teacher who uses American Sign Language and English. At the start of every semester, before we dive into the course\u2019s syllabus, I stand before my university students and let them ask me anything. Some ask about my writing career, grill me on the meaning of my tattoos or request pictures of my dog. But at least a few students each year ask me why I don\u2019t have a cochlear implant and whether I want to get one.This answer is, for me, an easy one. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m happy with how I am now.\u201dI explain that deafness offers me a unique perspective on the world, or joke that I like it quiet when I\u2019m writing, but I always end with a fact: \u201cIt would be a big commitment \u2014 learning to use a cochlear implant takes a lot of work.\u201dIn my teaching, depending on the class, I use a combination of American Sign Language with interpreters, my own voice and lip reading when appropriate. I also use hearing aids that give me basic sound information. My experience is far from exceptional. Most deaf people use multiple methods of communication and technological support to interact with the hearing world. It\u2019s no secret that a heated debate over cochlear implantation has evolved in recent years, one frequently reduced to an either-or battle between sign language and speech. The reality is much more nuanced, and the more we understand about it, the better.Those who are good candidates still have a long road to success after the operation. A cochlear implant sends sound as electrical pulses to the auditory nerve; it does not come preloaded with language information. The user must spend years in vigorous auditory-verbal training to learn to decode the signals to understand sound and speech.Because the implants are often depicted as quick fixes without mention of this process, the surrounding controversy is often framed as culture versus technology: Those who advocate American Sign Language (A.S.L.) are defenders of a language rendered irrelevant by scientific progress. And while cultural preservation is certainly a factor for deaf people, it is not the whole story.Children with a cochlear implant and no access to visual language may be unwittingly engaged in a race against the clock as they learn to interpret the electrical signals provided by the implant. Some children are successful in this pursuit, while others aren\u2019t.Low technological failure rates for implant hardware are often confused with the more complicated measure of success or failure of the devices in real-world contexts. Implant technology might be consistent in a vacuum, but the human use and response to it isn\u2019t.Advocates of oral-only education often dismiss arguments for bilingualism with the phrase \u201cparental choice,\u201d but when implants are publicized as cures, many parents make a choice with incomplete information and without ever having met a deaf person before. And those who choose to forgo the implant face pressure from medical professionals.Dr. Kaitlin Stack Whitney, an assistant professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the mother of a deaf preschooler, says her family\u2019s experience has made it clear that the goal of implantation for many isn\u2019t language access but rather to make the child \u201cnormal.\u201d\u201cWe are constantly asked why my A.S.L.-using preschooler, whose language development is more than a year ahead for his age, doesn\u2019t have a C.I.,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThe focus isn\u2019t on whether he\u2019s educated, happy, and thriving \u2014 it\u2019s on passing. Meanwhile, we know children with C. I.s who have language delays because of factors like age of hearing loss identification and quality of support.\u201dDr. Stack Whitney said that she and her husband are not against implants and that their son will weigh in on the decision when he is older.Ms. Kolb says applying a one-size-fits-all understanding to the subjective natures of sound and hearing does a disservice to implant users. \u201cBecause of the existing misperception of what cochlear implant technology actually does, and the range of outcomes that actually exists for different deaf people,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve had to do a lot of work to explain to others what I do hear, and also why I still need and benefit from accommodations. I think this is the dangerous underside of perpetuating an uncomplicated story of cochlear-implant-as-cure.\u201dA cochlear implant isn\u2019t inherently bad, but it isn\u2019t inherently good, either; it is a neutral piece of technology, a tool, like a hammer. Expecting an implant to cure deafness or magically generate speech is to await the moment the hammer will fly out of one\u2019s hand and build a house on its own. The value of the tool lies only in the skill of its user, and for the cochlear implant user, that skill is learned with much effort. To suggest otherwise is to give a disingenuous prognosis to potential patients and their parents, and discounts the hard work successful C.I. users do to communicate in a way the hearing world deems acceptable.An earlier version of this essay misspelled the surname of the author of a book on cochlear implants in children. She is Laura Mauldin, not Maudlin.Advertisement"}

They converse every other week.My point, to those of us who want to ensure that Donald Trump is a one-term president, is to be careful what we wish for. Whatever happens on Tuesday isn\u2019t going to decide what happens in 2020. Or am I missing the forest for the trees here?But you\u2019re right that Trump will try to turn Nancy Pelosi into the new version of immigrant caravans. The Republicans have made her into their all-purpose target already, even when she hasn\u2019t actually had the power to do anything to thwart them.I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever really talked about Pelosi.

Also, investigating the past is probably not what\u2019s going to decide the election. Democrats need to put forward an agenda, work with the Trump administration on things like immigration reform and an infrastructure bill, and appeal to a wider cross-section of Americans. The question of Trump\u2019s tax returns is mostly a distraction from that goal.Have we discussed the way all of Trump\u2019s regular Democratic targets \u2014 except with the perfunctory nod to Chuck Schumer \u2014 are women?

{"Headline": "Mitt Romney Goes to Washington After All ", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe soon-to-be senator from Utah will have to decide when and how to make common cause with Donald Trump. Mr. Holland is a professor of religion at the Harvard Divinity School.The latest polling in Utah\u2019s senate race has Mitt Romney up by some 36 points over Jenny Wilson, his Democratic opponent. Barring an enormous upset, Mr. Romney will join the United States Senate. This will put him a few checks and balances away from a president \u2014 the leader of his party \u2014 whom he once called \u201cterribly unfit for office.\u201dAs Mr. Romney prepares for Washington and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona concludes his congressional service for Arizona, I keep getting questions about what it means for devout Latter-day Saints to participate in American governance. I suppose these questions come to me because I am a scholar of American religion and because, as a Latter-day Saint, I share Mr. Romney\u2019s and Mr. Flake\u2019s religious faith. People seem to think I have the inside scoop on how these men relate their devotional lives to their public service.Perhaps the only responsible answer to such questions is that religious identities and their political implications cannot be so simplistically reduced. Political orientations are shaped at the intersections of race, class, geography and history and a tangle of other currents with which religious commitments become inextricably intertwined. For many people, the role of religion in politics is less about a set of prescriptions to which decisions can be confidently ascribed and more about a set of resources that individuals can choose to bring to bear on their decision-making process.Individual Latter-day Saints make these decisions differently. Mr. Romney, Mr. Flake and I share a theology but not a political party.There certainly are aspects of Latter-day Saint culture that help account for this resistance. A collective memory of religious persecution has generated a sense of solidarity with the Muslims that Mr. Trump has vilified. Missionary service in early adulthood often gives church members like Mr. Flake and Mr. Romney a commitment to God\u2019s global family that is at odds with the president\u2019s splenetic nativism. A unique theological emphasis on human agency makes many Latter-day Saints nervous about Mr. Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts. Our religious community\u2019s ideals of kindness have been offended by the vulgar cruelty of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior.When people ask me about Mr. Romney and Mr. Flake, they are often well aware of these severe limitations on Latter-day Saint opposition to the White House. Still, at the very least, they want to make sense of the rhetoric. The politically charged resources that we share can push in multiple directions. The same memory of religious persecution that recoils at Mr. Trump\u2019s Islamophobia also generates profound states-rights distrust of a federal government that once sent armed troops into Utah. The same theology of eternal family bonds that balks at Mr. Trump\u2019s misogynistic lechery can only with great difficulty accept his opponents\u2019 pro-choice platforms. Despite appearances in the \u201creddest of red states,\u201d Latter-day Saint values have never fit perfectly with the political divisions of the two-party system, but the age of Trump has made that misalignment much more pronounced.Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s hearing publicly displayed some of the choices Latter-day Saints face in the age of Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake\u2019s very public agonizing over the nomination became a vivid symbol of the struggles many of my coreligionists feel when they allow the current political moment to incite deeper forms of civic soul searching. At the same time, Orrin Hatch\u2019s conspicuous absence of agony symbolizes the decisions of many of my coreligionists not to allow any such thing.Assuming Mr. Romney wins a seat in the United States Senate, he will have to decide when and how to make common cause with the leader of his party. Will he draw on his experience as a missionary in France to resist isolationism and xenophobia? Will he utilize his memories as a lay church leader in Boston, where he devoted untold hours of ministry to vulnerable individuals and communities, to temper the president\u2019s brutalizing rhetoric of winners and losers? Will he let a distinctly Latter-day Saint reverence for the United States Constitution embolden him to check abuses of executive power?If he wants to counteract the man to whom he once attributed the potential \u201cunraveling of our national fabric,\u201d he will have plenty of religious resources to bring to bear. Whether he will use them is up to him. David F. Holland is a professor of religion at the Harvard Divinity School.Advertisement"}

Mr. Bookbinder is executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr. Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement and accompanying cooperation are also of profound importance for what they don\u2019t cover. When Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax and campaign finance charges in August, he did so without the benefit of a cooperation agreement. Now that he has one, it is safe to assume that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has found his cooperation valuable and thinks it will help build a case against other targets. That cooperation will almost certainly involve topics beyond those mentioned in the documents filed Thursday. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies will try to dismiss the significance of Mr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation, pointing out that he has now confessed to multiple crimes in two separate actions. But as any experienced legal practitioner knows, the government almost always relies on cooperators to make their case against their criminal cohorts. Often the best way of learning about, and proving, criminal activity is by working with those involved in that activity, unsavory as they may be. Plus, the documents filed Thursday quote extensively from emails that are almost certainly in the special counsel\u2019s possession, which corroborates the belief that Mr. Cohen has come clean about his Russia dealings.The president and his lawyers may now be lamenting the game that they have been playing for nearly a year in delaying the president\u2019s responses to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions. In so doing, they have given Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators time to flip multiple key associates. And the president now faces a new Congress that will be more likely to take action in the event that Mr. Trump tries to shut Mr. Mueller down, and diligently pursue the issues raised in any report released by Mr. Mueller and his team.The potential risk to the president on three investigative fronts \u2014 obstruction, collusion and campaign finance \u2014 continues to grow. We know that the president has a tendency to hit back twice as hard when he is threatened. That puts the investigation at greater risk. Legislation to protect the special counsel was once again blocked by Republican leadership from a Senate vote on Wednesday. The coming omnibus spending legislation will provide a must-pass vehicle to try again to enact these protections, and we hope the supporters of Mr. Mueller, and of democracy and accountability, on both sides of the aisle will seize the moment.

{"Headline": "Hurricane Harvey Passed Over, but These Fish Kept Making Babies", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesUnderwater audio recordings rescued from Hurricane Harvey showed that the urge to spawn was more powerful than a category 4 storm.Their team has been looking at spawning: when fish cast eggs and sperm into the water that meet, fertilize and develop into a new population, if all goes well. The team wants to know when the fish start, how long they go and how temperature and saltiness, which fluctuate in the estuary near Port Aransas, Tex., might affect their behavior in different locations.But because the water is murky, they can\u2019t just dive in and look. Instead, they rely on these fish\u2019s unusual audible mating calls. In this species, as well as other drum fish named for their sounds, the males cry out in grunts and pulses during spawning. An individual sounds like a panther standing behind a trickling stream of water. And when many call together, they can evoke a chorus of chain saws.Mr. Biggs and his colleagues had deployed underwater microphones in April 2017 at 15 popular spawning grounds. These programmable recording devices are protected inside waterproof casing and strapped to a PVC pipe. To install and remove them, Mr. Biggs had to dive down six or 12 feet and hammer them into the sandy sea bottom.When news of Harvey\u2019s strength and direction was announced, Mr. Biggs was at a conference in Florida. He raced home to Texas and took a boat out to retrieve his recorders. He recovered about half before he had to evacuate, and the storm took most of the rest.Audio analysis of the six months of rescued recordings revealed some surprises. First, despite previous work suggesting spawning coincided with changes in the moon, their survey showed the fish population spawned daily.And then the two recorders that survived the hurricane yielded another unexpected finding.At first, the researchers thought the storm\u2019s noise was too loud to hear anything. But when it calmed, they heard the fish spawning \u2014 the day before the storm, in its eye and the day after.\u201cThat was completely surprising when you consider the total destruction on land,\u201d he said.Following the hurricane, the fish began spawning earlier in the day, possibly cued in part by temperature changes in the water.\u201cYou would think if they felt their environment getting that disrupted, they would just go somewhere else, but yet they were still hunkered down right in the same spots that they had been before,\u201d Mr. Biggs said.Whether they stopped during the worst of it and restarted in the calm, however, we may never know.This year the team has deployed another set of hydrophones to find out why the fish make sounds when they spawn. Is the call more of a social cue to sync spawning after they\u2019ve already gathered? Or is it more like a dinner bell calling out \u201cHey, it\u2019s spawning time in the estuary, come and get it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yes, the Octopus Is Smart as Heck. But Why?", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterIt has eight arms, three hearts \u2014 and a plan. Scientists aren\u2019t sure how the cephalopods got to be so intelligent. To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an octopus pulling two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the shells together like nesting bowls \u2014 and carts them away. \u201cIt suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be useful in the future,\u201d said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the University of Cambridge in Britain. But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement. For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them apes, elephants, dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots. \u201cIt\u2019s an apparent paradox that\u2019s been largely overlooked in the past,\u201d said Mr. Amodio. He and five other experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a car apart and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an animal thrive. That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a knack for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don\u2019t rely on fixed responses to survive \u2014 they can invent new behaviors on the fly.Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified some shared factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time, and they can form long-lasting social bonds.Those similarities have led to some promising explanations for how certain animals evolved to be smart.One is known as the ecological intelligence hypothesis. It holds that intelligence evolves as an adaptation for finding food. While some animals have a reliable food supply, others have to cope with unpredictability.\u201cIf you eat fruit, you have to remember where the fruiting trees are and when they\u2019re ripe,\u201d said Mr. Amadio. \u201cIt can be much more cognitively challenging than eating leaves.\u201dTools allow animals to get to food that they couldn\u2019t reach otherwise. And if they can make plans for the future, they can store food to survive hard times.Other researchers have argued for what\u2019s known as the social intelligence hypothesis: Smarter animals \u201ccooperate and learn from other members of the same species,\u201d said Mr. Amadio.Together, these forces appear to have encouraged the development of bigger, more powerful brains. Smart animals also tend to live for a long time, and it\u2019s possible that bigger brains drove the evolution of longevity. It takes years for juveniles to develop these complex organs, during which time they need help from adults to get enough food.Cephalopods behave in ways that certainly suggest they\u2019re highly intelligent. An octopus named Inky, for example, made a notorious escape recently from the National Aquarium of New Zealand, exiting his enclosure and slithering into a floor drain and, apparently, out to sea. Cuttlefish can scare off predators by forming eyespots on their bodies in order to look like giant fish. But they only use this trick against predators that rely on vision to find prey. If a predator that depends on smell shows up, the cuttlefish are smart enough just to flee.Another feature that cephalopods share with other smart animals is a relatively big brain. But that\u2019s where the similarities appear to end. Most of the neurons that do the computing, for example, are in the octopus\u2019s arms. Most strikingly, cephalopods die young. Some may live as long as two years, while others only last a few months. Nor do cephalopods form social bonds. They get together to mate, but males and females don\u2019t stay together for long or care for their young. While chimpanzees and dolphins may live in societies of dozens of other animals, cephalopods seem to be loners.Mr. Amodio and his colleagues think the evolutionary history of cephalopods may explain this intelligence paradox. About half a billion years ago, their snaillike ancestors evolved to use their shells as a buoyancy device. They could load chambers in the shell with gas to float up and down in the ocean.Another cephalopod, the nautilus, still lives this way. Like the octopus, it has tentacles. It also has a somewhat enlarged brain, although it doesn\u2019t seem to be anywhere as intelligent as an octopus.About 275 million years ago, the ancestor of the other cephalopods lost the external shell. It\u2019s not clear why, but it must have been liberating. Now the animals could start exploring places that had been off-limits to their shelled ancestors. Octopuses could slip into rocky crevices, for example, to hunt for prey.On the other hand, losing their shells left cephalopods quite vulnerable to hungry predators. This threat may have driven cephalopods to become masters of disguise and escape. They did so by evolving big brains, the ability to solve new problems, and perhaps look into the future \u2014 knowing that coconut or clam shells may come in handy, for example.Yet intelligence is not the perfect solution for cephalopods, Mr. Amodio suggested. Sooner or later, they get eaten. Natural selection has turned them into a paradox: a short-lived, intelligent animal.Mr. Amodio said that scientists still need to learn a lot more about cephalopods before they can know if this hypothesis is sound. But the research may do more than shine a light on octopuses and their cousins: It could give us a deeper understanding of intelligence in general.\u201cWe can\u2019t take for granted that there\u2019s just one way to intelligence,\u201d Mr. Amodio said. \u201cThere could be different paths.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the nautilus as a relative of the cephalopods. In fact, it is a cephalopod.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On My Wedding Day, Wishing I Looked Like Someone Else", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMy eyes were too swollen for me to walk down the aisle. It wasn\u2019t from crying.I could hardly open my eyes because my eyelids were so swollen. In despair, I called out to Damian, my soon-to-be-husband. Then we called my doctor, who said, \u201cLooks like your bone marrow transplant came to your wedding.\u201dI had received a bone-marrow transplant several years earlier, which vanquished the leukemia in my blood and saved my life. But my new immune system sometimes went haywire. Submerging myself in the hotel bathtub the night before with a moist, fragrant washcloth over my eyes had probably been a bad idea; it likely vexed my sensitive system.Or maybe this was caused by stress? It hurt to look at myself. Why did my body have to go rogue today of all days?Just two and a half years before, I didn\u2019t think this day would happen. At lunch with my mother, I said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m probably not going to find a partner.\u201d I was 30 then and full-body irradiation had made me infertile. \u201cI\u2019m not what guys are looking for.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sad about this. On the contrary, I felt relieved. Finally free from hope and longing. But my mother couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201cI\u2019m going to be O.K.,\u201d I said.The next day I boarded a plane for Arkansas and a Buddhist retreat center in the Ozark Mountains I had been to before. When I was ill, my parents worried I wasn\u2019t turning to Jesus, but Buddhism seemed to make more sense. My life had become an immersive education in impermanence and suffering.After releasing the pressure of needing to partner, after making my mother cry, I arrived at the retreat center. And there was Damian, wearing tan cargo pants, a beige button-down shirt and a Tilley hat. He looked Australian, but I knew he was British.I knew because I had heard about him during a previous visit, when I met his then-wife, Angela. Damian\u2019s green card had expired and he was stuck in England, unaware that Angela was lusting after a new guy. I actually advised her to ditch the new guy and stay with her husband, because he sounded so awesome. I even emailed her afterward to encourage her again, and I was sad when I learned they had divorced.\u201cSo, you\u2019re the Damian I\u2019ve heard so much about,\u201d I said.With a new green card, he was there for the same retreat and was helping build cabins for the center. I knew from Angela that he was in his late 40s, but he looked closer to my age.Damian would later say that after he met me, he kept thinking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ibby?\u201d I did get the sense he was always finding me around the center, but not in a creepy way \u2014 more how a Labrador greets you at the door, tail wagging, ready to receive you.I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle rugged conditions, so I chose to camp the first night, but I didn\u2019t know how to set up my borrowed tent, so Damian set it up with me.As I organized my things, Damian lay half in the tent staring at the stars. He later told me he kept thinking he should leave, but he felt remarkably comfortable. I kept thinking he should stay, because I was afraid to camp alone. But I decided that sharing a tent with a stranger wasn\u2019t the best way to start a meditation retreat.And this was a silent retreat, or meant to be. The first day, I was eating lunch on the ledge of a cabin. With no room next to me, Damian plopped himself on the grass directly in front, grinning. I found the obviousness of his interest refreshing, but I couldn\u2019t say anything, so I stood up and moved next to him on the grass and we ate our lunch quietly, staring at a cabin wall.The second day, eating lunch under a tree, we watched a cricket jump onto another cricket and they started mating. Talk about an awkward silence!We went for a walk to a swimming hole, where we skipped rocks. Then I broke the silence. I had been sick, I told him, and I didn\u2019t want to waste my time or his, so I asked him every question I could think of. Do you like your mother? What about children? Cats or dogs? Would you get married again? Do you mind that my ovaries don\u2019t work?All those questions, and not one red flag.Damian wasn\u2019t fazed by my cancer-survivor status either. I was healthy by then, with a negligible chance of relapse, but my immune system could be wonky. I have already been through menopause, and I can no longer make tears \u2014 all side effects of the treatment that gave me more time on earth.Illness changes you in nonphysical ways too, aging your spirit. It can make you wiser but also more aware and scared of life\u2019s potential for pain.\u201cWell,\u201d Damian said, \u201cyou seem fearless to me.\u201dOn the third day, he kissed me. Then he told me he loved me.\u201cNo, it\u2019s too soon!\u201d I said. Then I remembered the meditation instructor told us to \u201cbe spacious.\u201d Maybe that meant, don\u2019t freak out?What I wanted was a man I could admire and a love that was abundantly clear. Damian was unafraid, attentive, generous and compassionate. It seemed as soon as I had let go of my hope and longing, he appeared.By the end of the retreat, I knew that while there had been life before Damian, now there could only be life with him.My parents, however, were not happy when I told them about him and us, concerned about our age difference and Damian\u2019s previous marriage.My father, an attorney, said, \u201cWhen one of my clients wants to marry a divorced man, I tell her to talk to the ex-wife first.\u201d\u201cBut Dad, I did that.\u201dHe also worried that Damian, who designs, builds and remodels homes, wasn\u2019t a college graduate. I had an answer for this too.The year Damian was sorting out his green card, the BBC interviewed him for a story about the benefits of meditation. Because he had meditated for more than 10,000 hours, neurologists figured his brain activity might look different from the brain of an average person, so they put him into an M.R.I. machine.\u201cMeet Damian, a man who can seemingly turn happiness on,\u201d the reporter, David Sillito, said, adding that the neurologist who read Damian\u2019s M.R.I. had called his brain \u201cbeautiful.\u201d I sent the link to my father.But the morning of our wedding, not even Damian could turn on my happiness. I had become Buddhist, found the retreat center and met the man I love because I once had cancer. Still, if ever there was a day that I didn\u2019t want to be reminded of this, it was today, and it was staring me in the face.My doctor prescribed antibiotics, Benadryl and steroids. Damian and I sat on the edge of the bed and meditated for an hour, which was our practice at the time. Then he went off with his best man and I tried to pull myself together. At the salon, as my hair was being twisted into a bun, my mother begged me to stop being so upset, saying it would only make my eyes worse.Damian says that my family, which is prone to stress-induced squabbles, didn\u2019t have a chance to fight that day because my eyelids elicited such sympathy. That\u2019s a very Buddhist interpretation. All I can say is I wish my eyelids had asked permission before sacrificing themselves to keep the peace.But later, as my mother and sister and sister-in-law helped me into my wedding gown, I looked in the mirror and thought, \u201cWow, I actually look pretty.\u201d One \u2014 or all three \u2014 of the drugs had worked. The swelling had left in its wake a burnt orange color that looked like makeup on my eyelids.Still, I didn\u2019t really arrive to my own wedding day until the doors to the chapel opened and I saw my niece dropping petals on the path I was about to walk. Everyone I love was there, staring at me, smiling. Some were crying. I just kept walking.We had a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony in a glass and wooden chapel in the woods of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. We included a Bible reading about love, since our families are Catholic, but most of the ceremony was in Tibetan: chants sung by a monk, accompanied by the ringing of a bell. Damian and I sat together silently, soaking it all in, as I experienced firsthand how suffering can transform into something beautiful.Advertisement"}

What the special counsel has gathered since the raids provides the clearest proof yet to the American public that Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry \u2014 derided by the president and his allies as an aimless fishing expedition \u2014 is rooted in the law and facts. To those critics, this latest move was surely meant to send another message as well: He\u2019s not about to back down. The facts to which Mr. Cohen admitted on Thursday don\u2019t establish that Mr. Trump conspired with Russian efforts to win him the election, but they refute Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent, vehement claim that he had nothing to do with Russia as he sought the White House.

Dui! I am going to Lanzhou, too,\u201d I said, nodding vigorously to the kind-faced woman in her 40s, as we established that we were both alone and flying to the capital of China\u2019s Gansu Province \u2014 a spot in the country\u2019s interior along a northwestern part of the ancient Silk Road trade route \u2014 and that neither of us spoke the other\u2019s language.I had taken notice of Wei Zhaohan in the Beijing airport when she started listening to Chinese pop music videos next to me without headphones. This was my sixth or so visit to China, but my first without my relatives, who mainly hail from Shanghai and Beijing, and I\u2019d been missing that familiar element of noise and chaos: everyone talking over each other, picnic spreads of steamed buns and fruit laid out across airport waiting room chairs.\u201cYou can trust that I am a good person!\u201d she wrote into Baidu, and laughed as her friend drove us down a dark highway toward Lanzhou after midnight, which might be the midpoint of a Stephen King novel under other circumstances. But she was just one in a series of people who jumped in to help me \u2014 ordering for me at restaurants, getting me safely to my hotel, as Ms. Wei did. Most of them didn't realize I was Chinese-American at first; they just seemed to see a woman on her own in a strange land looking rather lost.A magnificent stretch of desert sandwiched between mountains, Gansu was once China\u2019s Wild West, containing the westernmost structures of The Great Wall, built to ward off attacking nomadic hordes, and legendary shrines dug into cliffs for the westward spread of Buddhism. But easier is relative and Gansu in November was not easy. Temperatures were below freezing in a landscape so beautifully barren it's hard to believe it can sustain life. There were few foreigners; almost no one spoke English; and I couldn\u2019t read menus or street signs. (I speak only basic, familial Chinese, like \u201cI already ate,\u201d and \u201cno, really, I can\u2019t eat any more.\u201d) They\u2019d already eaten, but insisted on ordering five more dishes just for me, all of them vegetarian, because Ms. Wei had noticed I\u2019d ordered a vegetarian meal on the plane. They drank hot water, which is a thing people do in the chilly North. And in between specialties like shredded potatoes stir-fried with chili peppers, Leader poured me shot glass after shot glass of baiju liquor. I know from many a banquet with my family that there\u2019s only one thing to do in that situation: lift your glass and shout, \u201cGanbei!\u201dIt was hard not to marvel at sheer human will up there, including the amount I\u2019d had to employ just to get to the view.The afternoon after my dinner with Ms. Wei, I had boarded a 6.5 hour train to Jiayuguan, which was the shortest I could find from the downtown Lanzhou train station \u2014 after I learned all the high-speed trains were sold out and left from a new train station, Lanzhou West, on the outskirts of the city, anyway.Onboard, a police officer introduced me to Jo, an English teacher from Jiayuguan. She not only woke me up when we had to get off the train at 2:30 a.m., but had her husband drive me to my hotel, where she negotiated my rate down to $29 for two nights (as opposed to the $90 I\u2019d booked online). I showered and huddled under my covers with all my winter clothes on because I couldn\u2019t figure out the heater. But I sure was glad I wasn\u2019t paying $60 more for that.The next morning, at Jo\u2019s suggestion, I walked on Jiayuguan\u2019s wide, relatively empty boulevards to a local restaurant, Wu Mai Er, to try a regional specialty: Lanzhou hand-pulled beef noodles. When I couldn\u2019t communicate my order, a man in line bought my bowl for me and showed me how to pick it up, put chili sauce, or lajiao, in it, and then sit at a counter to slurp the noodles from the steaming broth. The fortress underwent an impressive renovation in 2014. The evening I went, as the desert temperatures dropped precipitously with the sunset, I had the entire place to myself, walking up stone ramps used for bringing horses to lookout points and rolling down logs to crush enemies. At the exit, I caught up with Wei Gong, who was waiting for her taxi. A man who ran a shop selling tea sets made out of a local stone invited us to sit inside next to his wood-burning stove to warm our freezing hands.MONGOLIACHINAGREAT WALLSILK ROADN.

I\u2019d sprung for a luxurious \u201csoft sleeper\u201d car, with a comfortable bed and a door that closed. After four glorious hours of sleep, and a couple more waiting around in a taxi for the site to open, I walked into my first Mogao Cave to see 1,400 year-old Buddhas from the Tang dynasty.You can\u2019t get into the caves without a guide. After a bit of asking around I found an English-speaking tour, which had three people on it, including me. The caves, whose ceilings are covered in hundreds of little Buddha portraits to convey Buddha\u2019s infinite nature, date back to the year 366, when a monk named Le Zun went for a walk in the desert, had a vision of a thousand Buddhas bathed in a golden light, and was inspired to dig a shrine out of sandstone. For centuries, devotees would dig caves and decorate them with enormous Buddhas, until the Silk Road declined, and people stopped coming. The caves remained intact and untouched (save for the work of a few shrine robbers) only to be revived over the last century with the discovery of a huge trove of Buddhist documents from the 11th century.The centerpiece of the site is a five-story pagoda-like structure. As I walked in, a crowd of people were leaving and the light was so dim it was difficult to see. There was something big ahead. Was that a foot? I looked up to see a 98-foot-tall Buddha.There are bigger Buddhas in China and the world, but likely none feel as intimate as standing inside a building that\u2019s basically the same size as the Buddha, forcing you to crane your neck up to look at him and stay always in a supplicant position. The feat of human determination and faith that brought this massive statue into existence is overwhelming to contemplate. I think about that Buddha a lot and how close I had to stand to him to see him, and how tiny I felt in that moment. A planning committee had gathered outside my compartment on an overnight slow train. I had, it turned out, a certain love for the more social, populist \u201chard sleeper\u201d cars \u2014 with no doors and six bunks to a room \u2014 where the inability to sit up straight on any bed but the bottom meant lots of congregating in corridors. I also had a pile of logistical dilemmas, which piqued the interest of some English-speakers who\u2019d overheard me discussing them with the conductor.For my last day in the country, with a flight to Japan at 9 p.m., I had concocted a harebrained plan to spend the morning at Zhangye Danxia Landform National Geopark, or the Rainbow Mountains, then hop on a three-hour bullet train to the Lanzhou West station, and take another 40-minute train from there to the Lanzhou airport. But the trip was going to require precision engineering.First, Lien Shaoyong, a fellow eastward-bound traveler I had met at the grottoes, struck a deal for me with the conductor. I had a ticket for only part of the journey because the final leg to Zhangye had been sold out. The solution: pay cash for the difference and the staff would wake me in the middle of the night to move me to an empty slot since my bed was already spoken for.Next on the scene was Song Xu, my bunkmate and a businessman with excellent English. He began plotting my day backward from my last possible arrival time at the airport. A college student, Liu Haocheng, joined us, as did another businessman sitting nearby. The family of three whose bottom bunks we\u2019d commandeered listened in with bemusement as Mr. Liu translated the action into Chinese. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this by yourself?\u201d the mother said, nodding with approval. \u201cVery brave.\u201dMr. Tao picked me up while it was still dark and we drove to the park, past trucks making early morning deliveries, and droves of children riding their bicycles to school. Private cars can\u2019t go inside, so I boarded the first hop-on-hop-off bus of the day, which was carrying all the security guards and park workers, in their fur hats and winter coats, to their posts. The temperature gauge read minus-seven-degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit).WeChat messages began flooding in from the planning committee, who wanted to know how it was all going, and from Mr. Yu and both Ms. Weis, as well as from my aunt, uncle and cousin from Queens who happened to be visiting Shanghai for Thanksgiving but whom I wouldn\u2019t be able to see. The other tourists had gone and I was alone on a freezing cold mountaintop across the world from a life I\u2019d left behind almost a year ago, overlooking what could have been Mars, and I felt at home.Mobile signals proved significantly more reliable (and less restrictive) than Wi-Fi in Gansu. Pick up a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hot spot, which runs off cell signals, at the airport.All translation apps are flawed, but I like Google Translate for its free archive of conversations. iTranslate Voice is easiest for other people to read and SayHi seems to be the most accurate.To take a high-speed train, look for the station with a direction in the name, like Zhangye West or Jiayuguan South.

Keep your valuables away from the doorway. Whole meals, including corn on the cob are sold onboard, but most people bring their own food.

But if pie isn\u2019t your thing, this showstopper of a cake might be.This impressive cake is lighter than your typically dense pumpkin cake, so it\u2019s a fitting finale to a big meal, and it\u2019s gently spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and allspice so the pumpkin flavor everyone looks for on Thanksgiving still shines through. A smooth caramel Swiss buttercream blankets the top and sides. You could go for an elegant look, frosting the cake and drizzling caramel sauce over the top or decorate with swirls of buttercream for a homespun finish.Perhaps the best thing about this cake is that it tastes even better the day after it\u2019s made. That means you don\u2019t have to worry that it will take up precious oven space on Thanksgiving Day.Bake and assemble the cake the night before, and add the caramel drizzle (if you\u2019re using it) just before serving. It\u2019s a little over the top, which makes it a perfect end to a holiday meal. And if your crowd complains that it\u2019s not Thanksgiving without pie, ask someone to bring one. Who has just one dessert on Thanksgiving anyway?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Fallout Ruptures Democrats\u2019 Longtime Alliance With Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut those tensions burst into open warfare this past week after revelations that Facebook executives had withheld evidence of Russian activity on the platform for far longer than previously disclosed, while employing a Republican-linked opposition research firm to discredit critics and the billionaire George Soros, a major Democratic Party patron.Democrats now face a painful reckoning with longtime friends in the tech industry, relationships girded by mutual interest in issues like immigration and cemented with millions of dollars in campaign contributions.It reinforced criticism from the left \u2014 by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, among others \u2014 that Amazon, Facebook and Google are unaccountable monopolies, digital analogues to the railroad trusts of the Gilded Age.And it complicated life for tech\u2019s remaining allies in the party, such as Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a voracious fund-raiser and a tech booster whose relationship with Facebook goes back almost a decade.\u201cI think 2016 exposed the dark side of technology,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, a Bay Area Democrat. Widely considered friendly with the tech industry, Mr. Khanna criticized Facebook on Friday for its aggressive tactics, and said the company should \u201ccertainly fire the people who were in any way involved in the decision to peddle opposition research.\u201dThe clash intensified on Friday when four Democratic senators wrote to the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide more details about Facebook\u2019s lobbying activities. The lawmakers also raised a potentially more explosive issue: whether Facebook had ever used its own data and platform against critics.\u201cWe need to know if Facebook, or any entity affiliated with or hired by Facebook, ever used any of the vast financial and data resources available to them to retaliate against their critics, including elected officials who were scrutinizing them,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats who wrote the letter.\u201cAs more and more information comes out about how these guys operate, it\u2019s becoming conventional wisdom among Democrats that there is a serious policy problem here,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated.\u201cThese companies are not credible,\u201d Mr. Stoller added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s becoming clear to Democrats that they aren\u2019t friends \u2014 they are the problem.\u201dFacebook cut ties with the opposition research firm this past week even as executives there denied acting improperly.\u201dOur strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\u201d said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, in an interview with CBS on Friday. \u201cIt was not what I was doing, nor was it the company\u2019s strategy, to deflect, to deny or to hire P.R. firms to do things.\u201dBut Facebook and other tech companies now face increasing criticism from within their own ranks. In an interview, Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce and a major donor to Democratic causes, said his industry faced \u201ca tension between trust and growth.\u201d\u201cThese companies are going to have to recognize that they have to change,\u201d Mr. Benioff added. \u201cAnd the C.E.O.s have to change. And if they don\u2019t change, those C.E.O.s will be removed by boards and by shareholders.\u201dNo Democrat embodies the tensions between tech and Washington like Mr. Schumer himself. In 2011, he joined Ms. Sandberg to announce the opening of the company\u2019s first East Coast engineering office, in New York City, where he had worked to promote start-ups and other tech businesses.In 2015, Ms. Sandberg co-hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer in her Bay Area home, according to a Facebook employee briefed on the event. (The same trip featured a Schumer fund-raiser held by Bruce Sewell, then Apple\u2019s general counsel, and attended by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, according to an executive who declined to be named.).By the end of the 2016 cycle, Mr. Schumer had raised more money from Facebook employees than any other Washington lawmaker. All told, Senate Democrats have benefited from over $3 million in political contributions from Facebook\u2019s employees and founders over the years.Relations began to cool after the 2016 elections, when evidence mounted that Facebook and YouTube had become fertile ground for foreign interference and domestic misinformation, threatening not only the party\u2019s values but also its electoral prospects.Early last year, Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat, walked over to the Capitol to deliver a warning to Mr. Schumer, newly elected as Democratic minority leader.Mr. Tester\u2019s warning grabbed the attention of Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, who began to press Facebook and other social media companies to fix the problem.Disinformation was a particular focus for Mr. Schumer, according to an aide with knowledge of the senator\u2019s thinking. In March last year, Mr. Schumer summoned Adam Mosseri, then a vice president overseeing Facebook\u2019s News Feed feature, for a briefing on how the company would limit the spread of bogus news and propaganda. He later sent two aides to Silicon Valley to keep pressure on executives at Facebook, Google and Twitter.But as it became clear that the companies had understated their problems \u2014 and were moving slowly to fix them \u2014 the senator steered a middle course. When he and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, unveiled the party\u2019s \u201cBetter Deal\u201d platform for the midterm elections, a proposal to attack \u201ccorporate monopolies\u201d focused on airlines, beer companies and eyeglass makers.\u201cI am more sympathetic because I think they\u2019re in very difficult position and I worry about government regulation,\u201d he said.Mr. Warner\u2019s growing focus on privacy concerns led to a clash with Mr. Schumer, who confronted Mr. Warner in July, The Times reported this week, warning him to back off Facebook.Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that the senator \u201cworried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence Committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important for Facebook to recognize that this isn\u2019t a public relations problem \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Facebook previously signaled that it was ready to work with Mr. Warner and others in Congress on new regulation. Yet at the same time, Facebook turned to a conservative opposition research firm that sought to undermine detractors by publicizing financial links to Mr. Soros, a harsh critic of both Facebook and Google.\u201cTheir mantra has been, \u2018We\u2019re different, we\u2019re special, we\u2019re tech, all we do is good,\u2019\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees consumer protection and data security. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to find out, very graphically, that they do a lot of harm, and in fact they cover up the harm they do.\u201dHe added, \u201cTech is now like every other industry, in my view.\u201dJack Nicas and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It can be combined with meringue and turned into marshmallows. Or it can be put to use making a homemade version of Jell-O. (It\u2019s also used to make any number of savory aspics, but that is another story.)In parts of America where these molded creations abound, they\u2019re known as desserts or salads. Some come served on lettuce leaves, and have a sweet base that\u2019s sometimes tinted green and may suspend grated carrot, cucumber and radish. Others feature fruit salad and can be quite ornate, or humble and nostalgia-laden, made with fruit cocktail or crushed pineapple and mandarins, straight from a can.Tart clementine juice and juicy blood-red pomegranate seeds make an especially elegant version, a light, refreshing dessert that\u2019s perfect for the holidays. Seedless small clementines or satsumas are best, even if they are a little fiddly to juice. You could also use a combination of fresh orange, lime or lemon juice or substitute sparkling wine for part of the liquid.Bear in mind that gelatin is made by cooking animal bones to release their collagen, so vegetarians and vegans may instead want to use powdered agar, a type of seaweed. Those who can\u2019t eat pork should seek out beef-only kosher gelatin or versions made from fish skin.Once it\u2019s set, half the fun is in the unmolding.

{"Headline": "Missed Connection or Canceled Flight? 6 Tips for Getting What You Want From an Airline", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTips for using social media effectively when you are trying to resolve a travel disaster, from a canceled flight to a missed connection.Last month, when I was flying from New York to Dallas to report about how airlines use social media for customer care, I was having trouble with the online check-in for my Spirit flight. So I decided to conduct a quick experiment: I would call customer service and tweet at the same time, to see which got a faster response.The tweet read:I pushed \u201ctweet\u201d and then dialed the customer service number. As I was navigating the phone tree, I got this response from the Spirit Twitter account:\u201cHi Jonathan, please DM us your reservation info so we can figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201dI explained the issue in a direct message but didn\u2019t hear back immediately. A few minutes later, still on hold, I got through to a service member on the phone. I was about to tally a win for calling in, when the customer service representative said that I had already been checked in and an email had been sent to my inbox. Sure enough, the social team had already taken care of it.Here are some tips for leveraging social media to get faster service on your next trip.That\u2019s where airlines typically put most of their attention. It\u2019s also where you can expect the fastest response. To message an airline on Twitter, look up their \u201chandle\u201d (for example, Delta\u2019s is @Delta), and begin your message with it so that they can see your message. Remember, if you send a message this way, it\u2019s public.\u201cEscalating an issue into public social media, like on Twitter, can be an effective way to get attention,\u201d said Joshua March, the founder and chief officer of Conversocial, a social customer service provider. But it won\u2019t necessarily get you faster service.Typically, customer care agents will not ask you for personal information on a public forum, so in many cases, before they are really able to help you, they need to speak to you in a private channel. Options include Twitter\u2019s direct message, Facebook Messenger (which airline representatives say is increasing in popularity), WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, and text messages.\u201cIf you direct message us, we can immediately roll up our sleeves and get into the nitty-gritty, like seat assignments, flight numbers and personal information,\u201d said Lynn Stines, a social care representative at American Airlines.Venting at an airline or a passive-aggressive jab may feel good, but it won\u2019t get you to the front of the customer service line.\u201cWe still see several customers a day tweet something general and vague,\u201d said Laurie Meacham, the head of JetBlue\u2019s social media support team. \u201cWe almost always have to ask follow up questions to get to what they actually need.\u201d And have your information ready. That includes having your booking or reservation number, your flight number, and any personal information that representatives will need to look up your trip, including your frequent flier number, if you have oneSocial media team members are trained to spot influencers and those with large followings. It\u2019s important that they help these individuals quickly to prevent future headaches. Of course, you don\u2019t need a large following to get good service, but a social presence helps.\u201cRemember, we can also pop over and look at a user\u2019s history,\u201d Ms. Meacham said. She said they can easily spot the \u201cone off\u201d profiles or the \u201cbrand-new\u201d profiles that were created just to try to get in touch with airlines or brands.A developed profile, with a photo, a bio and a history of tweeting, goes a long way. And having a verified account probably wouldn\u2019t hurt eitherIf you\u2019re not on Twitter or Facebook, you can try getting in touch with customer service on the airline\u2019s mobile app, said Shashank Nigam, the chief executive officer of SimplyFling, an airline marketing firm. The better ones have internal messaging services that are staffed by social care teams. \u201cIt\u2019s also a great way to stay abreast of any flight notifications on the day of travel,\u201d he said.Really.It might not get you better service, \u201cbut it\u2019s so much easier to work with someone who is kind,\u201d said Annette Hernandez, a senior manager for social customer experience at American Airlines. \u201cThese are not bots you\u2019re dealing with.\u201dAlso, don\u2019t be surprised if you experience backlash from your rant by people who see your problem as petty or privileged. If you\u2019re being nasty online, you may get some heat yourself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finally, a Machine That Can Finish Your Sentence", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "Completing someone else\u2019s thought is not an easy trick for A.I. But new systems are starting to crack the code of natural language.Supported byOn stage, a woman takes a seat at the piano. SheFor you, that would be an easy question. But for a computer, it was pretty hard. While humans answered more than 88 percent of the test questions correctly, the lab\u2019s A.I. systems hovered around 60 percent. Among experts \u2014 those who know just how difficult it is to build systems that understand natural language \u2014 that was an impressive number.Bert\u2019s arrival punctuated a significant development in artificial intelligence. Over the last several months, researchers have shown that computer systems can learn the vagaries of language in general ways and then apply what they have learned to a variety of specific tasks.\u201cEach time we build new ways of doing something close to human level, it allows us to automate or augment human labor,\u201d said Jeremy Howard, the founder of Fast.ai, an independent lab based in San Francisco that is among those at the forefront of this research. \u201cThis can make life easier for a lawyer or a paralegal. But it can also help with medicine.\u201dBut there is a downside: On social media services like Twitter, this new research could also lead to more convincing bots designed to fool us into thinking they are human, Mr. Howard said.Each system learned a particular skill by analyzing all that text. OpenAI\u2019s technology learned to guess the next word in a sentence. Bert learned to guess missing words anywhere in a sentence. But in mastering these specific tasks, they also learned about how language is pieced together.If Bert can guess the missing words in millions of sentences (such as \u201cthe man walked into a store and bought a ____ of milk\u201d), it can also understand many of the fundamental relationships between words in the English language, said Jacob Devlin, the Google researcher who oversaw the creation of Bert. (Bert is short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.)The system can apply this knowledge to other tasks. If researchers provide Bert with a bunch of questions and their answers, it learns to answer other questions on its own. Then, if they feed it news headlines that describe the same event, it learns to recognize when two sentences are similar. Usually, machines can recognize only an exact match.Bert can handle the \u201ccommon sense\u201d test from the Allen Institute. It can also handle a reading comprehension test where it answers questions about encyclopedia articles. What is oxygen? What is precipitation? In another test, it can judge the sentiment of a movie review. Is the review positive or negative?This kind of technology is \u201ca step toward a lot of still-faraway goals in A.I., like technologies that can summarize and synthesize big, messy collections of information to help people make important decisions,\u201d said Sam Bowman, a professor at New York University who specializes in natural language research.Sebastian Ruder, a researcher based in Ireland who collaborates with Fast.ai, sees the arrival of systems like Bert as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for him and other A.I. researchers because they had assumed language technology had hit a ceiling. \u201cThere is so much untapped potential,\u201d he said.The ideas that drive Bert have been around for years, but they started to work because modern hardware could juggle much larger amounts of data, Mr. Devlin said.\u201cBert is a first thrust in that direction,\u201d said Jeff Dean, who oversees Google\u2019s artificial intelligence work. \u201cBut actually not all that big in terms of where we want to go.\u201d Mr. Dean believes that ever larger amounts of processing power will lead to machines that can better juggle natural language.But there is reason for skepticism that this technology can keep improving quickly because researchers tend to focus on the tasks they can make progress on and avoid the ones they can\u2019t, said Gary Marcus, a New York University psychology professor who has long questioned the effectiveness of neural networks. \u201cThese systems are still a really long way from truly understanding running prose,\u201d he said.Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, another prominent voice who has pushed for research that extends beyond neural networks, made the same point.Though Bert passed the lab\u2019s common-sense test, he said, machines are still a long way from an artificial version of a human\u2019s common sense. But like other researchers in this field, he believes the trajectory of natural language research has changed. This is a moment of \u201cexplosive progress,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 Standing alone, a few minutes before the doors were to open at the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Alexei Tikhonov gazed at Masha, a 30,000-year-old baby mammoth that he brought here from a Siberian riverbank thirty years ago.Masha, one of the museum\u2019s star attractions, rests with hundreds of other encased exhibits in one of the largest public collections of zoological specimens in the world. The cabinets, conceived in Frankfurt at the end of the 19th century, and the Czarist hunting trophies here exude an old-fashioned, even romantic air. But Dr. Tikhonov, director of the museum, is not too concerned.Sometimes he yearns for plasma panels and the modern gadgetry that many other museums use to inform visitors. But he has limited funds to modernize the museum, and prefers to spend that money buying new collections and supporting scientific fieldwork.The museum, like other great natural history museums, is \u201ca time capsule for organisms,\u201d said Ross MacPhee, curator of mammals at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\u201cFor certain kinds of studies, such as species endangerment and the loss of genetic diversity, this is turning out to be increasingly important,\u201d he added. \u201cNatural history museums are literally the only places where you will find good quality remains.\u201dWhen researchers at Penn State began searching for genetic information on the scarce population of California condors in the United States \u2014 currently there are less than 500 birds \u2014 the university reached out to St. Petersburg for help. A few months later, a feather from each bird was dispatched to university scientists for study.To ascertain the fate of the slender billed curlew, for example, ornithologists analyzed DNA clues found in the skin and intestines of museum specimens to pinpoint the species\u2019 traditional habitats, helping to guide the search for remaining birds.\u201cAs species come under threat,\u201d Dr. Tikhonov said, \u201cwe hope that in the future, due to these genetic efforts and new methods, it will be possible to restore these species.\u201dDr. Tikhonov, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on mammoths, is quick to point out the complications.\u201cWe cannot, for the moment, reconstruct a mammoth without making hundreds or thousands of mistakes,\u201d he said.For one thing, ancient DNA is heavily fragmented, noted Dr. Daniel C. Fisher, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Museum of Paleontology. \u201cFor these and other reasons, the whole notion of simply recovering ancient DNA and plugging it into living cells to generate zygotes is profoundly impractical,\u201d he said.The creation of hybrid mammoths is not only a technical issue. Where would these giant mammals live in a modern world, save perhaps the Siberian tundra? How would they affect existing ecosystems?Back in the halls of the museum, Dr. Tikhonov soon found himself happily swamped by schoolchildren. \u201cThe first role of the museum is educational,\u201d he shouted over the heads of the crowd.The Zoological Museum has 300,000 visitors per year, and he was expecting as many as 7,000 visitors that day. By early afternoon, the guides were already exhausted, but one of them, Polina Kenunnen, managed a smile when asked to take yet another group of young children for a tour.\u201cOn the internet, there is often silliness,\u201d she said while marching up the stairs toward the skeleton of a blue whale and the bust of Charles Darwin. \u201cBut here we can really show and tell things as they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seafood From Two Tapas Masters at Saint Julivert Fisherie", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Alex Raij and Eder Montero met while working in the kitchen of a sprawling, impersonal, gloomy modern-Spanish restaurant that lasted about two years. They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business.There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino\u2019s very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It\u2019s a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in \u201cCasino Royale.\u201d)Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich.There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideu\u00e0, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities.Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple\u2019s restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there\u2019s a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing \u2014 even when Saint Julivert does them better.The saut\u00e9ed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I\u2019ll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course.Even if you\u2019re an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you\u2019ve actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn\u2019t stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy.When there\u2019s an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn\u2019t always take it. I understand why I can\u2019t have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn\u2019t there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread.None of Saint Julivert\u2019s issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won\u2019t see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you\u2019re hungry.The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that\u2019s worth doing even if you\u2019re not hungry.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTablePete Wells is the restaurant critic at The Times.

{"Headline": "The Tax Cut and the Balance of Payments (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLots of financial maneuvering, signifying nothingOpinion ColumnistNow that Democrats have taken the House, it seems likely that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will turn out to have been the only major piece of legislation enacted under Donald Trump. There might conceivably be an infrastructure bill, but don\u2019t get your hopes up: Trump\u2019s people seem dead set against straightforward public spending, i.e., just building the damn infrastructure, and Democrats probably won\u2019t agree to privatization disguised as public investment.Now, the TCJA played almost no role in the midterms: Republicans dropped it as a selling point, focusing on fear of brown people instead, while Democrats hammered health care. But now that the election is past, it seems like a good idea to revisit the bill and its effects. What I want to focus on in this piece is the effects on the balance of payments.Why the balance of payments? Because the theory of the case - the not-necessarily-stupid rationale for the corporate tax cuts at the heart of the bill - depended crucially on claims about what tax cuts would do to international movements of capital. So one important piece of any attempt to assess the results so far involves looking at the balance of payments changes since the lower tax rate went into effect.And looking at those changes in the balance of payments also offers a good way to debunk some of the fallacies that all too often creep in when we discuss these issues. So let\u2019s dive in, beginning with a recap of how the TCJA\u2019s supporters claimed it would work.What tax cuts were supposed to doThe claim by tax cut advocates was, however, that the tax cut would be passed through to workers, because we live in an integrated global capital market. There were multiple reasons not to believe this argument in practice, but it\u2019s still worth working through its implications.What tax-cut advocates argued was that the rate of return in the U.S., net of taxes, is set by global forces. Suppose that there is a global rate of return r*; then the U.S. will have to offer r*/(1-t), where t is the corporate tax rate.Now imagine cutting t; the figure shows a complete elimination of corporate taxes, but the logic is the same for simply reducing the rate. This should lead to inflows of capital from abroad, increasing the capital stock, which both raises GDP and reduces the rate of return. In the end the after-tax return on capital should be back where it started, with all of the tax cut passed through to wages instead.The crucial point, however, is that for this to happen you have to have a large increase in the physical stock of capital - it\u2019s not an immaculate financial transaction. This in turn means that those inflows of capital have to enable a massive wave of real investment in plant and equipment. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean directly importing machinery; it could mean importing consumer goods or exporting less stuff of our own, either way freeing up resources for producing capital goods here at home. But the logic of the pro-tax cut case depends on the cut facilitating a period of large trade deficits. (I don\u2019t think anyone told Trump about this.)This is not, however, the way most reporting on the issue has framed it. Instead, reports have mostly focused on corporations moving funds home from their overseas subsidiaries, and asked what they are doing with that money. That\u2019s not exactly wrong, but \u201cmoving money home\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what people think it means, and is very loosely connected to the important economic issue here.On \u201cmoving money home\u201dU.S. corporations have large assets overseas. Some of these assets reflect past investments made for fundamental business reasons - e.g., auto plants built to serve foreign markets. But a lot of those overseas assets reflect tax avoidance strategies.But what did these big numbers correspond to in reality? Quite possibly nothing.Imagine a U.S. company whose overseas subsidiary has $1 billion in a London bank account. Following the enactment of the tax cut, it decides to transfer that $1 billion back to the parent company - but the parent keeps the money where it is. In that case the balance of payments statistics show a big drop in net direct investment abroad, because the parent firm is reducing its apparent stake in the subsidiary. But the reality is that the company still owns that same $1 billion in London - it has just shifted from owning it indirectly via the subsidiary to holding it directly. It\u2019s just accounting, with no real-world effect.Of course, the company could choose not to keep that $1 billion in a London bank; it might do something else with it, such as buy shares back from its stockholders. But what happens to the money then? The shareholders might themselves buy assets overseas; even if they buy stock here, whoever sells them the stock might invest the proceeds abroad.In other words, looking at corporate financial maneuvering after the tax cut doesn\u2019t really tell us anything about whether the cut is, in fact, attracting global capital into the United States. To make that assessment, we need to look at net sales of assets to foreigners by the U.S. as a whole - or, equivalently, at our net sales of goods and services, because the balance of payments always balances: the trade balance is by definition the inverse of the net capital inflow.What actually happened to capital inflows?If we\u2019re trying to assess the possible effects of the TCJA on the U.S. ability to invest, we need to know how much, if at all, it promoted true inflows of capital - resources made available to the United States that let us invest more than we ourselves are saving. These inflows can be measured two different ways. One is to look directly at the international financial account: asset transactions with foreigners, where selling assets is an inflow and buying assets an outflow. The other is to look indirectly at the difference between sales and purchases of goods and services, because the trade balance broadly defined (including investment income) - aka the balance on current account - is the flip side of capital inflows.In principle these two methods should give the same result. In practice there is sometimes a significant \u201cstatistical discrepancy,\u201d probably because some financial transactions don\u2019t end up being properly reported. This is less of an issue for goods and services, although some of the same strategies used for tax avoidance can distort this balance too. Anyway, I\u2019ve prepared a little chart showing quarterly measures of capital inflow since 2016, by both methods (Figure 3.)There are big statistical discrepancies in a few quarters. As I like to say, in the fourth quarter of 2017 America was a big exporter of errors and omissions. But overall the data tell a consistent story about what has happened to capital inflows since the tax cut went into effect, which is \u2026 nothing much. That elaborate financial dance between corporations and their subsidiaries seems, in fact, to be an accounting maneuver with little real-world relevance. The international consequences of the tax cut appear to be minimal.And that\u2019s a big deal, because promoting capital inflows was at the heart of the halfway reasonable argument for the tax cut. So far, that argument appears to be not totally stupid, but also, as it happens, quite wrong.The big giveawayOn its face, a corporate tax cut looks like a big giveaway to stockholders. Proponents of the TCJA claimed that this was misleading, because large capital inflows would ensure that the cut went to workers instead. But there\u2019s no sign of those big inflows, so what looks like a big giveaway to stockholders is, in fact, a big giveaway to stockholders.And about 35 percent of that giveaway is to foreigners, so the tax cut makes America as a whole poorer.Can we see this in the data? Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to extract this signal from the noise. If corporations returned all of the tax cut to stockholders via increased dividends, you might be able to see it in increased payments of investment income to foreigners. But much of it was used for stock buybacks, which won\u2019t show up in the same way.True, stock buybacks should raise the price of the stocks remaining, and you could try to allocate 35 percent of this capital gain to foreigners. When Trump boasts about rising stocks, or laments declines that he blames on Democrats, remember: higher stock prices actually make America poorer, because they don\u2019t add anything to our real wealth while increasing foreign claims on the nation as a whole.But stocks fluctuate so much, for so many reasons (or no reason at all), that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive to try and guess how much of that fluctuation is due to the tax cut. Better to focus on the fundamentals: corporate taxes have been cut by around $100 billion a year, so that\u2019s around $35 billion going to foreigners.OK, that concludes my wonkiness here. The moral of this story is that the tax cut seems to have produced some biggish financial activity on the part of corporations, but it\u2019s all basically accounting maneuvers signifying nothing. A balance of payments perspective, like other perspectives, points to a tax cut that, surprise, cut taxes on corporations, but had few real consequences for the economy.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places TravelerRising out of the mist and pine trees on South Korea\u2019s mountainous eastern coast was a serpent. Or at least it looked that way, as I awoke, groggy, and peered out my hotel window at a colossal undulation of orange, purple and teal stripes snaking through the forest canopy. Two blinks later, the shapes and colors morphed into what they actually were: the twisty, tubular slides of a waterpark.The Games brought a new high-speed KTX train and gleaming white hotel towers with infinity pools overlooking the ocean (see: Golden Tulip Skybay and the Richard Meier-designed Seamarq). Those mountains, though, loom largest, keeping the new Gangwon in harmony with the old.But on my last stop, in the city of Sokcho, just south of the Demilitarized Zone, I was on my own \u2014 and possessed with the Korean language skills of a mime.\u201cGo straight, walk five minutes,\u201d the hotel clerk told me when I asked how to find the jjimjilbang entrance. I did as told and got lost on a dirt path next to a stream lined with trees whose vivid yellow and red leaves were still clinging to their branches, just barely. There were tasteful bronze sculptures of naked women here and there, and a path around a placid lake built for contemplative strolls. I passed young families pushing strollers and old men meditating on stone steps built into a hillside. And then there was the child on a bicycle playing a video game at full volume, just as nature intended.When I finally got inside, those twisty slides were closed for the season but there was still a wave pool and rivers of warm water and tiers of hot springs. Inside, men and women filed into separate facilities, which involved stripping naked, soaking in a really hot bath, jumping into a cold one, and repeating. It's a sensation everyone should try at least once.Later, I walked onto a pavilion over the lake and had to laugh. I was standing under a mock temple roof, looking across a body of water to the mountains, with a grove of red Korean pine trees to the right and that glorious gaudy waterpark on the left. It was a scene so perfectly Gangwon it could have been a scroll painting.I hadn\u2019t taken a two-hour night bus to Sokcho from Gangneung to see a hotel waterpark, though. My personal must-do of the trip was to hike in Seoraksan National Park, home to the region\u2019s highest mountain, and legendary fall foliage. I\u2019d missed peak leaf peeping by a week or two, but there were still a few trees that looked like they\u2019d been dipped in red and yellow Kool-Aid.At the top of the park\u2019s cable car was a 20-minute climb to a rock face known as Gwongeumseong Fortress, the highest peak in the park and bare, with the exception of an occasional pine, bent over from the wind. I saw a woman hiking in heels, and a couple in matching red, black, and white, Mickey-Mouse-themed outfits. The only safety barriers between selfie-takers and precipitous cliffs were little four-inch signs featuring a tumbling purple cartoon bear and the words \u201cdrop\u201d or \u201cfall.\u201dBack at the cable car, I spotted a sign reading, \u201cAallack Temple,\u201d with an arrow pointing down a steep set of stairs no one else seemed to be taking. Metal gave way to slabs of stone laid flat between tree roots. Instead of a railing there were thick ropes attached to poles, and with so much slack and weight from recent rain I had to bend down to grab them. The sensation was less like walking on stairs than rappelling, sliding the rope through my hands and hoping that it would catch me if I fell the rest of the way, which seemed possible.After many more stairs than I\u2019d anticipated, I reached the temple, a single structure overlooking a valley. The steps continued to a dead end. Just as I was taking my final photos and heading back, a bald man in gray robes with a big smile poked his head out of the door.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d the monk asked, in hesitant English.\u201cU.S.A.\u201d I told him. He nodded vigorously and invited me inside. There, in front of a gold Buddha, under a ceiling alight with lanterns shaped like lotus flowers, I told him my name and he told me his, Jee-Woon, and we\u2019d pretty much exhausted our language skills.He offered me tea he\u2019d been warming on a wooden stove, and this time I pulled out my phone to try Google Translate, which seemed to be a new thing for him. He spoke into the microphone and told me that he\u2019d made the tea, which was delicious and earthy, out of five medicinal ingredients that were supposed to be good for health, like jujube and licorice.Was he alone, or \u201chonja\u201d in Korean? I asked.He was.I was honja, too. We smiled and sipped our tea.I told him I was grateful he\u2019d shown me his beautiful temple.As I walked out the door, he crouched down to make sure I got my shoes on. \u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d he said, again and again; I think it was the last English phrase he knew.\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d I said back. And really wished I could.Jean\u2019s last, most stringent directive had been to eat. Eat well, eat often, and when out in the country, get to restaurants well before 8 o\u2019clock at night if you want to eat at all. Both she and Hahna told me that Koreans in Seoul consider the food so much better in Gangwon they make special trips for it \u2014 while foreigners make trips around the world to eat in Seoul. Hahna taught me to tell the chef, \u201cJal meogeosseumnida,\u201d or \u201cI ate well.\u201dPrevious dispatches:Next dispatch: Gansu, ChinaAdvertisement"}

Same goes for the big group text message and that one relative who floods our phones with multiple consecutive texts to convey a single thought. (You know who you are.)And here we thought technology was supposed to make our lives more efficient. Fret not. I share your pain and so tested various tools to help people get together and stay connected this holiday. Here were the best ones.Let\u2019s start with the most frustrating situation: getting a big group of people to agree on when and where to meet. There are plenty of approaches, like sharing calendars or sending lots of emails, but the simplest solution I\u2019ve found is creating a poll.After you make your selections, you punch in your name and get a web link that people can click on to view the options, cast their votes and type in their name. From there, you can choose the time slot that got the most votes, close the poll and then communicate the plan to the group. I\u2019ve used this tool for groups big and small, and it spares me dozens of notifications and messages before meeting up.When it comes to staying in touch or catching up over the holidays, using a group text message is fine if everyone is using an iPhone. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s default texting service, iMessage, gives you the option to leave the conversation when it becomes too distracting. But if there are Android users among the group, the chat bubbles turn from blue to green, meaning that the messages are being sent as traditional text messages. Unfortunately, with traditional texting you can\u2019t exit a group chat, and the only option is to turn off alerts for the entire conversation.Then there\u2019s the annual exchange of photos during the holidays. You could just send a dozen photos of your trip to Europe or your newborn in a group text message, but that would burn through everyone\u2019s cellular data plans and make you unpopular.These methods aren't completely hassle-free, of course. Some of them require goading less tech-savvy friends and relatives into trying new tools. But once they are persuaded, your holiday gatherings will be less vexing to create, organize and reminisce about for years to come.Advertisement"}

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained the rationale with an analogy: \u201cIf you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier \u2014 and she says or he says, \u2018How many units do you have in there?\u2019 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what\u2019s in the cart.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, said Apple was trying to shift investors\u2019 attention away from the number of devices it sold. \u201cCompanies always try to put their best foot forward,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir best foot doesn\u2019t appear to be iPhone unit growth.\u201dAnother wildly profitable quarter for Apple showed its business has mostly avoided the turbulence that has roiled its Silicon Valley peers. Facebook, Google and Twitter have faced questions about their influence in the spread of disinformation and the proliferation of hate speech.Apple has tried to separate itself from other tech giants by trumpeting that it values its customers\u2019 privacy and hires people to curate its services rather than relying on computer algorithms. The company responded to criticism about the addictive nature of its smartphones by adding tools for people to track their time spent on them.Last month, Apple released its most expensive iPhone ever, the XS Max, which starts at $1,100. On Tuesday, it raised the starting price of its iPad Pro to $800 from $650 and of its MacBook Air to $1,200 from $1,000, while also making the devices faster and more powerful.Apple\u2019s strategy has worked for more than iPhones. Apple said that it sold 5.3 million Mac computers in the quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago, but that its revenues from Mac sales rose 3 percent to a record $7.4 billion. That was because customers paid nearly $1,400 on average for a Mac, up 5 percent from a year earlier.Apple\u2019s overall revenue increased nearly 20 percent in the quarter to $62.9 billion.Apple\u2019s other bet to maintain growth is its services business, which includes its cut of app sales and revenue from its own apps, like Apple Music, among other things. Services revenue rose 17 percent to nearly $10 billion in the quarter.Some analysts were concerned about Apple\u2019s prospects in China, where sales fell sharply several years ago. But revenues in the quarter there rose 16 percent from a year earlier.Apple\u2019s share price was down more than 6 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, likely because of its plans to stop reporting unit sales and because its revenue guidance for the current quarter was \u201clighter than expectations,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On \u2018Bureka Tuesdays,\u2019 They Make Pastries the Way Their Grandmothers Did", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMembers of a synagogue in Atlanta come together to make the savory pocket pastries to sell at Hanukkah, as they have for decades. \u201cBurekas were a piece of home that these immigrants brought with them,\u201d said Adam Kofinas, the synagogue\u2019s executive director. \u201cEven today with all our technology, this is a link to our heritage. Machines could make the pastries quicker, but nothing matches handmade.\u201dThe word \u201cbureka\u201d is the Hebrew and Ladino term for \u201cborek\u201d or \u201cburek,\u201d as the pastries are known in Turkey and the Balkans. The pastries come in many different forms today, made with buttered layers of phyllo dough, laminated doughs like puff pastry, or with an oil-based dough, as it\u2019s done in this community. On a recent Tuesday, Renee Galanti Feldman, 84, took a heaping teaspoon of filling and put it in the middle of a flat piece of dough. She moved her thumb and index finger to seal the bureka and then crimp the edges. \u201cThe old ladies would tell us how to make the burekas uniform,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we are the old ladies, and we have a reputation and our heritage to protect and perpetuate.\u201dBetween the bazaar and special bureka orders, the synagogue made more than $50,000 in net proceeds in 2017. (Money is also raised from sales of \u201cThe Sephardic Cooks,\u201d a spiral-bound cookbook first printed in 1971 that includes all the recipes made at the bazaar. The book sells for $15.)\u201cComing every Tuesday is a commitment, but you get so much,\u201d said Shelley Soriano Cooper, 61, as she rolled out her grandmother\u2019s dough for biscochos. \u201cWe talk to the elders, we keep the traditions alive and we speak Ladino.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about the people, it\u2019s about the cohesiveness of the community coming together. It\u2019s not about your or my burekas,\u201d said Elise Meyer, the president of the sisterhood at the synagogue. \u201cThis year we made so many burekas we had to use the synagogue\u2019s freezer and a caterer\u2019s commercial freezer to store them all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, Apple and Facebook Once Led the Market. Now They Are Driving It Down.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs concerns about growth and privacy issues took a toll, technology and banking stocks led a slide in Europe, and futures indicated that markets in the United States could follow.The mighty tech titans and their seemingly endless pipeline of profits, which powered one of the longest bull markets in stocks, are looking a little less invincible. Shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a slowdown underway globally,\u201d said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can\u2019t hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too.\u201dThe potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high. \u201cThis is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we\u2019ve basically been seeing since the end of September,\u201d said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds. When the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries. Not anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market\u2019s decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally. Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat. Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors. Since Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors. But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. An earlier version of this article misstated which company Alphabet is the parent company of. It is Google, not Apple.Advertisement"}

They talked timepieces, quizzed one another on Patek esoterica and traded tips on how to locate rare watches. The girlfriends who were along (none of whom are watch collectors) donned bikinis and sat on beach towels, chatting, before the buffet lunch.Mr. Kawamura rolled up the sleeves of his white linen shirt to display his blue-faced Ref. 5270G Perpetual Calendar Chronograph on his left wrist. Released in 2011, its dial was packed by Patek with the day and month at 12 o\u2019clock, a 30-minute counter at 3, a moon phase date at 6, and a seconds indicator at 9.It is one of the 30 to 40 watches in Mr. Kawamura\u2019s collection, which includes a number of Pateks, but also Rolex, Piaget, Hublot, Omega and Breitling \u2014 some of which he bought and others that were passed on by his father. \u201cCollecting is a huge part of my life,\u201d he said, estimating the value of his watches at more than 1 million Singapore dollars ($725,210).To show his friends, Mr. Kawamura had brought along a Patek 5170G-001 18-Karat White Gold Chronograph with Breguet numerals and a black dial, co-branded with Tiffany & Co. \u201cFor young collectors, buying is easier now,\u201d Mr. Kawamura said, recalling that when he first started collecting at age 14, he had to pore over glossy catalogs. \u201cNow it\u2019s all available on the web. You see a watch on Instagram and, boom, there\u2019s the price and its whole story \u2014 everything in a single click.\u201dHe also had his Patek Ref. 130 Chronograph in steel, the vintage 1939 timepiece that he bought two years ago in a Christie\u2019s auction, one of his most valuable pieces. It came with the original import stamp from Portuguese customs and an original band, all of which he keeps in his safe. \u201cThe Instagram response has been very positive,\u201d he said, referring to the comments he has received on posted photos of the watch.During the cruise, some of the men chided the other #PatekAcademy founder, Andy Zhang, for getting tiny scratches on his watches \u2014 he wears six in rotation \u2014 while cooking and playing with his two toddlers. A Shanghai native who lives mostly in Sydney, Mr. Zhang works in his family\u2019s property business, based in the Philippines, and in his own fashion boutiques.\u201cThey prefer selling to clients they know, to protect the brand,\u201d he added, pointing at what he calls his \u201cmilestone\u201d watch: Patek\u2019s 40th Anniversary Nautilus Chronograph, Ref. 5976/1G. He bought the white gold timepiece last year after meeting a senior Patek executive at a private dinner. \u201cHe called Geneva that day for me,\u201d Mr. Zhang recalled. \u201cIt was the last piece available.\u201dAmong those regulars is Austen Chu De Krassel, known as Chu, who flew in for the #PatekAcademy event.At 22, Mr. Chu has more than 80,700 followers on his personal Instagram account, @horoloupe, where he posts daily. Mr. Chu said watch brands had offered to pay him as much as $3,000 a post \u2014 but he never accepted the offers: \u201cI would have to post brand products I don\u2019t like; the stuff that doesn\u2019t sell.\u201dAfter the boat docked, the group went on to drinks at the Patek Philippe boutique in the upmarket Ion Orchard mall, hosted by Cortina Watch, Patek\u2019s retail partner in Singapore.While sipping Champagne and eating beef cheek, Mr. Kawamura showed off his new Patek purchase, which he picked up at the event: the sought-after Ref. 5131/1P-001 World Time. The cloisonn\u00e9 enamel dial (39.5mm wide) has a colorful Earth map \u2014 the North Pole at its center \u2014 surrounded by a day/night indicator and a 24-hour ring with 24 cities to represent the world\u2019s main time zones. The rice-bead link bracelet is available only in platinum.Released last year at the Baselworld trade fair, the 5131/1P was the first one that Cortina Watch had managed to get for the Singapore store, according to Andy Thong, the boutique\u2019s customer relations consultant. The price was 171,700 Singapore dollars.Select customers can order such prized watches \u2014 Mr. Zhang said he would pick up his 5131/1P later this month in Sydney \u2014 but Instagram sites have proven to be a problem for dealers. \u201cMost Instagram pictures are of the old collections and demand for these is crazy,\u201d Mr. Thong said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have them to sell; they are asking for what we can\u2019t get.\u201dMr. Kawamura hopes to ride what he thinks will be a potential wave of millennial demand by opening his own vintage and rare finds shop. And in preparation, he is considering two watchmaking courses in Switzerland next year.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople our age are getting exposed to collecting through social media.

Gwyneth Paltrow rushes to catch a train in London after being fired from her job. In one universe, she makes the train and gets home early and finds her man in bed with another woman. In the other, she misses it, comes home to her boyfriend alone, and stays with him to her own detriment and despair.The big \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if I didn\u2019t go to a magazine party in the fall of 1986, with my agent? What if I had not just partaken of the free wine and cheese and instead hobnobbed and made connections like I was supposed to? What if I hadn\u2019t tried to leave early so I could go dancing with my high school friends?If none of those things had happened, my agent wouldn\u2019t have said to me, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave without talking to at least one person you don\u2019t know,\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t have said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll talk to the bartender. He\u2019s cute.\u201dAnd I wouldn\u2019t have ended up five years later marrying said bartender.That was 31 years ago. My husband is still cute, but he is forever cutting it too close when we need to be somewhere, which sometimes makes him less cute in my eyes. I was thinking about all of this as I was waiting for him at the clock at Grand Central Terminal a few months ago. We were heading to a fund-raiser at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.I used to meet people at that clock while I was growing up. The Grand Central of my youth was nothing like the Grand Central of now, which is bright and gleaming, full of good restaurants and bars and shops. My Grand Central was filthy, dangerous, home to pickpockets and thieves and drug addicts.My junior high school was two blocks away, on the 40th floor of an office building. When classes were over, my best friend, Melissa, and I would run around Grand Central buying greeting cards, getting free samples of coconut patties at a little chocolate shop, skirting perverts.I loved Melissa then, and I love her now. She\u2019s like a sister to me. What would have happened if one of us had messed up the bubbles on the entrance exam to Hunter College High School? Where would I be now without her?I looked at my iPhone and texted my husband: \u201cWhere are you?\u201dNo answer.Bored, I walked around the clock, which is also an octagonal information center. Was my husband oblivious enough to be standing on the other side? I used to stand on that side in high school, waiting for my boyfriend to come down from Inwood. We were both so skinny back then that when we hugged, our hipbones would grind.We went out for a long time before he finally dumped me during my sophomore year of college. Waiting for my husband, I started to get that buzzy feeling I sometimes get when I\u2019m traveling, as if maybe I was going to bump into somebody I used to know.Could it be that old boyfriend? I doubted it. He lives in Florida, and someone recently told me he has six grandchildren.We went to high school in the Bronx. When I was young, we used to go to the New York Botanical Garden on field trips, which back then seemed like a jaunt to the country. One of my close friends was raped there one afternoon after class let out.Would that have happened if any of her classmates had stuck around, too? Or made her come to the doughnut shop? I thought a lot about this back then, the missed opportunity to save her. And I think about it now, how terrible it was and how angry I still am that someone did that to her.Back in high school, I thought about a lot of things, but not about one day taking the train to a fancy fund-raiser. I wrote poetry (that I never showed anyone) but never dreamed I would grow up to be a writer. When I was 17, I thought it was possible I would marry my high school boyfriend.I looked at my phone. My husband had texted: \u201cI\u2019m running late. Had to take a call. If I don\u2019t make the 5:40 u can go without me.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d I replied. But I was angry.When our children were small and I had vague ideas about the importance of family dinner, he would call and say, \u201cI\u2019m leaving work now.\u201d And then he wouldn\u2019t arrive for hours.As I started walking toward the track, I thought maybe if I hadn\u2019t gone up to him that night at the party so many years ago, I would be married to a man who not only was on time for this train but also had already bought the tickets. I started to stew. I thought about his younger sister\u2019s wedding 25 years earlier, when he came back from his run sweaty just as we, all dressed up, were leaving for the church.As I boarded the train, I checked my phone again. A text from him: \u201cI\u2019m on the shuttle from Times Square. If I make it, I\u2019ll go straight to train and try to find u.\u201d\u201cKK,\u201d I wrote. \u201cJust get on we\u2019ll find each other when we get off.\u201dBut I thought: \u201cHe\u2019s going to miss it.\u201dI sat back in my seat, wondering who would be at the party. Would the mystery person I felt destined to run into be someone I didn\u2019t expect to see that night?And then I wondered what would have happened if I had taken that West Coast fellowship I had applied for before I met my future husband but was promised to me after I fell in love with him.By that time, I was too happy where I was, in New York City, with him, temping and being a fledgling writer. Still, maybe if I had taken that fellowship I would be living in San Francisco now, having a picnic lunch down at the beach, watching whales spout and drinking local white wine straight from the half bottle.The doors on the train closed. I gazed at some guy sitting several rows away, facing me: graying, kind of cute, the right age. What would have happened if I had married this guy? Would I have a house and a dog and live in Larchmont?I took out my phone. The train was moving. I was going to text my husband and let him off the hook, tell him to turn around and go home. He was just sweetly keeping me company anyway.But he had already written: \u201cMade it! What car you on?\u201dI meant: How like him to make it by the skin of his teeth. As he had at his sister\u2019s wedding. Then I remembered walking down the aisle holding the hand of my little niece, because her mother was maid of honor, my little niece who is now all grown up and engaged to be married herself. I remembered turning, before I sat down with her in the front pew, to look toward the church doors to see if my husband had finally arrived.He is the oldest of four. Their father was dead, and my husband was supposed to escort his sister down the aisle. I felt such relief when I saw the two of them emerge from the doorway, my sister-in-law gorgeous in her gown and my husband a little geeky in his tuxedo, his hair still wet from his shower.Then I looked up to see what car I was in, as my husband had asked me to, so I could write and tell him, and there was my very own husband sitting directly across the aisle from me. He was staring at his phone, waiting for my response. He didn\u2019t even know I was there.And he looked so handsome! Uncharacteristically wearing a jacket and tie, because we were going to a fancy party, anticipation on his face.I took a moment to savor it, his silver, close-cropped hair, the eagerness of his expression as he waited for my text \u2014 the triumph of once again making it just in time!And I realized: This is the person I was destined to run into today, and also 31 years ago, and again and again, in this multiverse and hopefully all the others.\u201cI\u2019m right next to you,\u201d I typed.Startled, then smiling, he looked up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In California, One Community Reflects on a Fire as Others Still Burn", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOJAI, Calif. \u2014 There is the original commencement address that Aldous Huxley gave in 1951, saved from a burning boarding school in Ojai. There is a tattered and singed American flag, too. And on wall after wall of the Ojai museum are photographs of fire and destruction.It was only a year ago that a wildfire set a ring of flames around this rustic city northwest of Los Angeles. But the fire is already part of a retrospective exhibition that tries to make sense of the tragedy, even as homes remain destroyed and the trauma remains fresh.So it is in California that as one community, Paradise, is only starting to comprehend its losses in what is now the deadliest and most destructive fire in state history, another community, Ojai, a bohemian idyll in a valley not far from the Pacific Ocean, is coming together to remember its last big wildfire \u2014 and to worry about when the next one might come.\u201cWhen we started talking about this exhibit earlier this year, I don\u2019t think it occurred to us \u2014 we didn\u2019t even think about it \u2014 that it would be fire season,\u201d said Wendy Barker, the director of the Ojai Valley Museum. She added that she felt uneasy about opening the show at a time when the state, yet again, is on fire: in the north, in Paradise, and in the south, with the Woolsey Fire, near Malibu and parts of Ventura County, not too far from Ojai.But this is California, where these days fires seem to be raging all the time.Ms. Barker, whose exhibition included the maps of fires that burned near Ojai throughout its history \u2014 in 1929, 1932 (for decades the largest in state history), 1948, 1979 and 1985 \u2014 said that in the past, after a fire, residents would at least have the respite of believing they would have many years before the next one.\u201cBut do we?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s scary. These aren\u2019t isolated incidents anymore.\u201d\u201cWe do seem to be at a tipping point,\u201d said Professor Pyne, adding that there needs to be new thinking on zoning and where homes are built, as well as on how to manage forests in the face of growing danger. \u201cIf last year didn\u2019t do it, if that didn\u2019t lead to a massive and immediate response than what would? Well, this, within a year of the fires of 2017, and this one that has destroyed so much. This is shaping up to be a major moment on the timeline.\u201dEdward Struzik, a historian and a fellow at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Canada, noted that most of the largest fires in California history had occurred in recent years. In fact, nine of the 10 largest have occurred since 2003.\u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about it. We\u2019re seeing a trend here very clearly. Nobody expected it to happen as quickly as it happened. This is a head-spinning trajectory, these past few years in California.\u201dHeather and Bob Sanders, who have lived in Ojai since 1976, are among those who lost their home in Upper Ojai in the Thomas Fire, where about 100 houses burned to the ground. These days they are living on their property in a trailer, with hopes of rebuilding. Others are doing the same, or living elsewhere in mobile homes as they wait to rebuild.Describing the process of rebuilding, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a stack of papers.\u201d Just the other day, a geological survey of his property was finally finished, which will now allow him to apply for a building permit to rebuild.Her publishing partner, Deva Temple, who grew up in Ojai but now lives in Oregon, was drawn to the photographs that emerged from the fire.Ms. Temple, who has organized conferences on climate change, which scientists say has led to prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures, dry conditions and ever-larger fires, said: \u201cI knew this wasn\u2019t going to be the last huge fire, but one of the first of the huge fires. The whole landscape of the west is going to change.\u201dMs. Sanders, speaking about losing her home, says in the book: \u201cBut life goes on and now we\u2019re dealing with it, though there are just too many things to do. And I don\u2019t think a lot of people know what so many of us are still dealing with from this fire. We\u2019re still figuring out how to rebuild.\u201dOthers who lost homes in Ojai decided to pack up and start again somewhere else, where housing is cheaper and where wildfires are not a danger.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to go through that again,\u201d said Lauren Crow, 32, who moved to Portland, Ore., with her partner after losing her hand-built tiny house \u2014 and her start-up skin care business \u2014 in the Thomas Fire.An interactive map, updated every six hours, shows where the smoke, and health risk, is most intense.The destruction in Paradise is likely to reverberate around California, as people in other places wonder if their town could be next.\u201cIt\u2019s not like people are buying McMansions in a rural spot,\u201d said William Stewart, an expert on forestry at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThese are places where people have been since the Gold Rush in some places, or at least for many decades. We\u2019re now having these historical towns where people are starting to look around, and think: \u2018We\u2019re not that different from Paradise.

{"Headline": "Five Takeaways From Our New China Project", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did China do it?How did the land once commonly \u2014 and with some disdain \u2014 known in the West as Communist China come to lead the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires?How did a once-cloistered nation with a flailing economy drive extreme poverty down to less than 1 percent? How did it achieve social economic mobility unrivaled by much of the world?And perhaps most of all, how did a country that rejected all of the conventional wisdom Western economists had to offer arrive at a moment when it is on track to surpass the American economy and become the world\u2019s largest?When The Times launched China Rules, the series that began last Sunday, these were the questions we asked our reporters to try to answer. The last four articles in the series will appear this Sunday, when a special print section will also be published.Here are some takeaways about what they found. In the uncertain years after the death of Mao Zedong \u2014 the founding father of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 Chinese leaders struggled to find a way forward. It was the 1980s, and the country was still recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil.After decades of centralized planning and state control of the economy brought much of the country to its knees, Chinese officials knew they had to try something else \u2014 but what? The answer was far from clear. \u201cThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation,\u201d writes Philip P. Pan in the opening article of our China Rules reports.The world may have thought that it could change China, and in many ways it has, but China has also changed the world.Now, the question for China has turned from how to compete to how to pull ahead in an era of American hostility that has realigned the global dynamic. As President Xi Jinping pushes a more aggressive agenda overseas and tightens controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war that has brought the countries to the cusp of a new Cold War. When Henry A. Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, made a secret trip to Beijing in 1971, he opened a new era of engagement between the United States and China. It was grounded in the mind-set that increasing trade and investment would benefit both countries by making America safer and China more prosperous. But the decades of engagement that followed have given way to a trade war encouraged by China hawks like Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Trump. Mr. Bannon\u2019s view that China is the greatest long-term threat to the United States has influenced Mr. Trump\u2019s policymaking.And now, China has begun clamping down even more. President Xi has reversed course on some of the decades of reforms that the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made to drag the economy forward. New internal and external pressures will test this model like never before. Its relationship with the United States may be contentious, but China has been busy making its mark in a bid for global influence, even as America turns increasingly inward.From Cambodia to South Africa, it has been funding major infrastructure projects like dams, bridges, ports and power plants. Some describe the effort as a modern-day Marshall Plan, the American reconstruction campaign after World War II that laid the foundation for many enduring military and diplomatic alliances.China\u2019s take on that, the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, is bolder, more expensive and far riskier. As it works to win new allies and develop new markets, Chinese-funded projects are reshaping financial and geopolitical ties. But the costs for both aid recipients and China can be high. And Beijing is sometimes accused of using its infrastructure investments to ensnare partners in debt traps \u2014 and then seize their assets.We examined nearly 600 projects that China helped finance in the last decade. They show the scope of China\u2019s strategy on a global scale. As China focuses attention on its immediate neighbors, it has overtaken the United States as the leading trade partner in Asia. It is also projecting power through military might in the South China Sea, where Mr. Xi has ordered the development of several contested islands.The American Dream has long promised a pathway to a better life for those willing to work hard. But unprecedented economic expansion in China has created an environment where upward mobility may now be more attainable in Beijing than Baltimore.While China is still much poorer than America over all, it is outpacing its Western rival in some crucial areas.Its population is among the most optimistic in the world, according to public opinion surveys. Eight hundred million people have risen out of poverty since the 1990s. Incomes are rising across generations, with children out-earning their parents. Life expectancy has soared. It\u2019s more complicated than that, of course. Education and a growing private sector have offered a path to social mobility, but they can also function as a means of social control. The government offers an unspoken pact to its people: A good life is possible for anyone who works hard, even the children of peasants \u2014 as long as they stay out of politics.China charted a new manufacturing model in a bid to build cutting-edge industries that could rival Western giants.Defying the conventional wisdom of economic development, it is trying to do it all. The Communist Party is throwing the full financial weight of the state behind these efforts.Beyond manufacturing, China has begun getting more involved in all types of industries.Mr. Xi has emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well.\u201d Chinese companies have long mimicked their American corporate counterparts, but Chinese tech firms have evolved quickly from copying Silicon Valley\u2019s successes to making huge strides of their own, from mobile payments to social media innovations. Now the inspiration flows both ways, with American companies taking notes from Chinese counterparts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will We Ever Cure Alzheimer\u2019s?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 things we\u2019d Really like to knowFew drugs have been approved for treatment of this dementia, and none works very well. It has become one of the most intractable problems in medicine. It\u2019s a rare person in America who doesn\u2019t know of someone with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The most common type of dementia, it afflicts about 44 million people worldwide, including 5.5 million in the United States. Experts predict those numbers could triple by 2050 as the older population increases. So why is there still no effective treatment for it, and no proven way to prevent or delay its effects? Why is there still no comprehensive understanding of what causes the disease or who is destined to develop it?The answer, you could say, is: \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d And that is certainly part of it.For nearly two decades, researchers, funding agencies and clinical trials have largely focused on one strategy: trying to clear the brain of the clumps of beta amyloid protein that form the plaques integrally linked to the disease. But while some drugs have reduced the accumulation of amyloid, none have yet succeeded in stopping or reversing dementia. And amyloid doesn\u2019t explain everything about Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 not everyone with amyloid plaques has the disease.\u201cIt\u2019s not that amyloid is not an important factor,\u201d said Dr. John Morris, director of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cOn the other hand, we\u2019ve had some 200-plus trials since 2001 that have been negative.\u201dNot all trials have targeted amyloid. Some have focused on tau, a protein that, in Alzheimer\u2019s, forms threads that stick together in tangles inside neurons, sandbagging their communications with one another. Tau tangles seem to spread after amyloid accumulates into plaques between neurons. But so far, anti-tau drugs haven\u2019t successfully attacked Alzheimer\u2019s itself.Only five drugs have been approved to treat this dementia, but they address early symptoms and none have been shown to work very well for very long. It\u2019s been 15 years since the last one was approved. \u201cThe field is desperate, and we all want something to work,\u201d said Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.But while several experts said they were cautiously optimistic, much more testing of the drug, known as BAN2401, is needed. These results came from a Phase 2 trial, which is considered an intermediate step to the larger and more extensive Phase 3 trials usually required for Food and Drug Administration approval. And a few we\u2019d rather not discussSome issues with the study will need to be rectified in subsequent trials, including that people with a gene known to increase Alzheimer\u2019s risk were, at the insistence of European regulators, taken out of the group that received the highest dose.Dr. Samuel Gandy, associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in New York, noted that so far no drugs have managed even to modestly improve Alzheimer\u2019s patients\u2019 ability to function, which would allow them to remain independent longer. \u201cWe need something to affect activities of daily living, like whether they need fewer caregiving hours and that sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing has been so dramatic.\u201dThe reason Alzheimer\u2019s research is littered with failed clinical trials lies beyond questions of amyloid and tau. For one thing, researchers have found it difficult to engineer animals with symptoms mimicking human dementia so they can effectively try drugs on them before testing on people. Because of this, in recent years many researchers began testing anti-amyloid drugs on people with very early dementia, or those who don\u2019t have dementia or other symptoms but \u2014 because of genetic risk or amyloid levels in their spinal fluid \u2014 are at high risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. At the same time, the scientific establishment has become increasingly open to new theories about the underpinnings of Alzheimer\u2019s. Some researchers are trying to restore lost synapses; others are focusing on microglia, scavenger cells involved in the brain\u2019s immune system. \u201cWhether or not the amyloid hypothesis is correct, we need to better understand Alzheimer\u2019s disease mechanisms and risk factors and use this information to find the most effective ways to treat and prevent this disease,\u201d Dr. Reiman said.\u201cWe spent too long thinking about amyloid as plumbing \u2014 how much do you produce, how much do you clear,\u201d Dr. Tanzi said. \u201cThen we came along and were saying infection is actually driving the amyloid hypothesis. Amyloid\u2019s a match, the tangles are a brush fire being spread as they kill neurons, and the virus is lighting the match.\u201dHe and others suggest that the therapeutic answer might ultimately be a cocktail of medications. \u201cDrugs to hit amyloid early on, drugs to hit tangles early on, drugs to hit inflammation,\u201d Dr. Tanzi said. \u201cAnd you might want to add antivirals.\u201dBut, of course, that is not the same as turning back the tide of the disease.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Check Trump and Repair America\u2019s Image", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats should use their new power in the House.Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Sullivan were senior national security officials in the Obama administration.For two years, President Trump has upended expectations for how America acts in the world, picking fights with allies, shredding international agreements, devaluing human rights, cozying up to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and outsourcing much of our Middle East policy to Saudi Arabia. Now he is about to face a Democratic majority in the House.While Democrats are rightly focused on health care and pocketbook issues, they should also assert themselves on national security. This is particularly important since Mr. Trump, now less capable of pursuing a domestic agenda, is likely to focus on issues where he has greater freedom. A Democratic House cannot take foreign policy in a wholly different direction, but it can put forward an alternative vision while holding this administration accountable for its increasingly reckless actions abroad.First, Democrats should send a clear message to the world that we stand by our allies and our democratic values. Congress can make its voice heard in reaffirming our alliance commitments, increasing funding for the State Department, pressing the administration to admit more refugees and providing both tangible and moral support for independent civil society and media around the world. Mr. Trump may not see American values as a part of our strength and influence, but Congress should.This is especially vital at a moment when Russia and China are offering the world an alternative, authoritarian path. In addition to supporting the Russia inquiry being led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, Democrats should pursue legislation that defends our democracy against foreign meddling, protects our elections and our critical infrastructure against cyberattacks, makes it easier to vote and increases funding for combating state-sponsored disinformation. This is not about politics; it\u2019s about the health and resilience of our democracy, and our capacity to support other beleaguered democracies. Second, Democrats should challenge the president on his approach to the \u201cforever war.\u201d Despite running on a pledge to withdraw from military conflicts, Mr. Trump has escalated every conflict he inherited \u2014 largely behind a cloak of secrecy and without a clear strategy. Congress can insist on greater transparency around American military deployments, forcing the administration to specify which terrorist organizations the United States is at war with and the military objectives. Democrats should also push for a plan that removes our troops from harm\u2019s way in Afghanistan, while insisting that a war against Iran cannot take place without congressional authorization. As Mr. Trump faces political setbacks at home, Democrats must be vigilant in checking military adventurism abroad.The House should demand all of the information that our intelligence community has developed about this terrible crime, and provide a public accounting of the facts \u2014 including when Mr. Trump and his closest aides had information that the crown prince was responsible for the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This should inform a broader review of our relationship with Saudi Arabia that looks at possible sanctions, arms sales and all Saudi actions that run counter to American interests.More broadly, Democrats can signal a shift in priorities. On defense, expensive administration plans to modernize the nuclear arsenal and establish a \u201cspace force\u201d should be scrutinized. And while Mr. Trump may have vacated American leadership on climate by leaving the Paris accords, Democrats should fight to restore United States funding to mitigate the effects of a warming planet, including mass migration and armed conflict, while pressing for the planning necessary to deal with those problems as they worsen.Third, evidence of corruption in the Trump administration demands oversight. Never in our lifetimes has there been such a glaring concern that a president and his associates could be mixing personal financial interests with the nation\u2019s business. We still don\u2019t know the depth of the Trump family\u2019s conflicts in dealings with countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia and China. Why has the administration given a blank check to the Saudi crown prince? What explains Mr. Trump\u2019s genuflecting before Mr. Putin in Helsinki? Democrats should use their oversight authority to investigate the possible quid pro quo nature of the Trump administration\u2019s policies. We have seen how foreign governments have been corrupted through the conflation of personal and official agendas. This must not be permitted to happen in the United States. Beyond checking possible malfeasance inside the White House, Democrats in the House can also push back against international corruption and money laundering, including by instituting rules that make it harder to establish anonymous shell companies that hide ill-gotten wealth.Democrats can also resist Mr. Trump\u2019s conflation of domestic politics and national security, which was on full display when he deployed thousands of troops to the Mexican border to deal with a phantom migrant threat invented to rally his base before the midterm elections. Similarly, Democrats should call out the president when he boasts of negotiating \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d with North Korea or China that are intended to improve his political standing without materially advancing the nation\u2019s interests.Americans sent the world a message on Election Day that they reject the course set by President Trump, and that should begin to fix the extraordinary damage this administration has done to our international standing. Democrats must use their new power in Congress to carry that effort forward.Ben Rhodes was a deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama. Jake Sullivan was national security adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden and director of policy planning at the State Department. They are co-chairmen of National Security Action, a progressive foreign policy organization.Advertisement"}

The association said that extensive negative coverage of Sudanese youth had made it difficult to find a stadium willing to host its summer tournament. And those who have considered hosting have imposed \u201cunrealistic barriers\u201d \u2014 including restrictions on the hours the event could run and limits on crowd sizes \u2014 that made the event unfeasible, the group\u2019s statement said.Such requirements are rarely imposed on other sporting events, said Karen Pearce, a manager of strategy and inclusion with Basketball Victoria, the state\u2019s leading basketball organization.Ms. Pearce said while it was possible the restrictions were not rooted in racist attitudes, that could \u201cunfortunately\u201d be the case.\u201cI would hate to think that it is,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause what we\u2019re running is a basketball tournament for a bunch of people who love their basketball.\u201dThe South Sudanese Australian National Basketball Association holds tournaments twice a year \u2014 the National Classic in July and the Summer Slam in December \u2014 which, according to the group, usually involve up to 500 players and 1,000 spectators.For the last few years, the tournaments have been held at Eagle Stadium in Wyndham, in the outer southwestern suburbs of Melbourne. But this year, the stadium decided not to host the event.\u201cThey said that we couldn\u2019t do the tournament this year in their facility because they had concerns,\u201d said Manny Berberi, the basketball association\u2019s manager. Mr. Berberi said the venue had initially agreed to host the tournament, but that decision was later blocked by the local council.In a statement, the Wyndham council, which oversees the venue, said it decided not to host the tournament because of \u201ccapacity issues.\u201dAdvocates for the Sudanese community said the failure to find a host for the games was a blow.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of events that cater for the South Sudanese community in Australia,\u201d said Nyadol Nyuon, a Sudanese-born lawyer and community advocate. \u201cIt\u2019s denying a whole community an opportunity to celebrate,\u201d she said.Mr. Berberi said that he did not \u201cwant to be too quick to play the race card because at the moment, we\u2019re still assessing the situation.\u201d But, he added, it was \u201cprobably an issue of fear.\u201dBoth he and Ms. Pearce said they hoped to find a host so the tournament could resume next year.Mr. Berberi said that while there might be issues among some South Sudanese youth, basketball had the potential to be \u201ca huge part of the solution.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe kids just want to play basketball at the end of the day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Of Monuments, Arguments, Vampires and Thanksgiving", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Wayne, Brett Kavanaugh, my brothers Michael and Kevin, and me.Opinion ColumnistMy older brother Michael taught me many things.He taught me to hold vinyl records gingerly at the edges, so I wouldn\u2019t smudge them, and how to wipe them down with a soft cloth before returning them to their sleeves.He took me to the American Film Institute to see \u201cShane\u201d and \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d sparking a lifelong love affair with vintage movies. And he gave me \u201cDracula,\u201d written by the Dublin-born Bram Stoker, sparking a lifelong love affair with vampires.Even before I could drink, he taught me never to buy wine that didn\u2019t have the words \u201cAppellation Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u201d on the label.Michael, 17 years older, taught me how to tie my shoes, scrub under my fingernails, parallel park, brew loose tea, play bridge and Scrabble, and how to differentiate between \u201cnauseous\u201d and \u201cnauseated.\u201d He taught me that Dashiell Hammett\u2019s San Francisco and Jelly Roll Morton\u2019s New Orleans were the epitome of cool.He could not teach me not to be terrified of roller coasters. But in everything else, I was an eager student.\u201cIf there was a hurricane, you\u2019d blame it on W.,\u201d he\u2019d say.When Michael died after a bout with pneumonia in 2007, I sat on my couch for days and grappled with how my job had hurt our relationship. I never wanted to go through that again.And then Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.We were due to fly out there the first weekend in October. Then, just like Anita Hill, Christine Blasey Ford was dragged into the spotlight after telling her story to Democrats. Her scalding accusations against a man about to ascend to the Supreme Court riveted a rived nation.The Jesuit-run Georgetown Prep, where Kevin had coached for 25 years and where his three sons had gone to school and where Neil Gorsuch also went, morphed from being heralded as a Supreme Court feeder school to being depicted, as Kevin disgustedly put it, as \u201ca drunken roadhouse overflowing with testosterone.\u201dFriends of Kavanaugh say they approached Blessed Sacrament, the Chevy Chase church where my sister sometimes sits behind the Kavanaughs at the 5:30 p.m. Mass, to see if they could offer a \u201cshow of support\u201d Mass for the beleaguered judge. The Mass didn\u2019t happen; perhaps the church considered it too political.Kevin was distraught. He went on local TV to defend Kavanaugh, saying, \u201cI used to kid Brett that he was 30 when he was 16.\u201dKevin did not cancel the trip. The Saturday we arrived, Mitch McConnell rammed through Kavanaugh.We went to Goulding\u2019s Lodge, where Wayne and Ford stayed when they made their movies. At night, after a dinner of Navajo tacos and amazing Navajo fry bread and nonalcoholic wine \u2014 no alcohol on the Indian reservation \u2014 we repaired to a tiny theater where they screened those films \u2014 \u201cStagecoach,\u201d \u201cThe Searchers\u201d and \u201cShe Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\u201dBy day, we drove around admiring the breathtaking mesas, millions of years old, including the local favorite, Mittens, two striking formations that look like shale and sandstone mittens. The Navajos once believed they bolstered the sky.This was where Ford and Wayne forged an identity for America that lasted for decades.As Garry Wills wrote in the 1997 \u201cJohn Wayne\u2019s America\u201d: \u201cHe embodies the American myth. The archetypal American is a displaced person \u2014 arrived from a rejected past, breaking into a glorious future, on the move, fearless himself, feared by others, a killer but cleansing the world of things that \u2018need killing,\u2019 loving but not bound down by love, rootless but carrying the Center in himself.\u201dJoan Didion, in the 1965 essay \u201cJohn Wayne: A Love Song,\u201d wrote that \u201cin a world we understood early to be characterized by venality and doubt and paralyzing ambiguities, he suggested another world,\u201d a land of cottonwoods where a man \u201ccould make his own code.\u201dAs we drove, I contemplated the world of white patriarchy and colonialism that is now over, no matter how hard Donald Trump tries to milk it, and the bitter struggle to break out of the chrysalis with a new, inclusive American identity.Based on a recommendation given to me long ago by John McCain, Kevin and I went on a day trip to the eerily beautiful Canyon de Chelly in Arizona.With trepidation, as we drove on a long stretch of road on a Navajo reservation, I broached the subject of politics.When I pressed him about Trump\u2019s pattern of egregious, lawless and value-free behavior, Kevin admitted that he often winces at the president\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d but simply waits for the \u201ccrazy\u201d periods to pass and focuses on the things he likes.\u201cA lot of the stuff he says is taken out of context,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got news reporters becoming opinion writers, and that\u2019s not what they\u2019re supposed to be doing and that\u2019s not a fair press.\u201dHe does not, however, identify with Trump bashing the elites. As a paper salesman, he worked hard to earn enough money to pay for good schools for his kids. \u201cI\u2019m reading these articles where suddenly \u2018elite\u2019 is a dirty word,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, when Prep was described as an elite high school when I was looking for a high school for my kids, I was thrilled that it was elite.\u201dHe said he watched Blasey\u2019s testimony and saw it this way: \u201cI thought she was sympathetic but not credible because she had no facts. I think something happened to her, but it wasn\u2019t him. I was hoping Trump wouldn\u2019t do something stupid that would upset things, so when he mocked her, I cringed.\u201dHe said that the #MeToo movement \u201ccertainly had a legitimate reason for being invented, but they run a terrible risk, just like the feminists did with Bill Clinton when they decided to give him a pass even though what he was accused of would have been death for any other politician. So if they\u2019re going to say that due process should be suspended in certain cases, they\u2019re going to delegitimize their own movement.\u201d\u201cIf you did an unfair hatchet job on him, I\u2019d be very upset,\u201d Kevin said of Kavanaugh. \u201cBut politics should not be the determining factor in your life, high up on your emotional scale. You should realize that family always is more important. I always used to teach my kids growing up, when they\u2019d have fights, I said, \u2018Just remember, when you really need somebody, the only one that\u2019s going to be compelled to run toward you is your family, not your friends.\u2019\u201dWhen we got back to the inn, with the desert monuments blazing red in the sunset, the Kavanaugh ceremonial swearing-in at the White House was starting. We sat down in front of the TV, next to each other and yet so far apart.When Kavanaugh thanked his \u201camazing and fearless\u201d friends, including those from the \u201ccoaching\u201d world and his \u201ctightknit Catholic community here in the D.C. area,\u201d I looked over. A tear was running down Kevin\u2019s cheek.And then I started to cry, too, because I was thinking of Michael and what was lost, and Kevin and what I hope won\u2019t be lost. And because, more and more, it seems that Donald Trump\u2019s genius for hate and division has driven us all into a canyon that we won\u2019t easily be able to climb out of.I worry that it will be a long time before we can talk across our jangly, angry chasms.Advertisement"}

Katie Rogers, a White House reporter for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.How do President Trump and Melania Trump use tech?The president is not as technologically savvy as the first lady. His aides slip him paper copies of news articles, and when he travels on Air Force One, an aide is often spotted carrying around these mysterious-looking cardboard boxes. They are full of paper documents. The president will often sift through the papers when he needs to refer to something \u2014 which can be where that famous Sharpie of his comes into play.(What a coincidence: I use Signal, too. Mrs. Trump, call me.)How have you seen White House tech evolve under President Trump?If I\u2019m on the road, it\u2019s easy for me to tune into a pool spray or speech through someone else\u2019s Periscope live-streaming account, for instance. And when the president is at one of his properties, including the Trump Hotel or Mar-a-Lago, I often lurk on Instagram to see who is hanging out with him.The Trump White House also had journalists switch over to an in-house Wi-Fi network, which made some reporters understandably uncomfortable for security reasons. The West Wing has also made more use out of devices that scan for gadgets including phones \u2014 I can understand why Signal is so popular. I think the anxiety over surveillance is perhaps more heightened than it was under the Obama administration, which, by the way, did its part to pave the way for these types of procedures.What are your most important tech tools for keeping up with breaking news from the White House and talking to your sources?I\u2019ve been on this beat since January. I thought I was pretty much tethered to the news before, but this job requires you to imbibe a daily tidal wave of news. So that\u2019s fun.A lot of my monitoring is Twitter-based, so I use tools I\u2019ve relied on for years. I use Nuzzel, a social news app that lets me know what the people I follow on social media are sharing, which is helpful for identifying the stories getting traction. And I use Twitter\u2019s list function to sort all of the noise into manageable buckets: I have lists of White House reporters, politicians, White House aides and Washington chatterboxes.Outside of a few news apps, I dislike having notifications on my phone in general \u2014 my eyes tend to glaze over if I have too many \u2014 but I receive them from a few news organizations and whenever the president or his press secretary tweets. Several of my colleagues have the Apple Watch, which gives them a friendly little jolt when those tweets happen. I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to cross that particular Pavlovian bridge yet.Living and working in Washington have a way of narrowing your perception, so I try to make sure I understand what people outside my bubble are talking about and reading. On my computer, I use Tweetdeck \u2014 which helps manage Twitter accounts \u2014 to display a list of prominent conservatives, which runs alongside a list of journalists. It\u2019s interesting and instructive to see how the two worlds function in real time, especially when news hits.This beat is competitive, and building it from scratch has meant using a lot of research tools \u2014 Nexis for phone numbers, Spokeo for social media accounts \u2014 and making a lot of cold calls and sending emails. (If I really need something, I\u2019ll go to your doorstep.) I\u2019ve also learned that calling from a blocked number leads people in the president\u2019s orbit to believe the call is coming from the White House, so they answer right away.What could be better about some of these tools?This is just a small thing, but you know how Snapchat will show you if someone screen-grabs your message? That would be interesting to have in Signal, but absolutely no one would use Signal if that function existed.Outside of work, what tech product do you and your family love? I wouldn\u2019t say my husband and I are particularly tech savvy. We still enjoy having good old-fashioned squabbles over the thermostat, so we don\u2019t have a smart home.What tech product is on your holiday wish list?Ugh. Probably an Apple Watch.Advertisement"}

We will have to wait until the G-20 meeting to find out whether he was doing it again, or simply preparing the markets for bad news.The new companies will be: United Technologies, a maker of jet engines and airplane parts; Otis, the elevator company; and Carrier, which will specialize in heating and cooling equipment.But if that\u2019s the case, who would buy up the currency as it falls through the floor? More from Mr. Laurent:The defenders of the faith with the resources to influence the price are more likely to be large, centralized actors like big mining operations, exchanges or the 500-odd addresses with more than $10 million of Bitcoin to their name, not a committed community of tech geeks.Tether, which provides crypto tokens that it says are backed one-to-one with real currencies like dollars, is a prime candidate, Mr. Laurent says. But there are accusations that such tokens have been used to prop up Bitcoin illegally, and the Justice Department is investigating. That may further dim the hopes of a recovery.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Answering Your Midterm Questions", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.It\u2019s a lot to process, even for those of us whose job is reporting it all. But, as we said when we started this newsletter, we\u2019re here to help! So today, we\u2019re going to answer a few of your questions from this week.Jeff Gordon writes: I would love to know how Beto O\u2019Rourke spent $68 million on his campaign.That\u2019s something I\u2019d like to know, too! As many of you know, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a Texas Democrat, raised nearly $70 million for his Senate campaign. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a complete picture of his spending quite yet. The last disclosures candidates were required to file to the Federal Election Commission covered spending only through mid-October.What Democrats want to know now is how much Mr. O\u2019Rourke has left over. As of mid-October, his campaign had about $10 million in the bank. That money, or whatever is left of it, could be donated to other candidates \u2014 or repurposed for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s own political ambitions. Kathie Whelchel asks: Do you have any thoughts on President Trump offering Kris Kobach a position in his administration as a consolation prize?You aren\u2019t the only one wondering whether Mr. Kobach, a Republican who lost his bid to be the governor of Kansas, could join team Trump. Given the value the president places on loyalty, it wouldn\u2019t be all that surprising if Mr. Kobach ended up in the administration.Over the past 48 hours, his name has emerged as a top pick to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Mr. Kobach was an early supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and served as vice chairman of the president\u2019s voter fraud commission. He was also a source behind Mr. Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 presidential race.Majda Jones wants to know: What can the lame duck House do between now and when the Democrats take over? Lame duck sessions are notoriously unpredictable. But we know there\u2019s one big issue that has to be tackled: Funding for some of the government, including the Department of Homeland Security, expires on Dec. 8. The president has threatened a shutdown if Congress doesn\u2019t fund his border wall. The final appropriations bill has to get 60 votes in the Senate, which means it can\u2019t pass without some Democratic support. But, Democrats are in no mood to fund the wall after winning the House \u2014 a victory they view as a referendum on Mr. Trump. So it\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or even whether \u2014 the government gets funded.And there are a few other legislative loose ends, like negotiating a new five-year farm bill and extending some annual tax breaks.Both parties also need to select new House leadership, a fight that\u2019s particularly interesting for Democrats, given the number of new members who pledged during their campaigns to oppose Nancy Pelosi as speaker. On the Republican side, Kevin McCarthy, the outgoing majority leader, and Jim Jordan have already announced bids for minority leader.____________________About 72 hours after the first polls closed, we are still waiting for some results. Here are a few marquee races that remain undecided:Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican nominee for Senate, has filed two lawsuits over voting results. His opponent, Bill Nelson, has filed a lawsuit of his own. And President Trump has gotten involved, accusing the Democrats of sending \u201ctheir best Election stealing lawyer,\u201d and promising to \u201cexpose the FRAUD!\u201d________________________________________Enjoy your weekend!____________________ Margaret Kramer contributed to this newsletter.Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Why SAP\u2019s Purchase of Qualtrics May Be Mutually Beneficial", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsRather than proceed with an imminent initial public offering at a possible valuation of around $4.5 billion, the market-analytics company Qualtrics is selling itself to the German software giant SAP for $8 billion in cash. That casts aside the desire for control of Qualtrics\u2019 founders, but it may still be a smart choice.The agreed deal, SAP\u2019s biggest since it bought the travel and expense management firm Concur in 2014 for $8.3 billion, backs its chief executive Bill McDermott\u2019s expansion into customer relationship management, from its core business of helping firms run their finance, logistics and human resources.Qualtrics had filed with U.S. regulators to sell 20.5 million shares in an initial public offering at an indicated price of $18 to $21 per share. At the top of that range, but excluding additional shares available to the underwriters, Qualtrics would have had a market capitalization of around $4.5 billion.The deal with SAP is certainly a good one financially for Qualtrics in the short term. Ryan and Jared Smith, along with their father Scott, will collect more than $3 billion for their stake. That\u2019s against a lower valuation in an unpredictable stock market. The similar, if less impressive, company SurveyMonkey, which only went public in September, is trading below its I.P.O. price.Ryan Smith, the chief executive of Qualtrics, will remain in charge, and the company will keep its brand and two headquarters in the United States. Being part of a $130 billion behemoth may erode autonomy, but there were risks in the original plan too. Buyers of public Qualtrics shares could have eventually resented the tight control that the Smiths were going to retain through super-voting rights and other mechanisms.Qualtrics collects data and feedback on a business\u2019s customers, employees, products and brands \u2014 something it calls experience management, or XM. It has produced positive free cash flow every year since its founding in 2002, according to I.P.O. filings. Not being a drain on resources makes it less likely that SAP will interfere.Despite the cloud of jargon, there\u2019s also visible scope for mutual benefit. SAP claims around 413,000 customers, while Qualtrics has a mere 9,000 or so. Revenue synergies can be questionable, but when a much smaller company\u2019s products \u2014 especially scalable cloud-based ones \u2014 can be inserted into the marketing channels of a far larger entity, top-line gains seem less far-fetched.At 20 times the company\u2019s forecast revenue for 2018, SAP is paying up for Qualtrics, though control ought to merit a premium to second-class public-market shares. But SAP\u2019s Mr. McDermott sees XM as a new frontier for the operations-heavy group, and has breathlessly likened the deal to Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012. If he can make the analogy hold, Qualtrics will soon matter far more to SAP than the deal price suggests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Big Law Is Taking On Trump Over Immigration", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorporate lawyers at Paul Weiss, a prestigious Manhattan law firm, often spend their days scouring the fine print of client documents and government regulations. But for the past few months, they have been on a different search.In the firm\u2019s Midtown offices, about 75 lawyers have been trying to find more than 400 parents who were separated from their families at the southern border this year and then deported without their children.Big Law \u2014 a nexus of power where partners are often plucked for top government posts \u2014 has emerged as a fierce, and perhaps unexpected, antagonist to President Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. While pro bono work is nothing new, over the past two years, major law firms have become more vocal and visible in pushing back against the administration\u2019s policies.Top firms have a well-earned reputation as cautious defenders of the establishment, and immigration is generally considered a safe area for pro bono work because it rarely conflicts with corporate clients. Still, both supporters and critics of the president\u2019s agenda have noticed that large firms have been behind several of the biggest court battles.\u201cWhat\u2019s different here is that the firms are on a wholesale basis, and dramatically, challenging the behavior of the White House,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University and an expert in legal ethics.\u201cMajor law firms have really stepped up,\u201d said Becca Heller, the executive director of the nonprofit International Refugee Assistance Project.The Department of Justice, which has defended the administration in court challenges, declined to comment.Republican partners, Mr. von Spakovsky said, seldom find support for cases with a conservative bent.But since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, immigration has grown into a much more divisive and high-profile issue.Still, there are limits. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything that would jeopardize your corporate client,\u201d said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School. During the 2008 housing crisis, for example, many major firms did not represent foreclosure victims because they represented banks.Immigration does not generally present such conflicts, but tangling with the White House in a public way comes with its own risks. It can rankle clients, who are sensitive to their public image and might have cases before the government.Several of Paul Weiss\u2019s top clients declined to comment. A spokesman for Citigroup, Edward Skyler, said jokingly, \u201cGiven how valuable their time is, which we can attest to, it\u2019s very admirable.\u201dTo date, Paul Weiss lawyers have spent more than $2 million in billable hours on the A.C.L.U. project, the firm said. Paul Weiss is not litigating the case but was appointed by the court to help the nonprofit find and represent deported parents. Jeh C. Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security under Mr. Obama, is a partner at the firm but is not involved in the effort.\u201cWe\u2019re reuniting families destroyed by the administration,\u201d Mr. Karp said in an interview.Emily Goldberg, pro bono counsel at Paul Weiss, orchestrated the firm\u2019s response to family separations.For more than three months, Paul Weiss associates have been searching for parents and making calls to ask parents if they want their child sent home or placed with a sponsor in the United States.There have been obstacles, said Steven C. Herzog, a senior lawyer. Some parents are from rural areas and do not have phones. About a third speak indigenous languages.A few families have promised to fax forms, only to disappear, revealing later that the nearest town with a fax machine was several hours away, said BJ Jensen, the pro bono associate co-leading the search.The first family he found lived in Cob\u00e1n, a city in the central highlands. The family had not heard anything about their 7-year-old son in three months, he said.The involvement of large law firms in immigration-related lawsuits has not gone unnoticed by supporters of tighter restrictions.\u201cThey view the influx of asylum seekers as some kind of humanitarian project,\u201d Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, said of the lawyers. \u201cWhereas a regular American sees it as an affront to our legal system.\u201dAs of this month, Paul Weiss lawyers have contacted all but a handful of the roughly 400 deported parents. The government has released the children of about 260, half to parents in their home countries, half to sponsors in the United States.But the work may continue.The A.C.L.U. plans to use the lawyers\u2019s case notes to try to show Judge Sabraw that a number of families were coerced into signing deportation orders, even though they faced danger at home, Mr. Gelernt said. If the judge agrees, those families should be allowed to come back to the United States and apply for asylum, he said.\u201cThat\u2019s our hope,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just our hope,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s our job.\u201dAdriana Balsamo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s the latest.The legislation builds on a prison reform bill passed by the House this year, and has the potential to bring moderate Republicans and Democrats together to push it through Congress before the end of the current session.The bill would unwind some of the tough-on-crime federal policies of the 1980s and 1990s, which have incarcerated African-American offenders at much higher rates than white offenders.Some law enforcement officials and conservative lawmakers oppose the measure, arguing it poses a risk to public safety._____The county sheriff is releasing names of the missing \u201cin waves,\u201d a spokeswoman said, so that officials can handle the volume of calls.

And both Democrats and Republicans won races last week after casting themselves as education champions.But many voters, particularly in conservative and swing states, were unwilling to open their wallets.

As the company tried to grapple with the public outrage over meddling in the 2016 elections, its leaders sought to mask the extent of the problem and adopted an aggressive lobbying effort to combat critics._____But now, in the aftermath of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, their fates are unclear.Neither was among the 18 arrested in Saudi Arabia\u2019s own investigation into the killing.

{"Headline": "Some Marriott Strikes End, but San Francisco Workers Stay Out", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a settlement in Hawaii, two-thirds of the almost 8,000 of the hotel giant\u2019s workers who had walked out are back at work, as one of travel\u2019s busiest seasons is underway. The first thing that the wedding planner Lauren Carson noticed at the end of eight weeks of strikes against Marriott hotels in Hawaii was the quiet. The \u201cincessant noise\u201d from the picket lines was gone.\u201cI drove into Waikiki and it was so quiet and peaceful and back to normal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so nice.\u201d\u201cWe had one group that was about 35 people and with only two days we had to find somewhere that could accommodate them,\u201d she said. The couple received an apology from the Sheraton Waikiki, which also returned about $5,000 in deposits, Ms. Carson said.Negotiations are scheduled for Saturday and Sunday in San Francisco between Marriott officials and Unite Here, the union representing 2,500 workers who walked out on Oct. 4 at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown, the Marriott Marquis, the Marriott Union Square, the Palace Hotel, the St. Regis, the W and the Westin St. Francis.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict but with the holidays coming we are hopeful we\u2019ll see some movement this weekend,\u201d a union spokeswoman, Rachel Gumpert, said.A Marriott spokeswoman, Connie Kim, wouldn\u2019t address whether bookings had been affected by the strike, but said that the hotels remain open, and that 32 other Marriott-managed properties in the San Francisco area were not involved in labor disputes.The union members got a boost recently when the San Francisco Culinary Bartenders & Service Employees Welfare Fund said it would continue the strikers\u2019 health care benefits for December and January, if necessary.More than 100 San Francisco workers have been arrested and accused of blocking streets and other acts since the contract with Marriott ended there in August.In Chicago, a citywide strike that started in September didn\u2019t focus on any particular employer, but at its peak affected 26 hotels in a dispute over health care coverage. There, workers at the Cambria Hotel Chicago Magnificent Mile, part of the Choice Hotels International chain, remain on strike, while United Here reached a deal with the other hotels. In San Francisco, issues include health care coverage and wages, which the union said haven\u2019t kept up with the cost of living in the Bay Area. When the previous contract expired, the median income for its employees was $44,000, the union said. The housekeepers also want better protection from sexual harassment, and more time to clean the rooms that aren\u2019t serviced daily as part of Marriott\u2019s \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201d program, which offers incentives to guests who forgo daily housekeeping.Marriott International has management or franchise agreements with about 6,700 hotels under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories. Details of the financial packages with Marriott won\u2019t be released until an agreement is reached in San Francisco. But deals have been reached covering 5,200 employees at 16 Marriott-operated properties, including seven in Boston, and one hotel each in Detroit, San Jose, Calif., Oakland, Calif., and San Diego. All of the contracts with Marriott thus far cover job security, worker involvement in the use of technology and a reduction in workload for housekeepers, the union said. Although Hawaii doesn\u2019t have the \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201d program, the room quota for housekeepers there was reduced by one room per day, to 13 rooms, at most of the hotels.The new contracts also mean that housekeepers will be provided with a silent panic button to summon help if they feel threatened, in an effort to address sexual harassment.In Hawaii and Boston, the deals also covered a so-called child/elder fund in which Marriott sets aside money to assist with the cost of caring for young children or older relatives, she said. Hawaii also included an increase in health and pension contributions.\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have ratified contracts in both Boston and Hawaii and are welcoming associates back at work,\u201d Ms. Kim, the Marriott spokeswoman, said.Even with most of the hotels back to normal, the headache isn\u2019t over for everyone. Rebecca Walsh of Sydney, Australia, and her friends stayed in three rooms at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani from Oct. 12 through 15. She complained on the hotel\u2019s Facebook page about curtailed services and a noisy picket line.\u201cWe can\u2019t sit by the pool and have been woken by the protesters every morning,\u201d she wrote, noting that the only compensation they got was a waiver of the $30 a day resort fee.  An earlier version of this article, relying on information from a union representative, misstated which provisions were included in Marriott's contracts with its hotel workers. While a provision allowing people with low-level nonviolent drug convictions to obtain union jobs was proposed, it was not included in the final contract.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Essentials for Covering Silicon Valley: Burner Phones and Doorbells", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingReporting on secretive technology companies sometimes means finding people who don\u2019t want to be found. Jack Nicas, who covers Apple, relies on some old-school methods.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jack Nicas, a technology reporter for The Times in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You write about Apple and other Silicon Valley companies. What are your most important tools for reporting?Reporting is not typically sexy. We spend a lot of time sending emails, leaving voice mail messages, chasing dead ends and trying to persuade people to tell us stuff they shouldn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have any shiny gadgets you see in spy movies. Some of my most reliable reporting tools are a pen and paper.Arguably my most interesting gadget for a time was a flip phone I bought from Target. Burner phones are great for talking to paranoid sources, contacting unsavory characters or trying to reach people who are screening my calls. But now, of course, there\u2019s an app for that. It\u2019s called Burner and it lets you make calls and send texts with different phone numbers. I can even pick the area code so my subject thinks I\u2019m calling from nearby, just like the spammers! (We have a lot in common, some people say.) For sensitive communications, I still use Signal, the encrypted messaging and calling app.I record some interviews with TapeACall Pro, an app that requires dialing in a third number that records the call\u2019s audio. But because that can store the audio in the cloud, for sensitive calls I revert to a tangled setup that involves a decade-old Olympus WS-400S voice recorder, headphones and an auxiliary cord. That keeps the audio on a recorder that never connects to the internet. For particularly sensitive conversations, I ditch all of that and try to meet in person.If I had to choose one favorite old-school reporting technology though, I\u2019d pick the doorbell.When has going door to door helped with your reporting? And when did it not work out so well?When I covered crime in Boston and Florida, I typically knocked on doors to find families and friends of victims. That often led to harrowing but fruitful interviews. Now I\u2019m usually trying to find people who don\u2019t want to be found \u2014 and that sometimes means I\u2019m not well received.That was the case on one of my first door-knocking experiences. My professor at Boston University, Dick Lehr, a longtime investigative reporter, took me under his wing to examine a 30-year-old questionable arson murder conviction. We showed up to the apartment of the man we suspected had actually started the fire in question. He was home, and appeared to be on drugs. We were invited in and, as we questioned where he was the night of the crime, we eyed a large knife on his table. When he became belligerent because I began writing, we left.In a past life you covered Google. Now you cover Apple. So, iPhone or Android?I\u2019ve had both and have a controversial opinion: They\u2019re basically the same. (Apple will not like this answer.) The top phones for either operating system are excellent, easy-to-use devices with virtually the same features and apps. The biggest difference is the business model.How so?Apple makes money by selling consumers expensive iPhones. Google makes money by giving away its Android software and services \u2014 and then charging advertisers for access to the billions of users it attracts.Google\u2019s approach has given it enormous data about the world and its inhabitants. Google is well positioned to use its mass collection of personal data for new products, like artificial intelligence, but it also draws new scrutiny to the company.Apple\u2019s less data-focused approach has allowed it to take the high road on privacy. That strategy has potentially insulated the company from regulations and public scorn, but it also could leave Apple with dumber products than its rivals.Internet trolls have targeted you for your coverage.

They were later released and were expected to be back in court on Christmas Eve. Mr. Bobbitt was arrested in Philadelphia and was being extradited to New Jersey.The couple started a GoFundMe campaign for Mr. Bobbitt in 2017. Ms. McClure claimed that she had been out of gas and money when Mr. Bobbitt, who was homeless at the time, offered her his last $20 so that she could get home.The couple took a photo of Mr. Bobbitt, a veteran, when they said they returned to repay him. The GoFundMe campaign went viral; 14,347 people donated $402,706 for Mr. Bobbitt. The heartwarming story was widely covered by news organizations.The authorities pored over more than 60,000 text messages sent by Ms. McClure and Mr. D\u2019Amico. An hour after the campaign went live, Ms. McClure sent a text message to a friend admitting that the entire story was untrue, Mr. Coffina said.\u201cOK, so wait, the gas part is completely made up but the guy isn\u2019t,\u201d read the text message Ms. McClure sent. \u201cI had to make something up so people will feel bad,\u201d she added.After administrative fees charged by GoFundMe, the couple netted $367,108. All of the money was spent, according to Mr. Coffina. He said $89,000 was withdrawn in or around casinos and over $20,000 was spent in casino play.The authorities also seized a car, jewelry and luxury handbags from the home of Ms. McClure and Mr. D\u2019Amico during a raid in September.In March, Ms. McClure sent a text message to Mr. D\u2019Amico lamenting that they had less than $10,000 left from donors, according to the authorities.\u201cMaybe he just didn\u2019t appreciate that the lawsuit will bring out this information,\u201d Mr. Coffina said.The authorities also found that in 2012, Mr. Bobbitt posted a similar story to his Facebook page, saying he had spent his supper money to help a woman. That story did not gain nearly as much traction as the tale about the gas money.Mr. Coffina believes the three people met near an underpass where Mr. Bobbitt hung out that was close to the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia, which Mr. D\u2019Amico and Ms. McClure frequented.Lawyers for Mr. D\u2019Amico and Ms. McClure declined to comment.

{"Headline": "Will Hurd Wins Re-election to Texas Congressional Seat", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The Democratic challenger trying to unseat Representative Will Hurd, a two-term Republican congressman in the Texas border region, conceded the race on Monday, ending a nearly two-week dispute over the counting of provisional and other ballots in a tight race and sealing Mr. Hurd\u2019s re-election.Mr. Hurd\u2019s majority-Hispanic district has been a hard-fought battleground for Democrats and Republicans. The 23rd District spans a wide swath of Far West Texas, including parts of San Antonio and some smaller border towns. The seat has flipped five times between Republicans and Democrats since the early 1990s, and Democrats were eager to make it six.As it turned out, the race was so close that it took days of ballot examinations to determine the outcome.Mr. Hurd and his opponent, Gina Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force intelligence officer, finished the election with one of the tightest vote margins in the state. Mr. Hurd had received 49.2 percent of the vote and Ms. Jones got 48.6 percent, with 1,150 votes separating the two candidates, according to state elections officials.Mr. Hurd had declared himself the winner, but Ms. Jones said the election was far from over and refused to concede.Her campaign waited as an unknown number of ballots were tallied in more than two dozen counties and went to court seeking a two-day extension to get the job done. The postelection limbo paralleled, on a smaller scale, the vote-counting controversy unfolding in Arizona, Florida and Georgia. At the center of the Texas case was the counting of absentee, military and overseas ballots sent in by mail as well as provisional ballots, which are effectively temporary votes that are not yet official.Ms. Jones and her campaign\u2019s lawyers challenged vote-total changes and the handling of the provisional ballot process by elections administrators in Medina County and in San Antonio\u2019s Bexar County.In one moment that illustrated the lingering state of uncertainty over the election, Ms. Jones went to Washington last week and attended a freshman orientation for incoming members of the House of Representatives, even though she had not actually won election to Congress. She joined the freshman class for a group photo outside the Capitol.But in a statement released Monday, Ms. Jones conceded the race to Mr. Hurd.\u201cWhile we came up short this time, we ran a race of which we can be proud,\u201d she said. \u201cI remain committed to serving my community and country, and I wish Will Hurd the courage to fight for TX-23 in the way in which our district deserves.\u201dThe race opened a window on the increasing diversity of Texas politics. Mr. Hurd is the first black Republican to represent Texas in Congress. Ms. Jones was seeking to become the country\u2019s first Filipina-American congresswoman and the state\u2019s first openly gay or lesbian member of Congress.The outcome was a belated boost to Texas Republicans.Texas Democrats flipped 16 state and federal seats to blue from red: 12 in the State House, two in the State Senate and two in Congress. In addition, some of the state\u2019s most outspoken far-right politicians had surprisingly narrow victories, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who was the Texas chairman of President Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016.Mr. Hurd, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who is one of the few African-American Republicans in Congress, is regarded as one of the more moderate members of the state\u2019s Republican delegation. He has spoken against President Trump\u2019s planned border wall and co-authored a bill earlier this year to both protect the undocumented young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation and strengthen border security.\u201cBeto suggested it,\u201d Mr. Hurd told The New York Times at the time while on the road. \u201cHe thought I was going to say no.\u201dThe 23rd District is one of the places where Democrats have accused Republican leaders of drawing boundary lines intended to weaken Latino voting power and of helping to squash Hispanic turnout by passing one of the country\u2019s toughest voter ID laws.In recent years, federal judges found in separate cases that the Republican-led Texas Legislature discriminated against minority voters in its drawing of the 23rd District and in its passage of the voter ID law. But in later rulings, federal courts sided with Texas and upheld both the district map and the state\u2019s efforts to loosen the voter ID restrictions.Advertisement"}

New research unspooled 60,000 years of its history with an eye on what it will do in the future.Finally, the volcano enters a pre-caldera phase. Minor eruptions become infrequent, and magma accumulates in the subterranean reservoir. As it pools, the magma evolves into a water-rich, gassy form, and the most buoyant, bubble-rich patches gather at the top. This magma buildup may eventually culminate in another major eruption, and the cycle would begin anew.But Dr. Forni found that the chemistry of the Monte Nuovo eruption in 1538 is similar to that seen in the deeper past, when the volcano slowly built to caldera-forming blasts. The presence of two calderas suggests that Campi Flegrei has probably completed at least one cycle, and if this pattern is indeed real, then the chemistry hints that \u201cwe are potentially at the start of a new cycle,\u201d Dr. Forni said.But, she said, predicting when a major eruption will occur is beyond the current ability of science: \u201cThe best we can do for now is to see how the system behaved in the past.\u201dThe study\u2019s use of geochemistry to understand long-term magmatic evolution, Dr. Kilburn said, \u201cmay help to improve our understanding of large calderas worldwide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Would You Draw History?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEWhen cracks start to appear in the world order, the old textbook timeline just won\u2019t do. Mr. Sartwell is a professor of philosophy.Recent world events \u2014 take your pick \u2014 might have you wondering about where human history is headed, and by what route. You would not be alone. The fracturing of global alliances and the rise of hard-right movements like those in Hungary, Brazil and the United States have caused many of us to question the inevitability of what we generally call progress. Ecological disasters like the California wildfires, plausibly connected to climate change and suburban development, raise the specter of a human history moving inexorably toward self-destruction. The philosophy of history, which flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and has enjoyed periodic revivals in the hands of thinkers like Arthur Danto and Francis Fukuyama, set itself the remarkably ambitious project of describing the forces that shape human events: history\u2019s structure, its direction, its aim, its point and even its end. There are good reasons to be skeptical of such a project, which we might associate above all with the names Marx and Hegel, and it is possible that history has no coherent shape or direction, or many. It may be, too, that the shape of history depends on our decisions and not on impersonal forces. But the philosophy of history is also a seductive project because, among other things, it seems to promise an understanding \u2014 even an approximate one \u2014 of what might happen next.The basic timeline of history, which still ornaments elementary-school classrooms, remains the way many of us picture how we got to where we are. Its ubiquity suggests that drawing history, trying to capture the shape of time graphically, on a page or in our imaginations, is fundamental to how we understand both the past and the future; we need to diagram history to grasp it, if it can be grasped at all. There is only one history or course of time, in this view, and all humankind is swept up in it. As we tilt the right end up, we portray \u201cthe Whig interpretation of history,\u201d a term coined in 1931 by the historian Herbert Butterfield to describe what he thought of as na\u00efve progressive optimism, the idea that history was headed pretty directly for freedom and enlightenment. We\u2019ve often gotten very much the same picture from progressive leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and former President Barack Obama, who tell the story of America as a march toward justice, characterized by the enfranchisement of oppressed groups, presented at times almost as inevitable.On the other hand, many theorists and many traditional cultures have envisioned time as circular or at least cyclical, which is even suggested by the rhythm of day and night or of the seasons.Nietzsche, for example, speculated that a finite number of atoms in infinite time would assume the same configurations again and again, infinitely. But many ancient philosophies, such as Stoicism, and ancient religions, such as some elements of Hinduism, believed in the wheel of time (or kalachakra). We talk this way informally as well, when we say that history repeats itself, and certainly the idea that we live in an era when fascists and capitalists are squaring off against socialists all over the world sounds like 1930, and 1890 and 1850.The repetitions are striking but not exact, so perhaps history has a loop structure.It\u2019s cyclical, but it often doubles back on its journey forward. Here we might also think of progress pursued through a revival of traditional values, or radical reform movements that make what almost appears to be a reactionary appeal to the source or origin, as in the philosophy of Confucius or the Reformation of Martin Luther. Obama\u2019s first inaugural address, typically for American political rhetoric, portrayed his victory both as progressive and as a return to the values of America\u2019s founding, as the top of the loop, as it were. A strength of this picture is that it explains seeming setbacks as continuations of the way forward. We are likely to flow out of our period of reaction and disaster.The most ambitious accounts of history in the 19th century were Hegel\u2019s and Marx\u2019s, which described the structure in terms of \u201cdialectics,\u201d or opposites that were reconciled at a higher level in the next phase: conflicting cultures or classes or spirits of the age that were merged and transcended at the dawn of the next period, which in turn generated a new conflict or tension.For example, Marx described the feudal economy as generating a conflict between lord and serf that was finally overcome by the rise of bourgeois capitalism, which in turn gave rise to a conflict between owners and workers that would inevitably lead to communism. Hegel looked on the Romantic art of his time as a synthesis and transcendence of symbolist or iconic art (Egyptian, for example) and classical Greek and Renaissance styles, overcoming the apparent opposition between reason and passion or reason and subjectivity. Both of them, like Fukuyama, thought that the whole thing was leading toward some kind of ecstatic or at least satisfactory end-state.Once we let the physicists and cosmologists in on the action, however, things are liable to get explosively weird, and Stephen Hawking (following Richard Feynman and others) concludes from quantum mechanics that \u201cthe universe has every possible history.\u201dIt\u2019s a big bang not only of matter but also of almost infinitely many timelines, each of which might be a line or a loop, a circle or spiral. At this point, however, the complexity might just be getting too great to yield much in the way of predictions. Or rather, if you predicted that everything that can possibly happen will happen, you\u2019d be right, and finished.If I were trying to draw history, I\u2019d draw it as a loop spiral: all on a single timeline, but crossing and recrossing itself, not making any particular progress forward or upward, but blossoming or expanding outward, more complex with each spiral because of the accretion of events.Well, that\u2019s the shape I think history would have, if I thought history had a shape. I call it the Spirograph theory.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the author of \"The Whig Interpretation of History.\" He is Herbert Butterfield, not Alexander Butterfield.Advertisement"}

Two years of chaos and hysteria ending in a return to standoff.Opinion ColumnistFor once, it all happened more or less as we foresaw \u2014 and by \u201cwe\u201d I mean risk-averse political commentators who hugged the polling averages and projections tight while resisting both Betomania and the occasional flashbacks to 2016. A good night for Republicans in the Senate. An excellent night for Democrats in the House. The Trumpian Upper Midwest swinging back toward Democrats. Red-state senate voters sticking with the G.O.P. The mobilize-the-base strategy falling just short for Democrats in Florida and Georgia. A rebuke to Trump in the overall returns, but not a presidency-ending repudiation. Two years of chaos and hysteria ending in a return to stalemate.But this election confirms that, contra certain Trump enthusiasts, the #MAGA era in right-wing politics is essentially a defensive era, in which G.O.P. leverages a fortunate Electoral College win and an advantage in the Senate to fill the courts and delay liberal ambitions for a time \u2014 but fails, conspicuously, to reap political rewards from the current economic expansion and to build an actual popular majority.And to the extent that conservatives \u2014 normal and NeverTrump alike \u2014 are willing to live with that outcome so long as they hold the Senate, it\u2019s what we deserve as well. There is no conservative governing agenda at the moment; there is only a desire not to be ruled by liberalism. So that desire will be fulfilled for two more years and possibly for more \u2014 but meanwhile the ability to actually move legislation will be rightfully taken from a movement and a party that had no agenda of any significance to move.What about Democrats?

Meanwhile Joe Manchin showed that the old model of nominating a populist who fits your state\u2019s swing voters still has life. But not enough life to save Joe Donnelly or elect Phil Bredesen, or to persuade the Democratic base to suddenly discover an enthusiasm for Senate candidates who are pro-life or immigration-restrictionist or ready, like Manchin with Brett Kavanaugh, to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.No: Democrats obviously want to win purple and red Senate seats, but they want to win them the way they just lost in Texas, with charisma and mobilization rather than with ideological compromise. So they\u2019re left waiting, as before, for demography or a recession to deliver them that opportunity.Until it comes, we have two parties that in different ways seem content with their insufficient coalitions, and a country that needs a governing majority but will settle yet again for stalemate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Facebook\u2019s Three Big Problems", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello, old friends! It\u2019s Kevin Roose, tech columnist and erstwhile newsletter writer.Facebook\u2019s eventful week in Europe got me thinking about how to categorize the many, many problems the company has faced over the past several years.They can be grouped in three buckets, I think, and it\u2019s worth spelling out what each of them is, because it might help illuminate the enormous complexity of Facebook\u2019s challenge in the coming years.So far, this hostility has manifested mostly in the form of a few shouty hearings and a lot of angry letters, and hasn\u2019t seriously impeded Facebook\u2019s ability to conduct its business. But it could produce real consequences in the coming months, as a Democratic House takes over in the United States and lawmakers in Europe and other countries start rolling out new rules around online ads, privacy and other core Facebook concerns.The second bucket consists of perception problems \u2014 external P.R. crises, dwindling user satisfaction numbers and low employee morale.I\u2019d argue that of these issues, the third really matters most. Tech companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talented workers, and morale problems can quickly turn into business problems if they result in a less competitive work force.Product problems are the most worrisome ones for Facebook by a large margin, because they flow into other issues and they\u2019re the hardest to solve.Making political problems go away is not rocket science \u2014 companies spend billions of dollars every year lobbying lawmakers to great effect. And perception problems, while painful in the short term, can be overcome over the long term, as news cycles move on and other companies\u2019 sins bump you out of the spotlight. (Exhibit A: Uber.)But product problems can be excruciatingly hard to solve \u2014 especially when, as in Facebook\u2019s case, they live at the core of a lucrative business model.I\u2019m not the first to point out that many of Facebook\u2019s issues stem from its embrace of targeted advertising, which has made it an insanely profitable behemoth and created an unending series of headaches.But it\u2019s not clear yet that Facebook can meaningfully change the engagement patterns on its apps \u2014 which are, after all, built on giving users more of what they want, even if what they want is hateful or misleading \u2014 without unraveling its business.So the big questions for Facebook now are: Can the company first acknowledge that it has product problems, in addition to political and perception problems? If it can agree on the product problems, how much money is Mr. Zuckerberg willing to lose in order to fix them? And how much damage will the company absorb in the meantime?In other tech news of the week:This is a great case for taking them more seriously, starting with Red Dead Redemption 2, which Mr. Suderman calls \u201ca game about both making choices and living with them, about taking responsibility for how you\u2019ve lived.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Wine Books of 2018", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThese five new volumes investigate some of the most basic issues raised by wine, while posing new questions and inspiring thirst. Wine invites contemplation \u2014 of the world, of our place in it and sometimes just of wine itself.Why does this wine taste as it does? What makes a bottle great? Or flawed? Can a glass still surprise us? What makes some grapes well-accepted and others not?This year\u2019s crop of excellent new wine books was particularly contemplative. Here are five of the best.As their starting point, they address the question that routinely occurs to every thinking wine drinker: Why does this wine taste this way and that one, made from the same grapes a mile away, taste entirely different?The authors visited some of the great wine regions of Europe and posed the question directly to vignerons, the people who grow the grapes and make the wines. The vignerons shared their observations, born of generations of experience with particular terroirs, and Mr. Parr and Mr. Mackay added their own detailed perceptions about the wines.The results are equations that correlate the intricacies of terroir \u2014 soil, climate, elevation, angle of inclination and the human element (which can be expressed in some unexpected ways, as when people reconstruct vineyards with stones and soil) \u2014 with a microscopic parsing of the wines themselves. The writers explain, for example, why wines made in the northern quadrants of the Nuits-St.-George region of Burgundy can be so different from those made in the south, and what might separate the chenin blanc grown in the schist of Savenni\u00e8res from chenin blanc on limestone in Vouvray.The \u201cGreat Wines of Europe\u201d portion of the title is misleading. The focus is primarily on France, which indeed has a solid claim to any investigation of terroir. While several other countries are visited, some regions feel like afterthoughts.Each section of the book concludes with a short list of producers recommended by Mr. Parr. These lists would have been more useful had they included more up-and-comers and fewer choices like Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti and Domaine Raveneau, which are universally acknowledged to be great and exorbitantly expensive.Still, Mr. Parr is an excellent curator of wine and winemakers, and Mr. Mackay writes clearly and invitingly, infusing what could be a lifeless inquiry with pith and zest. This is the sort of thought-provoking book that I will return to again and again.Terry Theise is one of America\u2019s most interesting wine importers. He specializes in small family estates in Germany, Austria and Champagne, whose work has helped form his conviction that wine can touch the deepest places in the human soul.This may sound like both a formidable and a quixotic goal, and in truth, Mr. Theise is not entirely successful. His most profound experiences with wine seem to have been so poignantly personal that readers may feel like an audience listening to the most articulate guru in the world without actually feeling the spirit themselves.Yet Mr. Theise has much to offer. He can help all of us untangle our own thinking about what makes a wine expressive, about the importance of paradox and ambiguity, and of the difference between wines that he might describe as modest, demure and tender, and those of volume and power.Mr. Theise believes in the importance of connectedness, wine\u2019s ties to place, people and community. Paradoxically, he also finds his own isolation, loneliness and melancholy to be revealed in greater detail by the most profound wines.Sometimes he tries too hard. \u201cNow we glean the timorous arrival, dare I say, of pleasure,\u201d he writes, a sentence I could hear only in the most unctuous cartoon voice. He describes a wine of \u201cnuminous emptiness,\u201d a phrase I\u2019m still trying to puzzle out.Face-palming moments aside, I loved this book. Mr. Theise\u2019s companionable ruminations provide much to ponder, preferably with a glass of great wine.Over the last 20 years or so, one of the more interesting resurrections has been the appearance of a genre that has come to be known as \u201corange wine,\u201d white wine produced as if it were a red. The juice of white grapes, ordinarily whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, is left to macerate with them instead, producing an amber-tinged wine with a mild tannic rasp.Indeed, most white wines were probably made in more or less this fashion until the second half of the 20th century. The brilliant, clear fruitiness we associate with white wine today is a relatively recent invention.The early centers of production of these wines \u2014 the country of Georgia, the northeastern Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the neighboring country of Slovenia \u2014 all shared a history of being conquered and of being subjected, as Mr. Woolf puts it, to \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d The rediscovery and nurturing of these styles (the term orange wine encompasses many different sorts of wine) was nothing less than a struggle to regain heritage and identity.Mr. Woolf is an engaging writer with an excellent story to tell and an array of intriguing characters. He is precise, weighing in on the intersection of orange and natural wines, without being pedantic. The book is full of magnificent photography, and includes an exhaustive survey of producers around the world who now work in these styles.On any given day, consumers must choose from a selection of wines, grapes and styles that seems to have multiplied exponentially over the last 20 years. Forward-thinking wine authorities embrace this diversity as a kaleidoscope of cultural expression, but some, like the powerful (but now largely retired) wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr., pushed back.We are introduced to many delicious orange wines, natural wines and esoteric (though culturally resonant) grapes, along with the people who produce and protect them. And we begin to understand the tension faced by growers and producers, who daily must negotiate the conflict between tradition and commerce.Does the commercial power of one dictate the disappearance of the other? Who is served by the vanishing of grapes and styles that, as Mr. Parker put it, \u201chave never gotten traction?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve always been kind of insufferable,\u201d Mr. Wilson writes midway through the book. Not at all. If anything, he lacks any trace of self-righteousness, a chronic affliction of wine writers. Instead, he will make you curious and thirsty.The last thing many people want to think about are flaws and faults. Yet there they are: cork taint, oxidation, volatile acidity and other problems that can cause the most highly anticipated bottles to be poured down the drain.The perception of flaws can be subjective, he says, as not everybody has the same sensitivity to certain faults.Mr. Goode is succinct and clear about how these various flaws are expressed in wines. This can be helpful to any wine lover who knows when a wine is not right, but doesn\u2019t know exactly what is wrong.When Mr. Goode digs in deeper about causes, however, I sometimes got lost in the detailed discussion of chemistry. I learned about faults that I did not know existed, like eucalyptus taint, which apparently is not uncommon in Australia. How can it be prevented? By not planting vineyards near eucalyptus groves, and vice versa.I would have liked to have seen an exploration of whether it should be considered a fault when modern wines are sound but deadly dull. But in its focus on technical faults, this book will be highly useful to anybody who wants to understand the numerous obstacles that can intrude on pleasure.Advertisement"}

That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.In another part of the article Whitaker wrote:Any investigation into President Trump\u2019s finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel.If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel\u2019s investigation was a mere witch hunt. If Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive.It is unclear at this point how this staff change will affect Mueller and his investigation, now that oversight for his work is being taken away from Rosenstein. But there is no way to view this move and not worry about the future of the investigation.Trump now has at least two avenues to appoint a permanent successor to Jeff Sessions: Send a new nominee before a more favorable Senate with even more Republican votes, or make a recess appointment over the holidays.The incoming Democratic majority in the House would have absolutely no say in this.Democrats did well in the elections for the House in part because representation there is a reflection of where people are. The Senate, on the other hand, is tied to land. Indeed, the fewer people in these states, many of them solidly Republican, the more weight each person\u2019s vote carries. The Electoral College lives between the two equations.Trump\u2019s strategy is to survive at all costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Price of Cool: A Teenager, a Juul and Nicotine Addiction", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "E-cigarettes may help tobacco smokers quit. But the alluring devices can swiftly induce a nicotine habit in teenagers who never smoked. This is the tale of one person\u2019s struggle.Supported byREADING, Mass. \u2014 He was supposed to inhale on something that looked like a flash drive and threw off just a wisp of a cloud? What was the point?A skeptical Matt Murphy saw his first Juul at a high school party in the summer of 2016, in a suburban basement crowded with kids shouting over hip-hop and swigging from Poland Spring water bottles filled with bottom-shelf vodka, followed by Diet Coke chasers.Everyone knew better than to smoke cigarettes. But a few were amusing themselves by blowing voluptuous clouds with clunky vapes that had been around since middle school. This Juul looked puny in comparison. Just try it, his friend urged. It\u2019s awesome.Matt, 17, drew a pleasing, minty moistness into his mouth. Then he held it, kicked it to the back of his throat and let it balloon his lungs. Blinking in astonishment at the euphoric power-punch of the nicotine, he felt it \u2014 what he would later refer to as \u201cthe head rush.\u201d\u201cIt was love at first puff,\u201d said Matt, now 19.The next day, he asked to hit his friend\u2019s Juul again. And the next and the next. He began seeking it out wherever he could, that irresistible feeling \u2014 three, sometimes four hits a day.He would come to hate himself for being dependent on the tiny device, which he nicknamed his \u201c11th finger.\u201d Yet any thought of quitting made him crazy-anxious.Experiences like Matt\u2019s have placed Juul at the epicenter of a national debate. On one side stand longtime adult smokers who celebrate the device as the aid that finally helped them quit smoking. On the other are teenagers who have never smoked a cigarette but who have swiftly become addicted to Juul\u2019s intense nicotine hits.The science about long-term effects of the other chemicals and small metals in the vaporized liquids is unsettled, not only because formulations vary widely and are often undisclosed, but because e-cigarettes have not been around long enough to study thoroughly.Perhaps what alarms public health experts most about e-cigarettes generally and Juul in particular is nicotine which, when vaporized, is absorbed by the body within seconds, much faster than when delivered by chewing gum or patches. Its potent addictive properties, doctors say, can be most pronounced in teenagers.******After a few weeks of bumming daily hits from friends (called \u201cfiending\u201d), Matt went on a family vacation out West. On his second day without a Juul, he found he wanted one desperately. On the third, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.He searched Juul\u2019s website to find a local store that sold it, and ordered an Uber to get there, mumbling a nonchalant excuse to relatives. Between the cost of the ride service plus the Juul \u201cstarter\u201d kit, he spent $100 to sate his need.Soon, he escalated to a daily pod, sometimes more. He was spending $40 a week, draining his Christmas and birthday money, and his paycheck from his part-time job at Chili\u2019s.Matt doesn\u2019t come across as a cool alpha. He\u2019s an easy, approachable kid with a certain sweetness, voted \u201cbest personality\u201d by his high school classmates. Focused on achieving academic and financial success, he stayed away from marijuana, alcohol and cigarettes. The Juul, he thought, was a harmless way to look like an edgy risk-taker.It became stitched into his social identity, and bound him to his buddies, who would ride around town hitting their Juuls in one friend\u2019s 2002 Volvo. By the time he graduated from high school in 2017, four of his five closest friends were also daily Juulers.He and other athletes noticed they would get out of breath more quickly. \u201cWe called it \u2018Juul lung,\u2019 \u201d Matt said. \u201cWe knew it lowered our performance but we saw that as a sacrifice we were willing to make.\u201dThere is an art and artifice to being a teenage Juuler, Matt explained during numerous long conversations, including one over a recent lunch at a local pizza shop. You have to scope out which convenience stores will card you and which will look away, so long as you pay their inflated prices.Near Matt\u2019s house in Reading, a middle-class Boston suburb, there are two convenience stores on West Street. The first won\u2019t sell you e-cigarettes unless you are 21. The second was just over the town line in neighboring Woburn, where the legal age until recently was 18. Turned away in Reading, Matt and his friends would simply saunter down the block, where they could pass scrutiny.What he had initially derided as Juul\u2019s pitiful wisp of nearly odor-free vapor turned out to be a great advantage. Teachers were clueless. If his parents walked into his room five seconds after he exhaled, they wouldn\u2019t know. \u201cThe Juul was super, super sneaky and I loved it,\u201d he said.But by the time he got to college, he began to admit to himself he had a problem. He was majoring in biochemistry at the University of Vermont and feeling overwhelmed by the workload; the Juul was his only stress-escape. To limit his use, he kept it in his dorm room rather than carry it with him.But soon, he realized: \u201cAll I wanted was to be in my room.\u201dHe had 40 minutes between classes: Ten minutes, bike to the dorm. Hit Juul, 20 minutes. Ten minutes, bike to next class. Repeat.By now his vaping was about maintenance, keeping the craving irritability at bay. He knew things had gotten just ridiculous, but there was nothing to be done about it. He even fixed a Velcro strip on the dresser next to his dorm room bed and stuck the Juul on it, so that as soon as he opened his eyes in the morning he could just reach up for a hit: first, best, only head rush of the day.One girl on his dorm hall sold Juul pods from stock she had bought from a guy who ordered armloads on the internet. Unlike back home in high school, college students vaped in public everywhere \u2014 in lecture halls, at hockey games, in the dorm common rooms.\u201cMatt was open about wishing he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Tucker Houston, his freshman roommate. \u201cIt was a constant battle for him. People would tell him that they\u2019d want to buy a Juul and he\u2019d be like, \u2018No! You don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s not cool, it\u2019s not fun.\u2019 He became known as the juuling anti-Juul advocate.\u201dThis past summer, Matt returned home to work construction for his father, a building contractor. In the full sway of his addiction, he stuck the empty pods in his backpack so they wouldn\u2019t be spotted in the household trash. He hid the Juul in his bedroom, doing without it on the job for up to six hours at a stretch.That was rough.\u201cBut I knew if my parents caught me, I couldn\u2019t do it again, and that represented a future of not doing it,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI rationalized that it was better to do without it briefly, than forever.\u201dThen he found that the delayed gratification from leaving it at home was fantastic. \u201cIf you wait an hour, it feels great. But if you wait five hours, it feels unbelievable.\u201dAt the end of the day, he would take a long, two-second draw, and keep it in his lungs, a practice called \u201czeroing,\u201d because his body absorbed all the vapor, exhaling none. He\u2019d zero it four or five times, feel dizzy, blink about 10 times, and then be fine.One day, Matt\u2019s mother walked into his room to collect his dirty laundry. There was his backpack, unzipped, open.The confrontation with his parents was epic.David Murphy, Matt\u2019s father, was startled by the extent of Matt\u2019s Juul concealment. He hadn\u2019t suspected something was amiss. Matt\u2019s behavior never seemed appreciably altered.The vaping had to end, Mr. Murphy ordered. \u201cI said, \u2018Nicotine is a lifelong burden. There\u2019s a big company with its hand in your pocket, distracting your thought process continuously. Juuling is a huge undocumented risk. Now, how do we come back together as a family and solve this problem?\u201dTwo hours into the tearful conversation, Matt concluded: \u201cI could not justify the addiction anymore. And I realized my parents were my allies. Because I wanted to stop and they wanted me to stop.\u201d*********Because Juul is so new, there is no consensus protocol for how teenagers should withdraw. Matt devised a weaning regimen: every two hours, five short hits. Then longer breaks, fewer hits.One June day he was riding shotgun in the Volvo with his old friends. As he was about to take a scheduled hit, he grew despairing and exasperated. He had tried quitting before but it had never worked; would he always be chained to this gadget? Impulsively, he tried to throw the Juul out the car window, but the window stuck. So he abruptly yanked back the sunroof and heaved it to the street.One friend, sitting in the back, cheered and pumped his fist. But another scowled \u2014 he would happily have taken Matt\u2019s Juul.\u201cI felt strong for five minutes,\u201d Matt said. \u201cAnd then I felt really weak. I only realized the magnitude of my addiction when I stopped.\u201dNicotine withdrawal, he said, was hell. He was overtaken with bouts of anxiety. Who was he without his 11th finger? He would get the shakes, curl up in his bed, overcome with a sense of powerlessness.\u201cWhen Matt withdrew, he\u2019d flip out a lot, especially when other people had it around him,\u201d said Jared Stack, a friend since elementary school. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t stop doing it just because he had. They didn\u2019t care \u2014 because they were addicted too.\u201dIt was the whirring, the purring, the sound of their Juuls firing up, that would trigger Matt. Yet avoiding his friends was inconceivable.After three weeks, the worst of it passed. Even still, Matt can tick off to the day how long it\u2019s been since he stopped on June 6: 163 days as of Friday.He transferred to the University of Massachusetts in Lowell, majoring in business and living at home. Whenever he feels the Juul urge now, he tells himself, \u201cI\u2019d have to go through the whole horrible dark time that is being addicted and then quitting.\u201dHis eyes brightened as he gulped the last of his pizza, long limbs splayed everywhere. Instead, he said, he tries to help friends who want to quit. \u201cThey text me all the time when they\u2019re trying. They\u2019ll say, \u2018Did you experience this?\u2019\u201cAnd I say, \u2018Yes,\u2019 because I want them to know I understand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I tell them, \u2018But it gets better.\u2019 Because it does.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In an exhibition recounting Myanmar\u2019s martial history, his photo is at the top of a pyramid of 32 framed shots of other military leaders.In other halls, his image hangs alone.250 milesINDIACHINAMYANMARIrrawaddy R.LAOSNaypyidawYangonTHAILANDAndaman SeaBy The New York TimesNow, though, the general has been driven off Facebook; the company shut down his accounts in August.Yet the museum remains \u2014 a kind of Facebook profile for his accomplishments, and those of the military.\u201cI think the military wanted to build this massive museum to show off its guardianship of the country,\u201d said U Ye Myo Hein, an executive director at the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a sign of their megalomania.\u201dThe museum sits in the country\u2019s capital, Naypyidaw, itself an even larger show of the military\u2019s long legacy of almost unlimited power in the country.Some have theorized that the new city was created as a safeguard against invasion, and also protests. It has remained the seat of political power, even as the military stepped back and allowed for elections that paved the way for the country\u2019s partial democracy.Fifteen years on, Naypyidaw is a reminder that although the country now has the veneer of democracy, the military retains true power. Much in the city is a testament to its authority and its desire to shape how it is perceived.The monumental buildings seem designed to impress, but mostly they accentuate an overwhelming lack of people.The roads in the city, which in places swell to 16 lanes, would seem unnecessarily huge even with a crush of vehicles, but there is almost no traffic at all, at rush hour or anytime. Motor scooters easily outnumber cars.Driving down them feels like cruising on a runway instead of a highway, and many seem like alternate landing strips for the country\u2019s Air Force in case of war.The Parliament complex, a series of giant concrete structures, has the air of a fortress, with the reservoir surrounding it resembling a moat.A gilded pagoda towers over the nearby jungle. A replica of the country\u2019s famed Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, it stands just a tad shorter than the original to show a smidgen of deference to the sacred Buddhist monument.The military has a self-appointed role as a protector of Buddhism, the majority religion in this country with Muslim and Christian minorities.Yet even in a city filled with reminders of the military\u2019s might, the country\u2019s sprawling Defense Services Museum, set on 600 acres, perhaps best showcases the mind-set of a military force preoccupied with its reputation and showing off its power. Unofficial estimates of the museum\u2019s floor space put its size at around 540,000 square feet, not much smaller than the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\u201cThere are military museums in other countries, but the one in Naypyidaw is way too big in comparison,\u201d Mr. Ye Myo Hein said.A dozen display halls, each easily as big as a football field, show off bombs, mines, machine guns, mortars, warplanes and artillery. Photos of military leaders saluting and congratulating one another are everywhere.Elaborate dioramas portray optimistic versions of the military\u2019s capabilities. One demonstrating the military\u2019s communications capabilities includes a tiny model of an aircraft carrier. Myanmar\u2019s Navy has no aircraft carrier.But aside from groups of soldiers, whose visits are likely mandatory, there are not many people to admire these artifacts. On a recent visit, museum staff members easily outnumbered the civilians wandering the halls, mostly monks in small groups. One attendant said the museum typically has just a few visitors each day, with an occasional school group.Nine Burmese political analysts contacted said they couldn\u2019t talk about the museum \u2014 because none had been there.A military representative declined to discuss details of the museum.For decades the military used newspapers, radio and television to spread propaganda. In the museum\u2019s wing dedicated to psychological warfare, a to-scale model of a television studio recalled those efforts.New technology has both threatened, and amplified, those abilities. As Facebook began to proliferate in the country in 2012, many voices on the platform were anti-military.But Myanmar\u2019s military quickly recognized Facebook\u2019s potential as a convenient way to connect to people, making it an important new tool in an ongoing information war, even if its senior general is no longer allowed on the site.\u201cFacebook is great for propaganda,\u201d said U Myat Thu, a researcher who works to combat hate speech on the site.And while the museum may struggle to attract visitors, the military has figured out how to draw crowds to a far more accessible location: the internet.\u201cNo one watches military television or reads their newspaper,\u201d Mr. Myat Thu said. \u201cBut they do look at social media. And there the military has a big audience.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting from Naypyidaw. Saw Nang contributed reporting from Mandalay, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Ski for Less This Winter", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal travelerThe apps and strategies for singles, families and flexible travelers who want to beat the crowds to the slopes, and still not pay too much.You\u2019re adventurous, have some expendable income and, more important, nothing to prevent you from getting away spontaneously for the weekend. Flexibility is your friend when it comes to planning your ski vacation, and it will help you target some good deals.Users can get ideas from the app and then further whittle down their preferences. For example, I set New York City as my home and looked for three-day getaways to Salt Lake City that began on either a Friday or Saturday. The app yielded a slew of options, one of which was a $326 flight on JetBlue for the first weekend in December.But no app is perfect. When I went to book the flight, the price jumped to $362. During the course of trying different bookings, I encountered inconsistencies with pricing and availability on the app. It was a valuable lesson: It never hurts to cross-reference your in-app or online findings with another site, or directly with an airline or hotel.You\u2019re looking to get away with the entire family, but are somewhat hemmed in by school vacations and swim practice. You\u2019ll likely need to pounce the moment a good deal arises. Another wrinkle: You\u2019re competing with thousands of other parents who are looking to get away at the same time, which will likely include the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day.If you\u2019re watching a particular route or date range closely, I recommend enabling push notifications on your phone \u2014 when prices drop, they don\u2019t always last very long. Hopper and Kayak also allow you to set alerts hotel rooms, in addition to flights.You work a lot, but your main requirements are a laptop and good internet connection. Carving out a week \u2014 or even two \u2014 for a winter sports getaway isn\u2019t entirely out of the question. Take advantage of the time and flexibility you have to get the biggest bang for your buck.A ski vacation is unlikely to be a steal, no matter how you look at it. But with the right approach, you can avoid putting too much of a freeze on your finances.Advertisement"}

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.Of course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly. Just this year, the combined market value of those five companies has tumbled 7 percent or more during three separate periods. In each instance, the stocks resumed their march to fresh highs within weeks.The question now, though, is whether this time will be different.An earlier version of this article misstated the combined market value of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet at the end of August.

{"Headline": "I Was Never an Athlete. Then I Found Running.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingThe sport can be solitary. But you can also find incredible camaraderie racing with a pack.Ms. Moore has run five marathons and 16 half marathons.More than 50,000 runners are expected to take part in the New York City Marathon this Sunday. Some of them will be elite runners chasing glory; the rest will be looking for a personal record or a Boston Marathon qualifying time, or just looking to finish. I won't be doing the marathon this year, but I will be there to cheer the runners on, cowbell in hand. And while I take in this remarkable spectacle, I will also be looking forward to my next race \u2014 and reflecting on how grateful I am to have found a sport like this.For much of my life, sports held little appeal. I spent my time in high school editing newspaper columns and conjugating Latin verbs. The only running I did was when we were forced to slog around our bright blue track for a mile to complete the Presidential Fitness Test. But next April, I will join about 20 percent of my 1994 classmates and run a half-marathon in Nashville to raise money for our school\u2019s scholarship fund. We\u2019ve started a Facebook group to support one another during our training. We share photos of the scenery we encounter on our runs \u2014 for one friend in Georgia, that\u2019s hay bales and the occasional snake; for me, it\u2019s the urban greenery of Prospect Park in Brooklyn \u2014 and encourage each other through injuries and raccoon sightings.I found a Couch to 5K program online and worked my way up to the prescribed 3.1 miles. On my own, without the emphasis on speed or time, I found to my amazement that I enjoyed running. A friend mentioned to me that she was planning to do a half marathon with a charity group \u2014 why didn\u2019t I come to a practice with her and check it out? The next thing I knew, I was training for a half marathon with her. One mile at a time. I was never an athlete. I liked to swim, but floundered on land. I liked gymnastics class, but I\u2019m 5 feet 10 inches tall. I hated all team sports, particularly those scourges of elementary-school recess, kickball and dodgeball. Every mistake caused the failure of an entire group of people, and they weren\u2019t shy about letting me know. I chose my secondary school because it did not require going out for a team.After I ran that first half marathon in San Francisco in 2008, I trained for and ran a marathon. Then I ran the New York City Marathon, twice. I ran a half marathon in less than two hours. I won my age group in a 5K. And when I didn\u2019t succeed, when I was injured or tired or my legs cramped, they told me it was O.K., rest, try again tomorrow or next week or next month. And now I\u2019ve come full circle, back to the classmates who knew me as an awkward teenager, to share in this sport that has become a lifestyle. We are shedding the labels we hid behind as girls and coming into our own on the road.Most of us have young children, and it\u2019s a struggle to find the time to fit our runs in. But as we\u2019ve begun training, our kids are noticing. One woman runs with her teenage daughter; they recently placed in their age groups in their first 5K race. Little boys go out to pace their moms. I\u2019ve started taking my 1-year-old son out once a week in his jogging stroller, which up to this point I\u2019d complained was too heavy, too bulky, too much. Now it\u2019s an essential part of my week.I\u2019ll take him to watch the New York City Marathon on Sunday. I ran the Boston Marathon for charity when I was pregnant with him, and my race bib hangs above his changing table. I want him to see that his mom exercises both because it is fun and because it is necessary, and I want him to find a sport he enjoys as much as I do mine. I\u2019ll tell him how I ran that thrilling 26.2-mile course through the five boroughs twice, and yearn to do it again with him cheering me on. I\u2019ll tell him how running keeps me healthy and happy, and how working with others to compete against yourself is the best of both worlds.Advertisement"}

Brent Taylor, the mayor of North Ogden, Utah, was killed, according to the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, Spencer J. Cox, who expressed shock in announcements on Twitter and Facebook.\u201cI hate this. I\u2019m struggling for words,\u201d Mr. Cox wrote. \u201cI love Mayor Taylor, his amazing wife Jennie and his 7 sweet kids. Utah weeps for them today.\u201dMajor Taylor had taken leave from his position in North Ogden, a city of about 20,000 people, to serve with the Utah National Guard in Afghanistan. \u201cService is really what leadership is all about,\u201d he wrote on Facebook in January before what was to be a year\u2019s deployment.He said the assignment, his fourth deployment, was as part of an advisory team training an Afghan commando battalion.Debra Richardson, a NATO spokeswoman, said in Kabul, the capital, that the gunman appeared to have been a member of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.\u201cThe attacker was immediately killed by other Afghan forces,\u201d she said.NATO had not released the identities or ranks of the service members, or the location of the attack. But United States officials suggested it had occurred at an American special operations forces hub in Kabul that is used as a staging base for missions around the capital and in neighboring provinces.Major Taylor decided to join the military someday after the Sept. 11 attacks while attending Brigham Young University, according to a profile published in January in The Deseret News, a Salt Lake City newspaper. His five brothers also joined the Army in the years after the 2001 attacks, it said.His wife, Jennie Taylor, said in the article that service was an important part of their lives, and an example for their seven children. \u201cI hope they know that in our family, we help,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our family, we do what we can. If it\u2019s something we can do, and the call comes to serve, we say yes.\u201dMajor Taylor urged others to action as well, saying on Facebook in January that whether \u201creading to children at a school, or simply helping a neighbor, there are ways all around us to brighten someone\u2019s day.\u201dLast Sunday in what appeared to be his last Facebook post, he called on all Americans to vote. \u201cWhether the Republicans or the Democrats win,\u201d he said, it is important \u201cthat we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.\u201dAccolades poured out for Major Taylor late Saturday across social media.\u201cHe was the best of men with the ability to see potential and possibility in everything around him,\u201d North Ogden\u2019s website said in announcing his death. It added, \u201cHe was patriotic to the core and a shining example of what an American politician should be.\u201dMitt Romney, the 2012 presidential candidate who is now running for the Senate in Utah, said on Twitter that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the news.The latest attack came as the American military has retreated to a more cautious position following a widespread rumor about the killing of the powerful police chief of Kandahar Province, which has created mistrust with Afghan allies.On Oct. 18, the chief, Gen. Abdul Raziq, was shot dead by a teenage Taliban infiltrator as he was walking out of a meeting with the top American and NATO commander, Gen. Austin S. Miller.General Miller, who was standing steps away, survived a second round fired in the direction of the other dignitaries.It led to tensions with Afghan forces that cast a cloud over the relationship. Afghan and American forces clashed as the American convoy was leaving the compound, with United States forces shooting one Afghan guard dead.The American military has struggled to contain the disinformation, and senior Afghan officials have tried to quash the rumor.The concern peaked after an Afghan commando opened fire on coalition forces on Oct. 22 in the west of the country following what Afghan officials said had been a verbal clash over the killing of General Raziq.Mujib Mashal contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Washington.Advertisement"}

Time to turn the space into a showroom.11 PhotosJohn and Molly Cesarz have three young sons and an insufficient number of bedrooms to go around. This past August, they decided it was time to put their Upper East Side co-op on the market.The couple, who were preparing to close on a four-bedroom co-op nearby but would have to remain in their apartment for a few months, had fully expected such diktats and nodded agreeably.But Mr. Eiden wasn\u2019t finished.He also wanted to rearrange some furniture and temporarily replace several pieces with things he believed would make the space more pleasing to prospective buyers. The list included lamps, a sofa, an area rug, plants and assorted knickknacks.\u201cOur first reaction was \u2018No way,\u2019\u201d recalled Mrs. Cesarz, a high school teacher. As for the couple\u2019s second reaction, well, let\u2019s just say a beloved Oriental rug that once covered the living room floor can now be found tied up in a closet.These days, thanks to New York\u2019s sluggish real estate market, all the world\u2019s staged.Inventory is high, buyers are eager to find fault with a property (get a load of that plaid sectional in the living room and the statue of a shepherdess in the foyer!) and quick to find the exit. Understandably, sellers want to ensure that those prospects \u2014 any prospects! \u2014 stick around long enough to sniff the fresh-baked cookies. Thus, they are living, and not always happily, in the company of unfamiliar sofas, easy chairs, end tables, headboards and tchotchkes, and relegating much of their own furniture to storage.In some instances, the sellers haven\u2019t yet closed on their new homes and would like to skip the bother and the added expense of a short-term rental. And, of course, many people simply can\u2019t afford to carry two properties, so they\u2019ve got no choice but to stay where they are until they\u2019ve lassoed a buyer.When the market was booming, even an estate sale might call for only minimal tweaking. \u201cIf an apartment was in nice condition with a view, you expected prospective buyers to come in and have their own imagination and know how a room could be laid out,\u201d Mr. Moss continued. \u201cNow every apartment has to be prepared for showing.\u201dAnd sellers don\u2019t need a lot of convincing. Disheartening statistics help explain sellers\u2019 willingness to get with the program.But the difficult market isn\u2019t the only driver here. \u201cBecause of HGTV, we\u2019ve become more visually and design-oriented as a society,\u201d Mr. Harkov said. \u201cMany of us are skimming through Pinterest or looking at photos on Facebook, so we expect to see things look a certain way.\u201dIn a nod to the current climate, a stager was engaged to do the living room and master bedroom to the tune of $3,000 a month.Many stagers typically accept jobs only on properties that have been emptied of furniture \u2014 and emptied of occupants. They don\u2019t want the wear and tear on their sofas and rugs; they certainly don\u2019t need the aggravation. But some stagers, loath to miss out on a revenue stream, are taking all comers.Staging for a studio runs about $5,000, including the consultation and installation fees and the cost of renting the furniture for three months (although most staging contracts are for six months). The tab can run $40,000 to outfit a Classic Six, depending on how high end a client wants to go. \u201cEverything we bring in has a price tag,\u201d Ms. Lorenz said.Of course, storing a seller\u2019s furniture has a price tag too. Done & Done, a move management and organizing company, charges $400 and up each month, depending on the size of the storage room, said Ann Lightfoot, a founder of the company.If an apartment sells \u2014 mirabile dictu \u2014 on its very first day on the market, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Ms. Lorenz said. \u201cBut our contract still holds in its entirety because of all the work we already put into the project.\u201dMs. Guinnessey has also seen an uptick in requests for, say, a headboard but no mattress or a dining table but no chairs to go with it. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of order from a stager that tells me someone is still living in the apartment,\u201d she said.Stagers face a particular set of challenges when working on an owner-occupied apartment \u2014 the biggest being the presence of the owner and the owner\u2019s stuff.When the seller hasn\u2019t moved out, \u201cyou\u2019re working with what\u2019s in the apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people may have a navy easy chair and a maroon sofa, and I think, \u2018Hmmm, now what am I going to do? Maybe I\u2019ll bring in white pillows or a white rug to make the room feel lighter and brighter.\u2019\u201dIn some instances, stagers working on an owner-occupied apartment will charge an additional fee to cover wear and tear on the furniture and accessories. Ms. Lorenz has just instituted a 10 percent security deposit on every item from her own inventory. She and several fellow stagers have also established some new terms of engagement. Ms. Lorenz, for instance, will not stage an owner-occupied apartment that has pets. And if she puts a bunch of wine glasses on the bar for show, she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want clients to use the glasses.\u201d \u201cI have to tell people all the time that they don\u2019t get a vote about the kind of couch or end table I\u2019m going to use, and I have to be very firm on that point,\u201d she said. \u201cI explain to them the difference between interior design, which is for a specific taste, and staging, which has to have broad appeal. That\u2019s our expertise.\u201dLast month, partly in response to the softening market, Compass introduced Compass Concierge, a service that assumes the costs of decluttering, painting and staging clients\u2019 apartments; the cost is repaid by the sellers at closing. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important in this climate to put your apartment in the best light,\u201d said Samantha Lynch, the senior director of corporate development and strategic finance at Compass. \u201cThe program lets sellers invest in their homes while we assume the upfront costs.\u201dIn some cases, real estate agents themselves will take on the role of ad hoc stager, in the interest of saving a client both the cost of furniture rental and the staging fees charged by the professionals.Ms. Beauchamp, of Engel & Volkers, has a cache of chairs, lamps, glassware, vases and multiple sets of bed linens that she keeps in her own apartment and deploys gratis to dress up residences that she finds wanting. \u201cIt tells clients \u2018I\u2019m in this with you,\u2019\u201d she said.Mr. Eiden, of Compass, rents a few storage spaces to hold a collection of furniture and accessories (much of it from Wayfair) sufficient to outfit four two- or three-bedroom apartments. \u201cI don\u2019t charge my sellers anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all-inclusive of my commission. That\u2019s how important it is to me.\u201dSellers accept the invasion of the end tables and accent chairs with varying degrees of enthusiasm. \u201cInitially, people are a little bit worried to sit on the sofa that isn\u2019t theirs. They\u2019re a little intimidated by the whole setup,\u201d Ms. Kenney said. \u201cBut several of our sellers have thrown parties because the place looks so darn good they want people to come and see it.\u201dMrs. Cesarz, Mr. Eiden\u2019s client, described her staged apartment as \u201cfeeling institutional.\u201d She isn\u2019t wild about all the throw pillows on the bed, and she doesn\u2019t care a whit for the blue-and-white area rug that has taken the place of her Oriental. \u201cBut it probably photographs well,\u201d she said.But Mark Mayo and My My Tntien, the parents of two young children, were only too happy for Mr. Eiden to have his way with their two-bedroom apartment in South Park Slope. \u201cA lot of our furniture is stained with baby vomit and milk,\u201d said Mr. Mayo, 40, a data engineer. \u201cMartin showed us a couple of sofa styles, and he let us choose.\u201d Mr. Eiden also switched out the coffee table and TV stand and staged the couple\u2019s roof deck, adding a Buddha statue, an outdoor rug and plants. \u201cWe had to water them and everything,\u201d Mr. Mayo said of the plants. Listed at $869,000, the apartment recently sold for $800,000.\u201cMartin told me I would have to lose my sectional and maybe the dining table,\u201d said Alex Hall, 43, whose Mercer Street duplex recently went on the market for $1.5 million. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised that he and his team kept a couple of my things here,\u201d added Mr. Hall, who works in the tech sector. \u201cI mostly love what they\u2019ve done, even though my apartment is no longer perfectly set up for slouching around and watching a movie marathon.\u201dOccasionally, a staged apartment looks so good that sellers rethink their decision to move. One of Ms. Kenney\u2019s first projects was an owner-occupied two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. The clients were suburbia bound.\u201cThe apartment wasn\u2019t set up well,\u201d Ms. Kenney said. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t designers; they just do the best they can. We had the sellers take a lot of stuff out, then we rearranged everything and brought in accent pillows and bedding.\u201dShe continued: \u201cAnd when we got done, they said, \u2018This is so great. We\u2019re not going to move.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018I am never going to work in this town again!\u2019\u201d Three months later, the couple decided, on second thought, that they really did need more space.Mr. Eiden recalled a similar experience, when the owners of a three-bedroom duplex in Chelsea said to him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad at us. The apartment looks super great, and we don\u2019t want to sell it.\u201d He had decluttered their apartment, brought in lighting and a clutch of throw pillows, and rearranged the furniture to better define the space. \u201cI made more than my commission back with all the referrals they\u2019ve given me,\u201d Mr. Eiden said.But with staging, as with weight-loss products, results may vary. \u201cI don\u2019t think, in this market, we can guarantee that if you stage you will get X amount more dollars or a bidding war or even the asking price,\u201d said Ms. Larson, of Warburg. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this is a buyer\u2019s market with a lot of competition, and we need to check every box we can.\u201dStill, staging does have one invaluable benefit: Like packing up the pots and pans and books and linens, it\u2019s another, well, stage in the letting-go of home sweet home and the moving-on process.\u201cI really think staging in an owner-occupied apartment helps people detach from the property,\u201d said Ms. Beauchamp, of Engel & Volkers. \u201cThen it becomes a commodity that we\u2019re trying to sell for the best price possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brazil, Animals Cross a Road of No Return", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHighway BR-262 is among the deadliest in the world for wildlife. Biologist Wagner Fischer has been monitoring its grim toll for more than two decades.Whenever Wagner Fischer drives, he notices the roadkill.As a graduate student in the 1990s, Dr. Fischer, now a biologist with the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, traveled through Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, a tropical wetland the size of Wisconsin, and the largest freshwater wetland in the world. From his motorcycle, he saw monkeys swinging from roadside trees; capybaras slept on the shoulder. He was looking for fishing bats, the subject of his graduate research. But he was fascinated and appalled by the roadside carnage: caimans, anacondas, giant black-necked storks called jabirus and, once, a dead giant anteater with her cub, still alive, clutching her back. The region\u2019s main road, the BR-262, is a long thread of tarmac through the carpet of green, connecting the growing cities of Campo Grande and Corumb\u00e1, 430 miles apart. Dr. Fischer began taking photographs, thousands of them, and tallying the species along the road. He shared his unpublished results with other researchers and government officials. \u201cEveryone from the scientific community kept asking me, \u2018When are you going to publish that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Fischer recalled recently. The highway rises from the surrounding wetlands like an island, tempting wildlife, Dr. Fischer said: \u201cIt\u2019s a trap for fauna, and they don\u2019t know the risk.\u201dThe Pantanal is filigreed with rivers and streams that flood during the rainy season. Much of it is enclosed in the southwestern state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which increasingly is quilted with cattle ranches and soybean farms. Over the years, Dr. Fischer\u2019s colleagues began noticing a steady rise in the roadkill figures.Throughout Brazil, roads are littered with carcasses representing the country\u2019s 1,775 bird species and 623 mammal species. Large mammals are at greater risk in southern Brazil, including the Pantanal and dry savanna, whereas birds are at higher risk in the Amazon, according to Manuela Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez, a biologist at the University of Reading in England. \u201cWhen I got the total number, I was just completely blown away,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cOut of these 8 million birds, maybe some of those are fairly common ones, where maybe this is not a problem. But we don\u2019t know, exactly. Are we going to lose all birds in Brazil? Probably no. But it would be nice to know, what should we be worried about?\u201dEcologists worry that the problem will soon worsen. Brazil is home to 20 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity, but the newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to develop large tracts of the country\u2019s most ecologically sensitive areas. Now that Mr. Fischer\u2019s data are in the scientific literature, other researchers can more easily compare it with current data and identify trends, said Arnaud Desbiez, a conservation biologist with the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, and a co-author of the 2017 study. Dr. Desbiez also runs Brazil\u2019s Giant Armadillo Conservation Project and a related program called Anteaters and Highways. Ideally, he said, the data would inform government efforts to lessen the carnage. Over the years, Dr. Fischer has shared his unpublished data with state officials and urged them, to little effect, to build a system of bridges and underpasses that would let animals cross roads safely.\u201cFischer\u2019s data were very complete, and it was a very well done study, so it\u2019s sad to see that it hasn\u2019t been used as much as it should have,\u201d Dr. Desbiez said. \u201cA lot of things he suggested have not been implemented. This is not a new problem, but something he demonstrated existed a long time ago.\u201dDr. Fischer said: \u201cEcologists are very worried. The authorities pretend to be worried.\u201dBrazilian officials have taken some basic measures. White metal signs, bearing silhouettes of armadillos and giant anteaters, appear on the roadside every few miles, advising motorists to \u201cRespect Wild Life\u201d and \u201cPreserve the Pantanal.\u201d But signs are easily ignored, especially in the rush of freight-hauling and daily life, ecologists say. Dr. Desbiez favors fencing that keeps animals off the pavement and guides them toward safe passages under or over the road.Fraser Shilling, director of the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis, helped develop a real-time deer-collision map, which connects to a car or phone app that can warn drivers when to be on high alert. A recent seminar that taught other officials how to build their such maps drew representatives from 42 states, Dr. Shilling said.Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez is now studying individual species to figure out the impact on local populations. For mammals, especially those who reproduce slowly and in small numbers, the loss of a few individuals could have devastating effects, Mr. Desbiez noted.Monitoring roadkill is important for more than accounting purposes, said Dr. Shilling. Roads are the primary way in which most people interact with wildlife, yet traffic collisions with animals are wildly underreported, he said. Measuring the scale of death is a way to remind people that our footprint is much larger than the carbon dioxide we emit or the waste we produce.\u201cThe first part is discovering that there is a problem,\u201d he said.Dr. Gonzalez-Suarez said that deforestation poses a greater threat to Amazonian biodiversity than a new road does, but the two are linked, she added; new roads are built to harvest wood, and to transport grain and livestock from expanding farmlands.\u201cFor me, the biggest concern as a conservation biologist is the loss of habitat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see roads as necessary, but we need to acknowledge they come with a cost. These are animals that should not be killed. They are only dying because there is a road in there and we drive on it.\u201dDr. Fischer so far has avoided hitting any large animals in his travels, but a couple of birds have not been so fortune. He once struck a seriema, a terrestrial bird that resembles a roadrunner on stilts, and he collided with a parakeet while riding his motorcycle. He hopes that his historical record can help other biologists, and other Brazilians, reckon with the destructive capability of the roads they\u2019re on.\u201cBrazil is a big country with a lot of problems to solve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are trying to make a difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of Turkey Brining", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDear Thanksgiving cooks of America: On behalf of food writers everywhere, I apologize.But like the length of a trouser leg, turkey fashion shifts. Interviews with the big players in food media over the past few weeks suggest that the wet, salty turkey has lost its appeal among many of the people who once did the most to promote it.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to admit evolution has occurred with my cooking, and I\u2019ll go on record as someone who has a great brine recipe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut right now I am in a no-brining phase.\u201d Why the change of heart on brining? \u201cIt\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s wonky. It\u2019s ambitious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t always love the texture.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s essentially koshering,\u201d said Miriam Morgan, the food editor who oversaw the newspaper\u2019s project. Now retired, she will be brining again this year, as she has ever since that recipe was developed.\u201cThe reason I think it all started was because back then pretty much all we had were mass-produced turkey, which had no flavor, so you were trying to put more flavor and moisture back into the turkey,\u201d she said. \u201cThe turkey is delicious, so end of story.\u201dThanksgiving brining recipes flourished through the early 2000s, when Cook\u2019s Illustrated issued a definitive endorsement of the method. Christopher Kimball, its former editor, said brining was the most popular turkey method the magazine had ever developed when he led America\u2019s Test Kitchen.That\u2019s in no small part because the process was ready-made for writers who wanted to dig deep into its scientific side. Articles explained how sodium attaches itself to intertwined muscle proteins, weakens them and makes them separate so salty water can force itself deeper into the turkey and stay there. Brined fibers don\u2019t contract as much when they cook, and hold more moisture.\u201cSince I cook Thanksgiving in Vermont, I have a tiny kitchen and one not-too-large fridge, so there ain\u2019t no room for it,\u201d he wrote in a recent email. \u201cI just braise the bloody thing.\u201d\u201cI was saying brining works, if you\u2019re O.K. with watery meat, essentially,\u201d he explained in a recent interview.Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s tests involved cooking and analyzing three turkey breasts and 24 chicken breasts in various states of salting. Brining, he contended, gives poultry the texture of luncheon meat. In addition, the molecules in cider, herbs and other flavorings are too large to penetrate the membrane surrounding the meat before the salt molecules do, and so they fail to carry much flavor into the turkey.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s useless,\u201d he said of wet-brining, \u201cbut it\u2019s not worth the effort, because I think you get better results from dry-brining.\u201dWhat you might call the dry-brine era began quietly in 2006, when Russ Parsons, then a former (and future) food editor at The Los Angeles Times, was desperate for a new approach to holiday turkey.On Mr. Parsons\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Rodgers tried dry-brining and liked it. In homage, he called it the Judy Bird. The method could not be simpler: Use a tablespoon of salt for each five pounds of meat. Rub it into the breasts and thighs, sprinkle some inside and let the turkey sit in the refrigerator for a few days. Allow it to air-dry in the fridge for eight hours if you want the skin crisper.The result is well-seasoned, succulent meat without the hassle of all that water and the salt-choked drippings. You can even dry-brine a frozen turkey while it thaws, he discovered.But it was clear that wet-brining was on its way out, and this year it seems to have hit bottom. Even dry-brining is losing its appeal in some households. Time seems more precious than ever. Politics have exhausted us all. Perhaps it\u2019s time to simplify.The trick, he explained, is to treat the meat the way barbecue pit masters treat pork: Cook it low and slow, so the proteins don\u2019t seize up and squeeze out moisture, then thinly slice the white meat (to an eighth of an inch if you can) and soak it in a jus made with wine, stock and drippings.It\u2019s easy enough to recreate the effect in the kitchen. Simply roast the turkey at 325 degrees on a rack over a roasting pan until the thigh hits about 160 degrees. (Mr. Goldwyn suggests just roasting the turkey on the oven rack itself, with a pan below it to catch juices. Proceed with that at your own risk, or just use your V-rack and call it a day.)While the turkey roasts, simmer the ingredients for the jus on the stove. Then mix the drippings into the jus. You can even save some of the jus to whisk into a roux for gravy, which you\u2019ll want for mashed potatoes and traditionalists.Still, that method may end up going the way of turkey trends past.

{"Headline": "Vote, Vote, Vote!", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou have to ask yourself: Do you want a Congress full of Trump puppets?Opinion ColumnistAllow me to make a few requests of you in advance of Tuesday\u2019s elections.First, dispense with all of the distractions and the deceit.Donald Trump is openly trying to weaponize racism, to inflame passions and stoke fear. He wants America to focus on a caravan of refugees almost 700 miles away rather than to see clearly the corruption and cravenness right in front of our faces.Tune out, for the moment, the torrent of lies coming from Trump.Instead, focus on your principles.Focus on the numbness you felt on Election Day 2016, the feeling of horror and disbelief that Trump would actually assume the presidency, the way you stumbled though the days that followed, a pained, hollowed-out shell of yourself.Remember the reason that you showed up, pussy hat-adorned, for the Women\u2019s March, or the March for Our Lives following the horrific high school shooting in Parkland, Fla.Remember that feeling of honor and solidarity you felt when you saw those who took a knee on a football field or stood up at Standing Rock.Remember Trump\u2019s pathetically insufficient response to the suffering of brown American citizens in Puerto Rico and his outrageously hyperbolic response to suffering brown Central American refugees still in Mexico.Remember that Nazis, white supremacists, white nationalists and all manner of racists seem to be quite pleased with Trump\u2019s ascension.\u201cWe are determined to take our country back.\u201dHe continued:\u201cWe are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That\u2019s what we believe in. That\u2019s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he\u2019s going to take our country back.\u201dRemember how you felt when Trump said that there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides in Charlottesville.Remember how it felt back when, even if you disagreed with the president, sometimes vehemently, you still didn\u2019t think he was a demagogue and demi-fascist.Remember when the press \u2014 and the truth itself \u2014 wasn\u2019t under constant assault by a president who is a liar of a quality and scale that we have never seen before.Remember how you felt when you heard Trump bragging on tape that he enjoyed assaulting women, when multiple women stepped forward who claimed to have been sexually assaulted by Trump and when conservatives, including the so-called \u201creligious right,\u201d dismissed it all.Remember the disgust you felt at seeing people held at airports due to Trump\u2019s Muslim ban and seeing children ripped from their parents and locked in cages due to Trump\u2019s family separation policy at the border.Remember how you feel every time you see a Trump rally and recoil as his hyped-up base falls further into his thrall, excited and entertained by his animus and depravity.And now remember that through it all, Republicans in Congress have averted their gaze, silently or openly acquiescing, or even cheering.Republicans bore witness just like the rest of us to Trump\u2019s hatred, racism, division, corruption and mendacity, but instead of rejecting him, they embraced him. They became his flunkies and minions, his accomplices and his defenders. There is now no daylight separating the Republicans in Congress from the man who occupies the presidency.So, you have to ask yourself: Do you want a Congress full of Trump puppets?Do you want a Congress that refuses to hold Trump accountable, who would halfheartedly investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russia and who would halfheartedly investigate a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court?Do you want a Congress that will be a rubber stamp for Trump\u2019s ill-conceived policies and will help him remake the American judiciary in ways that could take generations to undo?Do you want a Congress that has continuously voted to do precisely what Trump wants to do: destroy the Affordable Care Act?Is this the country you thought it was or could be, or are Trump and Republicans in Congress making a mockery of your America?I say, enough is enough!Someone has to protect this country, our institutions and our traditions. We have to stand up for honesty, principles, equality and civility.The Constitution offers avenues for political change in this country, but the paramount one is at the ballot.

Instead, I signed up for my cable company\u2019s three-way service \u2014 Internet, phone and cable TV \u2014 for under $200 a month.But then a big storm hit California the other day. As all connections to the outside world went dead, my daughters reminded me that we are not a family with pioneer spirit.\u201cThat computer isn\u2019t going to help you,\u201d my husband said, raising his voice to be heard above the winds rattling the windows. \u201cWe have no Internet.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cThat\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d asked Clementine, 10, whose relationship with instant messaging can best be described as dependence. Her typing fingers were already starting to twitch like unearthed worms.Advertisement\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he must mean \u2018slow\u2019 Internet,\u201d Zoe, 18, said. \u201cBecause I need to check my Facebook.\u201d\u201cNo In-ter-net,\u201d my husband repeated, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t you care that the lights are out, the furnace is off and my beer is getting warm?\u201d\u201cNo Internet,\u201d Clementine repeated. \u201cI am going to die.\u201dTell me about it. I work at home. And like the 28 million other Americans who work from home at least part of the time (a figure provided by  the Dieringer Research Group in Wisconsin), I am trying to maintain a semblance of professionalism here.The rest of my family relies on the Internet for entertainment. I depend on it for survival. Take away my access to e-mail and online databases, and I\u2019m nothing but a lonely woman sitting in a cold basement.Sometimes, of course, a disruption is unavoidable. During the recent storm, when more than a million Bay Area customers lost electricity and virtually my whole town went dark, not even the local banks were online.But for me, the real problems began the next day after power was restored: for some reason I still couldn\u2019t get online. I looked at the cable modem. Instead of the usual mind-numbing galaxy of blinking lights, there were only two.AdvertisementEight lights, good.Two lights, bad.My daughters stumbled through breakfast like zombies. Then Zoe went back to bed (\u201cWhat else is there to do?\u201d); Ella barricaded herself in her room as a protest; Clementine drew pictures of computers with screens that said, \u201cSave me.\u201dI felt helpless. I\u2019d already missed a deadline the previous day when I was unable to e-mail a magazine story I had promised to an editor. Would I ever be able to file it? And I needed to confirm the itinerary for a looming business trip. Otherwise, how would I know which plane to board?I called Comcast for help on my cellphone. But as I listened to the recorded message \u2014 Comcast was aware of the problems in my area, but couldn\u2019t say when they would be fixed \u2014 I started to wonder if life had any purpose whatsoever.\u201cNo Internet,\u201d I said. \u201cI am going to die.\u201dAfter awhile, as I lay with my eyes closed, thinking bleak thoughts, I started to hear the cheery rattling sound of a power cord being tossed across the floor.I risked a peek. My husband, leaning out the kitchen window to dangle a cord down the side of the house, said, \u201cI have an idea.\u201dPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.I love when he says that.\u201cRemember that other Internet service you were going to test a few months ago?\u201d he asked.Vaguely. I sat up as he fiddled with another modem, one that a technician had installed last fall when, after the sixth time my Comcast service went out in less than a year, I had decided to explore alternative Internet connections.It was all coming back to me now. For review purposes, the data communications provider Covad, which specializes in business-class DSL broadband service, had installed a free line at my house.I never got serious about the review, though, possibly because the arrival of a backup connection had scared my Comcast connection into behaving. In the absence of problems with the cable connection, the high price of the Covad service \u2014 which at $174.95 a month would cost nearly as much just for Internet as three-way Comcast service \u2014 seemed like an unnecessary luxury.AdvertisementSo the only use the Covad line had  was when, for a brief period, my daughters conducted \u201craces\u201d to see if it was any faster than the Comcast connection when it came to watching YouTube videos. After they realized that any difference in speed could be measured only in fractions of seconds, they lost interest.Now I asked my husband, \u201cYou mean Covad never pulled the plug on the line?\u201d\u201cAll the modem lights are on,\u201d he said. \u201cGo downstairs, pull the cord in the window and see if it reaches to your desk.\u201dIt did.\u201cWe have Internet,\u201d I whispered. Actually, I might have shrieked \u2014 I don\u2019t really remember anything but a rush of pure happiness \u2014 because within seconds, every member of my family arrived at my side. They peered over my shoulder, giddy at the prospect of the most glorious sight in the world:  the Google home page.Within minutes, my husband figured out how to transfer our entire household wireless network from the Comcast service to the Covad line. Everyone retreated to respective laptops throughout the house. My husband settled in to watch the previous night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate on YouTube in the kitchen.Two days later, a few hours after the cable connection finally started working again, I called Michael Doherty, a Covad spokesman, to describe the situation.\u201cDid I just get lucky with the Covad line or is there a reason it kept working when the Comcast cable connection failed?\u201d I asked him.\u201cI have to be honest,\u201d Mr. Doherty said. \u201cSince we ran the line to your house over the phone wires, if a tree had gone down and severed that line, you wouldn\u2019t have it, either. And if your electrical power stayed out, your Covad modem wouldn\u2019t work, either.\u201d\u201cUnless I bought a generator,\u201d I said.The main difference between the business-class Covad line and the cheaper residential-grade service I had  from Comcast was customer service, Mr. Doherty said.Advertisement\u201cYou have business grade, and with that comes a service agreement that if it goes out, we\u2019re out there within 36 hours to fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe generally try to do it faster.\u201dFor bulletproof customer service, the higher price would be worth it. Frankly, I am tempted to cancel all three aspects of the Comcast service and rely solely on the Internet. After all, my family \u201cwatches TV\u201d mainly at Web sites that rebroadcast \u2014 legally and illegally \u2014 television shows. We make most of our phone calls via Skype or on cellphones.As I thought about it, I finally started to feel a surge of pioneer spirit, 21st-century style.E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.comGo to Home Page \u00bb"}
{"Headline": "In Florida Recount Fight, Democratic Lawyer Draws Plaudits and Fire", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He has been accused of rigging the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries to thwart Bernie Sanders and facilitating a deluge of big money into politics. He helped arrange financing for the dossier of sometimes salacious and unverified claims about President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and now is under direct fire from the president, who has said he is trying to steal the Senate race in Florida from the Republican candidate, Gov. Rick Scott.For an election lawyer, Marc E. Elias has drawn unusually intense attention and criticism.But then, Mr. Elias, who is representing Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the Florida recount, has been at the center of an unusually large number of high-stakes political fights.The work has yielded tens of millions of dollars in legal fees for his firm, Perkins Coie, from corporations, campaigns and political committees. In the process, Mr. Elias has earned a reputation as one of the most formidable election lawyers in the country, and arguably one of the most influential of unelected Democrats in Washington.That approach, however, has earned him the ire of activists who support increased transparency and decreased money in politics. They say he has been among the biggest impediments to both causes, and has often put the short-term interests of the Democratic Party ahead of the interests of the party\u2019s base, and even of American democracy more broadly.\u201cHe\u2019s doing really important work for voting rights that benefits all voters, but he\u2019s also pushed for a deregulation of money in politics that serves the interests of the wealthy,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation for the nonpartisan government watchdog group Common Cause.Yet Common Cause and other government-reform groups have consistently opposed Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to shape campaign finance rules, through legislative maneuvering, Federal Election Commission filings and court cases, to allow his clients to raise more money with fewer restrictions.In some ways, Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to expand big-money fund-raising and spending undermine his efforts to protect and expand voting access, said Craig Holman, an official at the government watchdog group Public Citizen.\u201cWhile he supports leveling the playing field when it comes to the right to vote, it\u2019s ironic that he opposes any legislation or policies that would level the playing field when it comes to money in politics,\u201d Mr. Holman said. \u201cMarc does not understand that in a world of unlimited and undisclosed money in politics, the Republicans generally hold a strategic advantage.\u201dRight now, though, the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership and base appear united in cheering for Mr. Elias\u2019s aggressive tactics in the Florida recount, and galvanized by Republican attacks on him.In announcing his role leading the recount efforts last week, Mr. Elias declared that \u201cwe believe that at the end of this process, Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner.\u201dThat prompted umbrage on the right, with Governor Scott asserting it proved that Mr. Elias did not care about a fair recount, and was, in fact, \u201chere to steal this election.\u201dThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, one of Mr. Elias\u2019s clients, has gone so far as to send out summaries of the coverage of Mr. Elias\u2019s conference calls with reporters, a treatment more typically reserved for the candidates themselves.\u201cMarc is a very smart campaign finance and election lawyer, but his legal positions are usually designed to serve the best interests of his Democratic Party clients in winning elections rather than any particular legal principle,\u201d said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer who has worked against Mr. Elias in several recounts, including in Florida.Mr. Elias did not respond to requests to be interviewed.A fast-talking native of Rockland County, N.Y., Mr. Elias, 49, joined the Washington office of Perkins Coie shortly after graduating from the Duke University Law School in 1993.He rose through the ranks to become a partner, joining with the head of the firm\u2019s political practice, Robert F. Bauer, to build Perkins Coie into the dominant Democratic firm in the lucrative election law industry.The firm has been paid nearly $80 million since 2001 by federal candidates and committees, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Those fees, which do not include the millions more paid by nonprofit groups represented by Mr. Elias, are most likely rising further with the Florida recount, in which several of his clients are active.He brought a team from Perkins Coie with him to Orlando, where its members set up a command center in the building that housed Mr. Nelson\u2019s campaign headquarters, though the team has since moved to another building. They have filed lawsuits on behalf of several clients, including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which sued to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots to be counted. And Mr. Elias filed suit on behalf of the Nelson campaign challenging the state\u2019s ballot signature-validation process as unconstitutional.\u201cElias is a really sharp, credible attorney,\u201d said Jon Soltz, a co-founder of VoteVets, another group that signed on to one of his lawsuits in Florida. \u201cIf you\u2019re credible and you\u2019re dangerous to the president, his playbook is to attack. So Marc Elias should wear this as a badge of honor that he\u2019s being effective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mystery of the Midterm Elections: Where Are the Russians?", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Shane Huntley has seen every form of state-sponsored cyberattack, first as an Australian intelligence officer and now as director of Google\u2019s most advanced team of threat detectors.So when he was asked what surprised him the most about the 2018 midterm elections, his response was a bit counterintuitive. \u201cThe answer is surprisingly little on the hacking front, at least compared to two years ago.\u201d He paused, and added: \u201cAnd that reassures some people, and it scares some people.\u201dHe is right. From the cyberwar room that the Department of Homeland Security runs round the clock in a bland office building in Arlington, Va., to Microsoft\u2019s threat-assessment center at the other end of the country, in Redmond, Wash., every form of digital radar is being focused on America\u2019s election infrastructure \u2014 and particularly on the Russian military intelligence agency once known as the G.R.U.This weekend, some of those radars began to sound a few warnings \u2014 but faintly, and in strange places. Cybersecurity firms and some election officials reported seeing an increase in cyberattacks on websites and infrastructure surrounding the vote, but not on systems that are part of the voting process. Hackers have targeted websites across the United States \u2014 including in Georgia, Florida and California \u2014 that allow voters to look up the location of their local polling stations or to verify that they are registered to vote.It is unclear where the attacks are coming from, but the sources appear to be a mix, everything from other countries to lone hackers looking to make a name for themselves, investigators say. \u201cThe attackers are trying to make a lot of noise,\u201d said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a cybersecurity firm that is tracking the action.He said the incursions were not an effort to disrupt the vote, but merely to bolster rumors of election fraud and interference. \u201cThey are going after anything that can undermine the process itself,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir aim is to put the outcome in doubt,\u201d which could enable President Trump or losing candidates, come Wednesday, to declare that the outcome was rigged.There is no evidence yet that the Russians have had anything to do with this latest set of malicious activities, and many experts say they believe that President Vladimir V. Putin is sitting out this election. After all, the argument goes, the scrutiny is intense, and 470 House and Senate races make it just too hard for the Russians to figure out their interests, much less manipulate the outcome. But after the 2016 debacle, suspicions run deep, and some think that the Russians just haven\u2019t played their hand yet.Whether a Russian change of tactics is unfolding is just one of many mysteries surrounding this first national election in the United States after the most sophisticated effort ever discovered to divide Americans, and ultimately seek to alter the outcome, by a foreign power.If there is a lesson from 2016, it was that America was constantly taken by surprise \u2014 by the hacking of the D.N.C. and prominent Democrats, by the publication of internal emails, by efforts to get inside the voter-registration rolls of 20 states. In 2018, there are new and different warning signs: The Iranians have shown up, and states and local governments have done surprisingly little to harden their infrastructure. The Chinese are players, but not in the ways that President Trump and Vice President Pence have suggested.And the Russians haven\u2019t exactly gone away. While there are few signs of pre-election intrusions into voter-registration systems, the social media campaigns never ended; some accelerated immediately after the 2016 elections. When the United States indicted Maria Butina, a Russian who was accused of running influence campaigns while an American University student, the government suspected Russian groups budgeted millions of dollars for continuing influence campaigns.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised by any of this,\u201d Mr. Huntley said last week at a Zeitgeist, an annual gathering of the company\u2019s leadership and many of its customers outside of Phoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s like fighting the last war. When I was in the military academy people told us all the next wars were going to look like the first Gulf War. They didn\u2019t. And in cyber, the next war won\u2019t look like 2016.\u201dSo in the last days of the campaign, here are six points from the 2018 cyberpolitical battlefield:In 2016, the Iranians were nowhere to be seen in the American election process. This year, they showed up in such force that Facebook announced last Friday that it was taking down a series of Iranian posts, mostly, it seemed, to demonstrate that the company\u2019s radar, switched off two years ago, is now on high alert.Intelligence officials and cybersecurity companies say the Iranians mostly appear to be copying techniques that they learned from watching the Russians, especially in social media. But there is a twist: The Russians and the Iranians are clearly not in political agreement here. While both have sought to exacerbate political and social divides, the Russians clearly showed a preference for Mr. Trump as Election Day approached, according to the conclusions published after the election by American intelligence agencies.The Iranians are playing the other side. \u201cThey don\u2019t like what happened to the nuclear deal,\u201d Yasmin Green, the director of research and development for Jigsaw, a unit of Alphabet, which is Google\u2019s parent company. Speaking at a TimesTalks event held by The New York Times and Deloitte on Tuesday night in Washington, Ms. Green, one of the country\u2019s leading experts on the uses and abuses of social media, noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of drastic sanctions, has made the Iranians determined to cripple him.\u201cNot only are they anti-this administration,\u201d she said, they are \u201cpro-liberal.\u201dBy comparison to the Russians, the Iranian hackers are still pretty unsophisticated and are largely inept at imitating down-the-street-neighbors when posting to Facebook and Reddit. One ad showed a frowning Mr. Trump, and declared him \u201cThe Worst, Most Hated President in American History,\u201d the kind of extreme declaration one might expect of Mr. Trump himself. Others sought to undercut American confidence in the way Washington operates, by showing two men shaking hands above a conference table and passing money below it. (\u201cWe call it bribery \u2014 they call it lobbying.\u201dSo it is no surprise, said Tom Burt, the vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft, that the most active battleground is, once again, Ukraine. In the Microsoft Cybercrime Center, a giant digital map of the world shows cyberattack activity, but the number of attacks are adjusted for the size of the population. Ukraine shows up in bright red. The United States, with 330 million people, or seven times the population of Ukraine, shows up in white, a sign of relative calm.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing activity in the U.S., but we\u2019re seeing it at levels less than we saw in 2016, said Mr. Burt, cautioning that Microsoft, with its network of machines using Office software and its Azure cloud computing services, is more likely to see hacking of accounts than social media activity.Still, Mr. Burt\u2019s group alerted two senators last year that a hacking group long linked to the G.R.U. had attacked their Capitol Hill offices, unsuccessfully. It was unclear if the goal was to affect their re-election campaigns or get into emails, because both sit on national-security-related committees. One of the senators was Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who is considered highly vulnerable. Microsoft also detected intrusions on two politically conservative think tanks in Washington in August.To get a sense of what is coming to the United States, Ms. Green and Jigsaw\u2019s chief executive, Jared Cohen, a former State Department official, visited Ukraine in recent weeks and found that it was still Mr. Putin\u2019s petri dish, a place where sophisticated new experiments were underway to deluge separatist parts of the country with disinformation ahead of military actions and a presidential election next March. Ukraine is \u201calways on the leading edge,\u201d she concluded.The question of China\u2019s involvement was raised first by Mr. Trump and then by Mr. Pence, who said in a speech that \u201cBeijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans\u2019 perception of Chinese policies,\u201d and said a \u201csenior career member of our intelligence community recently told me what the Russians are doing pales in comparison\u201d to Chinese interference.But Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were borrowing the terminology of cyberattacks to describe something very different: Efforts by China to publish policy arguments, often in newspaper supplements that have been paid for by the Chinese government for years, to make its case. There is no evidence, officials and outside experts say, of the kind of hacking that Russia has engaged in, or even much social-media use. (In Asia and Australia, in contrast, the Chinese have been busy on social media.)When three Democratic senators asked Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, for an unclassified letter explaining what the Chinese were doing in the 2018 election, to truth-test the administration\u2019s arguments, Mr. Coats avoided any potential contradictions with his boss by sending a classified answer.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said. Mr. Coats, he said, \u201chas an obligation to the American people to provide a public response to our questions, particularly since this is about America\u2019s elections and the security of our democracy.\u201dIf awards were handed out for most-bungled-election-machine-management, Texas would be a strong contender for the top prize. It\u2019s just that the problem is the machines or the voters, not Mr. Putin\u2019s hackers.Bad publicity followed, and Texas blamed voters who couldn\u2019t keep their hands off the machines, which were decades old. But in these nervous times, the incident underscored how susceptible many election machines are to quirks. That is another reason that paper backup for electronic voting machines is so important, so that voters can look over their selections, and so vote-counters have a nonelectronic way of conducting a recount, if the machines cannot be trusted.One would think that after all the concerns in 2016, states and counties would have been racing to update their systems. \u201cMost did almost nothing,\u201d Douglas Lute, a former American ambassador to NATO and Army general, who has taken up the cause of reforming the election infrastructure, said in an interview. The $380 million that Congress allotted recently mostly went to funding assessments of vulnerabilities.Yet while states and counties made changes, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana still use no paper backup, and parts of Pennsylvania, a vital swing state, do not either. That has not changed since 2016, and it is unclear that it will be solved by 2020.The vulnerabilities of voting machines have gotten a lot of attention, especially at the Def Con conference over the summer in Las Vegas, which drew 25,000 hackers. At the conference\u2019s Voting Village, it took an 11-year-old just minutes to hack into a voting machine using a simulation of Florida\u2019s system. (The machine\u2019s manufacturers called it a stunt, noting that physical security of the machines at Def Con was nonexistent. Still, the speed of the intrusion was impressive.Almost all voting machines in the United States are off-line and come in many varieties, making it hard to hack them unless you are sitting in front of the machine. But the computers that prepare the ballots are not, and at the conference, J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor who has published devastating work on the vulnerability of voting machines, held a mock vote that pitted George Washington against Benedict Arnold. Thanks to manipulation of the ballot software, America\u2019s most famous traitor trounced the man who was, until the software was rigged, first in the hearts of his countrymen.That is only part of the problem. Many counties use old, insecure websites for their voter registration; it would be relatively simple to create \u201cspoofed\u201d alternative sites or break into them, to manipulate data or post notices that polls have been closed or Election Day moved. That could be the next move in the county-by-county activity seen in recent days.There is also room for mischief as votes are tabulated and reported to the state, and ultimately to media outlets.The Department of Homeland Security said there had been little evidence this year of the kind of \u201cprobes\u201d into the voter registration systems that created such fear in 2016. But Election Day hasn\u2019t arrived yet.It wouldn\u2019t take much to disrupt Tuesday\u2019s vote in a few important swing districts, and that\u2019s what the United States government \u2014 and many private security experts \u2014 are worried about.The Department of Homeland Security says it will be deploying small teams of cyberexperts to important states \u2014 presumably those that are most vulnerable, or have close races \u2014 just before the election. But it is not hard to imagine different scenarios that could cause disruption, or just create the illusion of disruption.A last-minute attack on county or state voter-registration systems, just to knock them off-line, would create an uproar from voters who might show up at the polls and find they could not vote. A strike at power grids, turning out the lights at polling places, or just disrupting transportation systems could suppress turnout and lead to charges of manipulation.Mr. Rosenbach\u2019s group simulated such events in a series of scenarios with election officials, piling one attack upon another in an effort to get them to think ahead about how they would respond, all part of an election \u201cplaybook\u201d that the Defending Digital Democracy program has given to campaigns and officials.And then there is another fear: Come Wednesday, if there are still races that are too close to call, just a rumor campaign about possible election manipulation might be enough to cast doubt about the integrity of the results. And in the end, that\u2019s what election disruption is all about \u2014 undermining the citizens\u2019 confidence that their vote counts.In 2016, the evidence of the extent of Russian operations on social media did not become clear until months after the election was over \u2014 and then, time and again, Facebook had to admit it missed all the warning signs. Mark Zuckerberg, a company founder, moved from arguing that to think fake news and divisive posts \u201cinfluence the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea\u201d to ordering the hiring of thousands of Facebook monitors to make sure it never happened again.But there are no guarantees. Months after the midterms are over, evidence of covert internet action that is currently going unnoticed may well surface. As the Russians and others embrace artificial intelligence techniques, and get better at targeting messages, they may well find ways to route around the phalanx of new social-media police. Ms. Green says that is unavoidable.\u201cIt\u2019s still retroactive,\u201d she said of monitoring social media. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figure out how to do this in real time.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misidentified the state that Senator Ron Wyden represents. He is from Oregon, not Washington.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which some social media campaigns accelerated immediately after elections. It was 2016, not 2018.David E.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Public safety, national security and the rule of law are among the incantations the Trump administration likes to chant when rolling out one of its deliberately and pointlessly cruel immigration policies. It evidently hopes that repetition will somehow insulate its actions from public or judicial scrutiny. Since shortly after World War II, the United States has prided itself on being a refuge for those fleeing war or persecution of many stripes. Asylum protections arose from that commitment, giving rise to the complex web of statutes governing the process now faced by those presenting themselves for sanctuary.Mr. Trump may have left some with the impression that, once the midterms were over, he had no more use for the caravan of Central American migrants that he had fantasized about to frighten his supporters to the polls. But like the Muslim ban, which was also gestated in a political contest, the one that elected him president, Friday\u2019s asylum ban demonstrates that Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist impulses are guides not just to his campaigns but also to his governing.He creates nonexistent threats, generates manufactured fears and prepares exaggerated responses, all leading to an erosion of the rule of law, to feed more fears.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Will Science Take Us? To the Stars ", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "A monthlong visit to observatories in Chile, Hawaii and Los Angeles revealed spellbinding visions of the heavens. Supported byIt was the first night of a monthlong journey to visit astronomy observatories in Chile, Los Angeles and Hawaii. Whether designed for professional use or for the general public, observatories nurture humanity\u2019s explorations of the cosmos. They spark wonder and discovery, but even before I set foot inside the first one, I was seeing outer space in a spellbinding new way. ALMA\u2019s facility sits nearly two miles above sea level. It has the feeling of a space colony, maybe because of its cleanliness and the unforgiving terrain. Or maybe it\u2019s because of the extremes of the environment. Based on my own brief experience, temperatures in the area range from freezing at night to boiling during the day. As tourists climbed off the bus, each was given a squirt of sunscreen, the way you\u2019d apply hand sanitizer in a different setting.Like the particle colliders I visited, ALMA\u2019s research is as complex as the motivation is simple. Basically, ALMA\u2019s quest is to search for the reasons we are human beings instead of stardust floating in the void. For example, it found a simple form of sugar in the gas surrounding a young binary star, demonstrating that some of the chemical foundations of life on Earth also exist in faraway galaxies.The GMT is being built by a consortium of universities in the United States and other countries at a mountaintop site called Las Campanas. Owned by the Carnegie Institution, the site currently hosts eight other telescopes as well as staff housing that evokes a Swiss chalet. During the night I spent there, I met scientists working on the GMT\u2019s instrumentation. One of them was Brian McLeod, astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Dr. McLeod leads a team developing instrumentation to keep the GMT\u2019s 14 primary and secondary mirrors correctly aligned. He started designing prototypes back in 2009, which means that at first light in 2024, he will have spent 15 years on this project. He ruefully noted that people change jobs more frequently than he changes projects. When it begins operations, the GMT will welcome visitors, but how exactly is still unclear, given the site\u2019s remoteness. Plus, nighttime observation requires dim ground conditions \u2014 a hazard to driving \u2014 while daytime is the period when all the observatory staff sleep. Still, if ALMA is any guide, visits to the GMT will be popular. So many people want to visit ALMA that the external relations staff stay on-site for weeks at a time, doing shift work. This is despite the fact that unlike observatories for the general public, there is nothing to \u201csee\u201d at places like ALMA and the GMT. Today\u2019s professional facilities are long removed from the time when you look through a viewfinder and use the telescope as an extension of your eyeball. Instead, professional observatories use computers to capture data and images and send them to researchers around the world.Nevertheless, visiting these observatories \u2014 like my previous visits to particle colliders \u2014 boggled my mind. After all, those who work at observatories operate time machines that can detect light emanating from the birth of our universe, billions of years in the past. Even with the naked eye, the light I saw from the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud was 200,000 years old.I said goodbye to Dr. McLeod and his team and boarded a plane back to Santiago. As I stared out the window, looking down at the vast brown carpet of the Atacama below me, I considered my situation with strange clarity: I was a collection of bound-together atoms surrounded by other atoms hammered into the shape of a metal airplane tube. And this tube was propelling me through the sky by burning the remains of long-dead plants and animals. Thoughts like this did not come naturally to me before visiting ALMA and Las Campanas.I wondered whether the crowds at the Griffith Observatory were due mainly to its Hollywood celebrity. However, other astronomy sites were just as crowded. We experienced this the following day, when we flew to the island of Hawaii to visit Mauna Kea, one of the world's top venues for astronomy. The Maunakea Visitor Information Station, located about two-thirds up the side of the dormant volcano, is base camp for the professional observatories on the summit. It is also a center for public astronomy in Hawaii.Four evenings a week, a mix of employees and volunteers trundle out telescopes for everyone to see. People drive up hours before, because the parking lot almost always runs out of room well before the 7 p.m. viewing start time. Hundreds of us stood patiently in long lines, clutched cups of hot chocolate, waiting for glimpses of Jupiter and the North Star. Meanwhile, people hiked up a nearby hill to catch the last rays of the setting sun. It turned chilly. People donned sweaters and hotel bath towels to ward off the cold. In the winter, snow often covers the summit while vacationers enjoy the tropical climate at ocean level. The 14,000-foot-high summit at Mauna Kea holds 13 telescopes owned by a variety of countries and universities. Those with four-wheel drive vehicles can drive to the top and look around. We did this later in our trip. It was the middle of the day but it felt like evening. We drove through clouds, rain slicked the windshield and the temperature dropped from 80 degrees to 40. Although I could sense the lack of oxygen at the visitors\u2019 station, the real change came at the summit where there is 40 percent less oxygen than at sea level. Walking felt labored and the world took on an acute sharpness, as if rocks and boulders and the air itself had grown an edge. We hiked to the high-altitude Lake Waiau, its brilliant blue water an intense contrast with the fiery sun.At that moment, they seemed like a direct link to temples built on high places by our prehistoric ancestors, usually to be closer to the gods. We probably have always felt the urge to climb hills and mountains and stare at the sky. There is something about going to these high places \u2014 to ALMA, Las Campanas and the summit of Mauna Kea \u2014 that touches the core of our existence. \u201cStarstuff pondering the stars,\u201d in the words of Carl Sagan. It was the beginning of June, a few days later. A warm, early summer evening. Sirens rose in the distance. The air felt lethargic, unwilling to form a breeze. Streetlights glowed orange as I stepped onto my porch and looked around. I saw the usual city haze that obscures nearly all of the night sky. But the pull of a month of stargazing lingered on, and I looked up. Eventually I perceived the faint but unmistakable trace of the Big Dipper. I don\u2019t remember ever seeing it in the skies above Chicago, but of course it\u2019s been there all along. I kept looking, waiting for my eyes to become used to the dark. I thought about workers in astronomy observatories, getting ready for a night of exploration. More stars appeared. There was Jupiter like a beauty mark next to the moon. There was the North Star, twinkling just like in the lullaby. Standing in the middle of a city on our tiny planet, aware of my own fragile existence, I breathed a silent hello to the cosmos. Here are some additional observatories in the United States that are open to the public:This is the second of a two-part series on science tourism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Nauru Experience: Zero-Tolerance Immigration and Suicidal Children ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recent visit to Nauru revealed the effects of Australia\u2019s offshore detention policy and its impact on mental health. TOPSIDE, Nauru \u2014 She was 3 years old when she arrived on Nauru, a child fleeing war in Sri Lanka. Now, Sajeenthana is 8.Her gaze is vacant. Sometimes she punches adults. And she talks about dying with ease.\u201cYesterday I cut my hand,\u201d she said in an interview here on the remote Pacific island where she was sent by the Australian government after being caught at sea. She pointed to a scar on her arm. \u201cOne day I will kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWait and see, when I find the knife. I don\u2019t care about my body. \u201d Her father tried to calm her, but she twisted away. \u201cIt is the same as if I was in war, or here,\u201d he said.Now, though, the desperation has reached a new level \u2014 in part because of the United States.So far, according to American officials, about 430 refugees from the camps have been resettled in the United States \u2014 but at least 70 people were rejected over the past few months.That includes Sajeenthana and her father, Tamil refugees who fled violence at home after the Sri Lankan government crushed a Tamil insurgency.A State Department spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the rejections, arguing the Nauru refugees are subject to the same vetting procedures as other refugees worldwide. Australia\u2019s Department of Home Affairs said in a statement that Nauru has \u201cappropriate mental health assessment and treatment in place.\u201d At least 92 children have been moved since August \u2014 Sajeenthana was evacuated soon after our interview \u2014 but as of Tuesday there were still 27 children on Nauru, hundreds of adults, and no long-term solution. The families sent to Australia for care are waiting to hear if they will be sent back to Nauru. Some parents, left behind as their children are being treated, fear they will never see each other again if they apply for American resettlement, while asylum seekers from countries banned by the United States \u2014 like Iran, Syria and Somalia \u2014 lack even that possibility.For all the asylum seekers who have called Nauru home, the psychological effects linger.\u201cOur mainstay income is purely controlled by the foreign policy of another country,\u201d he said.In Topside, an area of old cars and dusty brush, sits one of the two processing centers that house about 160 detainees. Hundreds of others live in community camps of modular housing. They were moved from shared tents in August, ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, an intergovernmental meeting that Nauru hosted this year.Sukirtha Krishnalingam, 15, said the days are a boring loop as she and her family of five \u2014 certified refugees from Sri Lanka \u2014 wait to hear if the United States will accept them. She worries about her heart condition. And she has nightmares.\u201cAt night, she screams,\u201d said her brother Mahinthan, 14.In the past year, talk of suicide on the island has become more common. Young men like Abdullah Khoder, a 24-year-old Lebanese refugee, says exhaustion and hopelessness have taken a toll. \u201cI cut my hands with razors because I am tired,\u201d he said. Christina Sivalingam, a 10-year-old Tamil girl on Nauru spoke matter-of-factly in an interview about seeing the aftermath of one death \u2014 that of an Iranian man, Fariborz Karami, who killed himself in June. \u201cWe came off the school bus and I saw the blood \u2014 it was everywhere,\u201d she said calmly. It took two days to clean up. She said her father also attempted suicide after treatment for his thyroid condition was delayed.Seeing some of her friends being settled in the United States while she waits on her third appeal for asylum has only made her lonelier. She said she doesn\u2019t feel like eating anymore. \u201cWhy am I the only one here?\u201d she said. \u201cI want to go somewhere else and be happy.\u201dSome observers, even on Nauru, wonder if the children are refusing to eat in a bid to leave. But medical professionals who have worked on the island said the rejections by the Americans have contributed to a rapid deterioration of people\u2019s mental states. Dr. Beth O\u2019Connor, a psychiatrist working with Doctors Without Borders, said that when she arrived last year, people clung to the hope of resettlement in the United States. In May, a batch of rejections plunged the camp into despair. Mr. Karami\u2019s death further sapped morale.\u201cPeople that just had a bit of spark in their eye still just went dull,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThey felt more abandoned and left behind.\u201dMany of the detainees no longer hope to settle in Australia. New Zealand has offered to take in 150 refugees annually from Nauru but Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, has said that he will only consider the proposal if a bill is passed banning those on Nauru from ever entering Australia. Opposition lawmakers say they are open to discussion.In the meantime, Nauru continues to draw scrutiny.For months, doctors say, many children on Nauru have been exhibiting symptoms of resignation syndrome \u2014 a mental condition in response to trauma that involves extreme withdrawal from reality. They stopped eating, drinking and talking. \u201cThey\u2019d look right through you when you tried to talk to them,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe watched their weights decline and we worried that one of them would die before they got out.\u201dIn a quarter of the cases, the government has resisted these demands in court, said George Newhouse, the group\u2019s principal lawyer. \u201cWe\u2019ve never lost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is gut-wrenching to see children\u2019s lives destroyed for political gain.\u201dAustralia\u2019s conservative government, with an election looming, is starting to shift.\u201cWe\u2019ve been going about this quietly,\u201d Mr. Morrison said last week. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been showboating.\u201d But there are still questions about what happens next. Last month, Sajeenthana stopped eating. After she had spent 10 days on a saline drip in a Nauruan hospital, her father was told he had two hours to pack for Australia.Speaking by video from Brisbane last week (we are not using her full name because of her age and the severity of her condition), Sajeenthana beamed. \u201cI feel better now that I am in Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to Nauru.\u201dBut her father is less certain. The United States rejected his application for resettlement in September. There are security guards posted outside their Brisbane hotel room, he said, and though food arrives daily, they are not allowed to leave. He wonders if they have swapped one kind of limbo for another, or if they will be forced back to Nauru. \u201cAnyone who is brought here is still classified as a transitory person,\u201d said Jana Favero, director of advocacy and campaigns at the Asylum Seeker Resource Center. \u201cLife certainly isn\u2019t completely rosy and cheery once they arrive in Australia.\u201dOn Monday, 25 more people, including eight children, left the island in six family units, she said. Those left behind on Nauru pass the days, worrying and waiting. Christina often dreams of what life would be like somewhere else, where being 10 does not mean being trapped. She has been waiting two years for an answer to her application for resettlement in the United States \u2014 one that now seems hopeless given the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Each night, often after the power goes out on Nauru, she and her sister talk about life and death, and whether to harm themselves to seek freedom.Advertisement"}

I bought two or three postcards, as had a friend who had come with me. He flipped through the pages of a few dog-eared notebooks for several minutes before announcing decisively, \u201cThis is you. Five postcards.\u201d And he pointed at a hand-scrawled entry in a ledger dated Sept. 19, 2010. It was eight years ago to the day that I\u2019d visited his store.Leh (pronounced LAY), once the royal seat of a former Buddhist kingdom, is a place with a seemingly undying memory, ageless and eternal as the mountains that surround it. The Ladakh region, dotted with poplars and dominated by the Himalayas, has changed noticeably over the last decade, welcoming more tourists, restaurants and guesthouses. But it remains a wondrous destination for the adventurous traveler, full of captivating scenery, generous and friendly people, and accessible monasteries and holy places nearby. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that it can all be done fairly inexpensively.After arriving in Delhi, I spent a couple of days sightseeing and getting used to the time change before heading up to Leh early one morning. My trip was part of a longer journey to India, to places that will be featured in future columns. You can expect a good deal of bureaucracy when it comes to travel in this country. Have copies of your itinerary printed out, and a copy of the credit card with which you made a given ticket purchase, or the card itself.The bazaar is a good destination for your first day in Leh \u2014 you\u2019ll want to take it easy and drink plenty of water as your body acclimates to the noticeable change in altitude. The bazaar, once open to cars, but now a pedestrian walkway, is bedecked with banners from the local mosque and colorful Buddhist prayer flags. Street dogs trot lazily between vendors peddling local apricots (200 grams, almost half a pound, will run about 100 rupees), while hawkers call from their storefronts, promising the best prices for pashmina shawls and handmade crafts. In the distance, the nine-story Leh Palace surveys the activity below.\u201cAnd let me tell you, my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cThe machine-made pashminas are 10 percent nylon. No one else will tell you this. But it is the truth.\u201d The handmade pashminas ran in excess of 8,000 rupees, more than $100, as opposed to half that for the machine-woven scarves. I bought a machine-woven pashmina for myself (I honestly thought both were great; they both felt like spun cumulus clouds.) and a couple of beautifully patterned, very soft Merino wool scarves for 2,500 rupees apiece.A couple of bartering tips: While it\u2019s not the American way, try your best to get into it. Think of it as a dance or courting process, not as adversarial. Don\u2019t jump right in with numbers. Chat, have some tea and relax. If you don\u2019t like the price, act as if your heart has been broken, and walk away. Haggle hard, but if you know you\u2019re going to buy something, let the vendor feel like they\u2019ve won \u2014 they likely need the extra $5 or $10 more than you do.Lamayuru is a trek from Leh; If you want to visit somewhere a bit closer, Thikse Monastery is less than 20 kilometers west of town. Thikse, whose different white buildings cascade regally down a hillside, bears a resemblance to the Potala Palace in Tibet. We visited early, as the sun was rising, to catch morning prayers. Two young monks dressed in robes and orange headpieces stepped onto the roof and blew into their dung dkar, or conch shell horns. The ritual stunned us for its simplicity and beauty. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Luck of the Democrats", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump could have flattened liberalism. Instead he\u2019s given it an opening.Opinion ColumnistOne of the interesting features of this election cycle has been the gulf, often vast, between the hysteria of liberals who write about politics for a living and the relative calm of Democrats who practice it.In the leftward reaches of my Twitter feed the hour is late, the end of democracy nigh, the Senate and the Supreme Court illegitimate, and every Trump provocation a potential Reichstag fire. But on the campaign trail, with some exceptions and variations, Democrats are being upbeat and talking about health care and taxes and various ambitious policy ideas, as though this is still America and not Weimar, a normal time and not a terrifying one.One way to look at this gulf is to argue the pundits are saying what the politicians can\u2019t \u2014 that alarmed liberals grasp the truth of things but swing voters don\u2019t, so Democratic politicians have no choice but to carry on as normal even if inside they\u2019re screaming too.To understand this good fortune, consider two counterfactuals. In the first, the last 21 months proceeded in exactly the same fashion \u2014 with the strongest economy since the 1990s, full employment almost nigh, ISIS defeated, no new overseas wars or major terrorist attacks \u2014 except that Donald Trump let his staffers dictate his Twitter feed, avoided the press except to tout good economic news, eschewed cruelties and insults and weird behavior around Vladimir Putin, and found a way to make his White House a no-drama zone.In this scenario it\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump\u2019s approval ratings wouldn\u2019t have floated up into the high 40s; they float up into the mid-40s as it is whenever he manages to shut up. Even with their threadbare and unpopular policy agenda, Republicans would be favored to keep the House and maintain their state-legislature advantages. All the structural impediments to a Democratic recovery would loom much larger, Trump\u2019s re-election would be more likely than not, and his opposition would be stuck waiting for a recession to have any chance of coming back.Then consider a second counterfactual. Imagine that instead of just containing himself and behaving like a generic Republican, Trump had actually followed through on the populism that he promised in 2016, dragging his party toward the economic center and ditching the G.O.P.\u2019s most unpopular ideas. Imagine that he followed through on Steve Bannon\u2019s boasts about a big infrastructure bill instead of trying for Obamacare repeal; imagine that he listened to Marco Rubio and his daughter and tilted his tax cut more toward middle-class families; imagine that he spent more time bullying Silicon Valley into inshoring factory jobs than whining about Fake News; imagine that he made lower Medicare drug prices a signature issue rather than a last-minute pre-election gambit.But instead all the Trumpy things that keep the commentariat in a lather and liberals in despair \u2014 the Twitter authoritarianism and white-identity appeals, the chaos and lying and Hannity-and-friends paranoid style \u2014 have also kept the Democrats completely in the game.But it\u2019s the president\u2019s denial that\u2019s more politically costly for his party. If left-wing Twitter were running Democratic strategy while Donald Trump talked about infrastructure and drug prices, 2018 might seal a conservative-populist realignment.Advertisement"}

If these BBB-rated companies get downgraded further into \u201cjunk\u201d status \u2014 a distinct possibility if a slowing economy makes a dent in their profits or if their big acquisitions do not pay off \u2014 a vicious cycle is nearly inevitable. That means higher borrowing costs when it comes time to refinance or to obtain a new credit line and an increasing risk of default.When bellwether companies such as G.E., AT&T and IBM get into financial difficulty, that\u2019s bad news for the rest of us. When credit markets feel nervous about the biggest corporations, it\u2019s a good bet that it will be harder for ordinary Americans to get or refinance a mortgage, or get a car loan or credit card. It is a scenario that became very familiar a decade ago; the sequel may be upon us soon.William D.

{"Headline": "Your Boss Wants to Friend You on Facebook. What if You\u2019d Rather Resist?", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn employee is ignoring social-media contact from a manager. That might work in the short term. But here\u2019s how to handle this situation and prepare for the next one.I just received a Facebook friend request from my newish immediate supervisor. I\u2019d rather not accept it.I don\u2019t particularly like the direction this new boss is taking our office, nor do I care for his management style. But really, even if I liked him enormously, I think his request is creepy, and oversteps his role.Still, he was put in the position by the big global company that recently acquired our small firm, and while in theory we will still have a lot of independence I know that in reality this new manager will have a lot of influence.Right now my plan is to not address the request directly unless he brings it up in person. What are your thoughts?ANONYMOUSIt\u2019s a slight gamble, but for now you can probably just ignore the request. It sounds like a pro forma gesture on his part, and maybe he\u2019ll forget. But in case he does bring it up, or if you just want to resolve this in a more definitive way, there are a couple of things you should do.While you\u2019re at it, do the same for every social media account you have. Understand the privacy settings and how to adjust them. Even if you are determined to remain permanently unconnected to this manager, you\u2019re better off knowing exactly how to mute, block or otherwise control and limit your online audience.If the new boss brings this subject up later \u2014 or you just want to clear the air \u2014 you will have your social media house in order. And probably the best course of action depends on how, and how much, you actually use such services.I\u2019m assuming you must be active on Facebook or this wouldn\u2019t matter to you. If so, there\u2019s nothing wrong with simply having a personal policy of restricting your Facebook contacts to family and close friends, and saying so. If you don\u2019t really use it often, you can tell your boss that \u2014 or just accept his request, mute him and restrict his access to your activity.Just be careful: If you claim to limit your use to significant personal matters and connections, and the boss can easily see that you have voluminous debates about the Lakers or the new Robyn album with legions of co-workers on Facebook, you might have a problem. So either make sure you\u2019ve got your privacy settings right, stick to the truth or, ideally, do both.Just ask: \u201cDo you think I should invite the over-boss to the wedding? I don\u2019t know her very well, but I don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings.\u201d If her manager says yes, then the higher-up should be invited. If the answer is no and then it turns out that the higher-up felt insulted, then that\u2019s on the intermediate manager, not the employee.Richard W. GranahanDix Hills, N.Y.I received a number of responses to this item, with a range of attitudes. The most frequently expressed opinion was that the higher-up probably has better things to do and doesn\u2019t want to be invited to some flunky\u2019s wedding in the first place.It\u2019s hard to say whether such speculation offers any real comfort to someone who is genuinely worried about snubbing a superior, but it\u2019s worth consideration. My response tried to offer the bride-to-be a framework for considering potential outcomes and then deciding which would feel the least stressful. I like the idea of adding a more forceful \u201cmaybe you\u2019re taking the interest in your wedding a little too seriously\u201d into the equation. But I\u2019d still make it just one factor in that equation.This idea of escalating the matter by bluntly questioning the intermediate manager is the other end of the spectrum. It sounds perfectly logical \u2014 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m skeptical. Wouldn\u2019t the intermediate manager\u2019s answer reflect her own self-interest as much as anything else? If the higher-up were insulted, is it really plausible the employee could point the finger at this midlevel boss?Actual human beings with individual personalities and motives are involved, so I\u2019d be cautious about strategies to resolve this or any workplace dilemma in ways that depend on everyone\u2019s being coolly dispassionate. I have no doubt these approaches would work in a strictly rational world. Unfortunately, we all work in this one.Advertisement"}

Tehran has not restarted its nuclear programs despite America\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran deal. U.S. sanctions on Russia are still in place. Democrats badly damaged their chances of taking the Senate with their over-reaching and polarizing crusade to stop Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. What more could Trump ask for?In normal presidencies, good news, along with your opponents\u2019 mistakes, is good politics. It\u2019s your Topic A. In normal presidencies, the politics of cultural anxiety, social division or ethnic scaremongering \u2014 that is, of proposing the end of birthright citizenship and demonizing elite media and militarizing the U.S. border \u2014 is Plan B. It\u2019s what you turn to first when you don\u2019t have enough to say for yourself otherwise.But that\u2019s not how the Trump presidency rolls. In this campaign, fear is what\u2019s on the Republican menu. Peace and prosperity? Mere side dishes.The mystery of Donald Trump is what impels him to overturn the usual rules. Is it a dark sort of cunning or simple defects of character? Because the president\u2019s critics tend to be educated and educated people tend to think that the only kind of smarts worth having is the kind they possess \u2014 superior powers of articulation combined with deep stores of knowledge \u2014 those critics generally assume the latter. He\u2019s a bigot. He\u2019s a con artist. His followers are dumb. They got lucky last time. They won\u2019t be so lucky again.Maybe this is even right. But as Trump\u2019s presidency moves forward, it\u2019s no longer smart to think it\u2019s right. There\u2019s more than one type of intelligence. Trump\u2019s is feral. It strikes fast. It knows where to sink the fang into the vein.This has been Trump\u2019s consistent strength from the moment he entered the Republican race until the second he got wind of the migrant caravan. Yes, his administration doesn\u2019t even have an ambassador in Honduras, and if the U.S. has any kind of coherent Central American policy it would be news to me. Also, the idea of deploying thousands of U.S. troops to repel and even fire on the caravan is repellent, fascistic and probably unlawful.Still, several thousand people are pushing their way to the U.S. border with the idea that they will find a way to push their way through it. If they do, tens or even hundreds of thousands more will surely follow. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for fair-minded voters to wonder how the U.S. will vet and then absorb even a fraction of them (though I think we easily can), and what doing so will mean for our wider immigration system.If it\u2019s \u201ccompassion,\u201d it\u2019s a non-answer. If it\u2019s to abolish ICE, it\u2019s a dereliction of responsibility for governance. If it\u2019s to open the border, it is an honest form of political suicide. If it\u2019s more trade and foreign aid for Central America, that\u2019s a solution for the too-long term.The truth is that there is no easy fix to the challenge of the caravan, which is why Trump was so clever to make the issue his own and Democrats have been so remiss in letting him have it. The secret of Trump\u2019s politics is to mix fear and confidence \u2014 the threat of disaster and the promise of protection \u2014 like salt and sugar, simultaneously stimulating and satisfying an insatiable appetite. It\u2019s how all demagogues work.There\u2019s a lesson here worth heeding. Our economic GDP may be booming, but our moral GDP is in recession. The tragedy of Pittsburgh illustrates, among other things, that the president cannot unite us, even in our grief. Whatever happens on Tuesday, Democrats will only win in 2020 if they find a candidate who can.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crazy Work Hours and Lots of Cameras: Silicon Valley Goes to China", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldOne Chinese technology executive said he worked 14 to 15 hours a day at least six days a week. Another said he worked every waking hour and forced himself to watch movies to relax.The reaction from a group of Silicon Valley executives: Wow.Work habits weren\u2019t the only sharp difference between the Valley and China. By the end of the week, a group of American executives and investors found an alternate tech universe. It resembles Silicon Valley superficially. Look closer, and it becomes a futuristic yet closed-off world that can be equally impressive, alienating and dystopian.In August, Mr. Chan, Mr. Goldberg and 11 other Silicon Valley investors and start-up founders took a trip to Beijing and Shenzhen, two cities that are competing for the title of the Silicon Valley of China. Organized by the venture capital firms Basis Set Ventures, Index Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank, it was intended to help them understand how China has become a tech rival to the United States in barely two decades.It started the moment the group members entered their rooms at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Beijing\u2019s central business district, where a notice listed some of the websites they would be unable to call up \u201cdue to Chinese internet regulations\u201d: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google, Bloomberg and The New York Times.Online payments represented another telling metaphor. Mobile payments are almost ubiquitous in the biggest Chinese cities, but setting up an account requires a local mobile number and a Chinese bank account.\u201cChina\u2019s internet is a walled garden,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cNo one can break in unless you\u2019re from here.\u201dWithin that walled garden, everything seemed to be moving at an extraordinary speed. While Silicon Valley start-ups raise funding every 18 to 24 months on average, the group was told that the most successful Chinese companies do it every six months. It isn\u2019t unusual for a hot start-up to raise funding three to four times a year.Their hosts kept reminding them of the advantages China had over the United States in A.I. development. China\u2019s vast population and loose privacy laws give them access to much more data. A.I. companies also have considerable government support and are willing to pay more for top talent.\u201cThe U.S. competitive edge over China may not be long,\u201d Kai-Fu Lee, chief executive of Sinovation Ventures and former head of Google China, told them. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cthe Americans now have the information disadvantage.\u201dBut it was also obvious to the group what China was missing. For starters, everybody is Chinese. Even in its early days, Google had employees from 39 nationalities speaking 40-plus languages.\u201cChina is a bit homogeneous,\u201d said Mr. Chan, an early Google employee. \u201cYou don\u2019t find as much the perspectives of the world here compared to Silicon Valley.\u201dThen there are the work schedules. The Silicon Valley natives were introduced to the Chinese start-up concept of 996: Work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Once they got over their shock, they had to ask: Does that punishing schedule make sense?\u201cI\u2019m not worried so much about my portfolio companies not working as hard as the Chinese companies,\u201d said Mr. Chan, now a partner at Felicis Ventures. \u201cI\u2019ll worry when they\u2019re less creative and less efficient.\u201dWhile China is becoming more innovative, many members of the group said they believed \u2014 and some of their Chinese counterparts agreed \u2014 that the United States still led in some areas.Although some Chinese tech companies can look very Silicon Valley-esque \u2014 with sprawling campuses that include dining halls, gyms and nap rooms \u2014 their preferred management style is still top down and results driven. Unlike Silicon Valley, smart underlings have less freedom to start something new.Technology itself is neutral, some of the Chinese executives said. It depends on how people use it \u2014 an argument that Silicon Valley companies used to make.Still, the Silicon Valley delegation did not expect facial recognition technology to be so widespread in Chinese life. Companies they visited used it at office entrances and at retail kiosks inside their facilities. They also saw demo videos of how the Chinese police could use the technology to monitor potential crimes in crowded public spaces and learn how many suspects had been arrested.After grasping how prevalent the cameras were, they started counting them. Even the van they rented from the hotel in Shenzhen had a handful of cameras installed, blinking from time to time to signal that they were on.Then, like many people in China, they got used to it, as if the cameras weren\u2019t even there.Advertisement"}

Different methods and values \u2014 but not altogether different. Both draw on similarly cramped ideas about nationhood and sovereignty.

Some employees responded with muted applause and cheers.The session came at a fraught time for the social network, as executives mobilized to deal with a torrent of criticism of the company. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on the Friday meeting.On Wednesday, The Times reported about a struggle at the top ranks of Facebook with how to respond to Russian disinformation operations and revelations of weak data privacy protections. In particular, there was considerable tension between Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Alex Stamos, the company\u2019s former chief security officer.Mr. Zuckerberg said much of the criticism of his company over the past 18 months \u2014 specifically regarding election security, content moderation and disinformation \u2014 had been fair and important.Ms. Sandberg, who also attended the session, added that \u201cI fully accept responsibility for Definers,\u201d according to two people familiar with the conversation. \u201cThat was on me.\u201dBut Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg said The Times\u2019s investigation was \u201ccompletely unfair\u201d and at times \u201csimply not true.\u201dMuch of the discussion centered on boosting employee morale. Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s former vice president of global communications and public policy, returned to the company for the meeting on Friday.Mr. Schrage said that Facebook was in a difficult news cycle, and that things would eventually calm down, and he urged workers to keep trying to do their best and work on the company\u2019s tough problems.Some Facebook employees indicated that they believe The Times and other news outlets are unfairly targeting the company because of its outsize influence \u2014 a sentiment shared in the session on Friday when employees asked executives what would happen to employees who leak information to the press.Mr. Zuckerberg made it clear that Facebook would not hesitate to fire employees who spoke to The New York Times or other publications. But after an employee asked whether the company should issue a report about how many leakers Facebook had found and fired, Mr. Zuckerberg played down the idea.Leaks, he said, are usually caused by \u201cissues with morale.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting from Los Angeles and Cecilia Kang from Washington.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.One happy reality of the 2018 campaign for New Yorkers is that they are guaranteed to make history on Tuesday: They will elect the state\u2019s first black attorney general, either Letitia James, a Democrat, or Keith Wofford, a Republican.New York has reason to be proud of this choice.Each candidate is appealing \u2014 and also disconcerting.For someone who has been in politics for years, Ms. James can be surprisingly ill at ease and defensive, didactic rather than persuasive, prone to plumping her record. She has tilted at windmills as public advocate, filing suits to address problems at the public housing authority that had already been fixed, for example.Ms. James has frequently said that she has worked for the powerless while Mr. Wofford has worked for the powerful. It\u2019s an easy political slogan. It\u2019s also true. And since Ms. James has pledged to use the office\u2019s powers vigorously, we endorse her for attorney general.She has a lengthy record of defending New Yorkers from special interests, beginning with her earliest work as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society. From 1999 to 2001, she led the state attorney general\u2019s Brooklyn office under Eliot Spitzer, enforcing environmental laws and investigating predatory lenders. In 2003, Ms. James was elected to the City Council, where she waged a vocal campaign against Bloomberg administration development policies she said were pricing out low and moderate-income New Yorkers. She also challenged the Bloomberg administration on the policing policy known as stop and frisk. As public advocate since 2014, she has sometimes been overzealous in her use of lawsuits to address what she sees as inequities in government. Still, her efforts have aimed at using the true power of her office \u2014 the bully pulpit \u2014 for good, especially when it comes to tenants\u2019 rights and the needs of vulnerable children.But Ms. James has promised to push for a law that would allow her to pursue prosecutions without first getting approval from the governor and the Legislature. This would be important if the office is to be truly independent in fighting corruption. She has also wisely said she would ask the highly experienced and capable Barbara Underwood to stay with the office. Ms. Underwood has been acting attorney general since Eric Schneiderman resigned after he was accused of abusing women he dated. Mr. Wofford thinks Democratic attorneys general have used this law to generate headlines by obtaining attention-grabbing monetary settlements, rather than prosecuting serious crimes.Advertisement"}

Democrats netted three flipped seats, because Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican running in Mr. Lamb\u2019s vacated district, also won his race.Democrats were all but preordained to net the two suburban Republican seats won by Ms. Scanlon and Ms. Houlahan because of the redistricting. Ms. Wild\u2019s victory in the Seventh District, which includes the Lehigh Valley, was a bit of icing on the cake, as the state contributed to Democrats\u2019 new House majority.Still, the party went into Election Day hoping for an even broader advance, a gain of up to six seats, riding the wave of anger at Mr. Trump among the diverse, college-educated voters of the Philadelphia suburbs \u2014 especially women.Republican incumbents held off strong challenges in three close races from Erie County in the northwest to Bucks County in the southeast. Representatives Mike Kelly, Scott Perry and Brian Fitzpatrick were all returned to the House. Mr. Fitzpatrick won a second term in his Bucks County-centered seat, the lone Republican win in the Philadelphia region.\u201cI lost some really good friends tonight,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of a vanishing breed of Republican moderates, told supporters, referring to the party\u2019s loss of the House. \u201cWe had a rough night tonight nationally.\u201dAs widely expected, Democrats\u2019 top two elected officials in the state, Gov. Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey Jr., cruised to re-election.Republican strategists had openly worried that their statewide candidates\u2019 failure to appeal to moderates \u2014 Representative Lou Barletta, running for Senate, and Scott Wagner, the nominee for governor \u2014 would be a hurdle for many Republican voters and hurt the party\u2019s down-ballot candidates.Mr. Wolf, a liberal, has raised state spending on education and expanded Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act, though he lost a battle with Republican majorities in the General Assembly to impose a severance tax on natural gas.In purple Pennsylvania, those voters are more or less balanced out by suburban Republicans, who find the president\u2019s harsh nativism repugnant. Here as elsewhere, Republican suburban women were more inclined to vote their values than their stock portfolios.Mr. Trump, who spent the final weeks campaigning nonstop in red states where Democratic senators were vulnerable, including multiple visits to Florida, Indiana and Missouri, last came to Pennsylvania on Oct. 10 to stump for Mr. Barletta in Erie.The House race considered the closest in the state was Mr. Fitpatrick\u2019s, as he fought to portray himself as independent of the national party. He won endorsements from organized labor and gun control groups and was the beneficiary of around $7 million in outside spending by national Republican committees.His Democratic opponent, Scott Wallace, a liberal philanthropist, told supporters the midterms were about \u201cthat crazy guy down there\u201d in the White House.At a high school in Warrington in Bucks County, it was clear that the backing of the liberal groups had boosted Mr. Fitzpatrick. Lindsay Edling, a 22-year-old waitress voting for the first time, said she generally prefers Democrats, but voted for Mr. Fitzpatrick because he had the support of two gun control groups. \u201cJust all the shootings going on, it\u2019s really been concerning,\u201d she said.And Susan Novick, 52, a special-education teacher, said she had voted for Mr. Fitzpatrick because his name was on the list given by the Pennsylvania State Education Association.But it was also clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressively divisive campaign motivated some Republican and independent voters to cast a ballot for Mr. Wallace to send a message. \u201cDon\u2019t even ask me about Trump,\u201d sneered Dorothy Brodsky, 73, a Republican who voted for Mr. Wallace. \u201cI have 18 grandchildren. I\u2019m very concerned about their future.\u201dBarbara Krumins, who runs a construction business with her husband and is registered as an independent, said the congressional race was \u201c100 percent\u201d a referendum on the president.\u201cJust everything about him has been total anxiety and anguish,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything that comes out of his mouth is just crap. It\u2019s just insane. It\u2019s not the views I was bought up on.\u201d She voted for Mr. Wallace.The court, with a majority of Democratic justices, ruled the map had \u201cclearly, plainly and palpably\u201d violated the state\u2019s Constitution.After Tuesday, the delegation is split 9 to 9, reflective of Pennsylvania\u2019s continuing role as a battleground state going into the 2020 presidential election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteYou don\u2019t need to break out anything special for this rich, creamy fondue: Instead, a roasted squash is its serving vessel.Fondue is not something you serve at a party; fondue is something that defines the party.Invited in as a part of the meal, that alluring attention-grabber will always dominate, demanding its own pot and forks and elbowing all other dishes out of the way. A classic fondue needs to shine alone.But if you eliminate the fondue pot, and ladle the same gooey cheese mixture into a roasted squash, it becomes a far more demure addition to the menu \u2014 without losing a speck of its rich, creamy charm. Instead of being the centerpiece of a meal, fondue-stuffed squash is an integrated part of it.This is not to say it\u2019s not still stunning \u2014 it is. If your guests don\u2019t ooh and ahh at first, just wait for the carving. Slice open the squash, and watch the cheesy insides gush out, emitting a heavenly steam. (Using a rimmed serving platter eliminates any tablecloth-staining mishaps.) Then spoon the fondue over the squash and serve it forth. It\u2019s a more theatrical version of squash with cheese sauce, but one that won\u2019t end up stealing the entire show.Along with the squash and oozing cheese, I\u2019ve added some bread crumbs. Fried until golden with garlic, chile, lemon zest and some optional but very delectable anchovies, it\u2019s a crunchy and pleasingly oily garnish that replaces the usual bread cubes dunked into fondue, albeit with a lot more flavor.Unlike a traditional fondue, which will eclipse any roast or braise you try to pair it with, this version makes an excellent side dish. Or it can be served as a rich appetizer, with something light to follow. I like to bring it out before roasted fish, with sorbet and cookies for dessert.Although you do have to whisk the fondue right before serving, the rest of the dish can be made ahead. The bread crumbs can be fried the day before and stored airtight at room temperature without losing their crunch. And the squash can be roasted earlier on the day of serving. Just reheat it until piping hot before pouring in the fondue, so the cheese stays melted and runny.You won\u2019t need to break out fondue forks, but spoons will guarantee your guests get every last, silky drop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Thrill of a Women\u2019s Wave", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWatching anti-Trump female candidates win is exciting, but I\u2019m worried about all they\u2019re being asked to do.Contributing Opinion WriterWatching these women win has been a salve on a festering two-year-old wound, as a president who ran on misogyny and racism used his platform to amplify that bigotry. This was a tough election, and while Democrats didn\u2019t take the Senate and many high-profile candidates lost, female candidates did remarkably well. The numbers are still being tallied, but we may, for the first time ever, have 100 women in the House. Texas will send a Latina woman to Congress for the first time \u2014 actually, two women. The nation will send two Native American women to Congress, a first as well. It is exhilarating and remarkable to see so many women succeed against long odds, and heartening to see so many take their place as \u201cfirsts\u201d in what has never been a truly representational democracy.But I am worried, too. The women are here, and the expectation is that they will do what women so often do: act as a cleanup crew.For all of the people who turned out to vote to send a message that President Trump does not represent the best of America, many other Trump loyalists sent the message that the president does indeed represent their America: Angry about a more inclusive nation, nostalgic for a past when white men had a monopoly on power and the rest of us knew our place.When they take their seats, though, they will face a different set of expectations from our rule-breaking president, and even from their male colleagues.The narratives around who lost and why will almost certainly touch on identity, questioning whether candidates were too \u201cidentity-focused\u201d by virtue of recognizing that they were not white men, and their lives, experiences and priorities were different. This simplistic read seems destined to overshadow more nuanced takes on how sexism and racism shape our perceptions, preferences and behaviors. It also ignores a stunning reality: Women made the blue wave.If the post-mortem will be undoubtedly tough on the women who lost, the coming years won\u2019t be much easier for the women who won. There is a perception that we need more female leaders not just because a representative democracy is a fairer democracy, but because women might just be better at the things our current leaders lack \u2014 communication, collaboration, the ability to cool one\u2019s Twitter fingers and restore a bit of integrity to politics. There is an expectation that the Democratic women elected Tuesday will make real change and do what they promised: take on President Trump, be advocates for their communities, make our national policies as representative as our country.The problem is that they haven\u2019t really been given the tools to do it. Republicans maintain control of the Senate. They have a leader in the White House who says he will do whatever he wants.In politics and in business, research shows that women are punished for being seen as grandstanding or self-promoting. That leaves female politicians without a crucial advocacy and negotiation tool. And more eyes will be on female legislators, because minorities in any room are inevitably more visible. The women who won on Tuesday night, then, face the monumental task of cleaning up our current mess, one made, for the most part, by men \u2014 without taking credit for their efforts.The real story of this election, though, is not what women have or haven\u2019t done, or what we will or won\u2019t do; it\u2019s another stage in the long dance between disaster and progress that has animated gains in civil rights and women\u2019s rights since our country\u2019s founding. The disastrous, proto-authoritarian presidency of Donald Trump came to be because a black man occupied the office before him, and then a woman challenged him; Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency also inspired many women to run for office; his presidency is also such a crisis that a lot of women actually won. These victories do not work in straight lines, and they are rarely total.Once they are in office, our female legislators will sometimes disappoint us, just as men do. They will sometimes be astoundingly courageous, just as men are. Many of them will probably work harder and ask for less credit than their colleagues \u2014 not something men often do. The reality is that even with all of these female victories, women still make up less than a quarter of the House. We can look at this new Congress and see more women and people of color dotting the long-monochrome landscape of overwhelmingly white, mostly-male faces, and recognize that progress has come, fragile as it may be. And we can look at those same faces and see all of the ways in which our American representatives do not quite yet represent all of what America is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Helped People Cheat at Grand Theft Auto. Then His Home Was Raided.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA gamer in Melbourne has had his assets frozen in connection with a popular video game cheat. He\u2019s one of many being sued by game companies worldwide, raising questions about copyright law and the policing of online civility.\u201cCheaters do tend to ruin the game experience for others, but not everything that is antisocial is illegal, nor should it be,\u201d said Mitch Stoltz, a senior attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit in San Francisco that defends digital privacy and free speech. There\u2019s a lot of money at stake. But earlier this year, Infamous was taken offline following a spate of legal action by game developers against \u201cmodders,\u201d or people who modify games in a way the original designers did not intend.But for players, the cases and the severity of enforcement often come as a surprise. The use of search and seizure orders in copyright cases is not uncommon in Australia, said Nicolas Suzor, a law and digital media researcher at Queensland University of Technology. But having them obtained in a closed courtroom hearing without the defendant being represented is concerning, he said. Mr. Anderson agreed.The raid, Mr. Anderson said, came after weeks of surveillance. Early on the morning of Sept. 25, his computers and hard disks were seized. \u201cThey\u2019re just beating up on me,\u201d Mr. Anderson said of the game publishers, arguing that the search and seizure order was a disproportionate response. Infamous was designed to help players combat cheaters using more sinister modifications, almost like an antivirus software, he said. But Alex Walker, editor of the gaming website Kotaku Australia, said that Infamous was \u201cjust a straight-up cheat.\u201d Cheats, he said, \u201cbreak and exploit parts of the game code to advantage the experience of one player at the disadvantage of other players.\u201d \u201cIt is genuinely harmful to the community,\u201d he added. In a statement provided to The Times, Take-Two Interactive said it was \u201ccommitted to protecting our multiplayer community from harassment and other disruptions to their shared entertainment experiences.\u201d Still, copyright policy may not be the best way to tackle the problem, said Meredith Rose, a policy counsel and copyright expert with Public Knowledge, an advocacy group in Washington focused on consumer digital rights. She said banning individual cheaters, for example, would be a fairer and more effective response. \u201cThe proportionality of the hammer is completely out of scale with the harm being done,\u201d Ms. Rose said. Even if copyright litigation were justified when it came to cheaters, she added, the cases could set a dangerous precedent: Copyright and anti-circumvention laws could also be used to deter competition, criticism of corporate policies or reports of security vulnerabilities. The contracts that accompany downloads of video games and other media products often include clauses that allow for a broad range of \u201cdraconian\u201d corporate policing, said Mr. Stoltz, the San Francisco attorney. When courts worldwide become willing to \u201ctransform violations of the fine print into heavy-handed remedies,\u201d he said, it makes everyone vulnerable to \u201cthe whims of every company that we do business with online.\u201dAdvertisement"}
