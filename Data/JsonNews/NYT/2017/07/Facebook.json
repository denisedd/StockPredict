{"Headline": "Migrant Maids and Nannies for Jihad", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Ayu is a 34-year-old Indonesian maid, and the head of a pro-Islamic State network in Hong Kong. She recruits, raises funds and spreads propaganda for the group. She is just one of several dozen Indonesian domestic workers in East Asia known to endorse jihad.Ayu \u2014 I\u2019m using a pseudonym, because she fears trouble from the police \u2014 became pregnant young, ran away from abusive in-laws and left her baby behind to go work in Hong Kong in 2003. She consumed alcohol and drugs to numb depression. In late 2011, after losing her job as a maid for the third time, she went to Macau, sleeping on the streets for months, until she overdosed.A Muslim only nominally until then, she now sought spiritual refuge. Surfing Islamic websites, she became absorbed by news of the war in Syria. She began to befriend international jihadis on social media. She returned to Hong Kong and enrolled in an Islamic course run by a puritan, though non-extremist, Salafist institute \u2014 but left it in mid-2014 when her teacher reported her to the police because she had voiced support for the Islamic State.She started translating propaganda material for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from English into Indonesian and spreading it on Twitter and the messaging app Telegram. After marrying an Indonesian jihadi she\u2019d met on Facebook, she was introduced to the inner circles of Indonesian pro-ISIS groups.Some 500,000 migrants from Indonesia work in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, most of them, like Ayu, women employed as maids, nannies or caretakers for the elderly. Based on official reports by the Indonesian police and interviews and social media monitoring conducted by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), where I am a researcher, about 45 Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong alone have been identified as active supporters of the Islamic State. There may be twice as many.These numbers may seem small, but the radicalization of Indonesian maids and nannies working in East Asia is alarming. It takes very few dedicated people to do considerable harm, and these supporters of jihad are more resourceful than others: Their incomes are much higher than those of most Indonesians, they speak better English and they have more contacts internationally.Two Indonesian women who had been migrant workers were foiled last December as they were preparing suicide bombings at the presidential palace in Jakarta and a tourist site in Bali. Others have traveled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, provided funds to the group, recruited new members or connected local jihadis with fighters in Syria and Iraq.Far less activity of the kind has been recorded among the roughly one million Indonesian domestic helpers working in the Persian Gulf. Only about a dozen radical maids in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are active on social media, for example. None is reported to have joined jihadis in Syria.As migrants from a Muslim-majority country working in non-Muslim territories, Indonesian maids and nannies in Hong Kong or Singapore radicalize for different reasons than either Indonesian helpers in the Middle East or converts to jihad in the West.Based on IPAC\u2019s monitoring of social media since mid-2015, as well as our interviews with several dozen Indonesian migrant workers and Muslim leaders in Hong Kong, these workers seem to have started out as nominal or non-devout Muslims and then undergone a rapid religious transformation while living abroad.Jihadi sites like voa-islam.com and kiblat.net appear at the top of result lists when one searches for \u201cIslamic news\u201d on Google in Indonesian. Their narratives \u2014 prophesizing an Islamic Armageddon in Syria and the like \u2014 are then spread by social media. Encrypted chat apps, particularly Telegram, serve as support groups for new recruits.\u201cI was online 24 hours every day, the Wi-Fi was so good,\u201d Firda, an Indonesian maid who worked in Singapore, told me in April. \u201cAt first I used it to watch movies, but after a while I felt empty. I had a decent job and money, my boss was nice to me, but I felt dry spiritually.\u201dFor some domestic workers, joining the Islamic State is a form of emancipation \u2014 from pasts they sometimes regret, from the hardships of exile, from subservience to men. Ika Puspitasari, a former domestic helper in Hong Kong, was arrested in central Java in December 2016 for plotting a suicide attack in Bali: She told the police that after helping finance her husband\u2019s terrorist plans for a time, she had wanted to play a more active role.It is these desires, and the helplessness they often stem from, that deradicalization efforts must address. The Indonesian government currently conducts training for migrant workers before they go abroad, but it focuses on languages and practical skills. The preparation should also incorporate modules about religious extremism, and describe recruitment by radical groups as a form of exploitation because jihadis often extract money from migrant workers.Indonesian Muslim business associations in Hong Kong and elsewhere may also have a part to play. They could be encouraged by the Indonesian consulate to set up ventures with migrant workers, allowing workers who are attracted to extremist views to be exposed to other perspectives in a collegial setting.Such exposure has proved effective in other contexts. For example, a reformed terrorist in Lamongan, in East Java, has set up a livestock cooperative bringing together former radicals and nonradicals, and that proximity reportedly helped change some of the jihadis\u2019 views over time. Programs could be put in place in Hong Kong to get radical domestic workers involved in, for example, businesses selling Muslim garments and Islamic herbal medicine, goods in high demand among migrants.Nava Nuraniyah is an analyst at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, in Jakarta.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Mistaking Trump for a Boy Scout", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed Contributor\u201cThe answer is no,\u201d he assured the crowd. President Obama, who was a boy scout in his youth, unlike Mr. Trump, missed the two national jamborees that took place when he was president (though he did address them by video). But he invited a group of scouts to come to the Oval Office each year, and he gave them a very different kind of message from the one they heard from Mr. Trump on Monday.I know this because I was one of those scouts. As the elected youth leader of the Boy Scouts\u2019 honor society, I found myself with half a dozen other scouts on the annual visit to the White House. I remember the way Mr. Obama listened carefully and asked thoughtful questions as we talked about the service projects the organization had undertaken that year.These Oval Office meetings are one of the many presidential \u201ccheck box\u201d responsibilities: 10 minutes that have to be scheduled somehow every year. Because the Boy Scouts of America received a congressional charter in 1916 with annual reporting requirements, the Report to the Nation, as the trip is called, falls in a gray area between unavoidable photo-op and congressional mandate.Even if it was mostly an obligatory formality, President Obama never let that on to the boys in the meeting. Despite overwhelming schedules, American presidents understood it was worth the time to hear some kids talk about Scouting\u2019s opportunities for service and leadership. The stories from these meetings become legends among the generations of youth leaders, many of whom come back to serve as adult mentors in the program. President Bill Clinton, one of them told me, called each of the kids in the room by name after hearing their names just once.The protracted battle over Scouting\u2019s gay membership policies owed much to the fact that Scouting in America truly cuts across all walks of life. There are troops in nearly every community across the country, and about 50 million living alumni. The Boy Scouts may skew toward its stereotype as white, middle-class and conservative, but it is a surprisingly diverse organization \u2014 of which its leadership is rightly proud \u2014 and Hispanics are among its fastest-growing demographic groups.Presidents invite scouts to the Oval Office and come to jamborees because the Boy Scouts has, symbolically, come to represent America\u2019s children. Scouting is intended to remain apolitical, based on universal American values, so that it can be a program that adapts to any local environment. That was what made the gay membership policies such a hard balance to strike for the movement.And that was what was so jarring and disquieting about Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. Even after prefacing his remarks by saying he \u201cshouldn\u2019t talk about politics,\u201d he couldn\u2019t stop himself from devoting the bulk of his speech to an unfortunately predictable combination of grandstanding, politicking and lewd inappropriateness. Seemingly egged on by a mass of adolescent boys, he became even more extreme than he is in his usual campaign speeches.Reading through dozens of Facebook posts from my Scouting friends after the speech, I discovered an outpouring from across the political spectrum of disappointment and sadness: a nostalgic feeling of innocence lost. For myself, and I\u2019d imagine for millions of other scouts who consider Scouting to be the greatest influence of their childhood, the president was breaking a sacred barrier we never thought he would cross.There was a small detail of the president\u2019s speech that would be easy to miss amid all the bluster. At one point, Mr. Trump called up several of his cabinet members who were boy scouts to stand behind him. Notably absent, even though Boy Scouts of America Facebook posts confirmed his attendance at the jamboree, was the member of his cabinet most intimately connected to Scouting: Mr. Tillerson.I don\u2019t know for certain whether anything can be read into Mr. Trump\u2019s omission or Mr. Tillerson\u2019s absence. But I do wonder if, in a time of encroaching breaches of cultural norms and social cohesion, it was a quiet statement consciously made by a man who truly understands what Scouting is all about.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North of Nordic: A Young Chef Invents \u2018Neo-Fjordic\u2019 Cuisine", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosBERGEN, Norway \u2014 \u201cSo this little ball of depressing represents the past of Norwegian food,\u201d said the chef Christopher Haatuft as he lovingly set down a drab bite of smoked mackerel butter on rye-pumpernickel bread.\u201cThis one is the future, the way it should be,\u201d he said, pointing to a snowy pile of sugar-and-salt-cured halibut, garnished with horseradish shavings and baby alfalfa.\u201cAnd this last one is just for fun,\u201d he added, a tiny Scandinavian \u201cshawarma\u201d of potato flatbread wrapped around pickled herring. It\u2019s a nod to the late-night street food Mr. Haatuft, 37, knew when he was a teenager here, thrashing around in the punk scene \u2014 and a joke about Norway\u2019s inexorable, traditional diet of potatoes and herring.Many of the New Nordic chefs are guided by solemn manifestoes about nature and culture. They often restrict themselves to Scandinavian ingredients, eliminating tomatoes, olive oil and peaches in favor of elderflower, sea buckthorn and pine needles. (The last, Mr. Haatuft said, is part of \u201cthe eternal Nordic quest for acid that isn\u2019t lemon.\u201d)Since he is the opposite of solemn, he coined a new term for the food at Lysverket: neo-fjordic.\u201cAt first it was a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fjords are what make Norway different, and that\u2019s what I want my food to be.\u201dMany things are different about Norway\u2019s geography, most of which make Mr. Haatuft\u2019s work more difficult. Compared with Bergen\u2019s rugged terroir, the area around Copenhagen, the birthplace of New Nordic, is as bright and balmy as the South of France. Here, rain falls more than 230 days a year, only about 3 percent of the land is arable and the winter is so long that is divided into two parts. (Morketid, the \u201cdark time,\u201d starts in October and lasts until January\u2019s Soldagen, \u201csun day,\u201d when the sun reappears but the weather grows colder.) Denmark has more sun, a longer summer and land that is flat and fertile enough for farming.Because of these harsh conditions, restricted land ownership and the frigid isolation of many rural areas, preindustrial Norway was singularly inhospitable to the small farmers who made up most of the population. In the late 19th century, hundreds of thousands of Norwegians \u2014 eventually, a third of the entire population \u2014 began leaving for the United States.\u201cThe big question for Norwegian farmers was not which kind of apples to grow, but how to not starve to death,\u201d Mr. Haatuft said. Deliciousness, he said, was a luxury they could not always afford.\u201cAs recently as my grandmother\u2019s time, people used cod liver oil as a cooking fat when there was nothing else,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could smell it for days.\u201dThat is one tradition he is not interested in bringing back.Instead of foraging in the past for inspiration, Mr. Haatuft asked himself a hypothetical question: \u201cIf western Norway were a region of France, what would the chefs here brag about?\u201dHis theory is that the prestigious classic cuisine of France is \u201cfarm food that was beautified and refined\u201d to suit the tastes and whims of rich people. In Norway, he said, there was never enough wealth to transform food into cuisine. (That changed after oil production began in the North Sea in the 1970s, making modern Norway one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations.)Traditional Norwegian food is famously bland, with infinite recombinations of fish, potatoes, flour and milk. But those porridges and dumplings were often spiked with intense tastes like smoked lamb and reindeer, salt-fermented salmon, goat salami and pickled root vegetables. The country has top-quality dairy products, berries that grow sweet in the 18-hour days of summer and complex aged cheeses. Extraordinary fresh seafood is harvested from the cold waters of the North Atlantic and the North Sea, and preserved using time-honored traditions that are just as complex as French charcuterie.\u201cA French chef here would brag about the smoked mackerel,\u201d he said. \u201cHe would clean out the dark parts to make it beautiful. He would add butter to make it rich and smooth, and make the flavor of the ingredient shine.\u201dThat is precisely what Mr. Haatuft does at Lysverket.Fiskesuppe, a traditional Bergen fish chowder, was traditionally thickened with flour. In modern times, cooks have added egg yolks and sour cream to enrich the broth. But to lift the flavors, Mr. Haatuft adds a bright green drizzle of leek oil, and diced carrots and celeriac pickled in distilled vinegar. \u201cThat\u2019s what the grandmothers used,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should I use wine vinegar?\u201dOne dessert at Lysverket is an ethereal cake made with almonds, chocolate and gjetost, the caramelized, spreadable goat cheese that resembles Latin American dulce de leche and is a national obsession.To procure the ingredients he needs, Mr. Haatuft spends much of his time on projects like nabbing loads of fresh herring before they are sent to the central market (Norwegian fishermen are not allowed to sell directly to chefs), tracking down divers and hounding the region\u2019s farmers to grow more diverse crops.To ensure a steady supply of flavorful, fatty pork, he prodded his friend Anders Tveite, a chef turned farmer, to start raising Mangalitsa pigs, whose woolly coats allow them to live outside all year, even in these rough mountains, still snowcapped in early July. In advance, Mr. Haatuft promised to buy all the meat that the farm wanted to sell him.\u201cThere just isn\u2019t enough good produce to go around,\u201d he said, crawling up steep strawberry beds at a farm in the mountainous Voss region northeast of Bergen. \u201cIt\u2019s not like being at Per Se, where there are seven other farmers I can go to for organic produce if my guy doesn\u2019t have what I need. This is it.\u201d\u201cNorwegians already have a healthy lifestyle; we hike, we hunt, we ski,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of room for education about how to eat well.\u201dMs. Vike, like Mr. Haatuft and virtually everyone involved in bringing better food to Norway, is concerned about how the country\u2019s booming aquaculture industry fits in. Neither of them serves the globally popular product labeled \u201cNorwegian salmon,\u201d knowing that it is not wild, but farmed in the country\u2019s waters.Before setting off for nearby fjords and waterfalls, explore the cultural scene and Nordic cuisine of this beguiling coastal city.In a storage shed in Sotra, an island just off the Atlantic coast, surrounded by tubs of live seafood, Mr. Haatuft opened a salad-plate-size scallop, pulling aside the mantle and the roe to get to the plump meat. Slicing it up in the shell with his pocketknife, he relished the squirm and the salt water that made the flesh taste fully alive.A few hours later at the restaurant, he grilled the scallops on just one side to firm up the muscle, then set off their sweetness with baby radishes and a bright, pleasingly bitter pur\u00e9e of nasturtium leaves. (Nasturtiums, like dill, sorrel, ransom, lovage and other pungent herbs, thrive in Nordic climates.)One commodity in short supply in Bergen is sous-chefs, but Mr. Haatuft is not planning an active recruitment effort.\u201cWhy would I encourage people to take a hard, hot job working 16 hours a day, when in Norway they could work seven hours in an office and still get free health care?\u201d he said.\u201cI want the people who can\u2019t do anything but cook, people whose only dream in life is to be a chef. People like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should I Tell Someone His Father-in-Law Is a Child Molester?", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistMany years ago, my middle-school science teacher was arrested and jailed for sexually molesting a female student. He was about 40 at the time, with a wife and several children, both biological and adopted. I knew the victim fairly well and was friends with two of her siblings. I spent a lot of time at their house, which was just down the road from mine.The science teacher drove the victim to a remote rural area near where I lived. This happened more than once.Eventually he was arrested and sent to jail for six months, according to what I read online. I\u2019m not inclined to think this is sufficient punishment, because his offense negatively altered the trajectory of this girl\u2019s life and her relationship with men. Also, according to her, there is a strong possibility that there was at least one other victim, who,understandably, chose not to come forward all those years ago.There are further reasons to doubt that the intervention you propose would help secure the child\u2019s safety. For one thing, her mother (assuming that the people in the picture are related in the way you suppose) probably already knows that her father was once jailed for molesting a minor. Nor have you any reason to assume that the young man himself is in the dark. If something\u2019s there for you to read online, it\u2019s there for everyone else. And if he doesn\u2019t know, you simply can\u2019t say how he\u2019ll react. Would he want to keep a child away from a loving grandfather who may pose no risk? Is he prone to violence? You have no idea.

He is increasingly unsettled by something some of the staff members are doing and is unsure if he has the authority to put a stop to what he sees as opportunistic, unethical behavior. We have a client who is a quite wealthy man around 60. He admits (often through tears, after he has been drinking) that he is very lonely and longs for a relationship and marriage. While he has dated women who are well suited to him (age, station in life, desire for him, eagerness for a relationship), after he has slept with them for a couple of months, he ends things, because he says, for example, that the woman\u2019s life is complicated, or that there is \u2018\u2018drama,\u2019\u2019 or that she has children, or that her nose is too big. He seems to have a penchant for much younger women, and for the past few years, he has been vocal about having a crush on one of our stylists, who is 20 years his junior, as well as the women on our reception team, who are in their early 20s. As the French say, \u2018\u2018\u00e0 chacun son go\u00fbt.\u2019\u2019One of my husband\u2019s assistants, a married man also around 60, has consistently pursued a friendship with this wealthy client because of his money. Our employee ingratiates himself, presses our client to have him over for dinner, follows the client to a nearby restaurant (which is owned by a family member of ours and at which our employees receive discounts), usually with the younger women tagging along as \u2018\u2018bait\u2019\u2019 and has the wealthy man foot the bill. He then invites himself, and anyone who is with him, to the man\u2019s house after the restaurant closes. Our male employee encourages the wealthy man to pursue these young women. If the two are at the restaurant and the women are not there, our employee will call them and put them on the phone with the wealthy client, or he will call them and tell them to get over to the restaurant because the wealthy client is there. The younger women have all said they have zero interest in this wealthy man, sexually or romantically. However, all of them are more than happy to use him as their personal sugar daddy \u2014 the last time, the bill was more than $500.I might add that the male employee, the one who pursues the connection for its benefits, never reciprocates. Surely nobody is forcing the wealthy man to pay for other people\u2019s drinks and food. He could, if he so desired, ask our employees to pay their own tab. I understand that he decides whom he finds attractive and what he is willing to endure, on the outside chance that one of these days one of these girls is going to want to sleep with him. I also acknowledge that our employees get to make their own decisions about their personal lives. However, all of this leaves a very bad taste in my husband\u2019s mouth. My own opinion is that while I find it cringe-worthy behavior on all their parts, I am not sure we have the right to mandate another\u2019s behavior (much less their ethics). Even if we asked our employees not to take our client up on the offer of meeting him at the restaurant after his appointments, are we allowed to tell them what they can and cannot do on their time off? So you should ask yourselves whether the financial risks you mention are genuine or whether you\u2019re merely reaching for business interests to align with your understandable sense of disapproval. If you\u2019re really sure about the situation and about your motive, you could have a courteous conversation with your employees, in which you urge them to be mindful of your salon\u2019s reputation. Of course, it may provoke some stony silences, which may also affect your husband\u2019s work life. Weighing these consequences, however, is a matter of prudence, not ethics.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

I will, I promise, and I don\u2019t mean to frustrate anyone, it\u2019s just that I normally don\u2019t talk about things like this until the Tricky Clues section. Also, to make my statement seem as dramatic and mysterious as possible.There. You\u2019ve just had a taste of VAGUEBOOKing, a fabulous word that has been around for a while, but which makes its New York Times Crossword debut today as VAGUEBOOKS. If you have an active Facebook account, you undoubtedly have at least one friend who tends to do this. This friend will post something that sounds like stunning but irritatingly vague news that raises more questions than it answers, and will then refuse to elaborate. Whether it\u2019s to evoke sympathy or passively aggressively communicate something to someone who might be reading, it has become part of the lexicon, primarily because it\u2019s so maddening.I liked NAIL SALON, INSTA, SEWING KIT, VAGUEBOOKS, BEST BUY, MAD TV, NEIL SIMON, NO FLY ZONES and the always hilarious TITTLE.\u25a0 18A: INSTAgram is the photo app referred to in this clue.

The answer to \u201cWhat may have a strong net effect?\u201d is a BOT.I\u2019m glad some of my favorite clues made it into the puzzle, including \u201cWhere to stick a needle\u201d for SEWING KIT, \u201cBusiness meeting?\u201d for NETWORKING, and \u201cDimensions without planes\u201d for NO FLY ZONES. Some of my other favorites were deep-sixed, unfortunately: \u201cMaria Bamford, for one\u201d for COMIC, and \u201cOne of four in Mississippi\u201d for TITTLE. I really liked the new clues for ENFORCING (\u201cPutting teeth into\u201d) and for BOT \u201cWhat may have a strong net effect?\u201dMy original clue for TONGUE was \u201cIt may be silver or sharp,\u201d which I wasn\u2019t particularly attached to. I was surprised to see that the new clue for TONGUE included \u201cMandingo,\u201d given the negative associations with the word and that \u201cMandinka\u201d still does the punny work of starting with the same letters as \u201cMandarin.\u201dHope you all enjoy this one!

{"Headline": "Police Officer Is \u2018Murdered for Her Uniform\u2019 in the Bronx", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a corner in the Bronx strained by steady rancor over unsolved crimes, and distrust of the police, Officer Miosotis Familia was a balm.She had earned a reputation as \u201ca good policewoman\u201d in the short time she was assigned to an R.V.-style police command post at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue, two miles north of Yankee Stadium, a longtime resident, Roma Martinez, said. She waved hello; she spoke Spanish.But long before she arrived, a hostility toward law enforcement personnel was building in Alexander Bonds, who had been in and out of prisons and jails for 15 years and was slipping into severe mental illness. Last year he warned in a Facebook video that he would not back down if he encountered police officers on the streets: \u201cI got broken ribs for a reason, son. We gonna shake.\u201dHis girlfriend called 911 on Tuesday night and told the police that Mr. Bonds \u201cwas acting in a manic, depressed state \u2014 paranoid,\u201d a law enforcement official said. When officers arrived, he had gone.About three hours later, with Fourth of July fireworks still going off, Mr. Bonds strode up to Officer Familia\u2019s command post and fired a .38-caliber revolver through a window, killing her with a bullet to the head. She was the first female New York Police Department officer killed in the line of duty since the Sept. 11 attacks, and only the third female officer killed in a combat-type encounter in the department\u2019s history.In the command post around 12:30 a.m., Officer Familia\u2019s partner, Vincent Maher, pleaded for help over the radio: \u201cMy partner\u2019s shot! My partner\u2019s shot!\u201d His call drew scores of officers and turned stretches of Independence Day festivities into a crime scene.Officers chased Mr. Bonds, 34, who wore a black hooded sweatshirt, black pants, black sneakers and black gloves. When they confronted him, he pointed his five-shot Ruger revolver at them and fired, a preliminary investigation indicates. The officers \u2014 a sergeant and a patrol officer \u2014 shot him dead. A bystander struck during the shootout was in stable condition.\u201cHe clearly had to look at her to get the kind of target acquisition it would take to shoot somebody in the head,\u201d a law enforcement official said. \u201cIt does not appear that he fired a whole lot of shots at her. So it looked like a straight-up assassination.\u201dThe attack underlined a challenge bedeviling New York City as crime falls to record lows: how to marshal public health resources and coordinate city agencies to treat the most violent and vulnerable citizens, many of them afflicted as Mr. Bonds was by serious mental illness.An aunt, Nancy Kearse, 55, said Mr. Bonds was released from a Bronx hospital only last week after a breakdown in June. His condition had been diagnosed as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, she said, and he had been taking anti-psychotic medication. She said he had been admitted to Bellevue Hospital Center several times in the last 15 years.Officer Familia, 48, who was known for a no-nonsense demeanor in her 12 years in the Police Department, grew up in Washington Heights in Manhattan amid the crack cocaine epidemic. She became a police officer in her mid-30s, after ending an earlier try at the Police Academy. She raised a daughter who is now in college and twins, all while caring for her mother in an apartment two miles north of where she was killed.\u201cShe was a warrior, tell you the truth,\u201d John Cuello, a nephew, said. \u201cShe was a fighter, she was tough \u2014 and that was the job for her.\u201dFor some residents who said the city too often skimps on police resources in the Bronx, the mobile command post offered a measure of assurance.Three miles south, outside the apartment where Mr. Bonds lived on the Rev. James A. Polite Avenue in the Morrisania neighborhood, residents said he had often spoken with addicts before they took drug purchases from other men on the block. He had been on parole since May 2013, after being locked up for eight years on a robbery conviction in Syracuse. He had also been convicted of selling drugs near a school and had been arrested on suspicion of punching an officer in Queens in 2001 with brass knuckles.Since his release in 2013, though, he appeared to have minimal police contact and had complied with the conditions of his parole. In the video he posted online about the police, many of his complaints stemmed from what he described as dangerous conditions in state prisons and a lack of accountability for guards.On July 4, Mr. Bonds returned from work at a fast-food restaurant around 7:30 p.m. and began drinking with friends on the corner, a neighbor said.His behavior alarmed his girlfriend, who, around 9 p.m., called the police several times as she followed him down a street farther south in the Bronx and reported that he was paranoid and manic, a law enforcement official said. Asked by the operator if he was armed or violent, the girlfriend said no, the official said.Officers and an ambulance crew reached the street where the woman was calling from, but Mr. Bonds had left. The officers classified the call as for an emotionally disturbed person and left.Soon after midnight, Mr. Bonds was dressed in an all-black outfit that officials believe he was using to escape undetected and carrying a revolver that had been reported stolen several years ago in West Virginia. He passed a deli, turned toward the mobile command post, cinched his hood tighter over his face and then fired one shot through a passenger-side window, said J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman.There was no indication that Mr. Bonds said anything before he fired, and detectives said they did not believe he knew Officer Familia. She was in uniform at the front of a fully lighted truck, a situation in which officers tend to feel at ease, police officials said. Officer Familia was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where she was pronounced dead about three hours after the shooting.\u201cMake no mistake: Officer Familia was murdered for her uniform and for the responsibility she embraced,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill wrote in the message to the department. \u201cAnd for the N.Y.P.D., regularly achieving lower and lower crime figures means absolutely nothing when one of our own is brutally shot and killed.\u201dIt also renewed worries in the Police Department about the risk of officers being targeted in their cars. The department has recently installed bulletproof protection on the doors of more than 2,000 patrol cars; in January the city allocated funding for bulletproof window panels on 3,800 cars and last month received its first delivery of 500 pairs of windows.In 2015, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio began tracking a small number of people with a history of violence and mental illness, but the program was slow to take shape. The city declined to say whether Mr. Bonds had been on its radar but said that 364 people were now in the program, up from 78 in its early stages.Reporting was contributed by Sewell Chan, Joseph Goldstein, Jeffery C. Mays, James C. McKinley Jr., Gerry Mullany, Sarah Maslin Nir, Emily Palmer, Sean Piccoli, Rick Rojas, Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed, Michael Schwirtz and Nikita Stewart. Susan C.

Still, she longed for a country pet to round out the menagerie at her home in a semirural neighborhood in Los Angeles County. A horse was too big for the backyard, a chicken impossible to cuddle. That is why in March she found herself at a Jack in the Box in Lancaster, Calif., a desert town on the western edge of the Mojave Desert, where she met a goat breeder with two Nigerian dwarf kids in the back of his Honda Odyssey.\u201cI know there are stereotypes: They eat cans and smell bad,\u201d said William Kowalik, a representative of the American Goat Society. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. They are very much like dogs. They are great pets. The goats know what kind of mood you are in. They can get a person to open up.\u201dThe internet\u2019s new favorite pet is giving cats and dogs a run for their money.Goats have a defined social caste, despite their laid back goofiness. \u201cEveryone has their own spot,\u201d said Mr. Kowalik, who has goats and lives in San Antonio. \u201cThey learn the order, and if you don\u2019t follow it, they will pout.\u201d If a goat sniffs another goat\u2019s food, \u201cthey\u2019ll walk off and refuse to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a piece of watermelon touches the ground, they won\u2019t eat it. They also get into: \u2018That\u2019s not my bowl. I am not going to drink from it.\u2019\u201d\u201cA guitarist in H20, a popular punk band from 1990s, called and wanted to come by and see the goats,\u201d said Mr. Edwards, who obliged. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018You guys were my favorite band.\u2019\u201d Another time a family from Pennsylvania went to his house to visit Kevin and company. And last year, Mr. Edwards got a message from a college friend in Los Angeles who wanted to visit his goats after seeing photos on Facebook. She was getting a divorce, Mr. Edwards said. He was single. They texted for months. She came to see the goats, then moved back to Utah. In April, they got married.\u201cGoats bring people together,\u201d he said.Perhaps the most difficult part of owning a goat is finding a neighborhood zoned for farm animals. Leanne Lauricella started the Goats of Anarchy animal rescue in 2015. She had left her job as an event planner in Manhattan and moved to rural New Jersey, where she adopted two rescue goats. The herd has grown to 52, a haven for animals that have lost feet because of frostbite, are missing limbs, were abused or have congenital disorders.The response from her followers was overwhelming. Within an hour, more than 3,000 people offered condolences. That number rose to 23,445 by the week\u2019s end. One of those who commented was Patricia Hunt from Concord, Calif., who said she cried when Lawson died. She does not own a goat, but she felt a kinship with Ms. Lauricella and her herd. \u201cI was so pulling for him,\u201d she said of Lawson.Of course, the photos were posted on Instagram.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dog Praised as Hero for Saving Deer (Whether He Meant To or Not)", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClearly, he is a hero.The lump was a fawn, which the dog dragged onto the sand. There it lay, alive but barely moving.Storm gently nudged the fawn\u2019s belly. It scarcely responded. He nuzzled it again. Nothing. He pawed at its tiny hooves. Then the video ended.The video footage has launched Storm to sudden social media stardom and sent him on a tour of morning TV talk shows.Banish any thought that the dog, a 6-year-old English golden retriever owned by Mark Freeley, a personal injury lawyer from East Setauket, N.Y., might have simply been following his instinct to retrieve.Definitely do not imagine that the dog was hungry.\u201cI was there, and if anybody knows Storm, they know that\u2019s not in his heart,\u201d said Mr. Freeley, who captured the moment on his phone while out with the golden retriever and his other, less famous dog, Sarah, a rescued Border collie. \u201cHe is the most gentle, gracious dog you ever want to meet.\u201dMr. Freeley, who also fosters rescue dogs and does pro bono legal work for a local animal rescue, said Storm \u201cgrasped the deer by the neck \u2014 just the way a lifeguard would put his arm over someone\u2019s neck \u2014 and dragged him in.\u201dIn the video, Storm licks the deer\u2019s jugular. \u201cIt was so touching,\u201d Mr. Freeley said. \u201cIt showed he really had a care and was worried about the fawn.\u201dMr. Freeley said he left to get help. He called a group he knew, Strong Island Animal Rescue League. Frank Floridia, who runs the organization, arrived with leashes and nets.By then, the fawn had wobbled back up. It took one look at the men and two dogs and darted back into the water, Mr. Floridia said. \u201cThey are animals of flight; they are going to take off wherever they can go,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a yard, they will smash through a wooden fence.\u201dThe fawn paddled out again, this time about 250 feet. After a failed attempt by Storm to fetch it once more, Mr. Floridia took off his shirt and, in his sneakers and shorts, swam out and grabbed the deer.Many fawns that are brought to the animal rescue, Ms. Ketcham said, are there because of dogs \u2014 and not heroic ones. \u201cI think the dog did a very good thing, but I\u2019m very realistic about what dogs do \u2014 dogs tend to chew these little deer up,\u201d she said.The fawn will eventually be returned to the wild, she said. But it is recovering from many ailments, including subcutaneous emphysema, a condition in which air bubbles are trapped under the skin, making it feel like \u201cBubble Wrap,\u201d Ms. Ketcham said. The illness can be caused by trauma.Being in a dog\u2019s mouth, Ms. Ketcham said, could be considered traumatic \u2014 but so could falling off a sandy cliff, the rescuers\u2019 leading theory of how the fawn got in the water.(Pay no attention to the naysayers who may suspect that a dog chased it there.)\u201cOfficially this was a wonderful thing that the dog saved the deer,\u201d Ms. Ketcham said. \u201cBut I think, if he was left to his own devices, the deer would not survive.\u201dCharacter witnesses for Storm include a parade of foster puppies the Freeleys have taken in over the last month. \u201cThey tortured this poor guy,\u201d Mr. Freeley said. \u201cAnd he did nothing.\u201dThe family\u2019s rabbit, Speedo, often sleeps on the dog\u2019s back. Although Storm adamantly refuses to fetch, Mr. Freeley said, the dog seemed to know the stakes were high in retrieving the fawn.\u201cA dog with his need to retrieve spearheaded the rescue,\u201d said Ms. Kutzing, the animal rescuer. The details, she said, do not really matter \u201cas long as the ending is happy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the breed of Storm the dog.

{"Headline": "Dispute Over Singapore Founder\u2019s House Becomes a National Crisis", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Two years after his death, no memorials, statues or streets in Singapore are named after Lee Kuan Yew, who established this city-state as a modern nation and built it into a prosperous showcase for his view that limited political freedoms best suit Asian values.Now a bitter and public family dispute over the fate of his modest house has shattered Singapore\u2019s image as an orderly authoritarian ideal and hinted at deeper divisions about its political future.Two of Mr. Lee\u2019s three children have accused their elder brother, the prime minister, of abusing his power to preserve the house against their father\u2019s wishes. The motive, they said, is to shore up his own political legitimacy and ultimately to establish a dynasty for which he is grooming his son.These charges have transformed what on the surface is an ugly estate battle into a national crisis that has raised questions about how this island nation is governed, the basis of the governing party\u2019s uninterrupted 58-year rule and how the country\u2019s leaders are chosen.\u201cAnd, more important for the people of Singapore,\u201d she continued, \u201cthey reveal that the \u2018A Team,\u2019 who have for decades presented themselves as the best option for the country, are actually using the power the electorate has bestowed upon them for their own personal goals.\u201dPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 65, has called the accusations \u201cbaseless,\u201d and he appeared in a high-stakes performance before a special session of Parliament on Monday and Tuesday to rebut the charges.On Tuesday he said no evidence of abuse of power had been presented, and he characterized the controversy as a distraction. \u201cThis is not a soap opera,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must all get back to work.\u201dBut as much as he would like to put the whole affair behind him, the crisis shows no signs of abating.If it tended toward authoritarianism \u2014 dissent was discouraged, the government controlled the media, criticism was met with punishing defamation lawsuits and elections never changed who was in power \u2014 most Singaporeans were happy to accept limits on freedom in exchange for prosperity.Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s People\u2019s Action Party has never lost its hold on power since 1959, and today it controls 83 of 89 elected seats in Parliament.One of his last wishes was that the house where he had lived for nearly 70 years be demolished after his death. He did not want it to become a museum, he said, where visitors would \u201ctrudge through\u201d and turn the place into \u201ca shambles.\u201dThe house itself, a musty five-bedroom affair at 38 Oxley Road, is not grand. More than 100 years old, it lacks a foundation, and dampness creeps up the walls. Maintenance has been deferred for decades. Walls are stained and cracked. Furnishings have not been updated in years.A pair of urns containing the ashes of Mr. Lee and his wife sit side by side on a small shelf in the main room.Despite the wealth created under the leadership of Mr. Lee, who was prime minister from 1959 until 1990, the house is emblematic of his modest lifestyle and a symbol of clean government.But the home\u2019s historical significance is undeniable. A basement room, set up with a long table and chairs, was the meeting place in the 1950s for the independence leaders who eventually rose to power, the spot where the People\u2019s Action Party was born.Despite this history, Mr. Lee left clear instructions in his will that the house should be torn down. The unsentimental leader doubted anyone would care, even his children.He stipulated that his daughter, who took care of him in his last years, could live there as long as she wished. She is only 62, so the final disposition of the property might not come for decades.They accused him of creating a secret government committee to circumvent their father\u2019s will for his own political benefit and of misusing his position \u201cto drive his personal agenda.\u201dSingaporeans are divided. Some see the value in preserving a piece of Singapore\u2019s history, while others think that Lew Kuan Yew\u2019s final wish should be honored. And some believe the whole affair should have been kept private.\u201cThis is a personal family issue, and it shouldn\u2019t be brought to the national level because it might create a bad impression around the world,\u201d said Tan Chuan Jin, 19, an information technology student.But just as it was difficult to separate Mr. Lee from the country he built, it is impossible to erase the politics from the house. Preserving it would provide a physical reminder not only of Mr. Lee, analysts said, but also of the current prime minister\u2019s connection to him.\u201cFor the ruling party, the house is a symbol of their legacy,\u201d said Li Shengwu, Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s son, an economist at Harvard University. \u201cIt is a symbol uniquely associated with them and gives them legitimacy.\u201dQuestions of legitimacy and abuse of power cut to the core weakness of a one-party state.\u201cThe people are more aware that the key issue is the abuse of political power,\u201d Sinapan Samydorai, the director of Southeast Asian affairs at Think Center, a nonprofit policy center in Singapore, said in an email.\u201cThere are few checks and balances to prevent such abuse,\u201d he added. \u201cThe trust and legitimacy of the government is being eroded, and the people\u2019s confidence in the system may slowly evaporate.\u201dSo more than the prime minister\u2019s reputation was on the line when he went before Parliament this week.On the dynasty question, he said his son, Li Hongyi, had no interest in politics. And Mr. Lee denied that he wanted to preserve the house to exploit his father\u2019s \u201caura.\u201d\u201cIf I needed such magic properties to bolster my authority even after being your P.M. for 13 years, I must be in a pretty sad state,\u201d he said.As for the no-longer-secret committee, he insisted that he had nothing to do with it and had recused himself from any government decisions relating to the house. The committee\u2019s job, he said, was only to \u201clist options for the house, so that when a decision does become necessary one day\u201d the government would be prepared.But his younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, said Monday that the prime minister was using the committee to \u201cattack the validity of our father\u2019s final will.\u201d Any such questions should be decided by a court, he said.Analysts said the prime minister needed to put the issue to rest and reassure the public that Singapore\u2019s government was fair-minded and aboveboard.It was not clear by Tuesday whether the parliamentary sessions, which included questioning by opposition members and statements of support by the prime minister\u2019s allies, had achieved that.\u201cUltimately, Prime Minister Lee and the government have to prevail in the court of public opinion,\u201d said Eugene Tan, an associate law professor at Singapore Management University. \u201cThey have their work cut out for them, and how they do so matters immensely to Singapore and Singaporeans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pinterest Wants to Show Advertisers It Can Run With the Big Dogs", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUp and down the festival\u2019s main boulevard, displays showcased new technology that allows users to search the digital scrapbook site using pictures taken on their smartphones. It claimed a beachfront space for the week and called it Pinterest Pier, a place where colorful signs highlighted the company\u2019s popularity among its users and the potential that represented for brands. (\u201cSee the possibilities,\u201d a sign declared at the beach\u2019s entrance.) Refreshments based on popular Pinterest posts were served, complete with physical cards that mimicked their appearance online.The pageantry represented Pinterest\u2019s renewed efforts with advertisers, which have escalated in the past 10 months as it looks to regain its early buzz and show what it believes sets it apart from the likes of Google, Facebook and Snapchat. Part of that includes breaking from its understated style and playing the game: In addition to its setup at Cannes, it made a splashy appearance at this year\u2019s South by Southwest festival and has attended at other industry events.\u201cIt\u2019s a focus for this year, building better tools and better relationships,\u201d Ben Silbermann, the soft-spoken chief executive and co-founder of Pinterest, said in an interview at an ad agency conference in April, where he was a speaker. A major part of that has been \u201ceducating marketers who may not be that familiar with the platform on what it is and what it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Yet Pinterest\u2019s users, the majority of whom are women, often provide a gold mine for advertisers with their searches and by \u201cpinning\u201d posts that they are interested in, indicating if they are exploring items tied to home redecoration, weddings or everyday needs like recipes and clothes before they have decided what to buy. Pinterest has been positioning itself as a better alternative to Google for search marketing, saying its connection with its users comes a step before someone types words into a search engine, especially now that it offers nascent visual search technology.\u201cThe pitch to advertisers is explaining what people do on the platform,\u201d Mr. Silbermann said. \u201cWhat they do is try to design their life. That\u2019s always a good place to be; Google\u2019s pitch is, \u2018People find stuff here.\u2019\u201dBut changing perceptions has not been Pinterest\u2019s only hurdle with advertisers. The company asks that ads on Pinterest mimic user posts, providing their own beautiful imagery and helpful tips \u2014 another parallel that Mr. Silbermann drew to Google, given how its ads blend in with search results. While they can be more effective than ads that interrupt photos of friends on social networks, it\u2019s a different kind of work for marketers and means that they have one more platform that they need to specifically design content for.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen brands achieve return on investment with Pinterest that blows away Facebook and Instagram, but that only happens when marketers share useful content and inspiring ideas,\u201d said Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company. \u201cIt takes a shift in habits, which takes time.\u201dThe company was also hampered by taking off \u201cat the tipping point of the desktop-to-app transition,\u201d GroupM, the media investing arm of ad giant WPP, said in a report this year, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s likely that its commercial progress was slowed by its immaturity and a need to build for the desktop platform for which it was conceived.\u201dStill, the firm has a positive outlook on Pinterest, adding that with the introduction of promoted pins and search ads, the company \u201cmay be a serious challenger as a natural link between interest (not quite the same as intent) and commerce.\u201dGoogle dominates search advertising, which brings in tens of billions in revenue for the company a year \u2014 and it too has a visual search technology called Google Lens. But that has not stopped the ambitions of its rivals, which were on particular display in Cannes during a panel hosted by Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science agency. The panel, called \u201cConsumer Discovery and a New Way to Search,\u201d featured Pinterest\u2019s sales chief speaking about image search and Amazon\u2019s vice president of global ad sales on voice search, making it clear that they were representing the new ways of searching.The company has also been trying to enhance its appeal with the public, running its first brand campaign in the United States last month around the phrase \u201cWhat if.\u201d The ads featured the phrase and Pinterest\u2019s name on striking photos, like that of a decadent pink milkshake topped with candy and a doughnut and another of an extremely fluffy poodle.Some in the industry viewed Pinterest\u2019s prominent setup in Cannes last month as a sign of more to come from the company.\u201cThere\u2019s an order of operations for Pinterest and it speaks to the methodological nature of Ben Silbermann \u2014 don\u2019t get flashy until you are absolutely confident,\u201d said Kevin Knight, the chief marketing officer of Experticity, who led Pinterest\u2019s creative and brand strategy until last year. \u201cThey had to wait until they were absolutely confident they could stand up in that bright light and withstand the scrutiny, so you\u2019ll see them get way more vocal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Competitive Stuyvesant, Alumni Are Waging a Bitter Contest", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAccusations of bullying, sham elections, secret financial deals \u2014 these are not charges that are usually associated with a high school alumni association.\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially all been ill-treated,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Golland (Stuyvesant \u201957), who is organizing a 60th reunion for his class in the fall, which he says the alumni association refused to publicize to its Facebook group until last week. \u201cThey\u2019ve alienated many, many groups of people.\u201dMr. Kim (\u201993), says his detractors are a \u201chandful of malcontents\u201d acting out of personal animus against him and hurting the organization and the school.Members of the association\u2019s board of directors are elected to three-year terms, which are staggered so that roughly a third of the positions come open each year. The board nominates a slate of candidates (the same number as there are open positions), and the dues-paying members of the association either vote for them or abstain; they cannot vote against a candidate. The directors elect their officers annually. Mr. Kim was first elected president in 2014.After ascending to the presidency, Mr. Kim announced a deal with the other two organizations under which they would dissolve and fund-raising would be centralized in the alumni association. At that point, the three groups had combined assets of about $2.4 million. By contrast, the endowment funds created by alumni of Stuyvesant\u2019s rivals, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School, stand at $6 million and $13 million.Although many alumni agreed that it was important to centralize fund-raising, murkiness about the terms of the deal led some to accuse Mr. Kim of acting without fully informing association members.Beth Knobel (\u201980), a former producer for CBS News, is one of those critics. She joined the board of the association in June 2015 to push what she said were needed reforms. She contended that the board\u2019s election procedures were undemocratic, the organization was spending too much on management and the group\u2019s financial reporting needed to be more transparent.She said other board members were hostile to her proposals.Once on the board, she said, she discovered it was not following the rules in its bylaws and handbook. In a conference call last November, she asked the board\u2019s governance committee to resolve the conflicts and to consider new bylaws she thought would improve management.She said that when Mr. Kim told her that was not how the organization wanted to spend its time and energy, she resigned.Mr. Kim said in an interview and subsequent email messages that the election procedures were standard for nonprofit organizations. He said he was comfortable with the share of total expenditures spent on management and fund-raising \u2014 33 percent, according to a draft financial filing for the 2016 fiscal year that he provided. That level of overhead is slightly high for a nonprofit, though not significantly so. In 2015, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation spent 19 percent of its total expenditures on management and fund-raising, while the Bronx High School of Science Endowment Fund spent 29 percent.Mr. Kim disputed Ms. Knobel\u2019s account of the governance committee call that preceded her resignation, saying the committee had adopted some of her suggestions, but not all, and that she had \u201creacted badly.\u201dMs. Knobel said the governance committee did not adopt any of her recommendations.Some of the most heated criticism has concerned Mr. Kim\u2019s handling of the unification of the groups. Friends of Stuyvesant quickly dissolved, as agreed, and turned over $600,000 in assets to the alumni association to form the seed of an endowment, Mr. Kim said. But the alumni association\u2019s dealings with the Campaign for Stuyvesant have not been as straightforward.By 2014, when the unification deal was reached, the Campaign for Stuyvesant had very little money left, despite having raised about $4 million. It had given $142,025 in scholarships to Stuyvesant students and grants to the school and had spent nearly all the rest on salaries, consultants, travel and other expenses, according to public documents. By the end of 2015, the date of its last filing with the Internal Revenue Service, it had $314,235 in assets.In a phone interview, Neal H. Hurwitz (\u201962), the campaign\u2019s executive director, disputed that the organization had spent any of its money unwisely.\u201cUnfortunately, people who were naysayers and people who were jealous and envious and whatever were always attempting to destroy the campaign,\u201d he said.As part of his effort to persuade the campaign\u2019s board to cease operations, Mr. Kim created a group within the alumni association called the trustees, who would manage the endowment fund, and he invited the campaign\u2019s board members to become trustees. The alumni association also hired the campaign\u2019s two staff members, including Mr. Hurwitz. In the end Mr. Hurwitz left the alumni association after less than a year. Neither he nor Mr. Kim would say why.The campaign has yet to turn over any money to the alumni association, which has raised alarms for some alumni, who say they worry that the group is spending its paltry assets.Others question why Mr. Kim brought individuals who had run such a troubled organization into the association.\u201cOne day there\u2019s a new group of directors who are called trustees, but who have no brief, who were certainly not elected,\u201d Nicholas Griffin, who graduated in 1980, said. \u201cMaybe it was a good idea,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it was never explained.\u201dMr. Kim said that, in unifying the three organizations, he had achieved something that others had tried unsuccessfully for years, and that it had been important to be inclusive. He said there had never been an agreement that the campaign would turn over any money to the association and that he had little leverage to persuade its remaining board members to do so.But \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, because \u201cthey\u2019re gone.\u201d He added, \u201cThe only people who care about their entity is these four or five folks that are just really upset at me personally.\u201dDr. Lawrence Marshall (\u201961), a former member of the alumni association\u2019s board, said he resigned in 2015 out of frustration with what he saw as the organization\u2019s lack of progress. To him, the biggest problem was how little money the association had raised from Stuyvesant alumni.\u201cWe have not done a good job, period, in convincing these people to be supportive of a place that in most instances played a huge role in the success they have achieved,\u201d he said.An article on Tuesday about conflicts between members of Stuyvesant High School\u2019s alumni groups misstated the voting procedures of the board of the school\u2019s alumni association. Members can vote for a candidate or abstain; they cannot vote a candidate down.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201dFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201dEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201dAt least they hope not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For $350 in Rent, a Tenant Becomes a Landlord\u2019s Helper", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRentersMost bad-roommate stories end with someone moving out. Sometimes, it\u2019s the meddlesome party who is exorcised, but more often than not, the reasonable roommate is the one who leaves, sacrificing his space, and sometimes his security deposit, to salvage his sanity. As far as happy endings go, relief is usually the extent of it.One of his roommates, he said, had become increasingly unpleasant to live with after losing his job. First, the roommate shut off the cooking gas to spite his girlfriend, who also lived there, then the internet went out, at which point turnover in the other two bedrooms became brisk.The roommate and his girlfriend, with whom Mr. Armlovich had shared a previous apartment, were the only ones named on the lease, and Mr. Armlovich later found out that the couple were making a profit renting out the other rooms, including his. But it wasn\u2019t until the roommate removed all the apartment\u2019s smoke alarms and then filed a complaint with the city as an excuse to withhold rent that Mr. Armlovich said he decided it was time to go.That, he figured, was the end of things. But about a year later, he got a call from his former landlord, Kay Doobay, 72, a retired home health care worker who lives on the first floor of the two-story house. The roommate hadn\u2019t paid rent in a year, she told Mr. Armlovich, and she was taking him to housing court. Would Mr. Armlovich be willing to testify that the upstairs apartment had been in good condition, with smoke detectors, when he lived there? Mr. Armlovich, who had found Ms. Doobay kind and generous (she often cooked dinner for them and once gave a subletter sleeping on the floor a futon), told her he would.After Mr. Armlovich testified, the roommate was ordered to pay six months of back rent \u2014 half the amount he owed, according to Ms. Doobay. A few months later, Ms. Doobay approached Mr. Armlovich with his own deal: a reduced rent of $350 a month in exchange for finding and vetting other tenants for the top-floor apartment.Mr. Armlovich agreed, on the condition that they charge reasonable rates for the other rooms. He didn\u2019t want to have his reduced rent come at the expense of others, he said. And since he would be selecting his roommates, he felt lower rents would ensure a good pool of people from which to choose.\u201cKay is very doting,\u201d Mr. Armlovich said. \u201cShe even switches out the curtains seasonally. She has winter curtains, Easter curtains, summer curtains.\u201dEmily Hamilton, 21, who moved into one of the $700-a-month rooms this May, said she was pleasantly surprised to find a setup that felt so \u201chomelike.\u201d\u201cWhen I lived in Queens before, the apartment never felt very secure,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, we all know Kay. She\u2019ll come up and be like, \u2018I just made dinner for you.\u2019 One day, I just mentioned, \u2018Oh, a plant would be nice here.\u2019 And the next day, there\u2019s a plant.\u201dAfter a long stretch of departing roommates slotting in their friends, this year Mr. Armlovich has had to earn his keep: Two of the roommates moved into a higher-end apartment complex in the neighborhood, and another left to live with her boyfriend.Mimi Schweid, 24, a friend of Ms. Hamilton\u2019s from Marymount Manhattan College, moved into the other $700 room this spring. The $850 room, meanwhile is still vacant: Mr. Armlovich said he had talked to a number of people but hadn\u2019t yet found a good fit.\u201cIf Alex says he recommends someone, we trust him,\u201d said Ms. Doobay, adding that she was O.K. with leaving the room empty for a few months waiting for a compatible renter.At the moment, however, Mr. Armlovich has a much more difficult task: He\u2019s looking for someone to take over his room \u2014 and his role \u2014 in the house. This fall, he\u2019s moving to Massachusetts to start a master\u2019s program at Harvard Kennedy School.But, he said, he is optimistic that he will be able to find a trustworthy replacement: After his first unfortunate turn in the apartment, he has had only good roommates.\u201cThe important test for me is, \u2018Have you ever had a good roommate?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Armlovich. He came to this wisdom after realizing his last bad roommate was always talking about how everyone had screwed him over. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018no,\u2019 then they\u2019re the bad roommate.\u201dThe Renters column last Sunday, about two roommates in a Bushwick apartment, reversed the ages of the two women, Emily Hamilton and Mimi Schweid.

ABCV calls this beverage Joy.Sustainability was a theme in the first two ABC restaurants, but ABCV extends the idea into a boutique wellness exercise.

Some of it is memorable, and none of it makes you feel as if you have asked your stomach to do things it wasn\u2019t meant to do. These are the two sides of ABCV: a missionary message combined with cooking that has a large measure of creativity and surprise. I guess that qualifies as \u201chigh vibration.\u201dSome of the most engaging courses at ABCV are dips. The gold medal in this event goes to the green hummus made with fresh chickpeas and Thai basil and served with substantial puffs of whole-grain pita. Good hummus has many fine qualities, but it is rarely exciting. This is. Running a close second is the labneh fortified with shallots, which give it some of the charm of an old-fashioned cocktail-party onion dip. It is great on purple potato chips or cucumbers (\u201ca warrior against hypertension and heart disease\u201d).Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Neal Harden, focus their salads in ways that turn them into precise statements. There\u2019s nothing random about the pairing of bitter radicchio with ripe strawberries, a few of which are crushed so they get smeared around the purple leaves and join forces with the saffron vinaigrette.Warm appetizers are built with a similar care. Grilled caps of donko shiitakes the size of muffin tops are spread with a green goddess dressing with a tingling charge of yuzukosho. The mushrooms (whose B vitamins help \u201cmanage physical and emotional stress\u201d) come with caramelized fennel, a more apt partner than you might guess.Roasted carrots (\u201ceat with oil or a fat to absorb the full benefit of her beta-carotene\u201d) are spritzed with lime and piled over an excellent and spicy butter, ground from toasted nuts and seeds.Mr. Vongerichten and Mr. Harden aren\u2019t playing in that sandbox. They\u2019ve got their own toys. When a squirt of lime juice can help, squirt they will.One or two dishes struck this omnivore as not quite complete. A plate of crisp, salty, horseradish-spiked sauerkraut made from savoy cabbage was a little monotonous on its own. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s fantastic on a hot dog.I also wanted more heft from the parts of the menu headed \u201cnoodles and rice\u201d and \u201clegumes and grains.\u201d In the wild rice with spring vegetables and fermented carrots, rice was an ensemble player, not the lead.And when my server recommended the spinach spaghetti by means of a story about cooking pasta at his mother\u2019s side, I was hoping for more than a sparrow\u2019s nest of green noodles under a mulch of kale and broccoli (\u201ca cruciferous that prevents premature aging\u201d).

Where do you go that\u2019s safe, if not your home?\u201dIs the news media in Australia biased?Ms. Abdel-Magied\u2019s comments (and Ms. Macsween\u2019s) come after several recent instances of what critics called racism in the mainstream news media.\u2022 In a segment for the Sky News Australia show \u201cOutsiders,\u201d the host Rowan Dean told Tim Soutphommasane, the race discrimination commissioner on the Australian Human Rights Commission, that his calls for more diversity in the news media were an attack on Anglo-Celtics. \u201cTim, if you don\u2019t like it,\u201d he told the French-born commissioner, who is of Laotian descent, \u201cjoin Yassmin [Abdel-Magied], hop on a plane and go back to Laos.\u201d\u2022 Fairfax Media\u2019s The Age published an article about Melbourne\u2019s bicycle-sharing program, oBike, with the headline, \u201cAre oBikes Melbourne\u2019s new yellow peril?\u201d \u201cYellow peril\u201d is an archaic, racist term that characterizes East Asian immigrants as a threat. The Age changed the headline and deleted a tweet that had used it.Given that this is a snapshot from just the past week or so, perhaps it\u2019s not hard to imagine why she\u2019d feel betrayed.[2:40 p.m.]The report also said that the Australian special forces discussed planting weapons on dead Afghans to create the illusion that those killed were armed combatants. Most of the documents are reports on events from 2009 to 2013.The inspector general of the Australian Defense Force is conducting an inquiry, and the Australian Federal Police told the ABC that they were also considering an investigation.Australian forces aren\u2019t the first to be accused in civilian deaths. But the troubling elements outlined in the report, like a \u201cbody count\u201d culture that celebrates racking up numbers of killed enemies, could point to more systemic issues.We asked several military experts for insight, and they suggested a few changes.1. Minimize inquiries.\u201cSometimes, there was an overreaction to what didn\u2019t need an external inquiry to be looked into,\u201d he said, referring to his experience in war. \u201cIt was something that should have been handled in theater.\u201dAside from fostering protectionism and cover-ups, he said, emphasis on civilian deaths may unwittingly give the enemy a tool.\u201cYour opposition also know that accusations of civilian casualties are a lethal weapon in the social media space,\u201d Mr. Shanahan said.Finally there are the logistical challenges of an investigation, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lag time in the time between an incident happens and the inquiry happening, and the war goes on,\u201d Mr. Shanahan said.\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could guarantee that nobody has spoken to each other,\u201d he said, warning that either the accusers or the accused could potentially fabricate false narratives.2. Follow the broader inquiry through.The inspector general\u2019s investigation will prove invaluable because it is looking beyond an individual case, said Bob Lowry, who served in the Australian Army for 30 years and is president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in Canberra.\u201cWhen it\u2019s happened twice, three, four times, you\u2019ve then got a systemic problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWas it someone from above demanding measures be taken? Was it something that grew from below? The thing to do is to talk to all the people involved, and find out what it is, where it came from, and what caused it to be in the first place.\u201d\u201cOnce you understand what\u2019s happened,\u201d he added, \u201cthen you can decide what measures to take.\u201d3. Re-emphasize the objective.One document in the leak referred to a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d as a potentially systemic issue. Mr. Lowry said that it was important to regularly emphasize that the mission\u2019s goal is the primary focus.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep a broader context and say, \u2018Look, we\u2019re not interested in how many people you\u2019ve killed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018What we\u2019re interested in is whether or not we\u2019re achieving the objective of the operation that we set out to.\u2019 You might be able to achieve that without killing anybody.\u201d[7:04 a.m.]It\u2019s a quintessentially Australian story, equal parts beer and cheek.A man identified only as \u201cDean\u201d claims to have checked in a single can of beer on a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Perth this past Saturday.His caper spread far and wide, being picked up by the likes of Time, Mashable and The New York Post.Naturally, here at The New York Times\u2019s Australia Bureau, we checked in with Qantas for comment.

Dough, extra wet and clingy, is slapped down on marble and patted flat with butter, then rolled and tugged into a gossamer pane, see-through and thinner than skin.This is folded and placed inside another pane of dough, which in turn is folded and placed inside another, and again, four, five, six times, like a series of Chinese boxes. Each is painted with margarine, a stand-in for Egyptian samna, pure butterfat.A few hours to chill, then into the oven, from which it emerges as a great mottled crepe with burnished whorls and, inside, close-set layers like an accordion\u2019s pleats. It can barely wait to flake. All that butter and margarine have disappeared into crannies, leaving no more than a kiss of oil on the fingers.Feteer is sufficient unto itself. But here it comes with a choice of honey or gebna adeema, an aged Egyptian farm cheese inflamed by chile, whose orange hue, creaminess, tang and heat suggest an uncanny spiritual kinship to American pimento cheese. Other versions of feteer subtract a few foldings of dough to make room for stuffings of meat, cheese (slightly more prosaic mozzarella and Parmesan), olives in briny throbs and bell peppers for scattered brightness and crunch.Best is the house special, which unites three meats: ground beef simply salted in a sweat of onions; beef sausage warmed by baharat, Egyptian seven-spice, with sweet, musty contours of cardamom and cloves; and basturma, air-dried beef in thrall to garlic and fenugreek, so potent it\u2019s a rebuke to pastrami. Somehow this tastes light, a loose commingling of salts, with just enough cheese to bind.The menu cheerfully collapses the distinction between the cuisines of Egypt and the country Mr. Guirguis and Mr. Botros now call home. The pie of the restaurant\u2019s name refers to both Egyptian feteer, which Westerners often liken to pizza, and actual Italian-American pizza. (One customer made the mistake of asking for \u201cEgyptian pizza\u201d and received the tomato-sauce variety.) Each is allotted its own oven, and each is sent forth into the neighborhood in identical white pizza boxes for delivery.I never tried the pizza, nor the Philly cheesesteaks, meatball heroes, mozzarella sticks and baked ziti also on offer. My table was already crowded with hawawshi, a meat pie denser than feteer, made of chewier, yeast-risen dough; small, earthy falafel called ta\u2019ameya in Egypt, shaped from crushed fava beans, with bronzed shells and buoyant, parsley-green interiors; and a whole chicken for less than $10, rubbed down with seven-spice and made fervent overnight, then roasted on a spit and given a last spackle of char on the grill.For dessert, there is more feteer, filled with the likes of custard and Nutella. Ask what to choose, and Mr. Guirguis will gently steer you toward a sleeve of ishta, pillowy cream skimmed off the top of boiled milk. The pie\u2019s surface is a snowy plain of powdered sugar, inscribed with honey.Above, King Tut looks off into the distance, his beard braided with lapis lazuli. But this is splendor, to eat such a thing off a tin platter, at a teetering table on a Brooklyn sidewalk in high summer.Advertisement"}

(Light brown, even.) We saw a great deal of stone and concrete: brownstones and townhouses with high stoops and bulky front porches.So we asked Nina Browne, the botanic garden\u2019s community program manager, who has overseen the competition for years and trains the judges, how the winner is chosen.The most important of all the judging criteria, she said, is citizen participation, measured, for example, by looking for gaps in the presence of gardening on the street.\u201cIt boils down to people more than plants,\u201d Ms. Browne said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you get that tangible sense of love. Which block really felt the most unified? Where is that sense of community really most palpable? That\u2019s urban resilience right there.\u201dThere are three rounds of judging over the summer conducted by horticulturists, volunteers, and trustees and leaders of the botanic garden, who begin by giving each block a score to determine the finalists. After roughly 150 blocks were carefully reviewed, the finalists all seemed equally vibrant with plant material, Ms. Browne explained.\u201cSo at that point, it\u2019s really about people power,\u201d she said, referring to the sense of civic engagement and community cohesion among those who live there.We poked around the block last week and saw planters and urns of blooms in every color of the rainbow. Green Virginia creeper vines and Taxus hedges lined porches. Blue edging lobelia and purple million bells brightened the sidewalks. White and yellow petunias and rosy-red garden verbena plants were overflowing from barrels.\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to what people can do, despite not having dirt to dig in,\u201d Ms. Browne said of the city street.That civic spirit was palpable.When we ran into the \u201cblock captain,\u201d Serge Vatel, he said his neighbors shared one goal: \u201cWe want to set the bar for the entire Stuyvesant Heights.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our lobby,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt\u2019s the gateway to our neighborhood \u2014 the first block people see when they come out of the train station, and the last block they see on their way to work in the morning. It\u2019s like a watermark for the neighborhood: It tells everyone, new and old, \u2018This is our standard of living.\u2019\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The greenest streets will meet some of the bluest skies we\u2019ve seen in a while.Today is looking very sunny. And warm, too.Imagine using the same modes of transportation found in our city to trek across the country.Beginning today, two college students will do just that.Cate Boyle and Victoria Principato will leave New York City on a nearly monthlong trip across the country and parts of Canada, during which they\u2019ll travel by rail (Amtrak trains, primarily), bicycles, and public transportation including ferries, buses, streetcars and ride-sharing services.Safe travels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers in Russia Call for Retaliation Against New U.S. Sanctions", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDmitri S. Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, noted that the proposed American law was still a draft. The House and the Senate must reconcile their versions before submitting it for President Trump\u2019s signature.Any substantial response by Mr. Putin would require more study, Mr. Peskov said. Using one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite adjectives in describing the law, he said, \u201cIn the meantime, it can be said that the news is quite sad with regard to Russia-U.S. relations and prospects for their development.\u201d He added that it was \u201cno less depressing with regard to the international law and international commercial relations.\u201dSimilar sentiments emerged from several European capitals. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the new sanctions, targeting Iran and North Korea as well as Russia, appeared to contradict international law because of their global reach.There is concern in Europe that the American sanctions could ripple through the energy market because they target companies that contribute to the development, maintenance or modernization of the pipelines exporting Russian energy.That would most likely affect a hotly debated natural-gas pipeline project linking Russia with Germany, called Nord Stream 2, which is owned by the Russian state oil giant, Gazprom, but in which European firms hold financial stakes.Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign relations committee in the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian legislature, said Moscow must respond even if it waited for the final law.The reaction should be \u201cpainful for the Americans,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. He also suggested a temporary alliance with Europe.Sergei A. Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said that the new sanctions would bury any prospect of improving relations, calling the measures \u201cbeyond common sense.\u201d\u201cThe authors and sponsors of this bill are making a very serious step toward destruction of prospects for normalizing relations with Russia and do not conceal that that\u2019s their target,\u201d Mr. Ryabkov said, according to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass. Despite that, he added, Moscow remained ready to cooperate on shared concerns, including fighting terrorism.Last December, former President Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and the closing of two Russian diplomatic estates near Washington and New York. Mr. Putin, anticipating better relations under a Trump administration, did not respond at the time. Many say they believe the Russian leader\u2019s most likely first step will mirror those actions, and Moscow has been threatening to take such measures for weeks.The American bill, passed by a vote of 419 to 3 by the House of Representatives on Tuesday, bolsters economic sanctions against Russia that were imposed after Moscow annexed Crimea and destabilized Ukraine in 2014.The measures reflect Congress\u2019s growing unease with Mr. Trump\u2019s relatively warm attitude toward Russia despite repeated assertions from United States intelligence agencies that Moscow hacked the American election. The law would require Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval before lifting any sanctions \u2014 a curb on executive authority that has prompted mixed signals from the White House about whether Mr. Trump will sign any final version of the bill.Russia, effectively ignoring the fact that its election meddling had prompted the measures, used the push for tightened sanctions as further proof that deep forces in the American government were continuing to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s wish, expressed during the campaign, to improve ties with Moscow.Mr. Trump will sign the bill because he is \u201ca prisoner of Congress and anti-Russian hysteria,\u201d Aleksei K. Pushkov, another Russian legislator and frequent commentator on foreign relations, wrote on Twitter. He called the sanctions \u201ca new stage of confrontation\u201d and mused whether the restaurant chain McDonald\u2019s should be targeted in response.There has been concern in the American business community that the sanctions would harm their interests. In previous rounds, Washington consulted with Europe on sanctions to ensure that everyone was on the same page. Alexis Rodzianko, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said the lack of consultation and the cementing in place of the sanctions would put American firms at a disadvantage.\u201cIf there is no coordination, everyone goes their own way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like them,\u201d he added, referring to the sanctions.In response to Western sanctions in 2014, Moscow banned the import of many foods from the West, including cheese and fish. Those counter-sanctions are often lauded in Russia as helping foster agricultural development at home.It is considered unlikely that specific American companies would be targeted in any retaliation from Moscow, because Russia is just emerging from a recession. John F. Tefft, the American ambassador to Russia, noted recently that American firms employed about 175,000 people in the country, including many local executives.More than anything else, the proposed law left the impression that the American sanctions, whether effective or not, would endure.\u201cThere were sort of expectations that the sanctions would be gradually lifted because there would be progress in the political settlements in Ukraine,\u201d said Oleg Khokhlov, a partner with Goltsblat BLP, the Russian arm of Berwin Leighton Paisner, a London-based law firm.\u201cThe question was when would it happen,\u201d Mr. Khokhlov said. \u201cWith these sanctions now about to be converted into law, that makes it much more difficult, and you just have to realize that it is going to be for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Woman Pleads Guilty in Fianc\u00e9\u2019s Kayak Death on Hudson River", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA woman accused of killing her fianc\u00e9 by tampering with his kayak and then leaving him to drown in the cold and choppy waters of the Hudson River pleaded guilty on Monday to a reduced charge of criminally negligent homicide.The case drew attention far beyond the area just north of New York City where the death occurred, as prosecutors described how a seemingly doting partner desperately called 911 for help after her fianc\u00e9 disappeared only to tell investigators later that it \u201cfelt good knowing he was going to die.\u201dThe woman, Angelika Graswald, 37, was awaiting trial for second-degree murder and faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. She was charged in April 2015, after her fianc\u00e9, Vincent Viafore, 46, vanished after his kayak capsized during a trip on the Hudson River. The authorities said that Ms. Graswald had removed a plug from the boat and knew that a locking clip that kept the paddle in place was missing.The couple was returning on the evening of April 19 to the western shore of the Hudson from Bannerman Island, several miles north of West Point. The wind picked up, and Mr. Viafore, who was not wearing a life jacket or a wet suit, fell into the water. (His body was recovered in May.)In the days after Mr. Viafore\u2019s disappearance, Ms. Graswald behaved in ways that struck some who knew the couple as unusual, singing \u201cHotel California\u201d at a local pub and using social media to post selfies and a video clip that showed her doing a cartwheel. She was arrested on April 30, a day after an encounter with investigators on the island she had visited with Mr. Viafore the day he disappeared. She had returned there to leave flowers in his honor.Ms. Graswald\u2019s trial was to begin next month after multiple delays, and Mr. Portale said that prosecutors had approached them this month with the plea offer.\u201cThis plea ensures that the defendant will be held criminally liable for her actions,\u201d David M. Hoovler, the Orange County district attorney, said in a statement on Monday. \u201cBy pleading guilty the defendant has acknowledged that Vincent Viafore\u2019s death was not simply a tragic accident, but the result of this defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201dMs. Graswald is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 1. Under the terms of the agreement, she is expected to receive from 15 months to four years in prison, prosecutors said. But Mr. Portale said that, taking into account the 27 months she has spent in jail since being arrested, she expects to be released by the end of the year.\u201cShe knows she\u2019s coming home,\u201d Mr. Portale said. \u201cShe can focus on moving forward.\u201dBy pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide, Mr. Portale said, Ms. Graswald acknowledges that she took the plug from the kayak and that she was aware of the rough weather conditions on the river that day, but not that she intended to kill Mr. Viafore. \u201cThe record is clear that this was not an intentional killing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a case of negligence.\u201dMs. Graswald came to the United States from Latvia when she was 20, taking a job as an au pair for a family in Connecticut. Mr. Viafore, a construction manager who lived in Poughkeepsie, grew up near the Hudson River, in Wappinger, in southern Dutchess County. Both had been married twice before.Friends had described them as a loving couple who traveled to Eastern Europe together. On Facebook, Mr. Viafore had posted a photo of the couple kissing in front of a setting sun, saying they planned to have their wedding on the Baltic Sea.But during the interrogation, a video recording of which was expected to be presented as evidence at trial, Ms. Graswald expressed frustration to investigators about the couple\u2019s relationship, complaining about what she said was Mr. Viafore\u2019s interest in pornography and group sex. She also described her ambivalence as he drowned.At the end of the questioning, she blurted out, \u201cI wanted him dead and now he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d But in a subsequent television interview, Ms. Graswald said of Mr. Viafore that she \u201cloved him\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything to kill him.\u201dProsecutors said that in addition to removing the kayak\u2019s plug, Ms. Graswald had also tampered with Mr. Viafore\u2019s paddle. After he fell into the water, prosecutors said, she delayed in calling 911 and intentionally capsized her own kayak to make it look as if she had tried to save him.After Mr. Viafore\u2019s body was found in the river weeks later, the medical examiner, in a decision that was met with criticism, was explicit in detailing the cause of death: \u201ckayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That has made the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean the country off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.In response, Apple has taken a number of steps to ensure that it stays on Beijing\u2019s good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.The company said this month that it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in the country.Apple has operated its app store in China for many years with only occasional run-ins with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing\u2019s move in December to target news sites indicate that China\u2019s internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple\u2019s China app store.Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While Some Cry \u2018Fake,\u2019 Spotify Sees No Need to Apologize", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the last week, the music industry has been buzzing over the accusation that Spotify\u2019s playlists are dotted with hundreds of supposedly \u201cfake\u201d artists, with names like Amity Cadet and Lo Mimieux, who are racking up tens of millions of streams yet have no public profile \u2014 no Facebook page, no Twitter feed, not even a face.Spotify has also been accused of secretly controlling the rights to these songs \u2014 atmospheric, wordless tracks on mood-focused playlists with titles like \u201cDeep Sleep\u201d and \u201cPeaceful Piano\u201d \u2014 an arrangement that, if true, would allow the company to reduce the amount of money it pays in royalties to record labels and \u201creal\u201d artists.The reality, however, may be more complicated.Spotify denies that it owns the rights to the music under question, although the company may well pay lower royalty rates for these tracks than it does for more standard pop fare. And the pseudonymous creators of the tracks \u2014 real composers and producers, whose work appears under numerous made-up names \u2014 do not want to be called fake.Peter Sandberg, a 27-year-old composer in Sweden who has created a number of tracks on these playlists, called the term unfair.The suggestion that Spotify\u2019s system is unfair would exacerbate the problem.\u201cGenerally, folks are excited to see growth in the legitimate digital marketplace,\u201d said Kevin Erickson, the national organizing director of the Future of Music Coalition, an advocacy group. \u201cTo the extent that artists will have lingering questions about whether they are going to meaningfully share in that growth, incidents like this will add to their skepticism.\u201dOscar Hoglund, the chief executive of Epidemic Sound, said in an interview that as part of an mieffort to \u201csoundtrack the internet,\u201d his company also supplies background music for YouTube and Facebook videos, which he said had garnered 10 billion views a month.The company has put nearly 1,500 songs on Spotify, Mr. Hoglund said, but has no role in placing the songs on the service\u2019s playlists.Jonathan Prince, Spotify's global head of strategic initiatives, said in an interview that the unexpected popularity of its mood-based playlists \u2014 \u201cPeaceful Piano\u201d has 2.9 million followers \u2014 has created a demand for more of that material, which the company has actively worked to satisfy.\u201cWe\u2019ve found a need for content,\u201d Mr. Prince said. \u201cWe work with people who are interested in producing it.\u201dBy Spotify\u2019s standard royalty rates, 500 million streams would be worth about $3 million \u2014 money that the company could theoretically save if it owned the material that generated those streams.\u201cThese guys are in a big fight with the music business right now over how much they pay creators,\u201d said Matt Pincus, the chief executive of Songs Music Publishing, whose roster includes Lorde and the Weeknd. \u201cThe more controversies they have that have a moral underpinning to them, the more of a problem they will have in the bigger fight.\u201dAs some in the business see it, the \u201cfake\u201d controversy could endanger future deals, although many labels, big and small, have protections in their licensing contracts that forbid Spotify from owning content or deliberately driving customers to lower-cost songs.Mr. Prince did not deny that the songs may cost Spotify less to play. But he said that the placement of all songs on its playlists was determined only by their popularity among listeners.\u201cThis is a marketplace, and not all content is priced the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are legit deals between us and labels that everyone feels comfortable with.\u201dIf Spotify has arranged a lower royalty rate for these tracks, those 500 million streams could cost it much less than $3 million. For some musicians, that may still be plenty.Mr. Hoglund, the Epidemic Sound chief, said that his company typically purchased the rights to music from its composers for a flat fee, but that for music on Spotify it split additional royalties evenly with its composers.Mr. Sandberg, who said he was \u201cborn and raised\u201d in the Swedish city of Uppsala and started out wanting to be a concert pianist, added that he was \u201cquite pleased\u201d with his Spotify earnings. Some of his tracks there are listed under his own name, and some under pseudonyms (which he did not reveal).\u201cA lot of big composers, writers and filmmakers have used pseudonyms,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201dAn article on Saturday about accusations that playlists on Spotify, the streaming music service, are dotted with hundreds of supposedly \u201cfake\u201d artists misstated the number of times videos using music by Epidemic Sound have been viewed.

{"Headline": "Trump and Putin Meet in Testosterone-Fueled Face-Off", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatchIt\u2019s the ultimate man-off: Vladimir V. Putin and Donald J. Trump, two leaders who have staked their appeal on projecting masculinity, face off on Friday with the world judging who prevails.Each is almost a cartoonish version of hyper-masculinity. Mr. Putin is frequently photographed shirtless on horseback, shooting tigers or flipping judo opponents. President Trump takes pains to glower at the camera, boasts about the size of his hands (and not just his hands) and recently tweeted a mock video of himself wrestling CNN. And in a telling irony, the fear is that the American leader so invested in proving he\u2019s a real man will not prove to be tough enough.Each leader built his following partly on unmanning his predecessor, on restoring strength to a country that each successfully portrayed as weakened by past policy concessions. Mr. Trump ridiculed President Barack Obama for degrading the American military, failing to defeat ISIS and failing to punish Syria when it crossed his red line.\u201cA real man acts, a soft man talks and makes nice,\u201d said Jackson Katz, the author of \u201cMan Enough? Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and the Politics of Presidential Masculinity.\u201d \u201cDiplomacy in Trumpland is femininity and unilateral action is masculine.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Putin called the dissolution of the Soviet Union the 20th century\u2019s worst catastrophe. His appeal to a Russian public hungering to restore its rightful superpower status has withstood economic privations caused by sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.William Taubman, an expert in Soviet history, said that Mr. Putin tapped into a long Russian preoccupation with being perceived as strong. \u201cWhen they get drunk, Russians will often say, \u2018You respect me, don\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d said Professor Taubman, the author of \u201cKhrushchev: The Man and His Era\u201d and a forthcoming book about Mikhail Gorbachev.Meetings between world leaders have often been seen through the lens of masculinity (witness Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s oft-quoted remark after the American bombing of Vietnam: \u201cI didn\u2019t just screw Ho Chi Minh. I cut his pecker off.\u201d) That holds particularly true for encounters between Russian and American leaders.During their \u201ckitchen debate\u201d in Moscow in 1959, Richard M. Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev stood in an American model kitchen and shook their fingers in each others\u2019 faces during a fiery exchange about capitalism and communism. Nixon, then vice president, wanted to avoid looking weak as he prepared to run for president; Khrushchev was posturing for both Soviet and American audiences.Before John F. Kennedy\u2019s first meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961, President Charles DeGaulle warned him: \u201cYour job, Mr. President, is to make sure Khrushchev believes you are a man who will fight,\u201d Professor Taubman recounted in his book. But Kennedy was rattled by their encounter; Khrushchev dismissed him as such a weakling that he went on to miscalculate Kennedy\u2019s resolve in the Cuban missile crisis.The Geneva summit in 1985 between Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev may be the encounter with the most parallels to the meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump, Professor Taubman believes, because the two were geopolitical foes who built a personal rapport that helped end the Cold War.Even with the long history of swagger, this Russian-American meeting stands out. \u201cIt\u2019s as old as American politics and yet it feels new in this iteration,\u201d said Michael Kimmel, a professor of sociology and gender at Stony Brook University and the author of \u201cAngry White Men.\u201d\u201cEverything is a manhood test. Even CNN has to be wrestled into the ground in a fake match, not a real one. To me, that\u2019s the metaphor, the WWE. It\u2019s two hyper-idealized versions of masculinity getting into the ring. Everyone loves the over-the-topness of the pretense, because everyone knows no one can get hurt. In this case, someone could get hurt.\u201dSo Mr. Trump has set himself up with little room to maneuver. He\u2019s built his brand, and much of his foreign policy, on masculine strength. He lost the handshake contest to Emmanuel Macron of France. And he\u2019s walking into a meeting with a country seen by much of the world as an aggressor who has already scored points against the United States with its interference in a domestic election.The cost of any perceived weakness could be high for both combatants \u2014 and the projection of masculinity they hold so dear.Advertisement"}

During the two months of the transfer window, he would spend hours sifting through articles laced with anonymous sources and stripped of verification, all purporting to reveal the identity of Arsenal\u2019s next big signing. \u201cIt was all Messi to Arsenal, that sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on sand.\u201d Only a handful of the reported moves ever came to pass.The miasma of misinformation prompted Varley to indulge in what he calls \u201ca social experiment,\u201d though others might identify it more accurately as a hoax. He decided he wanted \u201cto see how far a phantom could travel.\u201dSo in the summer of 2008, he invented a player. He would be a promising 16-year-old from Moldova, a country distant enough that his fictional roots might not easily be exposed. And his name would come straight from the statue of \u00d3 Conaire. After all, the plot of his short story centers on a character who \u201cknows his donkey is useless, but tries to sell it to the highest bidder,\u201d Varley said. \u201cSo there is a correlation with the transfer market.\u201dHis player would be a phonetic rendering of \u00d3 Conaire\u2019s title: Masal Bugduv.Long before the ascension of President Trump made the phrase unavoidable, soccer provided the most fertile ground imaginable for what we have come to call \u201cfake news.\u201dThe phrase has been used so often, an argument can be made that because it means almost everything, it no longer means anything at all. To most, though, it signifies a story where the facts are so disputed or distorted that truth itself becomes fluid. It is a story designed to take root in an explicitly partisan environment: Whether it is true or not does not matter so much as whether its intended audience wants it to be true. It is a phenomenon soccer has exploited for some time.In a sporting context, the most basic building block of a post-truth environment can be witnessed almost every week: A refereeing decision that costs one team victory is supported by the manager who benefited, and condemned by the one who suffered. Players and fans cling to the interpretation that suits them, and the news media dutifully reports the ensuing controversy.But it is during the long, frenzied days of the summer transfer window, when soccer itself becomes a sidebar to the business of player trading, that this tendency reaches its purest form. This is when fact and fiction are blurred, when clubs and managers and agents all offer clandestine briefings of their own versions of events, when truth itself becomes elusive.This month, in the space of a single day, unidentified sources close to Manchester United confirmed to reporters that the club had agreed to pay Everton 75 million pounds (nearly $97 million) for the star striker Romelu Lukaku. Sources at Everton denied it. Sources at Chelsea, another of the forward\u2019s suitors, insisted the club still retained hope of completing a deal with Lukaku.Not all of those things could be true. It\u2019s possible that none of them were. The truth you accepted depended largely on which one suited you best.It was for this reason that, in 2008, Varley built his hoax slowly, carefully, using all of his professional expertise. He based Bugduv\u2019s characteristics on Wayne Rooney \u2014 \u201cstrong, so he could fit into a team straightaway\u201d \u2014 but he did not \u201cmake him a superhero.\u201d Realism, he realized, was key. At his invented Moldovan team, Bugduv would play a supporting role, initially, rather than scoring buckets of goals every game.Varley first spread the word about Bugduv on various message boards. Each post was written in the style of The Associated Press: stripped of rhetorical flourish, straightforward, just the simple facts. He created a fictional Moldovan newspaper, titled with a vulgar Irish word play, and assigned Bugduv a caricature of an agent.When he was ready to have Bugduv graduate to the Moldovan national team \u2014 helping to beat Luxembourg \u2014 Varley wrote a story linking him to Arsenal and posted it online. The hoax started to spread. Most of the early posts about Bugduv came from Varley\u2019s accounts. But soon, Bugduv\u2019s name was being mentioned elsewhere, unprompted.\u201cPeople will believe what they want to believe,\u201d Varley said. \u201cAnd there is a desire to be seen as though you are in the know, not to want to admit you aren\u2019t on top of the game.\u201d\u201cIt was not meant to be malicious,\u201d Varley said. He had demonstrated, though, that soccer was the perfect environment for fake news to thrive. Looking back now, he regards Bugduv as \u201cthe first post-truth footballer.\u201dThat the vast majority of rumors never come to fruition does not seem to dull the appetite. Quite the opposite. As Varley found with Bugduv, what matters is not the cold, hard fact, but the version of truth that is most appealing. In the gap between seasons, hearing that your club could sign a player is the best substitute for actual matches.But others have been able to find a way to survive and thrive, learning how to function in an environment where facts are fluid and the mainstream news media is not trusted as comprehensive, if it is trusted at all.Indy Kaila \u2014 the founder of IndyKaila, a social media brand devoted to transfers \u2014 started tweeting rumors in 2012.\u201cI had a couple of friends who worked in the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used to tell me things, and I\u2019d put a bit of money on it. I noticed that when I tweeted it \u2014 \u2018I\u2019ve heard this, put some money on it\u2019 \u2014 I started gaining followers.\u201dRegardless, Indy Kaila now has agreements with a number of sponsors, though he will not confirm if transfer gossip provides his main source of income. Briefly, he even had a slot on a local radio station in Leicester.He has become a sort of news feed in his own right. \u201cI always put \u2018breaking\u2019 in front of things if it is stuff that is being reported elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I put \u2018exclusive,\u2019 it means it is my own information. I make that clear to my followers.\u201dRight from the start, every time he posted a rumor, someone would respond that he is a nobody, a chancer, a fake. It still happens, though it has not stopped him from gaining a following, or dissuaded him from posting. That is because how reliable his information was at the start is essentially irrelevant: He says he now receives tips from credible sources \u2014 \u201clower-level people who work at clubs\u201d \u2014 and claims to have been contacted, on several occasions, by players themselves, asking about the source of his information. The fake can be real, and the real fake.Like more established news outlets, he knows that no matter where the information has come from, most of the stories he posts will not come to pass. And like them, he knows that it does not matter. In soccer, as in politics, what now matters is whether people want this story to be true. People will believe what, and whom, they want to believe.So just as he is about to hang up the phone, having recounted his experiences, Indy Kaila pauses, then asks a question. \u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201chave you got any news for me?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Comfort in Scalloped Corn", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenI haven\u2019t had nearly my fill of corn on the cob this year: plain, boiled and buttered; roasted in the husk and drizzled with olive oil; or grilled over coals and rubbed with something spicy. There is something wonderful about its simplicity. Fetchingly wrapped in a bright green husk, a fresh ear of corn is as beautiful as it is ready to cook. We grasp it, steaming, in our hands as we nibble at the kernels, as we savor its sweet flavor, as the cob is quickly denuded.Still, it\u2019s best not to fall into a rut: There are many other wonderful ways to cook corn. The other day, I found myself suddenly craving not corn on the cob, but rather old-fashioned scalloped corn. A quintessentially American comfort food, it\u2019s a homey, bubbling, creamy casserole, crowned with toasted, buttery cracker crumbs. I vividly recall the scalloped corn that I was served for dinner, many years ago, on a small farm in western Washington, made with freshly picked corn and rich cream from the morning milking. Baked ham and hot biscuits were also served, but scalloped corn was clearly the star.Well loved throughout the United States, scalloped corn is often attributed first to New England. There, any number of other foods are scalloped \u2014 potatoes, oysters, clams, onions, tomatoes. The term usually refers to something baked in cream, sometimes with cheese, similar to a French gratin. Cooks differ over whether to use heavy cream, condensed milk or white sauce (b\u00e9chamel), but nearly all agree that buttered cracker crumbs or bread crumbs are essential for the topping.The seasoning for scalloped corn tends to be fairly restrained: just salt and pepper. For a more flavorful version, an old edition of \u201cThe Fannie Farmer Cookbook\u201d suggests adding a few drops each of Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces, and chopped green pepper. Some recipes call for diced ham. I\u2019m all for increasing the flavor quotient if so inclined. The basic recipe leaves plenty of room for innovation. My scalloped corn relies on diced red bell pepper for color and sweetness, but a little crushed hot red pepper or chopped fresh Fresno chile would not be amiss. Scallions or chives could figure in. A Southwestern variation might include roasted green chiles and queso fresco.I admired a scalloped corn casserole at a potluck once and asked for the recipe. It was easy to remember: one large can of cooked corn kernels and one large can of creamed corn, mixed with an egg and some grated cheese. It was excellent.cookingAdvertisement"}

Who wants to be bound by the behavioral constraints of petty mortals. As a kid, I would fold strips of aluminum foil, stick them into the wall outlet and slap them together to see the sparks: a kind of youthful nerd vandalism. Even today, I have felt the urge to run that red light, or to boisterously split infinitives. I\u2019m a wild man!My favorite novel, William Gaddis\u2019s \u201cJR,\u201d deals with these issues. In the book, an 11-year-old boy becomes a corporate titan. Wheeling and dealing from his school\u2019s pay phone and employing a penniless music teacher as a frontman, little JR builds his improbable business empire precisely because of his childish immorality and greed. I first read the book in college, and recently read it again \u2014 and each time, I was struck by how very up-to-date that kid seemed.It was the kind of question my wife and I call chicken-eggy.Also, Dr. Frances did not really use the word \u201cjerks.\u201d His language was stronger. But this publication still has standards, unless we\u2019re quoting politicians.So what do we do to correct the ways of bratillionaires? It seems to me that sensitivity training is not enough. Nor is public scorn. Even bad publicity is publicity, and it may even encourage bad behavior.So here\u2019s my brilliant idea: Deal with these men as we would deal with very naughty children. No dessert! You\u2019re grounded! I\u2019d suggest spanking, but that could backfire, too. You never know what some people might be into.Investors can help: Demand that execs lose a big chunk of their stock options with every grope. If a frat-house sensibility pervades their corporate culture, sell their stock. As we are seeing, the bad behavior is increasingly leading to trouble, and shareholders can let them know that being a jerk carries a high price. Losing money is a shock treatment they might respond to.She explained that \u201ckids are not intentionally jerks,\u201d and that if they misbehave, usually \u201cit\u2019s because they don\u2019t know better, and they are exploring.\u201d Adults, she said, don\u2019t have that excuse. She told me that the best way to deal with problems like oppositional defiant disorder in a child is through positive reinforcement.In one technique, parents reward good behavior with stickers that can be saved up and turned in for something the child wants, like earning time to play on an iPad. She didn\u2019t like the idea of spanking, or my main inspiration \u2014 widespread use of a collar that would deliver painful electric shocks.\u201cPunishment is definitely not thought to be very productive,\u201d she explained.She suggested that positive reinforcement might work with the tech bros, but with recalibrated rewards: Their H.R. director could give them stickers for good behavior, and if they collected enough, maybe they could \u201cturn them in for a boat.\u201dThe problem, Professor Church-Lang said, is that it is best to start early to correct impulsive, destructive behavior, even before children get to school. The longer you wait, the harder it is. But, she added, it can be done with adults, too. Programs in prison, for example, are built on many of the same principles.It will be difficult, but we should do this. Let\u2019s get out there and test these techniques. We will see if we can civilize these corporate man-babies. If we are lucky enough to succeed, we can move on to an even bigger challenge: Washington. I\u2019ve got a list.Advertisement"}

Spooked by surveillance and wary of being exposed by hackers, they are switching from phone calls and emails to apps that allow them to send encrypted and self-destructing texts. These apps have obvious benefits, but their use is causing problems in heavily regulated industries, where careful record-keeping is standard procedure.\u201cBy and large, email is still used for formal conversations,\u201d said Juleanna Glover, a corporate consultant based in Washington. \u201cBut for quick shots, texting is the medium of choice.\u201dTexting apps are already creating headaches on Wall Street, where financial regulations require firms to preserve emails, instant messages and other business-related correspondence.\u201cAfter the 2016 election, there\u2019s an assumption that at some point, everyone\u2019s emails will be made public,\u201d said Alex Conant, a partner at the public affairs firm Firehouse Strategies and a former spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Most people are now aware, Mr. Conant said, that \u201cif you want to have truly private conversations, it needs to be over one of those encrypted apps.\u201dEncrypted chat and email programs have existed for years, but many were clunky and hard to use. That changed when WhatsApp, a messaging program owned by Facebook with more than a billion users, turned on encryption by default for all of its users last year, making it simple for even the tech-averse to talk securely.Disappearing messages, once the province of teenagers on Snapchat, have also become standard issue for the paranoid, and even mainstream apps like Facebook Messenger now allow users to send secret, self-destructing messages.\u201cIt\u2019s a serious issue that part of the legal record is being destroyed,\u201d said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a group that advocates open government. \u201cLots of record-keeping requirements don\u2019t work very well at all for the modern world.\u201dDaniel Jacobson, a White House lawyer during the Obama administration, told me that the use of apps like Signal and Confide among Trump administration officials might technically amount to criminal activity, under laws that prohibit the destruction of government property. And while White House staff members are unlikely to go to jail for texting, he said that preserving public records was an essential democratic norm, no matter which apps officials use.\u201cThe public has a right to know what people in the White House worked on,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cEspecially at a time where basic facts are often disputed, it is important to know that the truth will one day be made public.\u201dWhether illicit or innocent, the use of secure texting apps is probably here to stay. The alternative is just too fragile, in a world where a data breach can mean disaster. Which means it\u2019s up to regulators and technologists to find a solution that provides both security and accountability.If modern communication methods can be aligned with record-keeping laws, it will ensure that when our leaders conduct official business, the public still gets the message.Advertisement"}

Half the world seems to live here, and still it\u2019s a surprise to stumble on a Japanese cafe, even more so one owned and run by a Japanese immigrant.Mr. Oda grew up in Chiba, Japan, and came to New York nine years ago. For a while, he ran a sushi franchise at Hunter College. Closer to his home in Woodside, Queens, he found this space, once a unisex salon, while wandering the neighborhood, and last September, he opened 969 NYC Coffee, a small, informal half-grocery, half-snack shop.About the name: \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite number,\u201d he said. The digits appear as wisps of steam rising from a coffee cup on the bright yellow awning, which doubles as a canopy over an unexpected patio, up a concrete ramp and jutting out into the sidewalk. Turquoise tables and chairs offer a glimpse of the elevated train, which rumbles past sounding almost like the ocean.Inside, cases and shelves are stocked with honey butter chips and Hello Kitty mango marshmallows, cans of royal milk tea and boxes of premade sushi heavy on avocado and spicy mayonnaise. Behind the counter, Mr. Oda works alone, morning to night. (Occasionally his sister stops by to lend a hand.)His heart-shaped onigiri are archetypes, the rice clingy and salted just enough that every bite has flavor. They wear bands of nori like beauty-pageant sashes or crisscrossed bandoleers. Most fillings are hidden at the center: flaked salmon off the grill; chicken pan-fried with doubanjiang and gochujang, for a lacquer of heat and crunch; umeboshi (preserved plum), its tang so intense that it obliterates any distinction among salty, sour and sweet. One heart comes studded with bacon shards and wrinkly edamame, a duel of brine and earth.Here, too, is onigirazu, a relatively recent innovation in Japan, credited to the manga artist Ueyama Tochi and his serial \u201cCooking Papa,\u201d about a salaryman who is happiest in the kitchen. To Westerners, onigirazu is recognizable as a sandwich, albeit with layers of rice instead of bread and a broad sleeve of nori to hold it all together. Mr. Oda builds his from slabs of pork or chicken, battered and fried, slaked with tonkatsu sauce as sweet as barbecue and surrounded by lettuce and, improbably, cheese.Curry \u2014 closer to Indian than Southeast Asian, but mellower and sweeter \u2014 is made with bricks of roux from Japan, to which Mr. Oda adds \u201ca lot of onion,\u201d he said with a laugh. Onion is all I tasted. Better were corn croquettes, shipped frozen from Hokkaido, which is known for the plumpness and sweetness of its corn. They\u2019re served a generous three to an order, large puffy patties with creamy insides, under golden bristles of panko that crumble like crisped air.(Some days Mr. Oda makes a lighter-bodied ramen with only chicken bones and shoyu; it\u2019s worth calling ahead to ask which is on the menu.)Rounds of cha-shu \u2014 pork belly tied into a roll, boiled and then braised in sake, soy and garlic \u2014 are cut thin and relax immediately into the soup; they droop from chopsticks like Dal\u00ed\u2019s melted clocks. The skinny noodles in the depths aren\u2019t homemade, but they have kink and spring. Accessories are elemental: scallion rings, half a hard-boiled egg, stalks of bok choy added at the very end so they still have crunch. Pickled bamboo shoots bring funk, pickled ginger a sweet barb.This may not be the muscular tonkotsu ramen, with a whiff of the barnyard, found at ramen shrines elsewhere in town. What it offers, like everything here, is comfort without affectation. It\u2019s a bowl you can sink into, that takes you in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Amazon\u2019s Influence Grows, Marketers Scramble to Tailor Strategies", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon\u2019s rapidly expanding influence on a wide portion of the American public has become impossible to ignore \u2014 and it is giving rise to a whole new side of the advertising industry.As more people live large portions of their lives in Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, ad agencies are increasingly offering specialized services to help brands take full advantage of the company\u2019s universe.That means adding flourishes like recipes and magazine-style images to product pages, coming up with creative ways to get customers to post reviews on Amazon and plotting how companies can best connect with people who are using devices like the voice-activated Echo.And Amazon itself, aware of its growing power, is encouraging companies to buy more ads through its own media group. Its argument: When an ad is on Amazon, a direct connection can be made between people seeing it and then making a purchase.\u201cHow your product is perceived on Amazon and in the Amazon community in ratings and reviews has such a powerful impact on the future of you as a brand,\u201d said John Denny, vice president for digital and e-commerce at Bai Brands, the beverage company. \u201cIncreasingly, if you win on Amazon, you win, period. And this is the world marketers have to wrap their brains around.\u201dSeveral advertising executives anticipate that more agencies will begin offering Amazon-focused services, comparing the company\u2019s rise to previous paradigm shifts like when search engines and social media became a daily part of people\u2019s lives.Dooley Tombras, the firm\u2019s executive vice president, said it sent products to influential Amazon reviewers in hopes of soliciting positive feedback and conducted \u201cguerrilla sampling,\u201d like holding events \u201cwhere we\u2019re handing out a product and we\u2019ve got teams there with iPads and we\u2019re encouraging people to write reviews of a product on the spot.\u201dThere are more than 14,000 reviews of the powder. The page also has more than a dozen images of the powder taken from \u201cmultiple angles\u201d against a light background to look clean and professional, Mr. Tombras said, along with short videos extolling the powder.Brands can pay Amazon to customize the middle of pages with large advertorial images and information \u2014 which in the protein powder\u2019s case included photos of men working out; a recipe for \u201cbirthday cake pancakes\u201d made with the chocolate-flavored whey; and a chart featuring six of its other products, like Micronized Creatine Powder, explaining when and how they should be consumed.Mr. Tombras\u2019s firm is even working on a feature for Echo devices that will provide recipes from Optimum Nutrition. \u201cIf you find a recipe you like and happen to not have that flavor or item, you can go ahead and make that purchase,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is pretty cool.\u201dAmazon has long been an online shopping behemoth, but marketers now know it is playing an increasingly important role in how people discover and learn about their goods.\u201cE-commerce is nothing new, it\u2019s been going on for decades, and Amazon is nothing new, it\u2019s been successful for decades \u2014 but now they are becoming much more of a dominant force in brand discovery,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the digital agency 360i.Its quick success in categories like apparel and the popularity of voice search emphasized that, Ms. Hofstetter said. \u201cAmazon is the new shelf space,\u201d she added, \u201cand if you\u2019re not on it, you may be rendered invisible.\u201dThe agencies said in the release that more than half of United States consumers now started online product searches on Amazon, compared with 28 percent on search engines and 16 percent on retailer websites.Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call this year that \u201cAmazon\u2019s penetration in most areas is frightening to some.\u201d He added that the company was his response when people asked him, \u201cWhat worries you when you get up at night and when you wake up in the morning?\u201dIn an interview in Cannes, France, last month, Mr. Sorrell said his firm wanted to do more with clients and Amazon, but noted there were major questions around how brands might gain access its customer data and compete on voice search.\u201cWhat happens if I say to Alexa, \u2018I like Cheerios,\u2019 and Alexa says, \u2018I\u2019ve got Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes, which are 10 percent off\u2019?\u201d he said.Amazon Media Group, the company\u2019s growing advertising division, has been looking to assuage such concerns while touting new ways marketers can reach people on Amazon. Seth Dallaire, its head of global ad sales and marketing, has been urging agencies to view product pages and images as \u201cbrand marketing vehicles,\u201d noting that if they are not well maintained it could undermine all the work companies did to get people there in the first place.\u201cWe can see the entire customer-decision journey, and that\u2019s what\u2019s unique,\u201d Mr. Dallaire said. \u201cWe can help a brand if they\u2019re selling their products on Amazon understand when a customer is exposed to an ad and, when they clicked on an ad, if they bought something, and then we can help them tailor their marketing messages and their creative to each different step.\u201dThat\u2019s no small pitch given the guesswork that goes into advertising. Amazon has long sold lucrative sponsored product listings and other ads tied to search terms on its site, like Google. It also offers automatically placed ads on external sites using its own technology and data, and marketing on Amazon packages and devices like Kindles.Amazon does not disclose the size of its ad business, though estimates show it is well below Google and Facebook, which each bring in more than $25 billion from ads annually. While eMarketer estimated that Amazon will attract more than $1 billion in ad revenue this year, BMO Capital Markets forecasts $3.5 billion for 2017 and $5.7 billion next year.\u201cIn the grand scheme of things, the advertising revenue they\u2019re generating is small compared to Google \u2014 you can barely compare them,\u201d said Norm Johnston, global chief strategy and digital officer for Mindshare. \u201cBut for Amazon, it\u2019s not the advertising revenue in itself. They know if brands invest in the platform, the more sales they\u2019re going to generate, and a lot of those sales lead to subscription models.\u201dIn the past, many brands handled their Amazon business through store sales teams that determined shelf positioning and end-of-aisle displays at brick-and-mortar chains. That is no longer workable as Amazon extends its ad network, offering branding opportunities through its Prime program and streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cIn the old world, you\u2019d run magazines, TV spots and outdoor ads, then you\u2019d go into the shop, and they\u2019d control what happened in the shop,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cYou can\u2019t distinguish like that anymore.\u201dTo that end, marketers are also learning to pay new attention to issues like how much of an item is in stock before promoting it, or risk being penalized by Amazon\u2019s algorithms if they aren\u2019t able to handle demand, Mr. Denny of Bai said.Mr. Dallaire said Amazon planned to keep investing in its ad sales and agency development teams.Ultimately, he said, the interest is generated by behavioral shifts.\u201cIt could be people shopping on their phones, the expectation you or I might have of getting immediate customer-review information and pricing information within seconds of pulling a device out of our pockets, it could be the expectation of hearing a song you ask Alexa to play,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvertisers want to make sure they are not missing out on these customer trends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Brown and Bloomberg, an Unlikely Team", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In some ways, they could not be more different.On one coast, there is Jerry Brown, the governor and a California fixture, a leader of the Democratic opposition to the Trump White House.On the other side of the country is Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican New York mayor, a billionaire businessman and philanthropist who has arguably been as active outside of Gracie Mansion (or more precisely City Hall; Mr. Bloomberg declined to live in Gracie Mansion) as he was when he was in political power.In truth, these two men are not as dissimilar as they might appear. Mr. Brown is 79; Mr. Bloomberg is 75. Both can be, shall we say, irascible. And both won considerable support by being viewed as something of a free spirit: playing by some rules of politics, while happily flounting others. Mr. Bloomberg, who doesn\u2019t exactly fit the profile of what most people might consider a Republican, left the party to become an independent as he thought about running for president.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting character study,\u201d said Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s top political adviser. \u201cOne guy is Jerry Brown \u2014 a California leftist. The other is the global king of capitalism. That doesn\u2019t make sense. But when you think about it they are remarkably similar and their success has come from their similarities.\u201dMight this cross-country lineup make a difference? Well, at the very least two big names from the two coasts guarantees that what might otherwise have been just another news release gets a bit of notice. That is no small matter in these hectic days.\u201cThey have a remarkable power to coordinate U.S. forces \u2014 business, environmental, state, local, corporate \u2014 in a way no two other individuals could,\u201d Mr. Sheekey said. \u201cThat really is the game at this point.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)On Sundays, the 1970s come alive in Golden Gate Park.The origins of the gathering date to the late 1970s, when thousands of skaters used to descend onto park streets during the heyday of roller disco.Later, city officials agreed to make Skatin\u2019 Place, at Sixth Avenue and John F.

{"Headline": "News Outlets to Seek Bargaining Rights Against Google and Facebook", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorSo what we used to call \u201cthe newspaper industry\u201d \u2014 but which now includes outlets with robust online existences \u2014 is coming together to make its biggest push so far to change the balance of power.This week, a group of news organizations will begin an effort to win the right to negotiate collectively with the big online platforms and will ask for a limited antitrust exemption from Congress in order to do so.It\u2019s an extreme measure with long odds. But the industry considers it worth a shot, given its view that Google and Facebook, regardless of their intentions, are posing a bigger threat economically than President Trump is (so far) with his rhetoric.The Alliance, the main newspaper industry trade group, is leading the effort to bargain as a group. But it has buy-in across the spectrum of its membership, bringing together competitors like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, as well as scores of regional papers like The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, which face the gravest threats.Capturing the current mood, News Corporation \u2014 which oversees The Journal, The New York Post and Dow Jones \u2014 said in a statement that it supported the effort to \u201cfocus the public and Congress on the anticompetitive behavior of the digital duopoly, especially as it adversely affects the news and information businesses.\u201dMark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, told me that \u201cthe temperature is rising in terms of concern, and in some cases anger, about what seems like a very asymmetric, disadvantageous relationship between the publishers and the very big digital platforms.\u201dThe thinking is that publishers need the option of operating as a group \u2014 and the leverage that would come from any collective action \u2014 should they determine that it\u2019s the only way to win meaningful accommodations.In the tumultuous news climate, Google and Facebook don\u2019t want to be seen as undermining real journalism. And executives with both companies told me it was in their interests to have ample, reliable news content.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, said. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do.\u201d\u201cWe want to help publishers succeed as they transition to digital,\u201d Google said in a statement, calling the effort \u201ca priority.\u201dPublishers say they appreciate how Google and Facebook put their news content in front of many millions of users they couldn\u2019t reach on their own. And they acknowledge the efforts the platforms are making to help.But as Mike Klingensmith, the publisher of The Star Tribune and the chairman of the News Media Alliance, told me in an interview, \u201cthey\u2019re talking to us, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of action yet.\u201dMr. Klingensmith said that for midsize dailies, which have been hit particularly hard by the shift in ad spending, \u201cit is impossible for us to go as a one-off company and negotiate or even get an appointment with these companies.\u201dThe Times is backing the move for what is called an anticompetitive safe haven, in part, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cbecause we care about the whole of journalism as well as about The New York Times.\u201dHe said The Times would consider joining a collective negotiation should its own talks fail to yield satisfactory results, which, he noted, they have yet to do.The Alliance acknowledges that its bid requires legislation giving them specific clearance to negotiate as a group, which is not commonly granted. It\u2019s an especially big ask from a Congress that hasn\u2019t had a great legislative batting average and whose controlling party, the Republicans, is not in a very press-friendly mood these days.Press representatives for the Senate and House Judiciary Committees \u2014 led by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia \u2014 said they couldn\u2019t comment without hearing directly from the Alliance.The Alliance\u2019s outside counsel, Jonathan Kanter, said he was hopeful that one argument in particular could sway them: \u201cThe product at issue is important from a public policy perspective \u2014 we\u2019re not just talking about widgets, we\u2019re talking about news, and news is crucial for a democratic society.\u201dWhatever the outcome, that should be a starting point everyone can agree upon.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

One clip posted in June details his rationale for joining the group; the second was released on Tuesday when the Y.P.G. announced he had been killed.In the video, Mr. Grodt says he joined the militia because he was committed to the Kurdish independence movement. Kurds, members of a stateless ethnic group, have been fighting for autonomy in the region for decades.\u201cMy reason for joining the Y.P.G. was to help the Kurdish people in their struggle for autonomy,\u201d Mr. Grodt says.

The recent intensifying of fighting in the region had made it harder for him to get in touch, she said.The clip offers a final message to his family.\u201cJust know that I love you all, and there is a lot that goes unsaid,\u201d Mr. Grodt says, before directly addressing his 4-year-old, Teagan. \u201cTo my daughter, I am sorry that I am not there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fading Trump Bump", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Thursday, I presented charts explaining that while President Trump has been dispatching self-congratulatory tweets about his economic stewardship, he has little to brag about, apart from the stock market. The economy continues to grow and add jobs at roughly the same rate it did under President Barack Obama.While Mr. Trump did get a post-election bump according to a number of metrics, that glow has faded. Trump voters appear to be increasingly frustrated with everything from the new administration\u2019s failure to enact significant legislation to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.This University of Michigan chart shows how consumer expectations jumped immediately after the election but have since dropped back to below where they were last November and close to recent lows.Declining confidence may be part of why retail sales growth has recently been slowing. As this chart shows, retail spending had been increasing steadily at 3.5 percent to 5 percent. Here again, President Trump may have gotten a post-election bump, but more recently, core retail sales growth has dropped to 2.6 percent, the lowest in more than three years.Other indicators, like the second-quarter forecast for gross domestic product, have been steadily revised downward because of the lack of progress on policy priorities and continued Washington dysfunction. This has dashed hopes for the 3 percent sustained growth rate promised by the Trump administration and contributed to growing concern among economists.Late last year, about 40 percent of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal thought the economy was more likely to underperform their growth forecasts. After the election, that percentage dropped to 25 percent. Now it is up to 57 percent, the highest since before November of last year.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s How to Move It Forward.", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterArtificial Intelligence is colossally hyped these days, but the dirty little secret is that it still has a long, long way to go. Sure, A.I. systems have mastered an array of games, from chess and Go to \u201cJeopardy\u201d and poker, but the technology continues to struggle in the real world. Robots fall over while opening doors, prototype driverless cars frequently need human intervention, and nobody has yet designed a machine that can read reliably at the level of a sixth grader, let alone a college student. Computers that can educate themselves \u2014 a mark of true intelligence \u2014 remain a dream.Even the trendy technique of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d which uses artificial neural networks to discern complex statistical correlations in huge amounts of data, often comes up short. Some of the best image-recognition systems, for example, can successfully distinguish dog breeds, yet remain capable of major blunders, like mistaking a simple pattern of yellow and black stripes for a school bus. Such systems can neither comprehend what is going on in complex visual scenes (\u201cWho is chasing whom and why?\u201d) nor follow simple instructions (\u201cRead this story and summarize what it means\u201d).Although the field of A.I. is exploding with microdiscoveries, progress toward the robustness and flexibility of human cognition remains elusive. Not long ago, for example, while sitting with me in a cafe, my 3-year-old daughter spontaneously realized that she could climb out of her chair in a new way: backward, by sliding through the gap between the back and the seat of the chair. My daughter had never seen anyone else disembark in quite this way; she invented it on her own \u2014 and without the benefit of trial and error, or the need for terabytes of labeled data.Presumably, my daughter relied on an implicit theory of how her body moves, along with an implicit theory of physics \u2014 how one complex object travels through the aperture of another. I challenge any robot to do the same. A.I. systems tend to be passive vessels, dredging through data in search of statistical correlations; humans are active engines for discovering how things work.To get computers to think like humans, we need a new A.I. paradigm, one that places \u201ctop down\u201d and \u201cbottom up\u201d knowledge on equal footing. Bottom-up knowledge is the kind of raw information we get directly from our senses, like patterns of light falling on our retina. Top-down knowledge comprises cognitive models of the world and how it works.Deep learning is very good at bottom-up knowledge, like discerning which patterns of pixels correspond to golden retrievers as opposed to Labradors. But it is no use when it comes to top-down knowledge. If my daughter sees her reflection in a bowl of water, she knows the image is illusory; she knows she is not actually in the bowl. To a deep-learning system, though, there is no difference between the reflection and the real thing, because the system lacks a theory of the world and how it works. Integrating that sort of knowledge of the world may be the next great hurdle in A.I., a prerequisite to grander projects like using A.I. to advance medicine and scientific understanding.I fear, however, that neither of our two current approaches to funding A.I. research \u2014 small research labs in the academy and significantly larger labs in private industry \u2014 is poised to succeed. I say this as someone who has experience with both models, having worked on A.I. both as an academic researcher and as the founder of a start-up company, Geometric Intelligence, which was recently acquired by Uber.Academic labs are too small. Take the development of automated machine reading, which is a key to building any truly intelligent system. Too many separate components are needed for any one lab to tackle the problem. A full solution will incorporate advances in natural language processing (e.g., parsing sentences into words and phrases), knowledge representation (e.g., integrating the content of sentences with other sources of knowledge) and inference (reconstructing what is implied but not written). Each of those problems represents a lifetime of work for any single university lab.Corporate labs like those of Google and Facebook have the resources to tackle big questions, but in a world of quarterly reports and bottom lines, they tend to concentrate on narrow problems like optimizing advertisement placement or automatically screening videos for offensive content. There is nothing wrong with such research, but it is unlikely to lead to major breakthroughs. Even Google Translate, which pulls off the neat trick of approximating translations by statistically associating sentences across languages, doesn\u2019t understand a word of what it is translating.I look with envy at my peers in high-energy physics, and in particular at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, a huge, international collaboration, with thousands of scientists and billions of dollars of funding. They pursue ambitious, tightly defined projects (like using the Large Hadron Collider to discover the Higgs boson) and share their results with the world, rather than restricting them to a single country or corporation. Even the largest \u201copen\u201d efforts at A.I., like OpenAI, which has about 50 staff members and is sponsored in part by Elon Musk, is tiny by comparison.An international A.I. mission focused on teaching machines to read could genuinely change the world for the better \u2014 the more so if it made A.I. a public good, rather than the property of a privileged few.Gary Marcus is a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University.Advertisement"}

Auto collections manager? Home health aide? Visual merchandiser? Count them all in.It\u2019s not that my postings on Indeed, LinkedIn and other career sites weren\u2019t explicit in outlining desired qualifications. I added instructions urging candidates to contact us only if they had backgrounds in journalism, P.R. or law. There was nothing to suggest I was looking for a fiscal benefits analyst, emergency medical technician or brand ambassador, but they showed up anyway.In part, the disconnect stems from a revved-up labor market that encourages job hopping and inflated credentials. It also reflects the vast online jobs marketplace, where restless applicants shoot off their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s like one of those T-shirt cannons at a football stadium, firing without aiming. Not a single candidate bothered to look us up and refer to what we do in the cover note. Instead, they all invoked grand boilerplate statements meant to impress the hiring gods.Here\u2019s how one actress stated her case: \u201cNot only do I believe in Ripp Media\u2019s ability to deliver human and intuitive touchpoints through physical and technological interaction, but I can contribute to this strategic investment for the modern enterprise by bringing my diverse experiences \u2026\u201d It was like reading Mad Libs.Many of those hitting me up hadn\u2019t been at their current job more than four months.

They assumed that because they\u2019d done surgical sales or analyzed customer accounts for a dental supply company, they could do anything. P.R. account director?

But when something is so simple, fast and prepackaged, it tends to feel inauthentic and impersonal. Goodness knows, employers are human, too.Although I listed my phone numbers in my ads, I got a total of two calls from applicants. Everyone else preferred the automatic approach, and it showed in their one-size-fits-all letters and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.

{"Headline": "Consumers May Be More Trusting of Ads Than Marketers Think", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe early results from a recent study that Kent Grayson, a Northwestern University marketing professor, did on consumer skepticism left him feeling a little, well, skeptical.So he ran the trials a few more times. Each time, when participants were asked what they thought of modern advertising techniques, they answered with words like \u201ccredible,\u201d \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201dThe study, done by Mr. Grayson and Mathew Isaac, a professor at Seattle University, and published in April in the Journal of Consumer Research, surveyed 400 participants regarding 20 common tactics used in television and digital ads. Thirteen of the tactics elicited favorable responses, which surprised even marketers.\u201cRight off the bat, I was wondering, \u2018Who did they talk to?\u2019\u201d said James Shani, founder and chief executive of Madison & Vine, a digital studio in Los Angeles.It is no secret that advertisers have faced difficulty getting through to savvier audiences that are far less trusting of brands and institutions than previous generations. Indeed, that notion formed the basis of what Mr. Grayson intended to examine when he began his research last year.\u201cOur hypothesis was that maybe it\u2019s more nuanced than that,\u201d Mr. Grayson said. \u201cPeople have said, \u2018I don\u2019t trust advertising.\u2019 The truth is, there is a lot of advertising that they do trust.\u201dCertain tactics, such as offering to match a competitor\u2019s low prices, reporting a high rating on a site like Amazon or Yelp or mentioning a recent ranking by a third-party source like U.S. News & World Report, received the most positive reactions from participants. Others, like using paid actors instead of real people, or even hiring celebrity endorsers to express their affinity for a product, came off as \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201cmanipulative,\u201d according to those surveyed.Jake Sorofman, who analyzes marketing trends as a vice president and chief of research for Gartner for Marketers, a research and consulting firm, said brands should already be recognizing that the \u201cpersuasion by way of manipulation\u201d approaches of the past were not going to work on modern consumers.\u201cConsumers are certainly becoming more savvy, more skeptical, more discriminating,\u201d Mr. Sorofman said. \u201cThey expect a lot more, and that\u2019s putting pressure on marketers to do better.\u201dChris Raih\u2019s conclusion is that consumers are willing to play along, as long as brands play fairly. Mr. Raih, the founder and president of Zambezi, a Los Angeles ad agency, wrote an essay for AdWeek in January about combating the \u201catmosphere of disbelief\u201d that he felt had pervaded society. He argued that brands needed to better use their platforms to bridge gaps, communicate and inspire.\u201cWe do see more nuance than what is reported,\u201d Mr. Raih wrote in an email. \u201cLook, today\u2019s audience is more sophisticated than ever before. They know how the machine works. They know why Facebook ads retarget them based on previous searches. They know why brands buy space on certain programming. The mystique is gone.\u201dThough the study demonstrated that all approaches are not equally unscrupulous in the eyes of consumers, some advertisers are trying to look beyond antiquated tactics for better ways to engage with people.\u201cWe\u2019re advising our clients on the importance of \u2018proving\u2019 over \u2018selling\u2019 brand values,\u201d Adam Tucker, president of Ogilvy & Mather New York, wrote in an email. \u201cAcross the industry, we\u2019re seeing brands evolve their marketing communications to be more engaging, more participatory and, ultimately, more personalized.\u201dMr. Shani said the study reaffirmed his contention that people were looking foremost for authenticity from companies. Establishing that takes time; he compared it to putting money into an individual retirement account, where the dividends do not pay off for years.\u201cAuthenticity is not a metric,\u201d Mr. Shani said. \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling you always get when you see a brand.\u201dThe researchers did not distinguish between age groups. Nor did they break down the tactics by presentation \u2014 print, digital or television \u2014 choosing to keep the formatting ambiguous.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of marketers out there that are trying to trick people,\u201d Mr. Grayson said. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to cheat consumers on the edges, such as by keeping the price the same but decreasing the food that\u2019s in the package by imperceptible amounts. We do have to go around with a certain amount of vigilance.\u201dAn important point, Mr. Isaac said, is that consumer disbelief about certain tactics can also be fluid. Some approaches deemed disreputable a few years ago could become more widely accepted. Product placements and native advertising \u2014 packaged to look like journalism \u2014 are two examples.\u201cI think the jury\u2019s out,\u201d Mr. Sorofman said, referring to native ads as manipulative. \u201cBut the best practices tend to ensure there\u2019s transparency. As long as there is transparency in the intent.\u201dAsked what he felt about the \u201catmosphere of disbelief,\u201d Mr. Shani said he still wanted to double-check the researchers\u2019 work. \u201cDid he mean credible or not credible?\u201d Mr. Shani joked.But the researchers hope that advertisers can embrace some bit of good news and home in on what they have demonstrated can work.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of bias out there that marketers already think they\u2019re behind the 8-ball a little bit, where consumers already think we\u2019re out to get them,\u201d Mr. Isaac said. \u201cAnd that may not be the case. They might actually be starting from a greater position of strength than they think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She has gone to protests, met with her congressman, lost sleep, shed tears.\u201cMy emotions are like a Ping-Pong ball being bounced back and forth between the players,\u201d said Mrs. Borland, who, with her husband, owns a karate school in Pleasant Valley, N.Y., and whose younger daughter, Amelia, 2, is receiving chemotherapy for leukemia.\u201cFor months it\u2019s been: \u2018Here\u2019s a bill, we\u2019ll vote. No, we won\u2019t. Now it will change. Maybe not. Will that one person vote or not?\u2019 Except that for us, this is not a game.\u201dThe months-old war in Congress over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has had more standoffs, stand-downs and bare-knuckled battles than any other legislative fight in recent memory. But for people whose health insurance is at risk, it has brought the anguish of protracted uncertainty.Most Americans who are insured \u2014 including many who have plans through their employers or Medicare, for example \u2014 do not seem to be at immediate risk of losing coverage. But millions of people who get coverage through the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act or through the expansion of Medicaid under the law could lose it.In interviews, some said they did not know from one day to the next whether they would be able to continue screenings and treatment. They are postponing or accelerating major medical decisions, weighing whether to move to more insurance-friendly states, or to close modest businesses and search for employment with health benefits. Millions of Americans feel held hostage to Washington\u2019s wrangling and, consequently, to their own inability to control critical matters in their own lives.\u201cI\u2019m so done,\u201d moaned Cathy McPherson, 58, a retired court clerk in Sonora, Calif., with hypertension, who has been covered by plans under the health care act from the outset. \u201cIt\u2019s what I think about all the time and I am totally burned out. They go over and over it. Can you stop? Just stop it for a little bit? Go on vacation! Relax! Because I\u2019d like a vacation from it, too!\u201dFor the last few weeks, as the Senate Republican health effort was twice pronounced dead only to be revived a day or two later, Nancy Molitor, a psychologist in Wilmette, Ill., has heard escalating anxiety about health care from all of her patients. Many want to spend entire sessions discussing it: how to handle the stress and the feelings of fear, powerlessness, rage and frustrated paralysis.\u201cThey know they should turn off the TV and their news feeds, but they can\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Molitor, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral health at the medical school at Northwestern University.On Wednesday, the day after the Senate narrowly voted to begin floor debate on health legislation, she saw eight patients who each brought up the issue, regardless of whether they would be directly affected by the repeal efforts. She noted that her patients worried about caring for parents as well as for children with severe mental illness. \u201cBut the situation is so fluid and volatile that it is a recipe for stress.\u201dAnd yet conventional therapeutic wisdom for managing stress does not translate well to health care-related anxiety, she said. In more typical periods of life agitation \u2014 death, divorce, job loss \u2014 a therapist tries to get patients to identify what is in their control, what is not, and how then to get information and make a plan.\u201cBut with health care, even the therapists don\u2019t know the answer. We haven\u2019t experienced this before,\u201d Dr. Molitor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a therapist in this environment because we\u2019re worried about the same things, too. We have to make sure our own anxiety isn\u2019t infecting the session.\u201dAngela Wilson Gyetvan has decided to move ahead with gallbladder surgery, even though she has so far been managing her gallstones \u2014 a side effect of medication she has been taking since she finished chemotherapy several years ago \u2014 with diet. But Ms. Wilson Gyetvan, a Los Angeles-based consultant for digital companies who has coverage through the Affordable Care Act, does not have the financial wherewithal to take a wait-and-see approach.She has been assiduously monitoring the Washington debate for months, incapable of putting herself on a social media diet. \u201cDuring the good moments, it was such a relief \u2014 \u2018It\u2019s dead!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral of us were ready to go for a drink and celebrate. But we were scared. And lo and behold, we were right.\u201dDr. Leigh H. Simmons, a primary care physician who teaches at Harvard Medical School, has been trying to adapt her approach to patients as each new upheaval in Washington brings fresh concerns to her office. The day before the House bill passed in May, she saw more patients in her practice than ever. \u201cSome were for urgent reasons, others less so,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they knew they had health care this year and they wanted to take care of things.\u201cI say, \u2018For the time being, since you have coverage, why don\u2019t we get the mammogram or the colonoscopy done?\u2019 I don\u2019t mean it to be frightening, but as an incentive.\u201dAs a physician, Dr. Simmons has been feeling drained, concerned about her patients \u2014 some with diabetes have been taking less insulin than the prescribed dose, to make supplies last. Some patients question whether they will be able to continue with her. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerless feeling, as a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are as worried as our patients about what this all will mean.\u201dIn Mosier, Ore., Joe Eckert, a technology consultant, and his wife, Tammie, who owns a fabric shop in Hood River, keep drafting and ripping up life plan after life plan, as they train their eyes on Congress. Currently they buy insurance through the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace for themselves and their son, 23.But, they worry, what if it goes down in flames? What if protections for pre-existing conditions disappear? What if they are thrown into the high-risk pool? Several years ago Mr. Eckert, 54, developed diabetes; Mrs. Eckert, 50, had a malignant skin cancer removed and is screened every three months.Plan A: Close the store and Mrs. Eckert will scour want ads for a job that will give them benefits. Plan B: Sell the house and move to Washington State, where, they say, health coverage seems to be more stable. Plan C: Delay a vacation, to save money.\u201cThe ups and downs of the debating have been the worst,\u201d Mr. Eckert said. \u201cYou\u2019re happy one minute \u2014 \u2018We won!\u2019\u2014 and then it\u2019s not over yet. It just keeps dragging on. Being in limbo is the hardest place of all.\u201dDiane Smith, of Lafayette Hill, Pa., is a social worker who counsels families in severe crisis because of catastrophic illness. Her own son, Luke Hoban, has congenital muscular dystrophy and needs considerable assistance, including a wheelchair and a ventilator. She has an autoimmune disorder for which she must take very expensive injections.She recently purchased insurance through the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI\u2019ve watched my life play out on the national stage,\u201d she said, \u201cknowing I was getting divorced and would get kicked off my husband\u2019s health insurance and that my son\u201d\u2014 who just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 \u201cwas about to go out into the world and possibly lose his Medicaid coverage too.\u201dShe has been almost sleepless throughout the recent siege of debates, following the voting in real time, heart in throat, while caring for Luke and going to work.She said that the density of legislative proposals drove her crazy. She was in bed the other night, tracking Twitter, and yelled out to her younger son, Christian, a junior majoring in economics and political science: \u201c\u2018What does this mean?\u2019 He got up in his underwear and I held out my phone. He just shook his head and said, \u2018Mom, we went through this!\u2019\u201dAs emotionally draining as the protracted debates have been, Mrs. Borland, the mother of the 2-year-old leukemia patient, keeps trying to find meaningful outlets for her frustration and fear. The Facebook group where she gathers with other mothers of children with cancer will not let her vent about insurance. The moderator has said that the topic is too upsetting for parents who need the space to be safe and supportive.Back in November, when her internal alarms over insurance began clanging, she assumed that both she and her husband were the family\u2019s vulnerable ones, as small-business owners who had purchased coverage through New York\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Her daughter\u2019s coverage through Medicaid would be fine, a hospital social worker assured her.But many months, debates, treatments and bills later, big Medicaid cuts are still on the table. She does not know how they could affect her daughter.Choking back tears, Mrs. Borland gathered herself. \u201cThe way that treatment for a child with cancer goes, you never think about tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just think about today. Because thinking that she\u2019ll lose coverage is like thinking she\u2019ll relapse. I\u2019ll deal with it when the time comes. That\u2019s a cancer mom\u2019s thinking.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Freed From ISIS, Yazidi Women Return in \u2018Severe Shock\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHARIYA CAMP, Iraq \u2014 The 16-year-old lies on her side on a mattress on the floor, unable to hold up her head. Her uncle props her up to drink water, but she can barely swallow. Her voice is so weak, he places his ear directly over her mouth to hear her.The girl, Souhayla, walked out of the most destroyed section of Mosul this month, freed after three years of captivity and serial rape when her Islamic State captor was killed in an airstrike. Her uncle described her condition as \u201cshock.\u201d He had invited reporters to Souhayla\u2019s bedside so they could document what the terror group\u2019s system of sexual abuse had done to his niece.\u201cThis is what they have done to our people,\u201d said Khalid Taalo, her uncle.Since the operation to take back Mosul began last year, approximately 180 women, girls and children from the Yazidi ethnic minority who were captured in 2014 by the Islamic State, or ISIS, have been liberated, according to Iraq\u2019s Bureau for the Rescue of Abductees.Women rescued in the first two years after ISIS overran their ancestral homeland came home with infections, broken limbs and suicidal thoughts. But now, after three years of captivity, women like Souhayla and two others seen last week by reporters, are far more damaged, displaying extraordinary signs of psychological injury.\u201cVery tired,\u201d \u201cunconscious\u201d and \u201cin severe shock and psychological upset\u201d were the descriptions used by Dr. Nagham Nawzat Hasan, a Yazidi gynecologist who has treated over 1,000 of the rape victims.\u201cWe thought the first cases were difficult,\u201d Dr. Hasan said. \u201cBut those after the liberation of Mosul, they are very difficult.\u201dThe shock expresses itself in women and girls who sleep for days on end, seemingly unable to wake up, said Hussein Qaidi, the director of the abductee rescue bureau. \u201cNinety percent of the women coming out are like this,\u201d he said, for at least part of the time after their return.Both Souhayla and her family asked that she be identified as well as photographed, in an effort to shed light on their community\u2019s suffering. Her uncle posted her image on Facebook immediately after her release with a description of what ISIS had done to her.For over a year, Mr. Taalo said, he had known his niece\u2019s location, as well as the name of the Islamic State fighter holding her. He enlisted the help of a smuggler who at great risk photographed Souhayla through the window of the house where she was being held and sent the images to her family.But it was too perilous to try a rescue.Souhayla escaped on July 9, two days after an airstrike collapsed a wall in the building where she was being held, burying another Yazidi girl who had been held alongside her and killing the captor who had abused them, her uncle said.At that point, she was strong enough to clamber through the rubble and make her way to the first Iraqi checkpoint.When her family drove to pick her up, she ran to embrace them.\u201cI ran to her and she ran to me and we started crying and then we started laughing as well,\u201d said Mr. Taalo, the brother of Souhayla\u2019s father, who remains missing after the Islamic State took over their hometown. \u201cWe stayed like that holding each other, and we kept crying and laughing, until we fell to the ground.\u201dBut within hours, she stopped speaking, he said.By the time they reached the camp where her mother and extended family had found refuge after the Islamic State overran their village, Souhayla slipped into what appeared to be unconsciousness. The doctors who examined her have prescribed antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.She also shows signs of malnutrition.Neither explain her extreme symptoms, said her family and one of the doctors who examined her.\u201cI\u2019m happy to be home,\u201d she whispered with difficulty into her uncle\u2019s ear, in response to a reporter\u2019s question, \u201cbut I\u2019m sick.\u201dThe Islamic State had been ruling Mosul for two months in 2014 when the group\u2019s leaders set their sights on Sinjar, a 60-mile-long, yellow massif to the north. Its foothills and mountain villages have long been the bedrock of life for the Yazidi, a tiny minority who account for less than 2 percent of Iraq\u2019s population of 38 million.The centuries-old religion of the Yazidi revolves around worship of a single God, who in turn created seven sacred angels. These beliefs led the Islamic State to label the Yazidi as polytheists, a perilous category in the terrorist group\u2019s nomenclature.On Aug. 3, 2014, convoys of fighters sped up the escarpment, fanning out across the adjoining valleys. Among the first towns they passed on their way up the mountain was Til Qasab, with its low-slung concrete buildings surrounded by plains of blond grass.That\u2019s where Souhayla, then 13, lived.A total of 6,470 Yazidis on the mountain were abducted, according to Iraqi officials, including Souhayla. Three years later, 3,410 remain in captivity or unaccounted for, Mr. Qaidi of the abductee rescue bureau said.For the first two years of her captivity, Souhayla made her way through the Islamic State\u2019s system of sexual slavery, raped by a total of seven men, she and her uncle said.When the push for Mosul began, she was moved progressively deeper into the area hardest hit by the conflict, as security forces squeezed the terrorist group into a sliver of land near the Tigris River. The area was pummeled by artillery, airstrikes and car bombs, and strafed by helicopter-gunship fire.As the Islamic State began losing its grip on the city, Souhayla\u2019s captor cut her hair short, like a boy\u2019s. She understood he was planning to try to slip past Iraqi security forces, disguised as a refugee, and take her with him, her uncle said.Mr. Taalo now spends his days nursing his niece back to health. To sit up, she grasped one of the metal ribs holding up her family\u2019s tent and pulled herself into a sitting position, as her uncle pushed from behind. But soon her strength was sapped, and she flopped back down.He used a washcloth to dab her forehead, as she lay in his lap. Her mouth fell open and her eyes rolled back.After her escape, almost two weeks passed before she was able to stand for more than a few minutes, her legs unsteady.Officials say recent escapees are also showing an unusual degree of indoctrination.Two Yazidi sisters, ages 20 and 26, arrived at the Hamam Ali 1 refugee camp, where they drew the attention of camp officials because they wore face-covering niqabs and refused to take them off, despite the fact that Yazidi women do not cover their faces.They described the Islamic State fighters who raped them as their \u201chusbands\u201d and as \u201cmartyrs,\u201d said Muntajab Ibraheem, a camp official and director of the Iraqi Salvation Humanitarian Organization.In their arms were the three toddlers they had given birth to in captivity, the children of their rapists. But they refused to nurse them, said the smuggler sent by their family to fetch them.He and camp officials filled out paperwork so that the children could be given to the state, he said.A video recorded on the smuggler\u2019s phone shows what happened when the sisters saw their family for the first time after their return. Their relatives rushed to embrace the gaunt women. They cried.Their mother, distraught, stepped behind the tent, trying to steady herself.A day after the video was taken, reporters went to see the women, and they could no longer stand. They lay on mattresses inside the plastic walls of their tent.Despite the loud voices around them and the flow of visitors, despite their mother\u2019s wail, they did not budge.Cars pulled up outside, bringing relatives carrying pallets of orange soda. They left the tent, hands over their mouths, trying to hold back sobs.Family members said that except for a few brief moments, the women have not awakened since then, over a week ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Backlash Builds Against Sexual Harassment in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd women entrepreneurs, emboldened by the support, have over the last few days become more willing to share their stories.\u201cWomen are more empowered than ever to not tolerate these things,\u201d said Sarah Kunst, chief executive of the fitness start-up Proday, who was propositioned by Mr. McClure after he had begun talking with her about a possible role at 500 Startups. Ms. Kunst said there were now \u201ccountless discussions\u201d among women about speaking publicly about their experiences and how to end the behavior.With more women willing to speak openly about harassment and discrimination, Kate Mitchell, a founder of a Silicon Valley venture firm, Scale Venture Partners, said the industry was facing \u201ca tipping point.\u201d\u201cThe fact this behavior is pervasive and what we know seems to be the tip of the iceberg has made us understand the difficulty and reality of our challenge,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cActions need to be more aggressive and more all encompassing than what I previously thought.\u201dBut even as the movement to grapple with harassment gathers momentum, some venture capital firms are privately grumbling about having to deal with the issue, said some investors.\u201cSome men have the feeling that the conversation has turned into a witch hunt,\u201d said Aileen Lee, a founder of Cowboy Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re asking when people will stop being outed.\u201dThat attitude belies a lack of understanding about the issue, said some entrepreneurs. Even though \u201cwe\u2019ve accepted why it\u2019s so important for a boss to not hit on someone who reports to him, many people still don\u2019t understand that those same power dynamics play out when founders seek to network or raise money,\u201d said Kathryn Minshew, the founder of the Muse, a company that helps millennials find jobs.In one instance, she met an investor at a conference and set up a time to discuss her company. That day, the investor\u2019s assistant said he needed to move the meeting to the evening. At the meeting, he got very close to Ms. Minshew and put his arm around her. In another instance, an investor suggested the two sleep together after his firm had signed an agreement to invest in Ms. Minshew\u2019s company, but before the cash was in the bank. She was unable to accept his money after that episode, which jeopardized her ability to fund her company.\u201cIt feels like the industry\u2019s acceptance and tolerance of this behavior is changing,\u201d Ms. Minshew said. \u201cI really appreciate how people in the industry are standing up and saying no, this isn\u2019t O.K.\u201dAt 500 Startups, Mr. McClure\u2019s resignation was spurred not only by Ms. Kunst\u2019s coming forward, but by a separate internal report this April that said he had sexually assaulted an employee, according to a resignation letter by Ms. Yin, the 500 Startups\u2019 partner who stepped down over the weekend. Her letter was obtained by The Times.The sexual assault claim moved 500 Startups\u2019 management to remove Mr. McClure from day-to-day operations of the firm in May, according to Ms. Yin\u2019s letter. But employees were told the change happened because of growth issues, according to the letter. Mr. McClure continued to be active in the company\u2019s Slack channels, weighing in on firm decisions, according to screenshots of the conversations that were reviewed by The Times.After The Times reported on Mr. McClure last week, he wrote on the 500 Startups\u2019 Slack channels that he had \u201cnot assaulted anyone (that I\u2019m aware of).\u201d Aman Verjee, the chief operating officer of 500 Startups, also told colleagues and employees that there had been \u201cno formal finding of harassment\u201d and \u201cno legal complaint against 500 or Dave.\u201dInvestors in 500 Startups were not alerted to the change in management at the incubator until after The Times published the information on Mr. McClure and Ms. Kunst, according to Brad Feld, an investor in 500 Startups. The firm also said on Friday in an email to investors, which was obtained by The Times, that Mr. McClure \u201cwill continue to be a significant contributor to the future success of 500.\u201dOn Saturday, Mr. McClure posted his public apology. \u201cMy behavior was inexcusable and wrong,\u201d he wrote.But that day, the firm\u2019s leaders held a heated phone conversation, in which Mr. McClure admitted to initiating unwanted physical contact with the unidentified employee, according to Ms. Yin\u2019s letter.In a statement on Monday, 500 Startups said that it learned of \u201callegations related to inappropriate behavior by Dave McClure\u201d in April, and that it immediately began an internal investigation, which led to Mr. McClure\u2019s stepping back from responsibilities. \u201cDue to the sensitivity of personnel issues and the privacy of all involved, the investigation was kept confidential,\u201d the firm said.In her letter, Ms. Yin wrote, \u201cI cannot support the lack of transparency and propagation of misinformation at the management level at this company.\u201d\u201cIf someone uses their power as a VC to make repeated sexual, physical advances on women in a professional context, that goes way beyond being a creep,\u201d she wrote.In response, 500 Startups said, \u201cWe appreciate Cheryl speaking up and realize how upsetting and painful it is for her to have gone through that experience and have the courage to speak up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo the Editor:The closing line in Linda Robinson\u2019s review of \u201cHue 1968,\u201d by Mark Bowden (July 9), is as chilling as the merciless, monthlong engagement the book describes. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she writes, the retelling of this battle \u201cwill prompt a wider reflection on how to apply the lessons of Vietnam to our wars of today.\u201dHow to apply the lessons of Vietnam? As far as I\u2019m concerned, the only \u201clesson\u201d of Vietnam worth learning is that the United States should not attack foreign countries that pose no risk to our national security. Learning that lesson \u2014 and avoiding the \u201cwars of choice\u201d in which the United States is currently engaged in the Middle East \u2014 would have been the best possible tribute to the brave Americans who died in Hue and elsewhere in that now reunited and independent nation.\u2666To the Editor:In Inside the List (July 9) Gregory Cowles writes that the best-selling novels of Mary Alice Monroe, set in the South Carolina Lowcountry, \u201coften grapple with threats to the region\u2019s environment.\u201d On Dewees Island, Monroe tells Cowles, \u201cthere\u2019s been a 70 percent drop in the number of North American shorebirds since the 1970s.\u201d She adds: \u201cIf I\u2019m the canary in the coal mine, as I\u2019ve been called, I\u2019m singing loudly right now.\u201dBut Monroe has it backward. The coal-mine canary sang loudly when there was no risk or threat. Only when the little bird suddenly fell silent, asphyxiated by poisonous gases gathering near the ceiling of the shaft, did the miners know to flee for their own lives.\u2666To the Editor:Judging from James Kwak\u2019s review (July 9), Jesse Eisinger\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Chickenshit Club,\u201d calls welcome attention to federal prosecutors\u2019 highly questionable failures to seek prison terms for many \u201chighly paid bankers\u201d who \u201cwrecked the economy,\u201d throwing many workers out of their jobs and families out of their homes.Similarly, the Black Lives Matter movement is calling welcome attention to prosecutors\u2019 frequent failures to jail police officers who appear to have criminally killed unarmed blacks. As a former prosecutor, I often wonder, when a grand jury fails to indict or a trial jury fails to convict such an officer, whether the prosecutor proceeded with the vigor that the circumstances warranted.Such refusals by prosecutors to proceed diligently or at all contribute significantly to maintaining our two-tiered system of justice \u2014 one for the privileged and one for the rest. Sadly, this system is deeply entrenched. But books like Eisinger\u2019s and protests like Black Lives Matter, which expose the fiction that we have equal justice for all, may help to dislodge it \u2014 if it can be dislodged.The writer was a New York State special assistant attorney general assigned to the Attica special prosecutor\u2019s office in 1973-74. An updated edition of his 1985 book about Attica, now called \u201cThe Attica Turkey Shoot: Carnage, Cover-Up, and the Pursuit of Justice,\u201d was published in March.\u2666To the Editor:I realize that book reviews are essentially editorials on books, full of opinion, and they don\u2019t have to be balanced, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that means a reviewer should grossly misrepresent a book. I feel that happened in the recent review of my memoir, \u201cLove, Africa\u201d (July 9). It was as if the reviewer, Nadifa Mohamed, hunted through the pages looking for evidence of the broader point she was trying to make \u2014 that outsiders can\u2019t write sensitively about Africa \u2014 and she closed her eyes to anything that didn\u2019t fit this pursuit.Even the moment where I talk about ooga-booga, a degrading term about African stereotypes, was misunderstood. The first time I heard that term was in New York, from a New York Times editor; that point was meant to be a launching pad for a self-critical discussion on how Western journalists cover Africa. I agree that this is a juicy and necessary conversation. What other part of the world has been so laden with stereotypes about power and race as Africa? Is it even possible for an outsider to look at Africa, to see it as it really is, without eyes jaundiced by all that we have read and heard about it? Those last two lines are lifted straight from the book. They are never even hinted at in the review.The result is that the review is like a movie trailer that gives you no idea of what the movie is really about. I have been the longest-serving New York Times correspondent in East Africa and have invested a good chunk of my life reading about that region, traveling through it, thinking about it and writing about it. I feel the review missed the empathy and humanity that seems to have been obvious to many others, including people from Africa, who have read the book.Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

The lovely little square called the Herbert Hooverplein lies next to the library of the University of Leuven (formerly Louvain), which was burned by the German occupying troops. It was rebuilt and restocked with contributions from many American schools, universities, libraries, foundations and other organizations whose names are commemorated on stone plaques that circle the exterior of the library\u2019s first floor.\u2666To the Editor:The review of \u201cThe Color of Law,\u201d by Richard Rothstein (June 25), may leave readers with the impression that there are no good remedies to decades of de jure segregation. It ignores an inexpensive remedy that has proved effective \u2014 adding mobility counseling to government-funded housing vouchers to help poor black families move to opportunity-rich, previously segregated communities. As Rothstein describes, in Chicago, Dallas and Baltimore, mobility programs have helped thousands of poor African-American families move to neighborhoods from which they had historically been excluded. Those moves have, belatedly, allowed these families to take advantage of the benefits of living in neighborhoods with better schools, jobs, parks and public safety. The results include higher high school graduation rates, college attendance, marriage rates and income (one large study showed a 31 percent increase in lifetime earnings for children who moved before their teens), and decreases in asthma, obesity, diabetes and depression. Similar programs should be instituted throughout the country.The writer is the president of the board of the Baltimore Regional Housing Partnership.\u2666To the Editor:I always hope not to be tempted to respond to reviews. But Eric Foner\u2019s review of my \u201cLincoln and the Abolitionists: John Quincy Adams, Slavery, and the Civil War\u201d (June 25) is a special case. He and I have a fundamental disagreement about Lincoln, race, and slavery. He argues in \u201cThe Fiery Trial: Lincoln and American Slavery\u201d (2010) that Lincoln\u2019s views about race and slavery evolved over time. I made it clear in my review for The Washington Post that, despite that book\u2019s merits, which are many, Foner\u2019s main argument is unpersuasive: Lincoln always opposed slavery; he never favored citizenship for blacks, though he accepted some limited version as a necessary outcome of the war. Foner\u2019s review of \u201cLincoln and the Abolitionists\u201d restates the thesis of \u201cThe Fiery Trial.\u201d It makes its case by numbers of misrepresentations of Lincoln and of what I\u2019ve written. Lincoln\u2019s greatness is not undermined by an attempt to see him clearly, with neither progressive nor idealistic blinkers, and neither Lincoln nor history benefits from Foner\u2019s special pleading. Arguably our greatest president, Lincoln does not need to be vindicated or defended, and there is not the slightest bit of evidence on which to claim that Lincoln wanted or welcomed a biracial United States. My take on Lincoln, despite Foner\u2019s claim, is deeply embedded in history, and of course racism \u201crises and falls over time.\u201d But the evidence demonstrates that racism, at a fairly high level, has been a constant in American history.\u2666To the Editor:In his review of \u201cA Fine Mess,\u201d by T. R. Reid (June 25), David Cay Johnston reminds us that all tax systems deserve regular reform. In Canada, we\u2019re \u201ccelebrating\u201d the 100th anniversary of an Income War Tax Act that was introduced in 1917 as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d Obviously, another unkept political promise!Although the review doesn\u2019t mention it, I suspect Reid described the simple and appealing measure that was introduced some years ago by Steve Forbes in his presidential campaign in 1996. I\u2019m referring to the excellent idea of a \u201ctax return on a postcard,\u201d based on a flat tax, with a rate to be determined.Such a common-sense reform would immediately add millions of tax consultants, accountants and lawyers to the unemployment rolls.

{"Headline": "Wesley Bryan\u2019s Greatest Trick Shot Was Rapid Rise to PGA Win", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCROMWELL, Conn. \u2014 In the moment that Wesley Bryan realized his lead was insurmountable and he would become the first South Carolina native to win the RBC Heritage, he was seated in the CBS broadcast booth. Sitting with Jim Nantz and Nick Faldo in April, Bryan delivered the type of soul-bearing interview rarely seen, recounting his emotions as he stood on the 17th tee and realized he had the lead.\u201cHonestly I just threw up a little bit in my mouth,\u201d said Bryan of the moment he looked at the electronic scoreboard. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, shoot, I guess this is what nervous feels like.\u2019\u201dBut Bryan\u2019s best trick of all has been his rapid ascension over 16 months: going from not having membership privileges on the PGA Tour in 2015 to competing on the Web.com Tour to receiving an automatic promotion to the PGA Tour to winning a PGA tournament. Bryan has improved from No. 1,127 in the Official World Golf Ranking at the start of 2016 to No. 42 this week.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m living in a big fairy tale and I don\u2019t want to wake up,\u201d Bryan said.At the Travelers Championship last week, Bryan received a reminder of just how far his game had come. He was paired with Jordan Spieth, now a two-time major winner, during the first two rounds of the tournament. The last time they had played together, at the amateur Jones Cup in 2011, Bryan shot 92, fired his father as his caddie, and withdrew from the tournament.\u201cJordan probably doesn\u2019t remember it,\u201d Bryan said, \u201cbut that was the low point in my golf career. That was rock bottom. But I\u2019ve always been one of those guys, when things aren\u2019t going the direction I want them to, you have two options: You can either work like crazy or you can just crawl in a hole and hide. And I kind of chose the first of those.\u201dAfter turning pro in 2012, Bryan toiled in mini-tour obscurity. He and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Augusta, Ga., where she attended school to become a physician assistant. They lived on a tight budget, clipping coupons; Elizabeth remembers fretting over her husband buying a $25 shirt.Bryan never lost sight of his goal to play on the PGA Tour, but his path took a detour in 2014. He and his brother were watching ESPN\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d and a video of a golf trick-shot made its \u201cTop 10 plays.\u201d It did not look too difficult, the brothers thought, so they tried it the next day. That led to them creating their own video and posting it to their social media accounts.\u201cIf it gets over 100 views, we\u2019ll do another one,\u201d George Bryan said.It did, and their second one \u2014 thanks to the Tour pros Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson sharing it on Twitter \u2014 went viral.Before long, the \u201cBryan Bros\u201d had their own YouTube channel, teamed with Rory McIlroy in a sponsor video, and signed a handful of endorsement deals. The financial freedom liberated Bryan, and he rediscovered his joy for the game through trick shots. In July 2015, Bryan recommitted to climbing the ladder to the PGA Tour.\u201cWhat I tell people is I\u2019m retired,\u201d he said of the trick-shot videos. \u201cI can still come out of retirement. If Brett Favre and Michael Jordan can pull it off, I can too.\u201dBryan earned his way onto the 2016 Web.com Tour in his fourth trip to Qualifying School. There were skeptics, saying he had gotten lucky at Q-School.

He set out to explore the themes of music, family and tradition in Mexican culture, employing the vibrantly painted buildings as backdrops. On the Mexican side of the border wall women painted messages, some including the word \u201chope.\u201d That day was the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and to mark the date, the Dresden Symphony Orchestra was playing concerts at the wall in Tijuana and across the border in San Diego.

{"Headline": "When You Should (and Shouldn\u2019t) Share Your Location Using a Smartphone", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last week after my motorcycle malfunctioned and crashed on the freeway, I wanted only two simple things from technology: to call 911 and to tell loved ones where I could be found.Coincidentally, I had been testing location-sharing tools from Apple, Google, Facebook and Snapchat. So before calling the police, I texted my partner, who was already tracking my location with several apps, letting her know I was hurt. When she opened Google Maps, she could see precisely where I was on the 101 South freeway.But when she refreshed the map to follow the ambulance, she ran into the app\u2019s shortcomings: Google showed I was at Costco (not where I wanted to be, injured or not) when I was actually strapped onto a stretcher heading toward San Francisco General Hospital.Such is the state of location sharing on smartphones.Yet security experts agree that on smartphones, it is now practically impossible to stop location tracking. There is a multitude of ways for third parties to find out where we are, including cell towers, the metadata transmitted from telecommunications, and data logged on our phones.So we might as well embrace location sharing and reap the benefits.\u201cFor the vast majority of people and the vast majority of circumstances, the benefits they get from sharing their whereabouts way exceed the risks that might be out there,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company.Here are some tips for the best- and worst-use cases for sharing your location using a range of old and brand-new location-sharing tools.First, a primer on how different location-sharing products work.Be aware that even if you haven\u2019t turned on location sharing in Snapchat, some people may be able to get a hint of your whereabouts if you use Our Stories, a feature for publishing public images or videos.In my tests, Apple\u2019s Find My Friends and Facebook Messenger were quicker and more accurate with real-time location tracking than Google Maps, which had significant delays before refreshing with a current location. Google said its app reports someone\u2019s location at intervals, from every few minutes to an hour, partly to save battery life.Location-tracking features have stirred controversy for the last decade. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit, said location-tracking technologies enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor people\u2019s movements or advertisers to connect people\u2019s online activities with their real identities.In other words, used carelessly, location tracking may hurt your privacy. But used thoughtfully, it can be a powerful and efficient communication tool.After testing location-sharing tools for two weeks, here are my suggestions for the best times to use them.\u2022 When you make plans to meet friends somewhere like a movie theater, get in the habit of sharing your location through Apple\u2019s iMessage, Google Maps or Facebook Messenger to broadcast your location for a short duration, like an hour. This way you can skip saying things like \u201cI\u2019m on my way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m running a few minutes behind\u201d because people can simply follow you on the map.\u2022 Consider using Apple\u2019s Find My Friends, Facebook Messenger or Google Maps to share your location occasionally with your romantic partner. Location sharing can be useful for being considerate of your partner\u2019s time and space. For example, I am less inclined to text my partner when I see she is at the office or driving on a freeway, but I am more inclined to text when I see she is at the grocery store to ask her to pick something up.\u2022 Next time you plan an event at a large outdoor space, like a picnic in a park, do your friends a favor: Use Apple Maps or Facebook Messenger to drop a pin on a map with your current location so they can find you. Wandering around aimlessly in a crowded open space can be annoying.Here were some situations where broadcasting your location may be undesirable.\u2022 Don\u2019t share your location when meeting in an indoor space like a specific store in a mall. Most mapping apps are not yet designed for indoor spaces and are thus inaccurate for location sharing.\u2022 Likewise, don\u2019t bother sharing your location on a nature hike. Most national parks, for example, are in remote areas with no cell connection, so turning on location sharing in this situation would waste battery life.\u2022 For safety reasons, avoid sharing your location publicly. Google makes it easy to publish a web link where anyone can follow your live location. To fend off the creepers, send the link only to the intended recipients; avoid posting it on public sites like Twitter or Facebook.\u2022 The bottom line: Know your limits. \u201cUse common sense,\u201d Mr. Grossman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to hide from people, don\u2019t publish your whereabouts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, he told her that a group of taxi drivers at the airport had vandalized the vehicle and that he needed the money from this ride to fix it. He also mentioned that he had been saving to see Iggy Pop, his late brother\u2019s favorite rocker, at the South by Southwest festival, which Ms. Saint John was attending as the head of global consumer marketing for iTunes and Apple Music.She gasped. Her dinner was with Iggy Pop. Would the driver, perhaps, like to come along?Cue the tears (and the five-star passenger rating).\u201cWe\u2019re all rushing in our lives, and I was so concerned with getting from here to there, and if not for the moment of humanity where we just started talking, that connection would not have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a miss that would have been. What a miss!\u201dThis story was part of what convinced Arianna Huffington, a founder of The Huffington Post and a high-profile member of Uber\u2019s board, that Ms. Saint John was the right person to shepherd Uber out of its recent thicket of legal and ethical scandals.\u201cSometimes it takes you months to get to know someone,\u201d Ms. Huffington said. \u201cWith her, I felt like she has this incredible capacity for intimacy and for sharing her story and for sharing others\u2019 stories.\u201dAnd, Ms. Huffington said, \u201cShe\u2019s great at social media.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been told that I overshare,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I get criticized for it, but how else would I be if not all of me?\u201dShe amplifies this presence with statement-making ensembles like the ruffled, lilac Marni skirt and crop top, gold-encrusted Chanel purse and stiletto heels she wore on a recent morning at Uber\u2019s San Francisco office. \u201cThat\u2019s my own personal thing,\u201d Ms. Saint John said of her interest in fashion, so distinct from the hoodie aesthetic around her.She has stood out from the crowd since her family settled in Colorado Springs when she was 12, after an itinerant childhood spent in Connecticut, Washington D.C., Kenya and Ghana, where her father was a member of the Parliament from 1979 until the 1981 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat there. Her mother designed and sold clothes and ensured that Ms. Saint John and her three younger sisters stayed connected to their culture, especially once they moved to the Southwest.\u201cThe first few months were really hard,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cHaving a name that people can\u2019t pronounce\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s BOZE-mah \u2014 \u201chaving a mom that refused to serve pizza on Friday nights when friends came over.

In her sophomore year, she ran for student council under the tagline \u201cAin\u2019t Nothin\u2019 but a Boz Thing,\u201d inspired by her anthem of the moment, Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cNuthin\u2019 but a \u2018G\u2019 Thang.\u201d\u201cI just thought it was so cool, but nobody got it,\u201d she said. She lost, \u201cbut it was a great lesson \u2014 you need to connect on your audience\u2019s level, not on your own.\u201dMs. Saint John attended Wesleyan University, ostensibly to prepare for becoming a doctor but managing to teach a class on Tupac Shakur, with a professor\u2019s supervision, in her spare time.

She also met her husband-to-be, an advertising executive, in the company cafeteria.In 2013, she orchestrated the halftime show Pepsi sponsored at the Super Bowl featuring Beyonc\u00e9. Four months later, her husband\u2019s illness was diagnosed. Their daughter had just turned 4.\u201cTowards the end of his life, as everything started to fail, he was very adamant that I not stop what I was doing,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cHe was telling me to hold his hands because he couldn\u2019t grasp anymore, saying, \u2018Promise me, you\u2019re going to keep going.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe ended up talking for four hours,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cI was raw.

{"Headline": "How to Save on Your Trip to a Theme Park", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerTheme parks can be great fun for all, but tickets, parking, food and incidentals can rapidly mount up to burn a hole in your pocket. Here is a list of tips to help you save a few bucks on that summer theme-park excursion, be it one of the popular Disney parks or your local favorite.A one-day Park Hopper ticket to Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom can cost $174. If you buy a 10-day ticket, however, the per-day cost drops to about $51. Keep in mind that for these multiday tickets, there is a limited amount of time to use them. In this case, you must use all 10 days within a 14-day period.You can buy theme-park tickets at the gate, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should. Parks always want to know when you\u2019re coming (it helps them determine their discount and blackout days, for example), and they love to have your money upfront. In return, many parks (with the notable exception of Disney) offer significant discounts for buying online.Conventional wisdom says that a good way to save money on the egregious pricing of food items is to bring your own; many parks will allow visitors to bring snacks, within reason. (Nearly all parks will allow reusable nonglass water bottles that can be refilled throughout the day, a much better choice than spending $2 to $5 on bottled water.)But toting your own food doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone. \u201cThat\u2019s not really something I want to do when I\u2019m on vacation,\u201d Ms. Marino says. Instead, she suggests skipping the side dish when ordering at restaurants as a way to cut costs. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018I want the chicken sandwich, but no fries,\u2019\u201d she says, which saves a dollar or two per meal.Many parks have water rides, and water is not your smartphone\u2019s friend. It sounds simplistic, but you\u2019ll be kicking yourself after drenching your $800 iPhone. Bring a sealable plastic bag to protect your phone during water rides. It costs virtually nothing, and can potentially save you a major headache.We\u2019ve all forgotten where we put the car. Don\u2019t let it happen in an enormous parking lot when you\u2019ve got tired children in tow. To save some frustration, take a photo of where you parked (\u201cO.K., kids, remember: We\u2019re in Foghorn Leghorn!\u201d). Better yet, open Google Maps on your phone and drop a pin at your car\u2019s location. You can then add a label or star to the location, making it a cinch to find at the end of the day.Advertisement"}

I considered them family. Sadly, the husband drank to excess daily. He then became verbally abusive to his wife and dismissed his family\u2019s concerns. So the wife asked me to intervene. I wrote him a letter about how his drinking was affecting his relationships. He acknowledged it but continued to drink. I withdrew; I couldn\u2019t tolerate the abuse of his wife. This was a few years ago. I still send them emails. The wife replies; the husband doesn\u2019t. But I miss their friendship greatly. Is there a way to resurrect it?MARCNot a pretty picture, but a pretty common one: Family and close friends catering to an alcoholic every way but productively. Here, the wife casts around for heroes to save her. And though I\u2019m sure you meant well, Marc, you were just grandiose enough to take the bait, as if Superman could add a superpower: able to crack addictions with a single first-class stamp. This is how codependence thrives, not recovery.Just walking into an Al-Anon meeting helps break down the secrecy and shame that so often surround addiction. You are not alone. Invite the wife to go with you. Rewriting your tired-out roles in this family drama is the only way I know to resurrect the friendship. You may not change the alcoholic, but you can certainly improve the way you deal with him.Two months ago, my pregnant boss invited her entire team (of seven women) to a baby shower at her home. We were all excited to be included and R.S.V.P.\u2019d yes. The week of the event, our company had major layoffs that we didn\u2019t expect. Four of the seven women, including me, were called into our boss\u2019s office and fired. Come shower day, none of the women attended. Should we have given notice that we weren\u2019t attending, mere days after getting the boot? And why did our boss invite us, knowing that layoffs were on the horizon?ANONYMOUSPerhaps your boss is a latter-day Marie Antoinette: Let them eat (pastel-frosted) cake. But it seems more likely that she didn\u2019t know specifically about the layoffs when she invited you. I have been in your boss\u2019s shoes, and I fought valiantly for employees \u2014 to absolutely no effect. Ultimately, I was given cost and head-count reductions and told to execute them. Your boss may not have been able to save you.Still, you lost your job. What could be more natural than feeling hurt and angry? And who better to project those feelings onto than a boss? I get why you blew off her party. (I bet she does, too.) But it seems silly and shortsighted for the three women who still work for her not to have attended \u2014 or to have said: \u201cI feel shaken up by the layoffs. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not up for a party tonight.\u201d Why alienate someone who didn\u2019t fire you?I have been living overseas for most of my adult life. But recently I moved a couple of hours from my family to reconnect with them and support my aging parents. They\u2019re not used to my being around, so I go out of my way to visit them. But it\u2019s always on my initiative and my dime. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars on train tickets, car rentals and hotel rooms over the last year, but they haven\u2019t come my way to visit even once. Should I say something?B.N.If the alternative is tabulating incidental travel expenses, sure, say something. But don\u2019t be a scold. You don\u2019t mention ever actually inviting them to visit you. Start there: \u201cI\u2019d love to show you where I live. Would you come for a weekend? We could take in [insert local attraction].\u201d If there\u2019s a glimmer of interest, try to lock down specific dates. Sometimes we need to help people give us what we want.I have been going out with a great guy for about nine months. This is my first major relationship. Sometimes when we are making out (or more), I fantasize about someone else \u2014 a movie star or someone I saw on campus. I would never cheat on my boyfriend in real life, but does my fantasizing make me a cheater?ANONYMOUSNo, it makes you human. Everyone fantasizes, even former President (and possible saint) Jimmy Carter, who told Playboy magazine, probably too candidly for the \u201970s, that he had committed adultery in his heart. Folks who claim that they have never fantasized romantically about people other than their long-term partners are either lying or seriously repressed.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.Advertisement"}

Even with the prominence of Tina Fey, Mindy Kaling and the sitcom \u201cBroad City,\u201d the baronesses \u2014 friends and Toronto comedy scene colleagues \u2014 noticed a lack of female sketch on mainstream TV (Amy Schumer aside). So they decided pool their expertise to design a sketch show for a smart, urban, platform-agnostic audience \u2014 and they did so with a shared sense of now-or-never urgency.\u201cBetween us, we have about 80 years of experience writing comedy,\u201d Ms. Whalen said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s going to work and what\u2019s not going to work. We\u2019ve been weirdly training for this for decades.\u201dMs. Taylor (the cerebral one, and the showrunner) and Ms. Browne (the one who pushes the joke toward the dark and dirty) met at the improv theater Second City in downtown Toronto in the mid-90s. They became good friends, living on different floors of the same apartment building. Both worked the city\u2019s comedy circuit for years, writing and appearing onstage and onscreen. Often, they crossed paths with another Second City alumna, Ms. Whalen (the one who is known to take an unwieldy idea and distill it to a cleanly written half-page). All three had experienced what Ms. Whalen described as \u201cdevelopment hell\u201d: selling hot pitches that sat on network shelves until they cooled and evaporated.Meanwhile, Ms. MacNeill was building a career in London. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Ms. MacNeill (the wild, physical one with a repertoire of deadpan reaction shots) had proved herself as deft at \u201cTitus Andronicus\u201d as comedy, appearing on series like \u201cPeep Show\u201d and \u201cMan Stroke Woman.\u201d But after becoming a newly minted single mother, she returned to a small town in her home province, Nova Scotia, with a baby and a foggy future. \u201cI was in my late 30s, eating my parents\u2019 mashed potatoes, and I needed to get out of their basement,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, I work well with desperation.\u201dSo when her daughter went to bed at night, Ms. MacNeill wrote screenplays, pitches and series, plotting an escape route. She also caught up on Canadian TV and noticed the country lacked anything like the woman-led British sketch comedy series like \u201cSmack the Pony\u201d and \u201cFrench and Saunders.\u201dIn 2012, she had mentioned this gap to Ms. Taylor, who was in Halifax, Nova Scotia, writing for \u201cThis Hour Has 22 Minutes,\u201d the CBC\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d-style faux newscast. Ms. MacNeill was working in the ensemble, and the two began to polish the pitch for a female-driven sketch show that would be naturalistic, observational and shot on location with a single camera. They wanted to be out of a studio and in the real-world strangeness of \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cLittle Britain.\u201d Ms. Taylor pulled in Ms. Whalen and Ms. Browne, who were also excited.\u201cI felt like I wasn\u2019t truly hearing women\u2019s voices on TV,\u201d Ms. Whalen said. \u201cWe all talk about auditioning for \u2018the mom\u2019: \u2018Does anyone want a sandwich?\u2019 But in real life my girlfriends are so interesting, and the way they talk about their children and their lives is dark and hilarious and funny.\u201dMs. Browne added: \u201cThere\u2019s more tweezing, but the older you get the more fun it gets to be a woman.\u201dThe production company Frantic Films partnered with the women, though its chief executive, Jamie Brown, admitted he hesitated about the name. \u201cPossibly too German.\u201d\u201cI have a love of baronesses,\u201d Ms. Taylor explained. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the lowest rungs of aristocracy, but they seem to be able to do what they want.\u201dAfter days of carefully rehearsing the pitch to appear off the cuff, they sold it to the CBC. Within a year, they were shooting on the streets of Toronto with Ms. Taylor as showrunner but all four equally involved at every step, right into the editing suite. They hired two permanent writers and rotated a large team of contributing writers and story editors, veteran and untested, and mostly women.Lea DeLaria, the comedian and \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d star, was in Toronto visiting friends when she first encountered the bending, squatting (pixelated) \u201c40\u2019s\u201d women. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9e had just left me, and my friends were like: \u2018Quit crying and watch this show.\u2019 It made me laugh so hard,\u201d said Ms. DeLaria, who later gathered castmates for \u201cBaroness\u201d viewing sessions on the set of \u201cOrange.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s great is the perspective, which you never see,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir humor isn\u2019t going to be about how big their boobs are. It\u2019s not the \u2018hot comedian\u2019 thing. They can go from total craziness to very light and sweet. It flies in the face of two adages: that girls aren\u2019t funny, and lesbians aren\u2019t funny.\u201dMs. Taylor is the one creator who self-identified as lesbian during interviews, but the series over all runs on a casual gender fluidity, where drag and gay characters are part of the comedy and an unabashed raunchiness often tilts queer. So while the show isn\u2019t capital-P political \u2014 there will be no Donald Trump or Justin Trudeau impressions \u2014 it feels political, just because it exists. \u201cI like having queer characters represented and having that part of me heard,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political act, to say: \u2018Yeah, we have voices and we\u2019re going to put them out there.\u2019 It\u2019s a political act to be unapologetically feminist.\u201dIn a sketch called \u201cRun the World\u201d \u2014 clearly a Beyonc\u00e9 shout-out \u2014 a global revolution has left women in charge. Turns out that at the all-female World Summit of 2050, there\u2019s not much to discuss. \u201cConflict? Any war?\u201d \u201cNo, we just talk it out these days.\u201dJennifer Caserta, the president of IFC, said she found the series \u201cridiculously relatable\u201d and saw it fitting cozily into the network\u2019s lineup (the show is a natural stepsibling to the similarly minutiae-obsessed \u201cPortlandia,\u201d albeit more Ann Taylor, less trucker jacket). So far, IFC\u2019s only note has been about changing a reference to a Canadian cocktail called a Caesar (it involves clam juice) to the more American-friendly Bloody Mary. In June, the network brought the group out to Los Angeles for a panel hosted by Ms. DeLaria, who also guest-stars this season. Ms. Whalen said she couldn\u2019t believe they got picked up at the airport in a car, and all four gushed about the quality of the hotel.In Los Angeles, Ms. Caserta observed their dynamic. \u201cSometimes great creativity comes out of tension, but they\u2019re the kind of collaboration born out of friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they take this for granted. They\u2019re very grateful. When you see talent like that, it\u2019s a little bit heartbreaking to think of the struggle before the breakthrough.\u201dBack in the Toronto writers\u2019 room, the pitches flew. Some could easily be imagined as goofy slices of life (the hell of receiving \u201cfunky socks\u201d as gifts); another was more high concept \u2014 sexual assault through the ages. That one didn\u2019t make it. Repeatedly, and gently, Ms. Taylor asked: \u201cJust to be clear, what\u2019s the point of view here?\u201dMs. MacNeill speculated later on how the show might land in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re four women in our 40s creating our first TV show,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s amazing or sad. The show has a vulnerability to it because it came from a vulnerable place. I do think that\u2019s why people might tune in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was a warm, sunny Wednesday in May. The dogs wore lime green and yellow Scotch-Brite bandannas and their owners wore expressions of strenuous amusement.To some, this scene may have seemed odd. In fact, given the rise of influencer marketing, in which people with big social-media followings are paid to promote products, and the hugeness of animal photos on Instagram, it was closer perhaps to inevitable.\u201cPet influencers outperform humans,\u201d said Loni Edwards, 32, the agency\u2019s founder.

{"Headline": "Olympic Medal, Earned; Glory, Denied; Future, Uncertain", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesEUGENE, Ore. \u2014 To watch as Chaunt\u00e9 Lowe took her high jumps at the Prefontaine Classic here in late May was to see a great athlete with a busted wing. She was 33 and hobbled, her hamstring aching and ankle sprained. She limped away after each jump and soon enough was disqualified. It led me to wonder if we were watching this exuberant four-time Olympian high jumper and reigning American record-holder aging in front of us.In June, in Sacramento, she failed to qualify for the United States team heading to the world championships in London next month.If Lowe\u2019s athletic clock is ticking down, if she competed in her final Olympics last summer in Rio de Janeiro, she can draw comfort in what happened in November. She was in her kitchen in Florida, her three little children out of the house, going through her Facebook notifications when a message popped up from a friend, the German high jumper Ariane Friedrich: \u201cCongratulations Olympic bronze medalist!\u201dLowe gave a quizzical look, took the message for a joke and clicked on another message: \u201cCongratulations Chaunte. So proud!\u201dThis time she clicked on the embedded link. She read a news report: Three Olympians \u2014 two Russians and a Ukrainian \u2014 who had finished in front of her in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing failed retroactive doping tests. She had moved from sixth to third place.She had become an Olympic bronze medalist. It was her first medal. She felt herself beginning to dance.\u201cI screamed like someone was in my house trying to take away my cookies,\u201d she said. \u201cI was excited and relieved at the same time. \u2018Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you are not a failure\u2019!\u201dHer reaction speaks to the volcanic pressures that elite athletes carry within. And her tardy medal speaks to the strange and sad world of modern doping, a battle between rogue chemists and medical detectives. The World Anti-Doping Agency now holds blood and urine samples from Olympic athletes for eight years, against the day that advances in detection allow for retests.The disqualifications from past Olympics now run into the many dozens. In November alone, the International Olympic Committee stripped 10 medals from athletes found to have cheated in the 2008 Olympics.So justice arrives like a distant echo.Even as Lowe danced about her house, calling friends, another realization dawned. She had missed her Olympic moment. She watched in 2008 as a cheater stood on the podium with a national flag and accepted a medal that rightfully was Lowe\u2019s. (She has not received her bronze medal, as one of the athletes accused of doping has appealed the finding; even then, the process of retrieving the medal and forwarding it to Lowe could take many months.)\u201cMan, I wanted to get that feeling of being on a podium and the world is applauding your achievement,\u201d she says. \u201cI was robbed of that moment, and I am surprised to find myself feeling joy and struggling to keep my faith.\u201dShe knows the shadow of doubt that athletes labor within, and the certainty that more disqualifications will deepen its hues. Dirty athletes get caught and doubts arise about everyone. Lowe has never had other than a clean test. Until recently, she assumed doping was more the province of sprinters and weight lifters and long-distance runners.All three of the disqualified high jumpers used turinabol, a steroid that builds lean muscle mass and endurance, which is particularly useful in long meets with multiple jumps. It also acts in concert to make other steroids more effective.\u201cTo see that my sport was one of the dirtiest in that Olympics changed my world,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really dark rabbit hole. I don\u2019t want people to cast a shadow on my career.\u201dAnother American, Derek Miles, a pole-vaulter, also was awarded a belated bronze medal for the Beijing Olympics. Miles has retired and works as an assistant track coach at the University of South Dakota.Lowe had worked to make her peace with her lack of Olympic medals. \u201cI had the option to write my story as a success or a failure,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was 4 years old, I told my sister I would make it to the Olympics. I\u2019ve competed in four.\u201dHer personal tale is more striking than that.She came of age in Paso Robles, Calif., in a family lashed by the storms of addiction. The electricity would get shut off one week, then the water. In sixth grade, she left for a track meet and returned to an empty house. Where, she asked her mother, are my sisters? I sent them to live with their father, her mother replied. Our house is getting foreclosed on.\u201cMom saw that our ship was sinking,\u201d Lowe says.Lowe slept with her mother in cheap motels and in the back seats of cars. (Her father has spent most of his adult life in California\u2019s prisons, also trapped by addictions.) When summer arrived, her mother packed Chaunt\u00e9 off to live with an aunt. \u201cMy mother was embracing a camping lifestyle,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cMom was off the grid.\u201dLowe thought a lot about her life and talked a lot with God that summer. In August, she told her mother that she had decided to live with her grandmother in Riverside. She knew she needed stability. As a high school freshman, she told the track coach that she wanted to try the high jump. You have to beat out the juniors and seniors, he told her.That was that, he figured.She woke before dawn to practice \u2014 a habit she has never lost \u2014 and eventually outjumped the best in the nation. She sprinted, triple-jumped, hurdled and scored in the classroom, too. At Georgia Tech, she finished with a 4.0 grade-point average. Her coach there, Nat Page, became a surrogate father. When she married Mario Lowe, Page walked her down the aisle.\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m his daughter,\u201d she says.I spent an hour talking with Lowe at the Rio Games last summer and another hour in May after the Eugene competition, and I\u2019m no closer now than I was then to decoding the how of this woman.She and her husband have a daughter with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. There were two foreclosures, and for a while it seemed the quicksand of family fate was tugging at her ankles. She pulled free. She became a favorite of track crowds, with her high bounding steps and leaps, slithering up, up and over that bar. She lands and bounds to her feet, clapping, smiling, doing a little boogie.She has a master\u2019s degree and a career in financial planning. Her athletic future holds a question mark for now. She has given thought to the 2020 Games in Tokyo. The body, however, is not an infinitely malleable instrument. She had tortured herself as never before in the four years leading to the Rio Olympics. And still she fell short, taking fourth place.Now she has her medal. She laughs, taken aback by the power of her obsessions and her life\u2019s voyage. \u201cI\u2019ve graduated college, I\u2019m a decent mother, and my husband and I are on 12 years of marriage and I\u2019ve represented my country with integrity,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I allow myself to write my own story, I\u2019m a success.\u201dThat was clear long before she read those Facebook messages last November.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watermelon Grows Up", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenMy earliest watermelon memories have all taken place in or near water, I realized the other day.At summer camp in northern Wisconsin, there was watermelon cut in thick half-moon slices, which we ate sitting on the boat dock, spitting the seeds as far as we could, or swallowing some. The grown-ups said leaves would sprout out of our ears, but, of course, that never happened. There was also the greased watermelon, smeared heavily with Crisco, that we used for the annual football game in the lake\u2019s shallow water and that always ended up smashed and sandy.Back at home, the ornately carved watermelon basket filled with melon-ball fruit salad \u2014 de rigueur on the neighbors\u2019 poolside buffet table for the Fourth of July or any other summer picnic gathering \u2014 was most memorable. There was also the watermelon, carried to the beach on a scorching hot day, that we devoured standing waist-deep in the waves.I ate my childhood watermelon plain, unaware of alternatives. As an adult, though, I nearly always seek a salty component. In Mexico, I learned to eat it with hot red chile and with salt and lime, too. (Even without salt, watermelon with fresh-squeezed lime juice is an inspired combination.) There was no turning back. Watermelon salad with sharp feta cheese and black olives was also alluring. Watermelon rind pickles beckoned, sweet, salty and cider-vinegary.Just as other melons are paired with prosciutto, salt or a salty element is the perfect complement to watermelon\u2019s sweetness. As with tomatoes, a splash of olive oil, a little acidity or some chopped onion are all welcome.For the recent heat wave, I wanted to make a simple gazpacho-like cold watermelon soup. In my mind\u2019s eye, there would be two steps. A mix of watermelon, honeydew and cucumber, seasoned well with salt and pepper and dressed with olive oil and lime juice, would go into the bowl. A ladle of fresh watermelon pur\u00e9e would follow, along with a shower of chives, mint and basil. It would be elegant in its simplicity. In reality, the first version was, well, bland.I discovered that the watermelon pur\u00e9e could handle a fair amount of seasoning. More salt, a touch more hot pepper, a little red wine vinegar and more lime, veering almost toward Bloody Mary territory, makes the soup much more refreshing. Another squeeze of lime at the table couldn\u2019t hurt.cookingAdvertisement"}

(Mice chewed through some of the wires, which is a different story and not one I want you to think about right now.) This would be a problem for me even if I lived alone.But I cook nightly dinners for another adult and the four teenage girls in my so-called blended family, a modern moniker that seems to vaguely reference cake mix but in fact denotes a group of children of various ages and temperaments who have been brought together by outside forces to dine together with regularity.Cooking for the many is the overlooked flip side of cooking for the few and dispersed, the other modern obstacle to an easy, sit-down family dinner.Many more men and women are just like me. On a given night, we face middle schoolers arriving home dragging dead cicada wings stuck on their shoes, announcing starvation; high schoolers, who may or may not have a boyfriend with celiac disease in tow; and a bevy of tutors, employed to prevent these modern children from failing subjects for which they have no particular aptitude, and who also seem to arrive with appetites.Summer can offer a brief break \u2014 let the kids\u2019 camp manage 400 slices of bacon each morning \u2014 or it can add to the chaos, as friends visit with their families and children come home from college and turn your kitchen into a 24-hour diner, including the part where someone else does the dishes.Recipes are often not kind to cooks for the many, with their civilized notations (\u201cserves four\u201d) and their refusal to rescale easily for six, or eight (at least not without copious chopping). We need help.To begin with, we need large pots. We need recipes that can be doubled perfectly, with little extra fuss, or that stretch the protein beyond the usual dice-size bite of meat. We need good speakers, to play loud music over our internal screams when someone comes into the kitchen and starts eating peanut butter crackers just as we put the last dash of salt on dinner. We need creative strategies that may or may not involve many, many eggs. Wine is optional, but advised.Here are some essential tips, gleaned from the experiences of other cooks, and from my own kitchen.Mrs. Flake takes this a step further, by planning her meals for the entire month and making her children help pick what she will make. \u201cYou have to have some skin in the game, realizing that every meal won\u2019t be your favorite,\u201d she said. Everyone gets to veto two items, based on their own scarring childhood experiences with liver and stuffed bell peppers. \u201cI swore to myself I would never fix something that someone would rather go hungry than eat,\u201d Mrs. Flake added.Still, she has to think big. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the luxury that some of my friends did with small eaters,\u201d she recalled of her children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just fix a salad and say, \u2018Here you go, everybody!\u2019 They\u2019d start making toast or pulling out cereal 20 minutes later.\u201dThe Flakes have compiled a family cookbook that they all turn to for well-scaled recipes, including Cafe Rio Pork, a marinated dish with lime cilantro dressing. Sunday nights are for grilled rib-eye (bought on sale at Costco), with a million relatives, and homemade chocolate chip cookies shared with neighbors.Erin Axson, who lives with her husband, three children, mother-in-law and brother-in-law in Salt Lake City, said she often jettisons grains. She marinates chicken in oranges and rosemary and lemon zest overnight, and tosses it on the grill for dinner. She sticks to modest protein servings and many pounds of vegetables, delivered weekly, and largely forgoes any starches.\u201cMy produce costs me $260 a week, which makes my neighbors die because that is so expensive,\u201d Ms. Axson said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t waste anything.\u201d Kale and spinach, for instance, go into a blender when wilting. \u201cI make a lot smoothies,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids call them sludges.\u201dAlso, protein can simply be one ingredient, not the central one; think potpie. Growing up, \u201cwe only killed one chicken at a time,\u201d Ms. Coles said, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t make the meat your main item on the plate. You do a chicken salad, or chicken potpie,\u201d with lots of cream and butter and vegetables.\u201cThere were nine people there,\u201d Ms. Peterson said, including her stepmother\u2019s three children, her father, her own boyfriend, her brother and his wife. \u201cEveryone was extremely happy at the end of the meal.\u201dWhen in doubt, make pancakes. cookingAdvertisement"}

I think that\u2019s because Ms. Burnikel doesn\u2019t really do \u201ctricks\u201d with her grids; her word count here is on the higher end for themeless puzzles, but that helps keep the fill relatively clean. When constructors go below a certain word count or stack long entries, it can be at the expense of the fill.

It has just come home for the summer.College students driven to the left (and occasionally to the right) by campus culture wars are now engaging in the same debates with their longtime housemates \u2014 also known as their parents. Students come home thinking that their parents are hopelessly stuck in some distant era like the 1990s; parents wonder what thousands of tuition dollars actually paid for.The New York Times interviewed students and their parents who have struggled to live under the same roof, even for a few weeks, sometimes arriving at d\u00e9tente over dinner and other times ending in slammed bedroom doors. Their responses have been condensed and edited.Senior, Rollins College; a self-described liberalSusan D\u2019AlessandroSheriff\u2019s office I.T. administrator, Altamonte Springs, Fla.; voted for Mr. TrumpMy mother is not super-crazy nutso, right-wing. But since the election, talking about politics has gotten harder. I tweet things at the president out of frustration. I called him a nasty word and my mother said, \u201cThat is not an appropriate thing to say.\u201d We got into a whole fight.We do get heated and a bit argumentative and raise our voices. But it\u2019s never destroying anything. I just want them to change their minds.What I notice is that when Nick is at school and not with us, his opinions will become far more liberal. This summer, he\u2019ll get very fired up and we\u2019ll have a conversation. I think both of us learn from listening to each other.It will sometimes get to the point where we\u2019re yelling at each other or swearing. But we know it doesn\u2019t change the core of our relationship.Nicholas DuffeeSophomore, University of Chicago; opponent of abortion rightsLivia CorredorLawyer, New York City; supporter of abortion rightsBut this past Easter, I became Catholic. One big influence toward shifting my worldview was the book \u201cThe Reason for God\u201d by Tim Keller, a Presbyterian pastor. And when I worked at Greenpeace, I met a girl who had Christian ideas, which made me start asking questions. She is now my girlfriend.Now abortion is very important to me. When an election comes around, I\u2019ll figure out how to vote, but I\u2019ve adopted a traditional Catholic or conservative approach to that issue. At school, I got involved with Students for Life, and next year I will be on the executive board.My mom doesn\u2019t like it. She would definitely describe herself as pro-choice. She has been a contributor to Naral Pro-Choice America. One conversation we had ended very badly. We were talking about whether or not Planned Parenthood was doing things that were illegal. It took the turn I feel is common in current political discourse, where we couldn\u2019t really agree on the facts, and because of that, we got angry and thought the other was crazy.It\u2019s very tough because I am pro-choice and feel so strongly about it. He believes that life begins at conception and you\u2019re killing. It\u2019s very black and white for him, and he can\u2019t see introducing anything else to that analysis. I\u2019ve tried.I\u2019m counting on his thoroughness in researching new ideas and hoping he changes. He is very respectful of my views.

She said things I didn\u2019t agree with regarding crime and terrorism. It became an argument, but we were in the car on the highway, and I didn\u2019t want to get into an accident. I ended the conversation and we sat in tense silence.This summer at my mom\u2019s house, they mostly watch Fox News. I\u2019ll cringe a little bit. But mostly I avoid political conversations, because I don\u2019t like fighting with my mom. In many ways, she\u2019s a role model to me.I do respect Jennifer\u2019s views and hope she respects mine. I totally understand why she thinks all these beautiful things: that everybody should be equal and rich people should give away all their wealth to the poor. In China, I was told that was the way society should be. But since I\u2019ve lived in the United States of America for over 20 years, my view has changed.As a mother, I love my daughter no matter what. Maybe we will have different political views or a different lifestyle in the future, but I do love her unconditionally.Sophomore, George Washington University; activist in left-wing campus movementsKimberly AgoroManager of a medical practice, Fort Worth; former Republican, now a moderate DemocratMy parents say that I have a bleeding red heart for the entire world.My mom used to be a Republican. She managed to work her way to financial health from a poor family, and she doesn\u2019t always believe in handouts. But with the racism in the Republican Party, she is now a conservative Democrat. She will say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d but also, \u201cI should be able to have guns.\u201dThis past year at American University, people hung bananas on campus and called black students monkeys. I marched with students from colleges across the region. My parents are of the opinion that if there is racism at a school or someplace else, you shouldn\u2019t go there. But I\u2019m of the opinion that you should be able to go wherever you want to go.We\u2019re on a cruise together right now, and we just got into a political argument last night. We\u2019ll definitely yell sometimes. My dad will get upset and keep saying his point over and over again. My mom will just walk away. But we never stay mad for long.She is so good at heart. But there are still times I wish there was some more hard-core practicality to her views. I wish she would listen and learn. I have a degree in African studies and biology and participated in many movements. She doesn\u2019t always respect my vast experience.I can\u2019t afford to make my blood pressure work in order to really get her to understand, so I will quite often back down. I will wait for the right situation to teach her the lesson I need her to know. Sometimes, kids are just that way.Callie DeschSenior, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater; advocate for gay and transgender rightsLynn Olson-DeschStore manager for Goodwill, Brodhead, Wis.; says she is still learning about transgender issuesWhen trans issues first started coming up in my family with my mom and stepmom, Lynn, one of them was more apprehensive at first. But then she started watching \u201cI Am Jazz\u201d (a reality show about a transgender teenager) on TV, and she became a lot more aware.At the same time, my mom also will sometimes say, \u201cI wonder how many of these people who are coming out as trans are actually trans. Is it because trans now is more acceptable?\u201d She\u2019s very butch and says she sees fewer and fewer butch lesbians.I understand them being older and not quite understanding the difference between gender and sexuality. Gender is how you identify as a person. Sexuality is who you are attracted to.Unfortunately, she has had a lot of homophobia on her college campus. She\u2019s really out and she\u2019s suffering from that.She\u2019s taught me and her mother a lot about the trans issue. Pronouns have been a conversation piece.But my partner and I have conversations. What is wrong with being a lesbian? Why do you have to conform to social norms by being a man? I wanted to be a man when I was 19, but I\u2019m really glad I didn\u2019t do that.We\u2019ve always had very frank conversations at the table. We do not want to be those parents who you can\u2019t talk to.Stephanie Saul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Makes (and Unmakes) an All-Star?", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI never was an All-Star, but I was on a few ballots. In both 1998 and 1999, when I was among the leaders in all of baseball in hits just before the break, my manager with the Phillies, Terry Francona, made a valiant effort to lobby the National League All-Star manager on my behalf. To no avail.That was as close as I would ever get.We often see All-Star status as a one-way flight to greatness, an indelible marker. But All-Star athletes deal with setbacks of all kinds that are no different from other players\u2019 \u2014 injuries, demotions, performance decline. And it\u2019s guaranteed that when All-Stars fall, they fall from much higher ground. Today, the toughest part of it may be that they do it in public: everything tweeted out, Facebook-posted, splashed on a web page, instantly Instagrammed.We saw this over the past few weeks, when two former All-Stars were let go midseason. The Cubs catcher Miguel Montero was ignominiously \u201cdesignated for assignment\u201d and later traded to the Blue Jays. And that timeless artifact, Bartolo Col\u00f3n, a four-time All-Star, was sent packing by the Braves.The tipping point for Montero was when he initially blamed his pitcher for the opposing team\u2019s rampant success at stealing base after base, instead of taking some responsibility as part of the pitcher-catcher battery. Headlines blared and alerts lit up cellphones, many using the word \u201cblasted\u201d \u2014 in reference either to Montero\u2019s critique of his pitcher or to one of Montero\u2019s teammates responding to his comments.Col\u00f3n\u2019s departure came with less fanfare and controversy, which could be an indicator of how even All-Stars can fade to black without much notice, despite, in this case, a 20-year career. Col\u00f3n was later picked up by the Twins, and the Sporting News noted, \u201cTwins get \u2018sexier\u2019 \u201d by signing Bartolo Col\u00f3n to a minor-league contract \u2014 this because of his nickname, Big Sexy. Sexy or not, I am mostly happy that my playing days predated all of our current social media staples.In baseball, one\u2019s pedigree can create the belief that instead of focusing on the journey, as every clich\u00e9 implores us to do, we\u2019re supposed to occupy a station and own it, not just enjoy the ride. Sport in particular is driven by numbers, and when a season or career is over, or a ballot box closed, the awards often follow the bottom line, not how we counted to get there. As a first-round draft pick, I was presumed to have an exceptional skill set and therefore the bandwidth to \u201cmake it\u201d \u2014 not just to the next level, but to the top. Where I\u2019d stay. There seemed to be no other acceptable outcome.If you look at my baseball career, on the back of my bubble gum card (or in today\u2019s terms, on my Baseball Reference web page), you see years, statistics and stops: Geneva, Winston-Salem, Daytona, Orlando, Des Moines and then, finally, the big leagues (Chicago, Philadelphia, Texas). Through the lens of the level of those stops, it looks like an escalator of guaranteed growth, a hedge fund manager\u2019s dream.Until it abruptly ends. The final entry is 2004. What you don\u2019t see is the shoulder issue that made me miss the beginning of the 1992 season, how the 1994-95 strike eliminated nearly my entire spring training and made that minor-league season a game of catch-up, being blindsided by a 1997 trade from Chicago to Philadelphia, the hamstring surgery in 2003. For most players, the minor-league experience is invisible to a big-league card despite its major influence. Yet in my case, most notably absent was my father\u2019s bout with illness for three years in the middle of my career.Every player has similar stories, All-Stars included. When I truly look at the ride of my career \u2014 or anyone\u2019s, for that matter \u2014 it is bumpy, not smooth, and a few times I even went backward. (See 1996, when the Cubs sent me back down to the minors.) The 2017 All-Star rosters are full of inspiring journeys, from Justin Smoak and Brandon Kintzler, two up-and-down big leaguers making their first All-Star appearances in their 30s, to the return to dominance of Yu Darvish and Greg Holland (and others) after Tommy John surgery. Then there are Justin Turner and Josh Harrison, at one point deemed utility-only players, both turning those roles into All-Star performers, dispelling the idea that versatility is a sign of weakness. And the stature-defying successes of both Aaron Judge (6-foot-7) and Jose Altuve (5-foot-6). As for their communities? The above All-Stars play for Toronto, Minnesota, Texas, Colorado, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, New York and Houston. Inspiration has a diverse reach.If numbers were everything, it would be easier to absorb and rationalize those bumps. Means to an end. But on the other side of getting released, fired or relegated, emotions are the key player. Like the percolating anxiety caused by knowing that some of those downhill changes are permanent, and we are powerless to discern which ones.But if a career is more complex than the stat line on the back of your baseball card, so, in a sense, is life. Even the mountaintop is always shifting with its inevitable weather changes. For anyone, athlete or not, the next step could always mean a plummet to the bottom.A couple of months ago, I was part of the very public layoffs at ESPN, and I realize, more than ever, how my time in professional baseball helped me frame the bigger picture on the other side of any setback, especially when you are falling from the top of an industry. Just as I learned when the Yankees released me in 2005. Both experiences led me to take time out to examine what I learned from the ride, whether I appreciated my station when I stopped to take it in. That reflection only underscored the significance of the now.In tonight\u2019s game, we will witness the talents of those who perform in the rarefied air we often speak about when it comes to the few who reach the top of the top. They are in their moment. And maybe, if we are lucky, they will create an original and singular moment for all of us, the kind that happens when we watch the best outshine the best.Advertisement"}

While she and Mr. Shaw were away at college, their mothers ran into each other and began a conversation highlighted by Mr. Shaw\u2019s mother revealing that her son had always thought Jenny Scharfeld was pretty.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about him before or after my mother passed along that comment,\u201d Ms. Scharfeld said, \u201cbut I was flattered.\u201dOn Sept. 9, 2012, Mr. Shaw was soon on Ms. Scharfeld\u2019s radar \u2014 as well as the United States Coast Guard\u2019s \u2014 after he and his father narrowly escaped tragedy during a forced landing of their Cessna 185 airplane onto the rough seas off the Big Sur coast in California.Shortly into the flight, which left Camarillo Airport headed toward their annual father-and-son fishing trip in Canada, the plane lost power and was forced to land on amphibious floats. They battled eight-foot swells before being rescued via helicopter by the Coast Guard just as their plane sank, and with only minutes of fuel remaining for the helicopter to return to shore.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just started thinking back to our high school years, and what a nice guy he was. I was so glad that he was O.K.\u201dIn July 2015, with Ms. Scharfeld\u2019s 20-year high school reunion approaching, one of her close high school friends began reaching out to classmates to see if they would attend. One of those calls went to Mr. Shaw, who told Ms. Scharfeld\u2019s friend that he could not make it as he would be in Minnesota for his grandfather\u2019s memorial. Mr. Shaw did, however, pass along his best regards to Ms. Scharfeld.\u201cThroughout the years, Jenny often crossed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI was Facebook friends with her sister and knew her whole family, who are great people.\u201dThe next month, Ms. Scharfeld, with the urging of that same friend, sent an email to Mr. Shaw, telling him that she was now living in Los Angeles and spending most weekends in Santa Barbara.He responded immediately, and not long after took her to dinner \u201cat a place close enough to walk back to her bungalow just in case our first date failed,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut she was so alive, so intelligent and so much fun to be with.\u201d\u201cFrom the moment we locked eyes,\u201d he continued, \u201cI knew everything was going to be wonderful between us.\u201dSo did Ms. Scharfeld, who said that she and Mr. Shaw \u201chad so much chemistry and enjoyed a crazy, fun weekend together.\u201d\u201cI hopped into his 1960s orange Jeep that day, and he looked exactly the same as I last remembered him,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked into his eyes and thought, \u2018Oh my God, I might marry this man.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Prisoner Finally Found Stability Before Killing Police Officer", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a lifetime of trouble, Alexander Bonds finally seemed to have everything under control. At 34, he had escaped New York City\u2019s shelter system and moved into his own apartment in the Bronx. He had a girlfriend, and a job at a fast-food restaurant. His five-year stint on parole was almost up, and he had not had a run-in with the police in years.But in recent weeks, something was off. He was hospitalized in June for a breakdown after making an ominous call to his sister.\u201cHe kept saying he was going to kill someone,\u201d Nancy Kearse, his aunt, said, recalling the episode. \u201cHe was very angry.\u201dHe had been out of the hospital only a week when that rage erupted in a heinous and seemingly random act of violence. Early on Wednesday, Mr. Bonds was walking down a street in the Bronx when he pulled out a gun and fired through the window of a police truck, killing the officer who was sitting in the passenger seat, Miosotis Familia. He ran a short way before he was shot and killed by responding officers.Less than 24 hours after the latest attack, investigators were piecing together the events that led up to the shooting. They had begun analyzing posts to Facebook in which Mr. Bonds speaks passionately about abuses he suffered in prison and appears to express anti-police sentiments, and delving into his yearslong battle with mental health issues.As they learned of the shooting, friends and relatives of Mr. Bonds were struggling to comprehend how a man who had seemingly come so far could so suddenly have pivoted to violence.\u201cThey do paint him as a really bad person, and I get it,\u201d Ms. Kearse said. \u201cMy heart really goes out to that family, but he is no cop killer.\u201dAs investigators work to determine a motive, they will certainly focus on circumstances that led to what relatives described as a mental breakdown Mr. Bonds suffered in June. At the time, his sister had talked him into checking himself into a hospital in the Bronx, Ms. Kearse said, but she could not remember which one.It is unclear how long he spent at the hospital or why he was discharged. In New York, mental health services typically will not provide inpatient treatment for more than a few days unless it can be proved that patients present an immediate threat to themselves or other people.Ms. Kearse said Mr. Bonds had been given diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and had been hospitalized on and off for years. When he was taking his medications, she said, he could be serene and almost never exhibited violent tendencies.But if he stopped taking them or, worse, had a few drinks, he could go wild.\u201cOnce he gets into that zone,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can\u2019t even medicate him and he becomes stronger than an ox.\u201dThere is a family history of mental illness, she said. After Mr. Bonds\u2019s father died of a heart attack when Mr. Bonds and his two siblings were still young, his mother, Deborah Kearse, had a breakdown and was institutionalized for a period. Mr. Bonds and his brother, John, were placed into foster care. His sister, Ryan, went to live with her aunt.Deborah Kearse was placed in an assisted-living facility in Lower Manhattan. Since his release from prison, friends said, Mr. Bonds had spent time volunteering at the facility, making sandwiches for the residents and trying to forge a relationship with his mother.Mr. Bonds\u2019s trouble with the law began in adolescence.In addition to low-level criminal activity, there were flashes of violence.In 2001, when he was 18, he was with a group of four other people who attacked a police officer in Queens, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the case, which has been sealed. Wearing brass knuckles, Mr. Bonds punched and kicked the officer, the official said.In 2006, he was convicted of robbing a person at gunpoint in Syracuse and was sentenced to a maximum of eight years in prison. It was his second stint in state prison in two years; the first time he completed an intensive boot camp for drug offenders and was released after seven months.\u201cIf you\u2019re an inmate at Attica, you\u2019ve had some form of abuse happen to you,\u201d said Sean Caraballo, 36, who became friends with Mr. Bonds in prison and kept in touch after they had both been released. \u201cIt wears on you, has an effect on you.\u201dIn a video that Mr. Bonds recorded and posted on Facebook in September, he accused guards of beating, raping and murdering inmates, particularly a guard he called Preacher, who he said organized fights between inmates \u201clike we savages.\u201d\u201cPolice be killing them and saying the inmates killed them,\u201d Mr. Bonds said. (Inmates in New York State prisons often refer to correction officers as police.)In other videos, he criticizes police brutality and suggests he would stand up for himself in any encounter with officers in the streets. Investigators are closely examining all of his social media content in search of other inflammatory statements.Friends said he had never spoken of committing an act of violence against a police officer.\u201cHe was aware about police brutality and aware of Black Lives Matter, but I wouldn\u2019t say he was angry or upset,\u201d said another friend who served time with Mr. Bonds at Attica, who would only identify himself as Jason G.The last time Jason G. saw Mr. Bonds was at his birthday party in mid-June. Mr. Bonds had to work and could not stay for long, but stopped by to offer best wishes and a hug.Since leaving prison, Mr. Bonds had taken control of his life, friends said. He met with his parole officer as required on June 20 and was scheduled for another meeting on July 11, according to a parole official.For four years, he was able to stay out of trouble. Then, on the evening of the Fourth of July, while many New Yorkers were launching fireworks and tending barbecues, Alexander Bonds was working himself into a frenzy.Starting around 9 p.m. his girlfriend made several panicked calls to 911. She described him as \u201cmanic\u201d and \u201cparanoid,\u201d according to a law enforcement official familiar with the calls. She tried to follow him as he walked the streets in the area near his home in the Foxhurst neighborhood of the Bronx, but she could not keep up. \u201cHe just takes off,\u201d the official said.Hours later and three miles away, a surveillance video captured him dressed all in black walking westbound on West 183rd Street. He strolled up to the passenger-side window of a police truck where Officer Familia was sitting, pulled out a Ruger .38 and fired once through the glass.Al Baker, Joseph Goldstein and Emily Palmer contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Why Some Online Video Stars Opt for Facebook Over YouTube", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Laura Clery has the trappings of a YouTube star \u2014 seven-figure annual earnings, brand sponsorships and millions of fans who watch her comedy videos \u2014 except for one notable difference: She\u2019s finding fame and fortune on Facebook.As an early participant in Facebook\u2019s video revenue-sharing program, Ms. Clery is one of its first stars to receive YouTube-like payments. Developing native stars is part of Facebook\u2019s ambition to challenge YouTube as the internet\u2019s primary destination for video by getting users to see it as more than a repository of one-off hits.But the social network has struggled to match YouTube\u2019s success in coaxing viewers to watch for longer stretches, which is essential to siphon off TV advertising money. YouTube said mobile viewers, on average, watch for more than an hour a day \u2014 a testament to its huge video inventory and uncanny ability to predict what you want to watch next.To capture and retain the attention of its two billion monthly users with more than short, viral clips, Facebook is now delivering live sports as well as creating its own serialized programs and exclusive shows. It is also courting performers who can build a passionate audience and keep them coming back.That is where Ms. Clery comes in. Feeling powerless over her acting career, Ms. Clery decided to try her hand at videos online two years ago. She started out on YouTube but struggled to stand out among the abundance of content.One of her first Facebook videos \u2014 a skit about close talkers \u2014 was viewed 30,000 times in a day without any promotion or fans. In two years, she has become one of Facebook\u2019s biggest stars and she is making more money than she ever did as a traditional working actor.\u201cI go where the love is and I go where I do better,\u201d said Ms. Clery, who had starred in a few sitcoms before moving into online video. \u201cPeople said \u2018Focus on YouTube because they monetize,\u2019 but the reach was more important to me. I figured the money would come, and it has.\u201dMs. Clery said a YouTube representative recently approached her to encourage her to focus more on YouTube. She already posts there, she said, but mostly to discourage people from stealing her videos and uploading them to the site.Most online video creators are not exclusive to any platform, but the biggest stars publish most consistently on YouTube because its ad revenue-sharing typically provides the biggest payouts.While most creators post videos to Facebook, it is sometimes treated as an afterthought or a marketing tool to redirect users back to their YouTube page. At last month\u2019s VidCon, the online video industry\u2019s annual trade show, Facebook unleashed a charm offensive to creators, highlighting its fledgling video ad programs and introducing a new app featuring tools to help creators make videos look more professional.\u201cYouTube is modern-day television for the younger generation. The audience is superdevoted and willing to give you their time,\u201d said Mr. Paul, whose brother Jake is also a star. He said his video logs \u2014 a mix between a reality show and running diary \u2014 on YouTube span from 10 to 25 minutes. Other than live streams, most of his Facebook videos are about a minute long.\u201cAs long as YouTube continues to be a place where creators can amass a large audience, it\u2019s always going to be a draw until another platform can match its revenue dollars,\u201d said Joshua Cohen, co-founder of Tubefilter, a site devoted to the online video industry.Facebook started testing the new advertising program earlier this year to allow some creators, like Ms. Clery, to place 15-second ads in videos. Creators in the program said advertising revenue from Facebook was comparable to YouTube, although many cautioned it was still early. Facebook said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with the program and planned to include more creators.Also, both companies are pushing to help creators land so-called influencer marketing deals \u2014 connecting social media stars with companies that want their brands or products promoted. Last year, YouTube acquired FameBit \u2014 a marketplace to help marketers find influential stars \u2014 while Facebook made more people eligible to promote posts from brands.Facebook and YouTube are also adding features that make them more alike. Last week, YouTube introduced a mobile feature to directly share videos with friends and maintain group messaging threads. YouTube also started a pilot program to allow major stars to post nonvideo content to their pages \u2014 creating a Facebook profile of sorts with photos and text.Ross Smith, who has 3.6 million Facebook followers for his comedy videos, acknowledged that he missed some opportunities to make money by focusing so much on Facebook.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty damn big and I didn\u2019t make a dime on it,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who is now part of Facebook\u2019s advertising experiment.But he said he reserved his best content for Facebook because it had a diverse and global audience. He is active on Snapchat and Instagram, but his videos spread faster on Facebook because it serves a different audience.At VidCon, Mr. Smith said his YouTube star friends were mobbed on the convention floor by teenage fans while he walked around largely unnoticed.

His children, all seven of them, had fallen gravely ill.The laborer, Abdulla Siraa, set about frantically trying to raise money to treat the children \u2014 $240, or about six times what he typically earns in a month \u2014 and raced as fast as he could on the 30 miles home over roads virtually destroyed in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\u201cI spent the whole journey reciting Quranic verses and praying for the survival of my children,\u201d he said.But when he arrived, he learned that his 4-year-old daughter, Ghadeer, had already died, after hours of calling out for him, though the rest of his children would survive.The crises in Africa, however, pale in comparison to the one in Yemen.The campaign has so far failed to reinstall the internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, but the fighting and airstrikes have killed more than 8,000 people and displaced at least three million, the United Nations says.In October, the government stopped paying civil servants, prompting strikes from sanitation workers and leading to garbage pileups and septic backups. That contaminated the wells that many Yemenis rely on for water, providing the ideal environment for cholera to spread. The outbreak picked up speed in April, after dirty rainwater further polluted the wells.\u201cThe average person lives on tea and bread. It\u2019s just one meal a day,\u201d said Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. \u201cThey are in a weakened state, and that is why they are getting sick.\u201dMaking matters worse, the war has damaged 65 percent of Yemen\u2019s medical facilities, denying more than 14 million people access to health care.The extent of the crisis was clear during a recent trip through some of Yemen\u2019s hardest hit areas, where clinics are overburdened and short on supplies, and families struggle to reach them and pay for treatment. Some watch their relatives suffer and die.Before the war, Yemen was already the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation, and its people never enjoyed high-quality infrastructure. But travel by car, the only means available, has become far more difficult because the Saudi-led bombing campaign has shattered bridges and left huge bomb craters in the main roads.A simple 20-mile ride that would have taken an hour before the war is now a maze of complex routes that can take many more hours and cost more than what many families live on for an entire month.To pay for rides to the hospital, many families borrow money or sell heirloom gold \u2014 the equivalent of an American family liquidating retirement accounts. Some who cannot pay carry their loved ones through the rugged terrain on trips that can aggravate dehydration.Cholera medications are supposed to be freely provided by Yemen\u2019s two competing administrations, but both have favored their military efforts over public health, forcing many families to buy medications from private pharmacies. Acute cases also require families to buy diapers or carry their infected relatives to the toilet several times an hour.Mr. Siraa, the farm laborer, spoke of his family\u2019s tragedy at a school that a local philanthropist had turned into a clinic in Haja Province, which has been hit hard by the cholera epidemic and the war.The bridge connecting it to the rest of Yemen was destroyed in an airstrike last year. The clinic has 35 beds, but only a couple of IV fluid bags, two fans and four nurses.When asked about his trip to the clinic, his family\u2019s illness and the death of his daughter, Mr. Siraa was almost speechless.\u201cThank God for everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe Yemenis don\u2019t like to complain because we believe that God punishes complainers.\u201dOthers had suffered through similar ordeals.\u201cWe are too poor for a taxi. We had to walk,\u201d said Saif Ahmad, an unemployed laborer, who stood nearby, wet and disheveled.To reach the clinic, he and his wife had hiked through a valley known for dangerous flash floods. He had his cholera-infected son on his back.\u201cIt took us five hours to get here. Now we have to beg for money,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said. His son, 7, lay on a bed receiving treatment, his mouth agape and his eyes half-shut.The epidemic has also taxed medical workers, who often work in dirty clinics with resources that fall far short of their suffering patients\u2019 needs. They sometimes have to ask their patients\u2019 families to help them clean the floors and bathrooms in their facilities.\u201cIt is not a nice thing to ask someone to do, but we can\u2019t do everything,\u201d said Abdulla Abu Fas, a doctor in the port city of Hodeida. \u201cWe can\u2019t work with the smell of feces and flies everywhere.\u201dThe United Nations says it needs $2.1 billion for its work in Yemen this year, but it has received only 29 percent of that amount despite repeated pleas for donations from aid groups.Cultural issues have also aggravated the crisis, said Mr. McGoldrick, the United Nations coordinator. Many Yemenis do not seek help immediately after they show symptoms because \u201cthey just don\u2019t want to admit that they have cholera, because they think it makes them look dirty or poor,\u201d he said.Although the epidemic has hit Yemen\u2019s poor the hardest, it has spread among other classes as well. Aziz Ramadan, a Yemeni Coast Guard officer from Hodeida, nearly lost his wife to cholera last month.The mother of Ahmad Saif Hashid, a member of Yemen\u2019s Parliament, died of cholera last week, he wrote on his Facebook page.While more medicine and better treatment would help control the epidemic, Mr. Ramadan said, it will very likely continue as long as the war does.\u201cPeople will continue to get sick, and they will always be treated like cattle here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe international community should just make people stop fighting and help our hospitals.\u201dShuaib Almosawa reported from Haja, and Nour Youssef from Cairo.

{"Headline": "The South Park Commons Fills a Hole in the Tech Landscape", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ruchi Sanghvi was the first female engineer at Facebook, where she helped create the news feed that now serves as the primary window into the world\u2019s largest social network. Then she built a start-up of her own and sold it to another rising Silicon Valley company, Dropbox, becoming one of its first female executives. But as she left Dropbox in 2014, she didn\u2019t know what she would do next.At 32, she wanted a better way of deciding where her career would go. She wanted an environment where she could freely explore new ideas among her peers without feeling the pressure to start another project immediately.As the months passed, she never quite found that kind of personal think tank, but she came to realize that many old friends and colleagues felt much the same way. Her next project became an effort to help people find their next project.The result is South Park Commons. Housed in an old townhouse on the oval park at the heart of the San Francisco tech scene, the Commons is a selected community of entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers and others. Ms. Sanghvi describes it as tech\u2019s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Junto club, a means of shaping new ideas through conversation and shared experience.It\u2019s also a way of preparing for the future.\u201cYou get a couple of shots in life to do something meaningful and impactful. Why not take the time to identify that?\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said during a recent conversation inside the Commons, a high-ceilinged space decorated by local artists. \u201cIt is very easy to fall into the traps of Silicon Valley \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s start a company,\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s invest\u2019 \u2014 without giving it a second thought.\u201dThe Commons is a bit like the hacker spaces that have long thrived in the Valley \u2014 places where coders and makers gather to build new software and hardware \u2014 but it moves beyond that familiar concept. Its founder, for one thing, is a female engineer turned entrepreneur turned executive.Today\u2019s tech industry also provides an extra degree of economic freedom, said Ms. Sanghvi, whose husband, Aditya Agarwal, also has a long history in Silicon Valley and is now the chief technology officer at Dropbox.Many tech workers were stuck with their companies for years, waiting for an initial public offering. Now they can easily sell their shares on private markets, and that means they have more opportunity to explore new ventures. At the same time, the path to the next venture is less obvious, as companies shift toward very different types of technology, most notably artificial intelligence, or A.I., which is rapidly changing the way the world builds software.The rub is that the talent needed to build and deploy these techniques is scarce, so much so that the likes of Google and Facebook are running classes to educate their employees in this new way of doing things. The Commons provides both a physical and a social environment where others can learn in similar ways.Ms. Sanghvi recruits people to the Commons solely by word of mouth, and they join merely by showing up and contributing a few hundred dollars in dues, to pay for items like coffee, snacks and paper towels and to fund regular events at the townhouse.When Cinjon Resnick arrived at the Commons last year after moving to San Francisco from New York, it was already cultivating an interest in neural networks and other A.I. techniques. He was among those who spent several months exploring the field, reading and discussing the latest research papers, and organizing lectures and workshops at the Commons.Many groups strive for this dynamic of exploration and dialogue, but for Mr. Resnick, the Commons succeeded. \u201cIt\u2019s a loosely structured place where people can come and form ideas,\u201d he said during a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all wanted.\u201dBut this arrangement has other byproducts. Ms. Qiu is one of three female founders who have emerged from the Commons. Though Ms. Sanghvi said the organization still needed more women, her presence and the group dynamic are at least a step toward that future.\u201cThis is collaborative learning,\u201d said Nilanjana Dasgupta, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studies how social environments affect career paths, particularly in science and technology. \u201cThat can feel more satisfying for women in a culture like Silicon Valley.\u201dMr. Resnick and other alumni of the Commons say this vibe exists because Ms. Sanghvi takes such a strong hand in guiding her creation. With a style both endearing and remarkably direct, she runs the community the way a good parent raises a child.She pays for the townhouse, giving the group a place to meet and work each day, and she lays down the rules. She demands regular lunches, dinners and other events, like the early lecture on A.I. from a Silicon Valley veteran, Keith Adams, who is the chief architect of Slack, or a recent presentation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable organization started by Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.\u201cEvents give you an excuse to talk to each other,\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said. \u201cThey make you feel like you\u2019re working on something together.\u201dBut she also sets limits. Anyone who builds a company that grows to more than five people graduates. She does not want the Commons to become just another accelerator.The trick lies in keeping the current vibe going and, better yet, mimicking its approach across the Valley. For the Commons, that means more independence from Ms. Sanghvi, a way for the group to attract members and raise funds on its own.Ms. Sanghvi said she might find a way to get the Commons a tiny percentage of any start-up that emerged from the townhouse or she might seek sponsorship from big businesses or nonprofits.That may or may not change the Commons. But Ms. Sanghvi is intent on ensuring that the vibe remains. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be something that lasts for three years and disappears,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Starting Over, With the Help of Tattoo Removal", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.For a former gang member, old tattoos can send a message to mainstream society: I am not one of you.They\u2019re an obstacle to employment, but also to new lives with family and community members who may be put off by the sinister-looking imagery.The charity was started in the late 1980s by the Rev. Greg Boyle, a Jesuit priest who became dismayed by the all too frequent deaths of young people caught up in gang violence in his Boyle Heights parish.Early on, a doctor with a laser machine offered to donate an hour of time here and there for tattoo removal. As word spread, a huge demand was uncovered.\u201cPretty soon I had a waiting list of 3,000 gang members,\u201d Father Boyle said.Today, Homeboy Industries operates a clinic open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, with three laser machines and more than 40 volunteer doctors.Father Boyle said the services were part of a holistic approach to gang intervention that included mental health counseling, addiction treatment and job training. The goal, he said, is to heal former gang members.\u201cAn employed gang member may or may not go back to prison, and an educated one may or may not go back to prison,\u201d Father Boyle said. \u201cBut a healed gang member won\u2019t ever reoffend \u2014 ever.\u201dLast week, Alex Carpio, a former member of the Varrio Las Lomas gang in the San Gabriel Valley, came in for his 45th laser treatment to get a tattoo across his abdomen removed.Mr. Carpio, 42, said he started gang banging at 13. He was in and out of juvenile halls and jails. He was shot multiple times, leaving him blind, and beaten so badly that he walks with a lean. After 20 years, he\u2019d had enough.\u201cI lived in a lie,\u201d Mr. Carpio said. \u201cI wanted to kill my worst enemies. But of course I was my worst enemy myself.\u201dLaser tattoo removal is said to feel like a hot rubber band snapping on the skin. Even for a former gangster, the treatments are not to be taken lightly.\u201cPshh, it is beyond painful,\u201d Mr. Carpio said with a laugh. \u201cYeah and I mean I\u2019ve been through so much pain.\u201dJim Wilson, a New York Times photographer, visited Homeboy Industries last week. Some of his images:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It was on this day in 1853 that Joaquin Murrieta, the Robin Hood of El Dorado, met his gruesome end.That\u2019s at least according to the legend.Much is disputed about the life of Mr. Murrieta, a Mexican gold miner who has been portrayed as both a freedom fighter and a bloodthirsty bandit.A few facts seem certain, according to Susan Lee Johnson, a historian of the American West. Among them are that Mr. Murrieta existed, that he traveled from Mexico to seek his fortune in California, and that he was hunted for crimes he may or may not have committed.Less clear is what drove him into a life on the run. According to the stories, Mr. Murrieta\u2019s success as a gold prospector attracted the jealousy of white miners who beat him and raped his wife, Rosita.Consumed with revenge, he formed a gang that robbed banks and killed dozens of men, including those behind the attack.On July 25, 1853, Mr. Murrieta was finally cornered by a posse of California Rangers and killed. His severed head, it was claimed, was placed in a jar and displayed for paying spectators.Richard Griswold del Castillo, an emeritus professor of Chicano studies at San Diego State University, said Mr. Murrieta came to represent a yearning for justice at a time of rampant racism and lynchings of Mexicans.\u201cI think the larger significance of him is as a proto-revolutionary,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have an ideology but he was fighting for the rights of the people against the injustices that a lot of people were feeling.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of Liz Smith, Celebrity Accomplice", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "Lions of New YorkShe was the most powerful gossip columnist in the 1980s. A tabloid celebrity herself, she could turn anyone into a star overnight. Until she couldn\u2019t.Supported by\u201cI\u2019m just fine,\u201d she said the other day. \u201cI can\u2019t walk. I can\u2019t talk as well as I used to, but I\u2019m relatively healthy otherwise.\u201dWhat she does not have is a column in a New York tabloid, the Via Veneto of the gossip world. Since The New York Post dropped her in 2009, she has been a herald without a proper platform, rejected by the media names she helped make boldface.Facebook, maybe?\u201cI don\u2019t think my name could sell anything now,\u201d Ms. Smith said in the apartment where she moved after her stroke in January, from her longtime digs above a Tex-Mex restaurant in Murray Hill. She wore a white cable-knit sweater and bright orange lipstick.\u201cIt used to mean \u2014 bylines used to mean something in journalism,\u201d she said, her Texas accent still unbowed. But with the internet and social media, she said, \u201cmost people have forgotten about so-called powerful people like me; we served our time.\u201dWhich put Ms. Smith at an existential crossroads: If a gossip columnist dishes in the forest and no one repeats it, does it make a sound? In a celebrity landscape that considers contestants on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d to be celebrities, how does a star-chaser regain her star?\u201cI am in search of Liz Smith,\u201d she said softly, musing at the thought. \u201cAfter a lifetime of fun and excitement and money and feeling important and being in the thick of it, I am just shocked every day that I\u2019m not the same person. I think that happens to all old people. They\u2019re searching for a glimmer of what they call their real self. They\u2019re boring, mostly.\u201cI\u2019m always thinking falsely, expending what little energy I have, believing every day I may just rediscover that person. I try to be all of the things I was, but it inevitably fails. I don\u2019t feel like myself at all.\u201dMary Elizabeth Smith was born in 1923 in Fort Worth and grew up enthralled by the radio broadcasts of Walter Winchell, aching for \u201cthe glamour and the excitement of New York,\u201d she said. She was not interested in Hollywood; New York was where the luster was.Her arrival, in September 1949, was less than glamorous. She reached Pennsylvania Station after a three-day train ride, with $50 and no job prospects, and spent her first night in a hotel room on 21st Street with two friends. She knew how to hail a taxi because she had seen it in movies, she said. When she looked out the window her first morning, she asked, \u201cWhich way is town?\u201dShe quickly found her way, landing an apartment with two roommates, taking turns sleeping on the couch. The place was small but it did not matter. The city was too exciting for her to stay home and read or sleep, knowing what was outside her window \u2014 stars, celebrities, the El Morocco club.\u201cI was just climbing and electrified all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBurning up with ambition. So I don\u2019t want to judge other people too harshly that I see on television. They\u2019re just climbing also. But I like to think that I had some talent.\u201dThe phone book!\u201cThat would be impossible today,\u201d she said. \u201cAny celebrity would flee from the publicity. They are trying to escape their fans. Once they\u2019re really big, they choose to insulate themselves with money, and they don\u2019t need publicity, they just get it by appearing, but they\u2019re not exactly clawing their way to the top, like everybody in the theater and the movies used to be. They\u2019re just so big, they don\u2019t care anymore.\u201dInto this gap, of course \u2014 between the untouchable star and the curious public \u2014 rose the gossip columnist, and particularly Ms. Smith. Access made the stars more like mortals, and made the gossip columnists more like stars. The price of admission, she discovered, was often uncritical reverence. Celebrities learned they could count on Ms. Smith.Meeting her heroes, she said, did not diminish their glow. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed fabulous.\u201dShe was invited to lavish openings and parties, or to travel to exotic film locations, and when she wrote favorably about these, she was invited to more. Instead of digging for scandal, like some of her competitors (\u201cI thought I was above it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to better myself\u201d) she cultivated mutually beneficial relationships with her subjects.\u201cI know people who wouldn\u2019t care if Liz Smith killed somebody as long as she mentioned their names in her column,\u201d he said.\u201cI had a fabulous education around the world, through people no one else could get,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat reporter wouldn\u2019t have wanted to go?\u201d\u201cI needed access to people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not supposed to seek access. You\u2019re just supposed to be pure and you go to the person you\u2019re writing about and you write the truth. Nobody can do it totally.\u201d\u201cBut everybody gives up something to be able to do a job, a demanding job,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd being a reporter is a demanding, dangerous job. It may be glamorous or put you in harm\u2019s way. I gave up being considered ethical and acceptable, for a while.\u201dShe moved from Modern Screen to television to Cosmopolitan, along the way contributing to the pseudonymous Cholly Knickerbocker society column in the Hearst newspaper chain. At The Daily News, where she got her first column under her own name in 1976, she took notice of a brash young real estate developer who irked the city\u2019s old-money types but entertained the readers of New York tabloids. Mr. Trump was made for tabloid columns, she said, because he was both ravenous for their attention and gifted at feeding their needs.Ms. Smith especially befriended Ivana Trump, who she thought was being unfairly shunned by high society. When the Trump marriage soured in February 1990, Ms. Smith chose sides cannily.\u201cI was horrified at the way he treated her, and I made the mistake of defending her,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is always fatal for your aspirations to be taken seriously as a reporter. But I had no choice. I had to be nice to them for a while to get access to them. I didn\u2019t particularly approve of them, I didn\u2019t like or dislike them. And I met his whole family and they were charming. So I was swept up in the scandal of Ivana wanting a decent settlement from Donald. And I became a featured player in the story, which I came to regret.\u201d\u201cI just tried to be fair, and most of these other columnists weren\u2019t,\u201d she said of her rivals. \u201cI like to think I was better than them. I\u2019m probably miscalculating.\u201dThe succession of front page stories raised the stakes for gossip, and made the competition for sources more cutthroat, Ms. Adams said. \u201cWe were two tigers trying to cover our turf, I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d she said.Circulation and ratings boomed. With income from her column, syndication and television, Ms. Smith was said to be the highest-paid print journalist in America. When Mr. Trump vowed to buy The News just to fire her, it made her only bigger.But the high did not last. When newspapers started to crash in the first decade of this century, Ms. Smith fell with them, accepting \u201cless money for the privilege of still being printed as a byline,\u201d she said. Until finally, even this came to an end.\u201cMaybe gossip is still amusing, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much fun as it used to be, because it\u2019s now all-pervasive,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone you never knew their name is on the front page, making millions of dollars or going broke, and you never heard of them before. In the past we were able to identify important people and stars.\u201dMs. Adams, who at 87 is still writing a column for The Post, characterized the new gossip as \u201cyoung kids who are out there with their telephones recording what these nonpeople are saying.\u201d She added, \u201cThey\u2019re making it very difficult.\u201dMs. Smith, who appreciates a well-packed phrase, was amused. \u201cHa!\u201d she said.Her regret, she said, was waiting so long. \u201cIt sounded defensive to protest that I thought myself bisexual, like I wouldn\u2019t admit that I was a lesbian. I wasn\u2019t a happy convert to any particular sexual thing. But I eventually got tired of defending myself and said, \u2018Say whatever you like.\u2019\u201dSince breaking her hip a few years ago, Ms. Smith has used a walker to get around. These days she rarely leaves the apartment, except for the occasional Broadway opening. Even dressing up to go to the restaurant on the ground floor is often too much trouble, she said.But she still has stories to tell, she said, even if she is no longer sure that anyone is reading them. \u201cIt\u2019s just the diminution of your name,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural thing to happen. So I began to be forgotten, like the seven newspapers I worked for are forgotten.\u201d\u201cAnd I could give up and commit suicide or just let events take their place,\u201d she added. But she thought she had one last contribution to make \u2014 a reminder, perhaps, of what gossip once was, and a chance to discover who Liz Smith was now. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want any reward,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to get it. But I might get another day of searching.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Liz Smith\u2019s writing collaborator. His name is Denis Ferrara, not Dennis.Advertisement"}

And if they don\u2019t change the galleries right away, they need to at least rotate the collection once in a while so it doesn\u2019t feel like it is a storage area that someone left the door open to.(Mr. Ligon is in the Met\u2019s collection.)Visual ArtistPlaywright, \u201cDisgraced\u201d (Pulitzer Prize, 2013)I remember when MoMA raised the ticket price to $20. And I heard that oddly enough, counterintuitively, admissions went up \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t making enough money to justify spending $20 a ticket. Because of that, I ended up going to the Met more.Fashion commentatorIf the Met could extend into Central Park with an outdoor sculpture garden, it could truly become a destination. There are a couple that come to mind, like the Hakone Open-Air Museum and sculpture park in Japan, or Storm King Art Center upstate. From an engagement perspective, it would be an incredible Instagram opportunity. Oh, there would also have to be a cafe. A kind of groovy al fresco eatery.(Mr. Doonan designed displays for the Met\u2019s \u201cCostumes of Royal India\u201d show.)ComposerI was thinking about my last visit to the Met, showing it off to my parents who haven\u2019t been in town in years. I truly felt like a part of it, and then I walked outside, and my mom\u2019s, like, the David Koch Plaza? What? And it underscores something that a lot of us accept about New York \u2014 the repercussions of conservative old money underwriting culture in the city. In some ways that\u2019s been important, but it\u2019s also continued the direction that a lot of the politics of the country have continued downward. I would urge a new leader of the Met, even if they are not the C.E.O. and if they can\u2019t rename the plaza, to at least show some kind of self-awareness and transparency as a public institution and hold educational programming about sustainability that will have as much of an impact as putting a climate-denier\u2019s name on a plaza.Restaurateur, chefThey have a restaurant in the Met? I would never think to go there to eat. I would say to a friend, let\u2019s go through MoMA, and pop down to Bar Room [at the Modern restaurant] for a drink and a snack. You go to the Whitney, and after that you\u2019ll pop into Untitled. The Met Breuer has Flora, the guys from the Estela [restaurant]. So my first suggestion is: Get a good food program there, whether it\u2019s a fancy, high-end place or not. You have this beautiful rooftop, and you could have a food element there. If you\u2019re going to build a new wing, make sure half of it\u2019s a restaurant by a really good restaurateur. I mean, I\u2019ll do it if they want me to.Another idea: They should have coffee stands throughout with chairs and the tiniest little tables, and a guy with an espresso machine just hanging out. Places where you could actually sit among the El Greco paintings with a little coffee. It would keep you there. It\u2019d be awesome.Professor, ancient Near Eastern art and archaeology, Columbia UniversityOne of the things that I\u2019ve dreamed about \u2014 though maybe it\u2019s just a pipe dream \u2014 is for the Met to create a sister relationship with museums in Iraq and, ultimately, Syria that need to be renovated and restarted. For instance, the Mosul Museum [in Iraq, looted and smashed by the Islamic State] has just been liberated from the ISIS occupation. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if they could partner with American colleagues, even over Skype? That\u2019s one way the Met can contribute its professionalism and expertise to preserving that cultural heritage. And the Met\u2019s own galleries for ancient Near Eastern art could use some spiffing up. Highlighting these galleries with a new installation would bring more attention to the incredibly rich art and architectural traditions of this region. This is more important than ever now, since so much is being deliberately destroyed.(Dr. Bahrani was a curator in the department of ancient Near Eastern art at the Met in the early 1990s and has organized workshops with the Met in Istanbul and Amman.)ArtistI hope the new director will be asking museumgoers, How can we serve you better? Today we have the possibility to reanimate what a museum can look like and expand the idea. A director should have the flexibility to be not just a fund-raiser but to get out, listen, be part of the community. Take a risk, maybe bring a Planned Parenthood office onto your campus. Art history is about context; it\u2019s about the sociopolitical environment that produces art. What environment are we building now, and what will it produce? The museum could be finding creative ways to implement this sustained dialogue.(Mr. Bradford is in the Met\u2019s collection.)Author and sociology professor, City University of New YorkThe Metropolitan Museum is a national treasure, but it\u2019s dependent on the city government and on donations to function, so maybe it\u2019s time to rethink the way an encyclopedic museum works. They have so much work that they can\u2019t show it, and then they try to expand the physical plant. Whatever they do requires them to raise enormous amounts of capital and justify that by getting more visitors. This grow-or-die commandment poses enormous difficulties and burdens on museums and the people who love them. One wild suggestion would be to become more decentralized, like libraries: Break down the Metropolitan Museum experience, officially, and make different hives within the museum, and charge lower admission fees to go into one specific section or another. Another possibility is to send things out of the museum on long-term loans as free installations to democratize access further. That would sure beautify the public schools.Comedian, actor, founder, Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture and IndustryShow more Chicano art! I have always said you can\u2019t love or hate Chicano art unless you\u2019ve seen it. This is a valuable and important school of art that\u2019s being ignored and needs shelf space.Choreographer; artistic director, L.A. Dance ProjectThe Met should be open until midnight twice a week. There should be ambitious site-specific performances, which are broadcast live, and well-programmed concerts. Imagine live music and dance performances in unexpected programs on late nights. The right programming could attract a younger audience and turn the Met into the place to be. The museum also needs two terrific restaurants. There is so much to appreciate in that setting, and no place to dine.Graphic designerOne of the biggest challenges they have is this simple thing called way-finding. You go up those stairs, which is an iconic New York experience, and then you go into grand hall, and it\u2019s like waking up with amnesia in the world\u2019s busiest train station. You forget where you are, and no one\u2019s helping you figure out where you need to go. The museum should reward serendipity to a certain degree, and making unexpected discoveries on the way to whatever you think you were looking for. But people need more help. Curators under the leadership of the new director can figure out how to complement the collection with old-fashioned hand-held paper maps, signs people look for as a matter of course, and new technology like apps and GPS. Now it\u2019s like doing Sudoku in some Martian-based 39-number [counting] system. It just doesn\u2019t seem solvable.Architect and Tony-winning scenic designer; co-author, \u201cSpectacle.\u201dI think about what a kind of formidable structure the building is for kids \u2014 and I take my kids there a lot. It\u2019s interesting to imagine, from a family point of view, about the experience of entering the Met and how to make it more permeable, starting with those incredible steps at the front of the building. It\u2019s one of the great places to hang out \u2014 the \u00fcber-doorstep. Performances at the base of those entry steps could be formalized, something where artists are invited. There are great architectural spaces that aren\u2019t currently used for exhibits proper and could be used as public space in a welcoming way. It\u2019s interesting to think about how to link the backside of the museum to Central Park that might particularly address kids and families \u2014 a secret garden or art path.Museums expert; author, \u201cChaos and Culture\u201d (2017)For me, the Metropolitan Museum is the Louvre of the United States, and frankly I would not reimagine it. I think the Met is exactly right in terms of the curators and programmers it has. But I do think there are changes that could be made. The full board of trustees is way too big. I understand that it\u2019s near to 100 people, and I think that makes it very difficult to manage and get meaningful input. I\u2019ve been told by people working at the museum that there are a number of people on the board who contribute very little except money. There should be some people on that board who take their participation very seriously on issues at the museum.In terms of the direction being divided between two people, my art friends all say, Who in heaven\u2019s name is going to want that second job if they\u2019re answering to someone else, and if every time they come up with an idea, the money guy is going to say, Oh no, bottom line? This structure has been tried a number of times. It was tried at the Met with Bill [William H.] Luers and Philippe de Montebello. It was tried in Philadelphia, too, when Anne d\u2019Harnoncourt shared responsibility with Robert Scott. In both of those cases, it was a very problematic decision.(Ms. Newhouse was a consultant for the architect search committee for the new modern and contemporary wing in 2016.)Because about 70 percent of curators in the U.S., perhaps even in the world, are women, there\u2019s something bizarre about the fact that the Met has never had a woman director. Appointing a woman would be important from a symbolic perspective, but it\u2019s also important that they pick a woman who thinks deeply about the museum and its role in the culture. A person who simply bemoans the numbers and the fact that change isn\u2019t occurring quickly enough is not the answer. The question is why art by women continues to be \u201cwomen\u2019s art,\u201d not just \u201cart.\u201dIt would also be great if there were some rooms that had fewer paintings. Psychologically it would make you look at art differently. Right now, the pieces are all placed more or less at the same height, and the same distance apart. It\u2019s monotonous. Maybe if they could kind of change the permanent collection up and give more importance to a Courbet, or some other small painting, it would allow you to sit and look at it. You\u2019re talking to someone who moves their art up and down as a hobby. I nail and then unnail things all the time. In my next life, I\u2019m going to be a curator.Visual ArtistThey should make a conscious effort to feature more art by women and to take more chances. They shouldn\u2019t wait until someone has been around for 20 years. I have a vested interest in work that\u2019s sexual, and political. The Met should have a show called \u201cThe History of Political Art.\u201d They could start with Goya and then move on to K\u00e4the Kollwitz [1867\u20131945], and political art that deals with the Vietnam War \u2014 and art that deals with AIDS. They could put the sexual political stuff, the feminists and L.G.B.T.Q. artists, on display. Donald Trump is on everyone\u2019s mind, and it\u2019s important to address this issue at this moment.Artist and a founder of For Freedoms, an artist-run \u2018super PAC\u2019The Met and the American Museum of Natural History really set the tone for how visitors understand history and culture. The organization of a museum helps create those narratives. At the Met, if you walk in and go to the left, you have Greece and Rome and beyond that, Africa. And to the right, you have Egypt. And the question for me is, Where is Egypt? Oh yeah, I think Egypt\u2019s in Africa. If the Met\u2019s trying to be objective, objectively Egypt should be closer to Africa.A lot of students learn about history through art, and the narrative of anything related to Africa and Polynesia and indigenous America is still laden with this notion of primitivism. And if I\u2019m a kid in the Met, I wouldn\u2019t really see an acknowledgment that Egypt, one of the foundations of civilization and of modern intellectual life, was part of Africa and that Egyptians had a range of skin tones, but they definitely didn\u2019t look like Elizabeth Taylor. The excision of Egypt from Africa has been so successful \u2014 has there ever been a movie made with Africans playing Egyptians? The responsibility of museums is to correct those narratives and explain: What did those people really look like? What was their art like?(Mr. Thomas has organized public programs with the education department at the Met.)Additional interviews by Robin Pogrebin, Hilarie M. Sheets, Roslyn Sulcas, Michael Walker.

She said she grew up eating malawach made by her mother, who is Peruvian and Israeli. \u201cIt was such a weekend treat.\u201dAt Kismet, the malawach is called \u201cflaky bread.\u201d It comes as a part of what is essentially a meal-size dessert, served with labneh (thick yogurt made with kefir cultures), preserved lemon and honey, or as part of a savory dish, again with labneh but accompanied this time by a soft-boiled egg, zhoug (a spicy, garlicky condiment) and crushed tomatoes. The labneh is made in-house, and the zhoug is from a recipe Ms. Kramer credits to the mother of her father\u2019s best friend.\u201cWe can put it on the menu year-round because we always have tomatoes,\u201d Ms. Kramer said. \u201cBeing able to do that here is amazing.\u201d\u201cNew York grinds you down in a lot of ways,\u201d Ms. Kramer said. \u201cNew York is also the most awesome place in the world, but, if you grow up there and do not have an experience elsewhere, you could not appreciate it as much as you really should.\u201dSitting inside Kismet, it\u2019s easy to appreciate the appeal of being in Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "The Gang Murders in the Long Island Suburbs", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "Four young Latino men went to hang out in the woods on Long Island one night during spring break. They ended up victims of the brutal gang MS-13.Supported byThe bodies were discovered in the woods behind a soccer field in a middle-class suburban town on Long Island. It was the middle of April, during spring break for the local high schools. Three students and a cousin visiting from out of state had been hacked to death by machete, the telltale weapon of the savage MS-13 gang.They were all young Latino men. And they were the latest victims of La Mara Salvatrucha (as it is known in Spanish), a street gang originally founded in Los Angeles in the late 1980s and active throughout El Salvador, Honduras and cities across the United States.On Long Island, MS-13 has been around for decades, but it has surfaced with a vengeance in the last 18 months, responsible for 17 murders, the Suffolk County police say. So far, federal officials have charged suspects in only three of the killings, including the murder in September of two teenage girls from Brentwood, N.Y., Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens.The presence of MS-13 is a frightful reality for immigrant families who escaped the same violence in their home countries, even as the recent deaths have turned into a flash point on illegal immigration. Lost in the debate were the lives of four young men just trying to find their way in America.The four seemed to have no obvious connection to MS-13; most had gone out of their way to avoid the gang.Justin Llivicura, 16, was born into an Ecuadorean immigrant family in East Patchogue. He worked at a local restaurant with Jorge Tigre, 18, who had come to the United States from Ecuador at age 10.Michael Lopez Banegas, 20, had fled gang violence in Honduras three years ago, reuniting with his parents in Brentwood. Michael\u2019s 18-year-old cousin Jefferson Villalobos also escaped Honduras around the same time; he settled with his parents in South Florida. Jefferson was on Long Island visiting Michael and his family for spring vacation, arriving on a Friday. The cousins were dead by the following Wednesday.Michael\u2019s father, Carlos Lopez, said he hoped the police were close to finding the killers so that his family would finally learn the motivation behind the horror. The police said they had been aggressively rounding up known gang members, making 220 arrests since September.Meanwhile, it has become clear in pockets of Long Island that even the most casual actions of teenagers \u2014 smoking marijuana, wearing the wrong color T-shirt or showing disrespect \u2014 can have severe consequences. All because they are within reach of the indiscriminate arm of MS-13.The Suffolk County police commissioner, Timothy D. Sini, would not discuss specifics of the investigation, but said that for MS-13, violence was both a means and an end.\u201cWhen the gang feels slighted, they will use violence to address it,\u201d Mr. Sini said. \u201cWhen they feel that someone is not following gang rules, they will use violence to address it. Frankly, when they don\u2019t like someone, they will come up with a reason to use violence against them.\u201dThe wave of migration to the United States from Central America hit its peak in 2014, when children made the dangerous trek alone to escape gang violence in their home countries. Michael and Jefferson, cousins who grew up in Santa Rita, a small town in northwestern Honduras, took the journey separately that year.Jefferson had survived a drive-by gang shooting in Santa Rita. Michael had seen friends die at the hands of the gang there. Their parents, already living and working in the United States, sent for them.\u201cIt was when things were very bad there,\u201d said Jefferson\u2019s father, Francis Villalobos, who has lived in Pompano Beach, Fla., north of Fort Lauderdale, for 19 years. \u201cMy mother told me: \u2018You\u2019d better take him. The gangs are recruiting. He needs to go so that he doesn\u2019t get into one.\u2019\u201dWhen they crossed the border, arriving as unaccompanied minors, they spent about a month in detention centers in Texas before the government released them to their parents. Both cousins applied for asylum.Jefferson enrolled at Deerfield Beach High School on Florida\u2019s southeast coast. He starred on the school soccer team and played with several club teams, even earning money now and then from teams in need of a talented defender.Jefferson did not like school, so in his senior year he left to work with his father cleaning windows in Miami.In April, the family took a trip to Long Island to visit Jefferson\u2019s uncle Jaime Villalobos. Jaime is married to Michael\u2019s aunt and lives on the top floors of a house in Brentwood. Michael and his parents lived on the ground floor.Michael arrived in Brentwood when he was 17, in April 2014. He had not seen his mother since he was 5; his father, since he was 1. He had never met his youngest brother, Josu\u00e9, 6.His parents both worked, his father repairing escalators at Pennsylvania Station, his mother, Lourdes Banegas, as a house cleaner. In the months after Michael arrived, he also found a job, working at a Key Food supermarket in Farmingville. With chubby cheeks and an endearing smile, he was something of a ladies\u2019 man, according to his family, who noted that several former girlfriends traveled to his memorial service. At Key Food, he fell in love with a co-worker named Fabiola.That fall, Michael entered Brentwood High School, one of 4,624 unaccompanied minors who have enrolled in the Brentwood school district in the past three years, according to the police. The district has 20,000 students.Michael told his girlfriend\u2019s mother, Irma, that he was uncomfortable with the gang presence in the hallways at school. Wanting to be close to Fabiola and to remove himself from Brentwood, Michael transferred to Sachem High School East, in Farmingville, according to Irma, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. He lived for a time in their home in Farmingville. (Fabiola and Michael eventually broke up but stayed friends, Irma said.)Michael would discover that his new school had virtually the opposite ethnic makeup as his old school. Brentwood is 80 percent Latino. At Sachem, more than 80 percent of the student body is white. In the very obvious minority there, the Latino students tended to stick together, Irma said. On Michael\u2019s first day of school, he met a boy named Alex Ruiz, who had recently arrived from El Salvador.Alex would be with Michael and the other boys on the night they died. According to several people involved, Alex managed to escape from the woods, though attempts to confirm that with Alex, through text message, Facebook and phone, were unsuccessful. Much of the account of what happened that night is based on what Michael\u2019s father and Irma said he told them.According to Irma, Alex knew gang signs and taught them to Michael. But Michael insisted that he never wanted to join the gang. That was what he was escaping back home, he kept telling her.It was through Alex that Michael and his cousin Jefferson hooked up that night with Justin Llivicura and Jorge Tigre, two other boys who lived across Suffolk County in the Ecuadorean enclave in Patchogue.Jorge was the fourth of six children. His father had been deported from the United States to Ecuador because he was convicted of domestic violence against his mother, Bertha Ullaguari.Ms. Ullaguari worked as a house cleaner, and Jorge frequently helped her. \u201cSometimes I would ask him to cook or mop or sweep or wash dishes, and he did it all,\u201d she said in a phone interview on the day of her son\u2019s funeral.Last fall, Jorge posted on his Facebook page that he was named an honor student at Bellport High School. But by the winter, according to teachers at the school, he had stopped going to classes.His older brother, William Tigre, 21, said in interviews in April that Jorge was not a member of MS-13 but had friends who were. William said then that his brother had tried to get away from MS-13, and his mother said that gang members had slashed the tires of his car in the weeks before the killings. His sister, Monica, maintained that the tires were slashed not because he was avoiding the gang, but because other boys were jealous of his car.Around the time Jorge stopped going to school, Justin Llivicura did the same. Justin was a sophomore, and his parents said they were concerned about his absences.\u201cI asked if anyone was threatening him; he said no, no one was threatening him, he just didn\u2019t like school,\u201d his mother, Blanca Zhicay, who immigrated from Ecuador 25 years ago, said in Spanish. \u201cI even went to the school to ask if he had any problems with anyone in school. But they assured me he didn\u2019t.\u201dMs. Zhicay said Justin, her only son and oldest child, was devoted to his family. He was an aspiring D.J. who performed for family and friends. Since he did not have a car, Jorge often drove him to D.J. gigs.Michael and Jefferson spent the day of April 11 working with Michael\u2019s father installing fiberglass insulation. By 8 p.m., Mr. Lopez said, the boys were exhausted from the day\u2019s work and were resting at home. He left for his night job, assuming the cousins would stay in.But Michael, never one to turn down a social outing, had previously told Irma that he planned to go out on Tuesday with friends. He did not give details.That same night, Justin asked his mother for permission to go into Manhattan to a party, where he told her there would be celebrities. It would be good for his budding career as a D.J. She said no.But when Ms. Zhicay checked on Justin in his room around 9:30 that evening, he was gone. One of Justin\u2019s sisters told her that she saw a car pick him up.Irma would later learn that it was Jorge who picked up Justin, and that Alex was also in the car. They drove 25 minutes west to pick up Michael and Jefferson in Brentwood.A neighbor saw Michael and Jefferson get into a car around 10 p.m., Mr. Lopez said.From there, according to Mr. Lopez and Irma, they picked up two girls in Central Islip. The seven squeezed into the small car and ended up at the soccer fields opposite the Central Islip Recreation Village complex. In the tradition of suburban teenagers, they were, according to Irma, going to smoke marijuana in the woods.Mr. Lopez and Irma said Alex told them what happened next. After a few minutes of sitting in the woods, Michael saw people approaching wearing masks, and he asked Alex if he thought they were members of MS-13. Alex said he was not sure.The people surrounded them and forced the boys to kneel. Alex managed to flee. What happened to the two girls from Central Islip remains unclear.Sometime after 11 p.m., Irma got a call, but she was sleeping and didn\u2019t listen to the message until early the next morning. It was from Alex: \u201cCheck on Michael.\u201d Jorge\u2019s brother, William, said he also got a phone call from Alex, which translated to: \u201cI see your brother, he is getting killed.\u201dOn the morning of April 12, Michael and Jefferson still had not come home.Irma spoke with Alex, who told her that he last saw Michael in the woods. She told Michael\u2019s father that, and he related it to Jefferson\u2019s father, who immediately suspected the worst. \u201cThey killed them,\u201d Mr. Villalobos said then.After several frantic phone calls trying to determine where the boys had last been, Irma and the boys\u2019 fathers followed a GPS signal coming from Jefferson\u2019s phone; Jefferson\u2019s mother back in Florida had tracked it through his Facebook page.When they got to the park, they flagged down a Suffolk County police officer on patrol and told him about the missing boys. They said a cellphone signal led beyond the fields, into the woods. Instead of checking it out, Michael\u2019s father said, the officer told them to submit a missing person\u2019s report.Michael\u2019s father said they picked up Alex to press him for more information, and after a brief stop at the park, they headed to the Third Precinct station house in Brentwood. Alex refused to enter, Mr. Lopez said.Carlos Lopez Jr., Michael\u2019s 25-year-old brother, soon pulled into the parking lot of the police station. He encountered Alex there and persuaded him to show him where he had last seen Michael. They went back to the park and then into the woods.Several minutes later, Carlos Jr. called his father, who was still at the police station. \u201cDad,\u201d he said, \u201cI found Michael \u2014 dead.\u201dMr. Lopez said he broke down among the officers at the police station. \u201cThat\u2019s when they believed us,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s when they took action.\u201dLater that morning, a video had surfaced, sent to Justin\u2019s girlfriend; it showed the four lying dead on the ground in the woods. Justin\u2019s mother said that when she first saw the video, she recognized her son from his clothing. The police, she said, would not allow her or her husband to view Justin\u2019s mutilated body.\u201cWe\u2019re in possession of the video, and we know its origins,\u201d was all Commissioner Sini would say.He would not confirm any details of the parents\u2019 account of the night, saying it would hinder the investigation.Weeks after the murders, Ms. Zhicay, Justin\u2019s mother, said she was anxious for closure. \u201cSometimes I think if it had been an American boy, that they would be moving heaven and earth, but since they are Latino boys with Latino parents \u2026\u201d she said, her voice trailing off.The police commissioner denied that that was the case. \u201cWe will solve the crime,\u201d he said.Just 16 days after Michael, Jefferson, Jorge and Justin were found dead, Attorney General Jeff Sessions arrived in Central Islip to hold a news conference vowing to shut down MS-13. He said gang members had been exploiting the government program for unaccompanied minors, some sneaking into the country undetected to be placed with guardians.Those who are not already gang members are vulnerable to the strong-arm recruiting efforts of MS-13 in the county, law enforcement agents said.Schools on Long Island have witnessed a remarkable population change with the influx of these young immigrants. In the past several years, MS-13 seems to have a stronger presence at Bellport High School, where Jorge and Justin attended, said Wayne White, president of the teachers\u2019 association. MS-13 graffiti has showed up in bathrooms and other places hidden from surveillance cameras.When classes resumed from spring break, Mr. White said, the school held an assembly and observed a moment of silence for Jorge and Justin. But the pause was punctured by some students clapping and high-fiving.Later that month and early in May, three immigrant teenagers were suspended from Bellport High School for suspicion of gang involvement, but their lawyer, Peter Brill, said they were wrongly accused, according to a report by Newsday. Because of that, he said, one of the boys is detained in Virginia, headed for deportation.\u201cThe fear is that our clients fled South and Central America because their lives had been threatened by actual MS-13 members,\u201d Mr. Brill said in an interview. \u201cAnd if they are going to be deported for not being MS-13, but perceived as gang members, they will be deported to a country where their lives will be in immediate jeopardy.\u201dMichael\u2019s father had vaguely been aware of gang activity when he brought his son to Brentwood. But he figured it was isolated and that Michael could avoid it.Michael\u2019s room, painted the blue of the Honduran flag, has become a shrine. On his bed, his mother laid out his favorite pink sweatshirt, with a design of French fries, a hamburger and a soda on the chest. His soccer cleats and karaoke machine are still in the corner.In the hallway, under his framed grade-school pictures from Honduras, there is a rough spot of hastily applied plaster. Michael\u2019s older brother had punched a hole in the wall in anguish after finding him dead.At the memorial service in Miami for Jefferson, he lay in an open coffin. His head bore bracing injuries, obscured only partly by makeup. The socket of his right eye was stuffed with a white cotton ball.That day, his father ducked into a quiet office to speak briefly of Jefferson. He wore a T-shirt with a picture of his son smiling in the clouds.As he talked about the senseless cruelty of his son having escaped gang violence in Honduras only to die from it in the United States, he was somber and resigned. \u201cNo one,\u201d he said, \u201cis safe anywhere.\u201dArielle Dollinger contributed reporting from Central Islip, N.Y., and Nick Madigan and Frances Robles from Miami.

At our request, Mr. Malik and Ms. Versace exchanged emails about the collection, which includes zip-up bombers, distressed jeans and brash logo T-shirts.The LatestAt the June men\u2019s wear shows in the fashion capitals of Europe, one designer after another trotted out clothing inspired by American work wear. Junya Watanabe, a longtime reinventor of classic American garb, showcased a collection filled with jackets, trousers and coats made in collaboration with the Michigan label Carhartt, while Herm\u00e8s featured uniform-like jackets and chinos detailed with work-wear stitching.A considerably less expensive way to get in on the work-wear trend is to bypass the luxury fashion houses and go straight to one of the sources: for instance, Earl\u2019s Apparel, a label from Texas.\u201cFashion is becoming more influenced by the story behind what one wears, not so much just the appearance of the garments,\u201d said Larry Beard, who runs Earl\u2019s Apparel with his siblings.In 1972, Mr. Beard\u2019s grandfather Earl started the company with the purpose of producing comfortable and durable clothing for workers. One appealing staple is a pair of carpenter pants from Stan Ray, a brand under the Earl\u2019s umbrella that has been around since the 1980s.\u201cPeople want something genuine with a past and a story,\u201d Mr. Beard said.DorkyIn recent seasons, labels like Prada and Gucci have offered versions of an item once considered unfashionable: the sandal. And Birkenstock, the brand that made its name with hippie-approved footwear, stepped into the spotlight with a presentation and party at last month\u2019s men\u2019s fashion week in Paris.Another sandal making its way down the runway lately is the Mexican huarache. Malibu Sandals, a California company, has come up with new takes on this shoe in collaboration with the Italian brand Missoni.

The designer Nick Wakeman started Studio Nicholson in 2010 with a line of minimalist essentials for women, inspired in part by Japanese design and architecture. Now Ms. Wakeman is applying her ethos to men\u2019s wear, with a range of everyday clothes from oversize coats to peg-legged trousers.\u201cAll the men in my life get dressed in a very specific way,\u201d Ms. Wakeman said. \u201cThey have a narrative, a story, a character in their head when putting things together.

{"Headline": "My Adventures in Accountability", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionNashville \u2014 I stood in the middle of a forest and whisper-screamed a word that cannot be printed in this newspaper.For the second time in one morning, I was on a wooded park trail. The first time, I\u2019d decided to cram in a minihike before doing an hour of writing and then heading to a meeting for my job. Then I got home, checked my pockets and found that my driver\u2019s license had gone missing. So back I went, hiking the same route a second time, eyes scanning the ground for my lost card. An hour later, there I was under the trees, still no license, my precious hour of writing time gone. This is what I get for trying to exercise, I thought. Later I ate a packet of gummy fruit snacks in my car on the way to my meeting.I reported this episode to my various accountability groups \u2014 sets of friends who check in on a daily or weekly basis to hold one another\u2019s feet to the fire of various goals. There\u2019s the fitness group; I\u2019m supposed to check in with those friends weekly about how many days I\u2019ve worked out. There\u2019s the healthy eating group, in which we keep a text thread circulating to log accomplishments such as \u201cDrank green juice instead of Diet Coke.\u201d Then there\u2019s the writing group, five nonfiction writers who also have day jobs. We meet weekly before work and use a private Facebook page to hold one another to our pledge not to let our creative endeavors get pushed aside.Personally, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not an elected official or chief executive, because I can\u2019t take any more accountability. I\u2019ve brought it on myself, of course. But the more people and forces I have to answer to, the more \u201cheld accountable\u201d starts to feel like \u201cheld underwater.\u201d Some days I want to spend an afternoon online looking at pictures of dogs with eyebrows, and I don\u2019t want to have to report it to anyone. Some nights I want to spend $9.99 to buy a movie on demand even though I could wait a week and rent it for $2.99, and I want to revel in that foolish splurge by myself.As it is, I find I can clear the bar for only one accountability group at a time. As an approval-seeking person, I always want a gold star. But to achieve one thing generally means letting go of another. I can write, but only \u2014 as they say \u2014 by putting my butt in the chair. If my butt is in the chair, my butt is not outside walking. I skip checking in with my hiking buddies on those days, but not because I want to hide from them. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m already a little downtrodden from having to report to my healthy eating group: \u201cUnwrapped seven slices of American cheese for lunch.\u201dSo I play a shell game of approval. Today my writing group won\u2019t be proud of me, but my healthy living group will. Tomorrow I will admit to eating a bowl of my kids\u2019 sugary cereal for breakfast, but I will also gloat over having pushed the bowl aside when I finished and stayed in that seat, building and demolishing and rebuilding paragraphs for three hours.As if kids and accountability groups weren\u2019t oversight enough, there are always Facebook and Instagram to help you feel the duty to measure up. Everything online is quantified, tallied up in hearts and upturned thumbs. If a woman posts a picture of the sparkling sunrise over her morning yoga session, she\u2019s publicly delivering on her commitment to meditative stretching. When a pair of doting dads posts a photo of their twins on their shoulders at the farmers\u2019 market, they\u2019re proving they\u2019ve achieved optimum levels of family fun. Meanwhile, over at my house, the kids sat on the sofa with headphones on for over an hour this afternoon because I was on the phone trying to finish an interview and I needed quiet. I will not post that. I don\u2019t want it to count.Sometimes I feel ill-equipped to do all this accounting. There are days, even weeks, that I don\u2019t check in with my groups, even though, of course, I have voluntarily joined them. I pull back when I feel the tail is wagging the dog, that I\u2019m putting more energy into my anxiety over reporting what I\u2019ve done than I would have put into simply doing it.Ultimately, accountability is optional. I could leave my groups and cut myself loose from the commitment to document how I use my time, but I\u2019m self-aware enough to realize I need that sense of obligation.Knowing someone\u2019s going to ask whether I met my goals has often made me get up and do what I might otherwise have blown off, and I have better health, more pages written and \u2014 yes \u2014 greater happiness to show for it. The encouragement helps, too. When I lost my writing time (but doubled my exercise!) that morning in the park, my friends offered commiseration and congratulations.That\u2019s another reason I won\u2019t quit: I feel too keenly the need to use my minutes wisely. They\u2019re going by much too fast.How have you tried to hold yourself accountable? Has it worked? Let us know in the comments. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Site of Scopes Trial, Darrow Statue Belatedly Joins Bryan\u2019s", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDayton JournalDAYTON, Tenn. \u2014 A statue of Clarence Darrow appeared in front of the historic red brick courthouse here this week, just within spitting distance of the banner for the Scopes Bluegrass Festival and its logo featuring a banjo-picking chimpanzee.Some have taken grave offense at the addition. After all, Darrow, an agnostic and the most famous lawyer of his day, was the man who lost the famous Scopes \u201cmonkey trial\u201d at the Rhea County Courthouse in 1925, though not before denouncing what he called the \u201cfool ideas\u201d of biblical literalism. Since 2005, a statue of Darrow\u2019s sparring partner at the trial, the orator William Jennings Bryan, has graced the courthouse lawn.At a County Commission meeting here on Tuesday, a resident named Ruth Ann Wilson suggested that the $150,000 statue of Darrow, being funded by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, might unleash a local plague or a curse.\u201cI rise in opposition to this atheist statue, all right?\u201d she said. \u201cThis is very serious, folks.\u201dAnd for some reason, there has always been a blithe streak in Dayton in the face of the grand questions of creation over which Darrow and Bryan wrestled as the denizens of the Jazz Age followed along through radio, newsreels and newspapers.During the trial, local merchants, hoping to cash in on the trial publicity, festooned their shops with apes and monkeys, and a local drugstore hawked \u201csimian\u201d sodas, according to \u201cSummer for the Gods,\u201d the historian Edward J. Larson\u2019s 1997 account of the trial. Today, downtown Dayton features the two-year-old Monkey Town Brewing Company, a 7,000-square-foot brewpub that offers a double-dry-hopped Evolution IPA.Brad Putt, the owner of a downtown music store, is among those who say that the statue of Darrow \u2014 sculpted by a Pennsylvania artist, Zenos Frudakis, and designed to stand at about the same height as the Bryan statue \u2014 simply serves to balance the historical record.\u201cPeople around here know that if you have a court case, you have to have two sides,\u201d said Mr. Putt, who fell back on Eastern philosophy and the \u201cTransformers\u201d movies to bolster his case: \u201cYou can\u2019t have Optimus Prime unless you have Megatron. You\u2019ve got to have a yin to the yang.\u201dIn an interview this week at her knickknack store, adorned with paeans to God and country (a current sign reads \u201cDarrow ACLU\u2019s Favorite Communist\u201d), Ms. Griffin predicted that the statue would not last long in the heart of the Bible Belt.\u201cThere are a bunch of people back on the mountain, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m just going to leave them to their devices.\u201dMs. Griffin\u2019s efforts, however, have induced a certain amount of gentle disdain of the bless-her-heart variety, even among some Christians like Mr. Putt. Kirby Garrison, 27, the co-owner of the brewpub, said an unwritten rule in a small town like this was to avoid explosive topics like the intersection of religion and science \u2014 or at least limit them to Facebook.\u201cUnless you really want to spark off a debate, it\u2019s kind of, \u2018Keep it to yourself,\u2019\u201d he said.If Dayton has had more than the normal share of controversy over the last 92 years, it has certainly brought it on itself. Its civic leaders, in an effort to raise the city\u2019s public profile, arranged for Dayton to be the venue for the trial, which civil libertarians hoped would test a state law at the time that banned the teaching of evolution in public schools. They even handpicked John T. Scopes, a teacher, as the defendant.With the aid of Bryan \u2014 a three-time Democratic presidential candidate and staunch defender of traditional Christianity \u2014 the prosecution won its case, but many credit Darrow with landing serious blows against Bryan\u2019s version of biblical inerrancy while examining him on the witness stand. Bryan died in Dayton a few days after the verdict was handed down.Tom Davis is one of a number of Christians in town who are pleased with the new addition. In fact, Mr. Davis, a creationist, was the president of the county historical society when it approved the plans for the project.Mr. Davis is also the main organizer of the yearly Scopes Festival, which for years has featured a play based on the trial that he said aimed to be fair to both Darrow and Bryan. (The bluegrass festival is a new addition to the festivities this year.) A small museum in the courthouse basement also strives for objectivity.While Mr. Davis said he felt threatened by what he saw as creeping secularization, he said the statue did not seem threatening at all.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to oppose a different belief, I\u2019d better understand it,\u201d he said.Among those at the official dedication of the statue Friday morning were Mr. Frudakis, the artist, and Annie Laurie Gaylor, the co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, an atheist group. Ms. Gaylor said in an interview on Wednesday that she would come to town holding no grudges.\u201cIt\u2019s the missing link,\u201d she deadpanned, \u201cin the courthouse display.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Each case carries a different degree of clarity, and what took place can be a matter of perception.That\u2019s where you come in.Have you ever been left wondering whether an experience was racism? What is the right way to respond if something like that happens?By Greg HowardIn New York, so much of my life consists of walking in and through crowds. I am, I think, a good walker. I don\u2019t dawdle, and even when walking at high speeds, I\u2019m courteous \u2014 always willing to sway to one side, change speed in traffic or even take wide berths around large, lost, child-toting or otherwise compromised gaggles of pedestrians.There are many times in a day when a person is walking toward me and in my path. In these situations, we both generally make minor adjustments upon our approach. Sometimes, and especially with pedestrians who are black, as I am, there\u2019s eye contact or even a nod. Almost always, we shift our bodyweight or otherwise detour to make the pass easier for the other. Walking courteously doesn\u2019t take much, just soup\u00e7ons of spatial awareness, foresight and empathy. In seven years of living and walking here, I\u2019ve found that most people walk courteously \u2014 but that white women, at least when I\u2019m in their path, do not.Sometimes they\u2019re buried in their phones. Other times, they\u2019re in pairs and groups, and in conversation. But often, they\u2019re looking ahead, through me, if not quite at me. When white women are in my path, they almost always continue straight, forcing me to one side without changing their course. This happens several times a day; and a couple of times a week, white women force me off the sidewalk completely. In these instances, when I\u2019m standing in the street or in the dirt as a white woman strides past, broad-shouldered and blissful, I turn furious.I turn furious because in these instances I feel small. I always get out of the way, because I was taught at a young age not to bodycheck random people. But I also get out of the way because, as a black man, I\u2019ve learned that bodychecking, bumping or even rubbing against a random white woman can be personally hazardous. So I acknowledge other pedestrians, and reroute. White men and all people of color do the same to me. They offer some form of acknowledgment that we are in each other\u2019s path, that I am there at all.I wonder, too, why I always get out of the way. Why haven\u2019t I ever just walked headlong into a rude white woman? What lessons tug at me, force me off the sidewalk, tell me that my personal space is not necessarily mine? Because explicit in every white woman\u2019s decision not to get out of my way is the expectation that I\u2019ll get out of theirs.A couple of weeks ago, I asked an Asian friend if he had the same experience of white women not getting out of his way. He said no. For whatever reason, white women see him just fine. The people who don\u2019t, he said, are white men.By Lisa GodwinThe company denies categorizing applicants by race but the incident would leave anyone with doubts, especially right after the Jopwell article had appeared. This experience has made me wonder if all candidates seeking employment have the same fair opportunity at getting hired if agencies are categorizing and profiling as such, or am I being contacted only to fill company diversity quotas and not because of my history of accomplishments? I am left puzzled yet inspired.By John EligonKANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 This might seem like just a story about tortilla chips, but I assure you it\u2019s much deeper than that. It is \u2014 I think \u2014 a lesson on racial and cultural alliances.As a black man, I usually feel a deep kinship with other racial minorities, even those who are not black.Sure, there are deep-rooted tensions between black folks and Latinos, and black people and Asians. But I have always felt that our shared struggles in a white-dominated society trumped our differences.But a recent trip to my favorite no-frills Latin American restaurant here has me rethinking this.It\u2019s a place where the chicken tacos are chargrilled to perfection and almost everyone speaks Spanish. My black wife and I are usually the only diners there who are not of Hispanic descent. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve always felt like we belonged \u2014 I even got one of their punch cards that rewards five visits with a free meal.After we ordered our tacos recently, the waitress, unsolicited, told us that they were out of chips and that she therefore could not give us any as they usually do.Yet a short time later, a Latino couple was seated, and their waitress brought them chips. Same thing with another group after that.\u201cHmm,\u201d my wife said, \u201cseems like they fried some more chips.\u201dSo as we were our eating tacos, I asked our waitress if they had chips now. They don\u2019t, she told me, but right at that moment a waitress walked out from kitchen carrying chips for another table. Our waitress\u2019s eyes went wide. She asked her co-worker something about chips in Spanish. (We don\u2019t speak Spanish.)The second waitress responded in Spanish, and the only thing I caught was \u201cun poquito.\u201d Yet our waitress turned back to us and repeated that they were all out of chips.We were now officially baffled, and the staff seemed to be getting nervous. A manager kept coming by our table to check on us, and giving a pained expression at the same time. Our waitress offered us churros. We declined, but she came back offering a different dessert, and we took it.As we were preparing to leave, another party of Latinos showed up, and their waitress brought them \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 chips.Now, the manager standing behind the counter appeared super anxious. He offered me a beer. I declined. He insisted. But I declined again.We honestly didn\u2019t want chips that bad. But what was going on? They offered us free dessert, free beer, but they drew the line at the (cheapest option) chips? That made little sense to me.Had I miscalculated my status at this restaurant and my bond with the fellow racial minorities who ran it? The best theory that we could come up with was that they were running out of chips and wanted to save them for the Latino customers. Being black, we were left out.I went back to the restaurant a few days later and posed that theory to the manager who was there that night, Alex Hernandez.\u201cOh no, no. No. No. No,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said when I asked if our race had anything to do with our not receiving chips. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, discrimination.\u201dWhat happened then?When we arrived, Mr. Hernandez said, the restaurant was out of chips. By the time our food had come out, they had fried more chips. But because we were already eating our tacos, they did not bring us any chips, he said.But what about when I asked the waitress for chips?Mr. Hernandez said that he didn\u2019t know why she did not bring us chips, and that if he had known that we wanted them, he would have brought them to us. At the same time, however, he said that he had offered me the beer because he felt bad that it had taken a long time for our food to come out (it was a really busy night) and because we did not get chips. But if he did not know that we wanted chips, why did he feel bad about that?Mr. Hernandez did not really have an answer, other than to reiterate that he felt bad for us and that if we would have asked him for chips, he would have brought them. He apologized profusely.The tacos and pupusas I ate satisfied me just fine. I would like to believe that this was nothing more than a misunderstanding, just a case of poor service.Yet I can\u2019t help but wonder now, in the larger universe of racial alliances, how do our teams actually line up?An earlier version of this article overstated what the writer knew about HireTalent\u2019s candidate database. While the writer stated that she believes her receipt of a HireTalent job pitch addressed as \u201cHello Black\u201d meant that each job candidate is categorized by race, HireTalent denies the practice.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a little intimidating.\u201cGoing to a gay beach is crazy intimidating,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s always in my face. One of the best things in the world for a gay man is to go to a straight beach. I would much rather stay at a gay beach, because I like what I am looking at, but to be at a nongay beach, I feel like the hottest dude on the planet.\u201dSpeaking from almost 1,200 miles away, in Minnesota, Casey Peterson, 34, said he had never felt like the hottest man on the planet. Not even close. As an athlete in high school, he played football, basketball and baseball, and even did his turn at wrestling. But still he was stocky. When he applied for the Peace Corps after college, he was initially turned away because of his weight. His doctor had to write a letter saying he was in fine shape.\u201cI would have to tell myself, \u2018I\u2019m not fat,\u2019\u201d Mr. Peterson said of his youthful build. \u201cBut I would ask myself: \u2018Why am I not more defined? Why do I just sort of look thick?\u2019\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t find pants,\u201d said Mr. Peterson, who, at 5 feet 11 inches and 200 pounds, would like to weigh 190. \u201cMy natural waist is a 31, but I have to buy pants that actually fit over my butt and my thighs. So then I am always the guy in baggy pants.\u201dWhen Jamyn Edis, 41, was coming up as a management consultant in London, he watched his older colleagues\u2019 stomachs loom large over their Savile Row suits as they smoked cigars in their offices. He told himself he would never be one of those men \u2014 and for the most part, he hasn\u2019t been. He has competed in three marathons and one triathlon. But that led to foot and shoulder surgeries and even a spinal fusion procedure. And then there\u2019s the weight.At 6-foot-2 and 195 pounds, Mr. Edis, the chief executive and a founder of the smart-car start-up Dash, cuts an impressive figure to other people. But when he takes off his black V-neck T-shirt, he can see the extra pounds (he would like to be down to 185). And he is not fine with it.\u201cThe question is, what am I going to do about it?\u201d Mr. Edis said over lunch at Market Table on Carmine Street.As with others, Mr. Edis, who said he weighed himself at most four times a year, may not have much say in the outcome. The extreme exercise he endured in his 20s and 30s has limited how far he can physically push himself these days. In 2015, his doctor told him to stop running.\u201cI think this is where the irritation has less to do with 10 to 15 pounds and more to do with knowing I am losing control of my body,\u201d Mr. Edis said, \u201cthrough age, not control of choices that I can make anymore.\u201dKirk Read, a 58-year-old professor of French and Francophone studies at Bates College in Lewiston, Me., summed up how he felt about being five pounds away from his ideal weight with one word: failure.\u201cIn every other aspect of my life, I know what to do,\u201d Dr. Read said. \u201cI follow my little plan. I make a list. I check them off. People are happy. And I move forward. This is one where it\u2019s just me and my will. And it\u2019s embarrassing to me that, in this aspect of my life, I don\u2019t have control.\u201dMuch of that has to do with what he described as a \u201cchubby\u201d boyhood. Dr. Read, who weighs 205 pounds, recoils at the memories of shirts-and-skins football games.He said that in his teenage years, shopping for jeans was traumatizing. After he tried several options with no luck, his mother decided the best solution was to buy some denim and make a pair for him herself. When another boy at school realized that his jeans were homemade, Dr. Read was embarrassed.In time, he stretched out to more than six feet. But his work often takes him to Paris, that city of fashion and cruelty.\u201cI\u2019ve actually had a French saleswoman say, \u2018You are enormous,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you say: \u2018Thank you very much. Are you trying to shun me out of the store?\u2019 Over there, I\u2019m just surrounded by people who make me feel like I don\u2019t want to be the enormous guy walking into the store.\u201dDr. Read said he sees the role played by his own vanity in all this. Unlike many academics, he likes to dress up. And he feels better when he looks thinner and healthier.Standing on the scale recently, he said he asked himself: \u201cWhat would it be like to weigh 200 pounds, or even 199? How would it feel?\u201d\u201cI know men in my life who stride through the world with confidence, even if they have a little paunch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell they\u2019re not holding in their gut, which I do most of the time. That\u2019s a natural pose for me.\u201cI assume they feel attractive and sexy,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey exude self-confidence. That\u2019s a place I would love to get to. Because I\u2019m not fat. I\u2019m corpulent. In some ways, that feels worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn making the announcement, Mr. Putin said Russia had run out of patience waiting for relations with the United States to improve.Mr. Putin said the staff reduction was meant to cause real discomfort for Washington and its representatives in Moscow.\u201cOver 1,000 employees \u2014 diplomats and technical workers \u2014 worked and continue to work today in Russia; 755 will have to stop this activity,\u201d he said.\u201cThat is biting,\u201d Mr. Putin added.The measures were the harshest such diplomatic move since a similar rupture in 1986, in the waning days of the Soviet Union.Washington\u2019s response on Sunday was muted. \u201cThis is a regrettable and uncalled-for act,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. \u201cWe are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it.\u201dMr. Putin has denied any Russian interference in the American election, saying that anti-Russian sentiment in the United States was being used to drive an internal political battle.He said it was important not to let actions like the new sanctions go unanswered.Despite the sweeping size of the reduction, ordered to take effect by Sept. 1, it seemed that Mr. Putin had not entirely abandoned the idea of better ties with Mr. Trump.Analysts noted that diplomatic reductions are among the simplest countermeasures possible. And in making the announcement, Mr. Putin noted at length areas where the United States could continue or expand their cooperation, including space rockets, de-escalating the war in Syria and the long history of shared oil projects.\u201cIt is the least painful response that Russia could have come up with,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, a foreign affairs analyst and columnist. \u201cYou can scale them up and scale them down.\u201dAnalysts also considered the timing of Mr. Putin\u2019s action important, coming after Congress adopted expanded sanctions but before Mr. Trump signed them into law.Russia does have additional options to pressure American interests, Mr. Putin warned, without going into details. \u201cI hope it will not come to this,\u201d he said.The number of American targets inside Russia for Kremlin retaliation is limited, particularly if Moscow is worried about damaging the investment climate or about other economic fallout just as it recovers from a recession.Outside its borders, however, is a different matter. Moscow might have shown some restraint in eastern Ukraine or in Syria because of the expectation of more favorable relations with Washington, but now, the Kremlin may be looking for places to challenge the United States.Although the initial news alerts in Russia said that Mr. Putin had ordered 755 Americans out of the country, he had actually ordered an overall staff reduction. Part of the confusion stemmed from the fact that Mr. Putin used a Russian verb that can mean to \u201cpack up,\u201d when referring to his action.In making the initial announcement on Friday, Russia said that the American diplomatic staff would have to be reduced to 455, matching the number of Russians employed at diplomatic missions in the United States. Russia also seized two diplomatic compounds, a warehouse and a bucolic enclave used for barbecues, which mirrored the United States\u2019 seizing of two country estates in December that it said were used for espionage.Mr. Putin had made no secret of the fact that he hoped Mr. Trump would return the estates as a friendly gesture when the two met in Hamburg, but that did not happen. The American government has said the Russian properties it closed were not just recreational areas, but used for intelligence gathering.The bulk of the 755 dismissed are likely to be Russian employees of the embassy in Moscow, as well from the American consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok.The United States Embassy in Moscow has declined to specify the number of people on its payroll in Russia, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has also refused to say how it arrived at its count, but the numbers seemed to indicate that there are around 1,200 people employed.It is not clear how many Americans could be expelled, if any.Unlike Russian diplomatic missions in the United States, which tend not to hire Americans, the United States employs hundreds of Russians at the embassy who do tasks like translation, processing visa applications, cooking and driving.\u201cThey will have to fire the Russian citizens,\u201d Mr. Frolov said. \u201cIt will create an enormous inconvenience for the U.S. Mission here, essentially slowing down the work but not affecting its core functions.\u201dOn Friday, the United States Embassy issued a short statement in which the departing American ambassador, John F. Tefft, expressed \u201chis strong disappointment and protest\u201d over the cuts, which mirror one of the largest tit-for-tat expulsions of the Cold War.In August 1986, the United States arrested Gennadi F. Zakharov, a physicist who was a Soviet employee of the United Nations, on espionage charges. A week later, Nicholas S. Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was arrested in Moscow on espionage charges.That started an intense round of expulsions, with the Russians ordering the American diplomatic missions down to 251 people, the same number they had in the United States at that time.The strict quota system was abandoned under a new treaty in 1992 after the Soviet Union collapsed.It remains to be seen whether the expulsions on both sides could escalate or stop at the current figures.An earlier version of this article overstated the action announced on Sunday by President Vladimir V. Putin. He said that the American diplomatic mission in Russia would have to reduce its staff, he did not say that diplomats would be expelled. The overstatement stemmed from a translation of Mr. Putin\u2019s use of a Russian verb, which can mean to \u201cpack up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Only then was he told why: He stood accused of leading an anti-army information campaign on Twitter.Dr. Ranjha is one of dozens of people arrested and investigated since January for their social media use, under the sweeping cybercrimes law passed by Parliament last year.Civil rights advocates, as well as people directly targeted by the authorities, have described actions that included harassment, intimidation, and detention without access to lawyers or family members. In a few cases, physical abuse of those in custody was reported.More subtly, the campaign has also injected a distinct chill into a Pakistani social media scene long known for boldness and rollicking satire.Dr. Ranjha insisted that he had never crossed any explicit line with his posts.\u201cI\u2019ve never been part of any anti-army campaign,\u201d Dr. Ranjha said in a telephone interview from his home in the Gujranwala District of Punjab Province. \u201cBut yes, my tweets definitely give the impression that democracy in Pakistan is very weak because it is not being allowed to grow stronger, to flourish.\u201dHe was freed on May 22 after two days of questioning. But his devices have not been returned, and the Federal Investigation Agency took control of his Twitter account to make it inaccessible.Under the electronic crimes law, investigations are carried out by the Federal Investigation Agency. The agency says it does not monitor, but only follows up on complaints from the Interior Ministry or, more often, from the military and its feared spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, or I.S.I.\u201cMonitoring is not our mandate; we get complaints from the interior minister and mostly our intelligence agencies about certain social media profiles, and then we investigate,\u201d said Muhammad Shafique, the head of the F.I.A.\u2019s cybercrime section. \u201cThere is coordination between civilian and military agencies; we work together.\u201dAn Interior Ministry spokesman said all questions about continuing investigations under the cybercrime law should be directed to the Federal Investigation Agency. An I.S.I. spokesman did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.The number of investigations, and sometimes arrests and fines, began increasing soon after the law\u2019s passage in August 2016. But it was a series of disappearances in January outside the normal workings of the law that greatly increased public fears and outrage over what was increasingly perceived as an unjust crackdown on public expression.Four of the five have since returned home. Three promptly left Pakistan. But Samar Abbas, the president of Civil Progressive Alliance Pakistan, a rights group based in Karachi, is still missing.No state agency has accepted responsibility for holding the five men. The army\u2019s media office and the Interior Ministry denied involvement in separate news conferences in January.Three of these activists were administrators of a popular satirical Facebook page called Mochi. The cover photo for the page reads: \u201cWe respect Armed Forces of Pakistan as much as they respect the constitution of Pakistan.\u201dOne Mochi administrator, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fears for his family, said he was subjected to torture during his three weeks in I.S.I. custody. The wife of another activist who disappeared in January said that since his return, he had remained so traumatized that he shied away from even his children, and remained mostly shut in his room. She requested that specifics about his case not be published to protect her family\u2019s identity.Another activist who disappeared was Salman Haider, a well-known poet now in exile in the United States. Mr. Haider declined to comment for this article, but shared a harrowing poem about his fear of death while in confinement, and such degradations as being made to use the same bottle to urinate in and drink water from.Rights activists say that the episode gave authorities renewed confidence to go after dissenters ever more openly, culminating in a public announcement in May by the interior minister that criticism of the security forces was forbidden and would be punished.\u201cOfficials now realized what an excellent tool they had in their hands to control political expression,\u201d said Mr. Ahmad of Bytes for All Pakistan.Mr. Shafique, the head of the Federal Investigation Agency\u2019s cybercrime section, would not comment on specific cases. But he made it clear that posts disrespectful of Pakistan\u2019s armed forces would not be tolerated.\u201cFreedom of expression within limits is a right, but using abusive language against sacred institutions \u2014 that makes a crime,\u201d he said.He added that under the cybercrime law, no one could be arrested without \u201csolid technical evidence\u201d retrieved from electronic devices. He called the existing law \u201cvery weak\u201d because it did not even allow the F.I.A. to register a case against an accused person without a court order.\u201cIn our country, social media is more free than it is anywhere else in the world,\u201d Mr. Shafique said. \u201cEveryone can say what they want. Who is scared?\u201dBut the crackdown has definitely raised fears, with many saying they self-censored their posts rather than risk arrest or any threat against their families.And that, Dr. Ranjha said, was almost surely the point.\u201cPicking me up was a way to send a message to others to straighten up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are taken away \u2014 and you don\u2019t know why, or when you\u2019ll come back \u2014 it changes everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Turmoil at U.S.C.", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The report said the former dean, Dr. Carmen Puliafito, led a secret life of wild partying even as he oversaw medical students and professors.Still unclear is what campus officials knew about accusations against Dr. Puliafito, a Harvard-trained eye surgeon whose fund-raising brought in more than $1 billion for the Keck School of Medicine.Citing interviews with associates of Dr. Puliafito as well as videos and photos, The Los Angeles Times chronicled a series of troubling accusations. Among them:\u2022 Dr. Puliafito commonly used hard drugs. At times, he was seen swallowing what was said to be an ecstasy pill and inhaling smoke from a methamphetamine pipe.\u2022 A man who was living in an addiction treatment facility said Dr. Puliafito, a friend of his, had given him meth.\u2022 A woman who worked as a prostitute said she and Dr. Puliafito, who is married, had become \u201cconstant companions\u201d after meeting in 2015.Dr. Puliafito resigned as dean last year not long after the woman, Sarah Warren, overdosed while the pair were at a Pasadena hotel. Yet he continued to serve on the medical school\u2019s faculty.Dr. Puliafito has not publicly addressed the accusations. An attempt by The New York Times to reach him on Sunday was unsuccessful.The university has said it was unaware of the troubles swirling around the doctor.On Sunday, a Los Angeles Times report cast doubt on the university\u2019s eagerness to confront the Puliafito matter.In March, it sent an email to C.L. Max Nikias, the university president, that referred to meth being found in a hotel room registered to Dr. Puliafito.That email, along with multiple other requests for comment, went unanswered, the newspaper said.On Sunday, The New York Times asked the university to discuss the latest Los Angeles Times report and other questions about Dr. Puliafito. The request was declined.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u2022 Internet companies will report earnings: Alphabet on Monday, Facebook on Wednesday, and Amazon and Twitter on Thursday.But medical experts say drug abuse isn\u2019t confined to the margins of society.\u201cI think we have this collective myth of the hard-core drug user being down and out,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a professor at U.C. San Francisco\u2019s medical school. \u201cWe fail to recognize that drug addiction is universal.\u201dWhile meth can be performance-enhancing at first, experts say it\u2019s typically a matter of time before things spin out of control.Rising tolerance leads to higher doses. Side effects show up: memory loss, anxiety, psychosis. The outward signs become harder to miss.In that sense, the medical school dean\u2019s case is unusual, said Dr. Richard A. Rawson, a substance abuse expert at U.C.L.A. Presumably, a colleague would have noticed something was awry.\u201cSo this one is an outlier, I have to say,\u201d Dr. Rawson said. \u201cI was surprised.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "How to Dress Down Like a Power Player", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttoned11 PhotosFran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, the French luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Brioni, wore a stretched-out zip-up hoodie. So did Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga. Ron Meyer, vice chairman of NBCUniversal, wore a Mr. Rogers black cardigan and baggy black shorts. Ivanka Trump wore an oversize white shirt, untucked, and skinny jeans. Omid Kordestani, executive chairman of Twitter, wore a Patagonia puffer. Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, wore skinny cargo pants and a cardigan the color of dried mud.If you want to know how to dress down like a power player during the coming vacation period, there is no better case study, thanks to the distillation of entrepreneurs, executives and influencers brought together every July by the event\u2019s founder, Herb Allen, the better to deal-make and elephant-bump in the rarefied altitudes of the Idaho aerie.Officially, there is no dress code at the conference beyond \u201crelaxed\u201d \u2014 or \u201chumble,\u201d as a regular attendee once told me \u2014 though name tags (humble!) are encouraged, along with the gift gear passed out to all attendees: navy or cherry red fleeces, hoodies, vests, polo shirts and baseball caps, so marked by the neat \u201cSV17\u201d logo over the left breast. And while the \u201cno press\u201d policy means less imagery emerges from the event than from, say, red-carpet happenings, enough snaps of schmoozing lords of the universe exiting their cars on arrival or taking the air between meeting sessions get released to provide fairly good intel on how they define off-duty dress.Which can best be characterized as \u201ccalculated schlubbiness.\u201d Or \u201cWho can give the impression they care less about what they wear than the next guy?\u201d Apparently, when you\u2019ve reached the top of the mountain, literal and professional, it\u2019s really about the smarts, people, not the suits.But it is the men, in their \u201cwhat, this old thing?\u201d rejection of the tailored sartorial culture in which most of them spend their days (the tech crowd excepted), whose attire is the most instructive. The predominant ethos being either the gym clothes shoved in the bottom drawer or back of the closet and then pulled out to meet with the personal trainer in the private gym look, or the \u201cpolo and baggy jeans on the back deck where no one can see you\u201d style.Indeed, the only branded area on the body was really the foot, where Nikes were impossible to obscure, and the bridge of the nose, where the Persols, mirrored aviators and Oliver Peoples rest.All of which made the few attendees wearing the traditional casual Friday uniform of jacket and shirt seem uptight and prissy (and even worse \u2014 old-fashioned) in comparison to their peers.Even Jared Kushner, of navy-blazer-and-flak-jacket-combo-in-Iraq fame, seemed to have learned one thing from his experience and swapped the blazer for a beige crew neck and jeans. Still, he blended into the crowd better when simply wearing a dark long-sleeve athletic shirt, having traded buttoned-up for loosened-up (or at least as if he were about to head off for a chest-thumping hike up the mountainside).But that was nothing compared with the extreme relaxers, most notably the tech crowd, for whom dressing down is a natural form of camouflage \u2014 obvious thanks to the fact that their T-shirts and jeans actually fit them. (They are the Silicon equivalent of the tailored suit.) The best examples were perhaps Nick Woodman from GoPro in a faded black T-shirt with a playing-card bunny on the front, or Jeff Bezos in a black polo, sleeves straining around his biceps.Indeed, aside from navy, there was, it\u2019s worth pointing out, a lot of black on display, including on Harvey Weinstein, Daniel Ek of Spotify and Ms. Barra \u2014 possibly as much as there is during fashion week. Which is interesting.You can understand it. After all, this isn\u2019t really \u201coff-duty\u201d at all; it\u2019s faux off-duty. Family may come along for the fun, but attendees are still dressing for one another. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous. And that means that to a certain extent what they wear is being chosen to send a message, and define an attitude.That being: Who can seem secure enough in their position to look fully unguarded? To not need any of the armor of power \u2014 aides or clothes or lawyers or polished shoes. To expose their soft underbelly (or loose underbelly as the case may be), the better to appear open and uncalculated with their peers.Of course, if the rest of us adopted the same strategy, we might just look sloppy. A better takeaway is simple: Truth is, when it comes to casual clothing, we are all as subject to the effects of peer pressure and herd instinct as we are when it comes to professional clothing. It\u2019s just at the opposite extreme.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In TV Spectacle, Man Convicted of Child Rape-Murder Is Executed in Yemen", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANA, Yemen \u2014 In a televised execution attended by thousands of Yemenis chanting approval, a man convicted of raping and killing a toddler was placed face down in a public square in Yemen\u2019s capital on Monday and shot with an automatic weapon at point-blank range.While public executions are not new in Yemen, the broadcast of this one, conducted by the Houthi rebels who have controlled the capital for more than two years in a calamitous civil war, was somewhat unusual.The egregiousness of the offense and public outrage over it may have played a role in the decision to show the execution on TV, as a way of mollifying the victim\u2019s family and portraying the Houthis as vigilant against crime.Court officials, the victim\u2019s family and news agencies were invited to attend, Saba reported. It said a crowd numbering in the thousands had converged around the clearing in Sana\u2019s Tahrir Square where the execution was carried out.Many spectators held cellphone cameras aloft to record it. Some were perched on telephone poles and rooftops.Shamsan Alyafaei, a 23-year-old university student, said he and some other spectators had learned of the execution on Sunday from messages on WhatsApp and Facebook. Some people arrived at 7 a.m., more than two hours beforehand, to get a good view, and held banners that read \u201cJustice has won,\u201d and \u201cRana\u2019s blood won\u2019t be in vain.\u201dMr. Alyafaei said there had been talk that the condemned man was mentally unstable. Still, he said of the outcome, \u201cas long as it was based on a judicial verdict, it\u2019s fine.\u201dAbdulkareem Ziraei, 32, a news photographer, estimated that 10,000 people were in the square for the execution and that the overwhelming majority had approved. Many yelled \u201clong live justice!\u201d he said, as the executioner discharged his weapon into Mr. Maghrabi\u2019s back.News photographs showed Mr. Maghrabi lying on his stomach with hands bound behind him as a uniformed soldier or police officer standing right over him opened fire.A Reuters dispatch from Sana quoted Yahya al-Matari, the father of the girl, as saying afterward that he felt justice had been served. \u201cThis is the first day in my life,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cI am relieved now.\u201dThe child was killed on June 25, the first day of Eid al-Fitr, a joyous Muslim holiday that signifies the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Yemen, the Middle East\u2019s poorest country, is overwhelmingly Muslim.At least 10,000 people have been killed in the war between the Houthis, who are backed by Iran, and a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, which views Iran as a regional threat. The war\u2019s impact also has placed much of the country on the verge of famine and contributed to a cholera outbreak that has sickened roughly 400,000 Yemenis.Shuaib Almosawa reported from Sana, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

Rib Reef, where Dr. Cantin was diving, was teeming with color and life just a year ago; now most of it is just coral skeleton covered in algae that looks like soot.There is still time to adjust. \u201cIt\u2019s a big system,\u201d Dr. Cantin says, with areas that can recover if given a decade or so of prime conditions.But the world is watching to see what will happen next.Will tour operators and the Australian government speak with more force about the damage from climate change? Will the giant Adani coal mine, which would bring more coal ships close to the reef, gain final approval? Will more of the reef die \u2014 or recover \u2014 in the coming year?The role of science and what it can do to help will be the focus of my upcoming story.In the meantime, scroll down for a few of my favorite stories from our climate team\u2019s globe-trotting reporters, along a few other stories from The Times this week.

{"Headline": "The Time to Fix \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 Was at the Start", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookPeople associated with \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d on CBS love to throw around the word ohana, the Hawaiian term for extended, interdependent families. The show\u2019s hero, Steve McGarrett, uses it to refer to his fictional team of crimefighters, but it always sounds a little awkward coming out of the mouth of Alex O\u2019Loughlin, an earnest Australian actor who after seven seasons of playing McGarrett still seems like a tourist on vacation from a Hollywood action movie.And ohana rang just as untrue this week when the executive producer and showrunner, Peter Lenkov, used it to refer to the show\u2019s cast and crew \u2014 while trying to tamp down the controversy surrounding the departure of the show\u2019s two Asian-American stars, Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park.I\u2019m not here to defend CBS\u2019s decisions. Indeed, there isn\u2019t enough information out there to be sure of who decided what, and on what basis. But I think that the current criticism of CBS is a little beside the point. The battle over \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d was lost a long time ago.I may bring a little more experience to the table than other commentators. I\u2019m the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 television critic who has watched every episode of the show. (That\u2019s 168 of them, or around 115 hours of my life.)For better or worse, Mr. Kim\u2019s and Ms. Park\u2019s characters \u2014 Lt. Chin Ho Kelly and his cousin, Officer Kono Kalakaua \u2014 are definitively supporting characters. They\u2019re onscreen as much as the leads, and they get their own story lines. But the show is built around the bantering, bromantic, Lucy-and-Desi relationship between Steve and his sergeant, Danny (a.k.a., Danno) Williams (Mr. Caan).There\u2019s an impulse here that\u2019s probably well meaning but results in stereotyping. Chin and Kono get dreary, topical plots: He tries to rescue a young girl from the drug cartels; she goes on a crusade against human trafficking. These plots line up with the show\u2019s often heavy-handed attempts to celebrate its adopted state, which last season yielded episodes involving the separatist Nation of Hawai\u2019i and the former Hansen\u2019s disease colony on Molokai.Meanwhile, the writers and producers focus all of the fun on Mr. McGarrett and Mr. Caan \u2014 Danno whining about Steve\u2019s reckless driving, Steve pompously criticizing Danno\u2019s parenting. And the best thing about the show \u2014 best being a relative term \u2014 is the way Mr. O\u2019Loughlin and Mr. Caan handle the back and forth. They\u2019re not comic geniuses, but they\u2019re good enough, and they\u2019ve developed a rhythm over the seasons.Could the writers have done something similar for Chin and Kono? Sure. A different type of series could find a different way to share the riches among its stars (which number five, including the African-American actor Chi McBride).But \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d is resolutely formulaic, and writers and producers get into comfort zones that resist change. Through seven seasons, Mr. Kim and Ms. Park spent a lot of their screen time smiling and rolling their eyes in reaction to Mr. O\u2019Loughlin and Mr. Caan.CBS (which also owns the show) is a business, and it is better than just about any network at knowing its audience. The show\u2019s casting decisions are made with that relatively old, Friday night audience in mind. It\u2019s betting that people tune in for the scenery, the gunplay and the O\u2019Loughlin-Caan relationship. Everything else is interchangeable.That said, there is a race problem with \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d but it happened in 2010, not this week. When the original \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d which ran on CBS from 1968 to 1980, was re-envisioned, it would have made all the sense in the world to cast the central partnership in a way that reflected the state\u2019s population, which is more than half Asian, native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. A caustic Hawaiian Danno might not have improved the ratings but would have done wonders for the show\u2019s credibility.So why am I a \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d completist? My mother lives in Hawaii, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time there over the years, and I started watching the show for the scenery \u2014 calling out the locations, moaning over the blatant shilling for the Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel. My mother is also Korean, and I felt some additional loyalty to the show because of Mr. Kim\u2019s and Ms. Park\u2019s prominence.But I also thought it was kind of amusing that the state\u2019s Asian population was being represented primarily by two Korean actors, when people who identify as Korean make up about 2 percent of the population. If the performers who take their place are of Japanese, Filipino or Hawaiian heritage, \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d will actually have become more representative on Hawaii.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hot Enough for You? Try Eating Something Even Hotter", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are less daunting methods to beat the summer heat than by wolfing down still-boiling chicken soup for lunch. But followers of a Korean tradition say that few are as effective.Their mantra is \u201cyi yeol chi yeol,\u201d or \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d and their weapon of choice is samgyetang, a whole young chicken or Cornish hen stuffed with glutinous rice, ginseng root, red dates and garlic, served piping hot in its own broth.At the peak of summer, and especially on \u201csambok,\u201d the three days of the year Koreans believe to be the hottest, according to the lunar calendar, many of them seek out roiling bowls of samgyetang in the belief that it replenishes nutrients, improves circulation and helps balance the body\u2019s internal and external temperatures.The dish predates written records, Ms. Kim said, but an early printed recipe for what is now called samgyetang appeared in a 1917 Korean cookbook and called for ginseng powder instead of fresh roots. By the 1960s, refrigeration had made fresh ginseng easier to buy, and the practice of eating the soup as a summer tonic, thought to refresh and re-energize, spread widely.Those wilting under the sun today still turn to it, often instead of chilled foods, as a way to cool down.\u201cIf I have something cold on a hot summer day, I may feel some relief as it goes down,\u201d said Ms. Kim, who lives in New York City. \u201cBut the temperature difference between my body and the environment becomes too large, and after a while, I actually feel hotter than before.\u201d\u201cIf I have some hot samgyetang,\u201d she added, \u201cI sweat a bit, and my body feels more in sync with the environment.\u201dThe theory was put to the test on a recent 84-degree day at Hansol Nutrition Center, which despite its name is not a shop stocked with vitamins and whey protein, but a Korean restaurant in the Murray Hill section of Queens, known for its samgyetang.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best-selling items on our menu in the summer,\u201d said Peter Ro, an owner. \u201cEspecially in hot weather.\u201dThe dish comes to the table at full boil in an earthenware pot, and as tradition dictates, it is served underseasoned. Salt is added at the table to the diner\u2019s taste: Each pinch helps bring the soup into focus, its richness cut by the sweet red dates and a faintly medicinal tang from the ginseng.\u201cWe very much concentrate on the stock,\u201d Mr. Ro said. \u201cWe try to adhere to the traditional way of preparing it.\u201dHe said his recipe is a secret. But samgyetang is almost always made from just a handful of ingredients, with none of the pungent, spicy flavors that Korean cuisine is often known for in the West. The chicken is stuffed with aromatics and simmered until the meat can be pulled easily from the bones with chopsticks.At Hansol, the soup is silkier than many versions, most likely from an extra helping of starchy rice in the stock. Otherwise it\u2019s typical of the uncomplicated comfort dish that has steamed up Korean kitchens for generations.Whether it provides relief from the heat ultimately depends on one\u2019s definition of relief. Any cooling effect is not always immediate. \u201cI guess we\u2019re thinking more toward the longer-term benefits,\u201d Mr. Ro said. \u201cThe food you intake will have an effect on your health, and that makes you feel better.\u201dMs. Kim, though, swears by its tempering qualities. \u201cIt might only be psychological for me, as a Korean,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it feels like it\u2019s working.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Student\u2019s Use of Auschwitz Artifacts in an Art Exhibit Prompts a Furor", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Israeli college student has drawn a storm of criticism for using artifacts that she initially claimed were taken from the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial site in Poland in an artwork for a college exhibit.The student, Rotem Bides, told Israeli news outlets this week that she had collected the objects during five visits to the site of the former Nazi concentration camp in what is now southern Poland.Ms. Bides said that her grandparents were Holocaust survivors \u2014 one grandfather was in Auschwitz \u2014 and that the art was intended to explore her personal history.\u201cI felt it was something I had to do,\u201d she told Ynetnews. \u201cMillions of people were murdered based on the moral laws of a certain country, under a certain regime. And if these are the laws, I can go there and act according to my own laws. The statement I\u2019m making here is that laws are determined by humans, and that morality is something that changes from time to time and from culture to culture.\u201dMs. Bides later told The New York Times that the items \u201care not from the Auschwitz camp and not from the Auschwitz museum, but from the nearby area,\u201d but she declined to elaborate. The Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum is a sprawling site covering hundreds of acres.The artwork was meant to be part of an exhibit starting on July 26 at Beit Berl College in Kfar Saba, a city near Tel Aviv, Israel. But the college removed it, according to a statement posted on its Facebook page, after reports circulated that it contained stolen artifacts. The college has recommended Ms. Bides for \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d and said it \u201ccondemns the theft of items from any place, and certainly from an extermination camp.\u201dThe college said Ms. Bides\u2019s decision to use the materials in the piece came from \u201ca lack of public sensitivity and a misunderstanding of its criminal significance.\u201dMs. Bides may face more than just college discipline. Representatives of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum condemned the reported theft, and said in a Twitter message that her use of the artifacts was disrespectful.Lukasz Lipinski, a press officer at the museum, said staff members were working with Polish prosecutors to ascertain whether the items were stolen from the site. The items did not appear to have come from any formal display, he said, but might have been picked up somewhere on the property.\u201cFrom the pictures, it is hard to tell,\u201d Mr. Lipinski said. \u201cSuch things, you can find them on the grounds of Auschwitz-Birkenau.\u201d\u201cThese things are of special value for Polish culture,\u201d Mr. Lipinski said. \u201cAnything taken from the museum is part of the history of the site. It is against the law, of course, to take anything.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

No one was at the door. Those lights were from passing cars \u2014 not coded language that he said he alone could understand. She tried to steer him to hospitals, into ambulances and toward help.On the Fourth of July night when it all ended, concern had turned to desperation. She called 911, tried to flag down police cars and ambulances, seeking intervention when reason failed. Finally, overwhelmed, she left Alexander Bonds, her boyfriend of six months, on a street corner in the Bronx.Mr. Bonds was killed moments later in a shootout with officers. There was little evidence of what had led him to open fire on a police officer; he left no manifesto, little public warning except on Facebook, where he expressed anger at prison guards and police officers. Police investigators immediately focused on the last few hours and days of Mr. Bonds\u2019s life.Mr. Bonds\u2019s girlfriend was with him for most of that time. It was, she said, a four-day descent into the depths of madness, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it could end violently,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could have done more.\u201dThe girlfriend, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal from the police or the community, said she was interviewed by police detectives, answering what she could. She wasn\u2019t there for the shooting, she said, and didn\u2019t know Mr. Bonds had a gun. But her account is the fullest and most harrowing to emerge of Mr. Bonds\u2019s final days and hours.During their six months together, he had told her of his past struggles with schizophrenia. But she had not seen any symptoms. \u201cI thought he was fine,\u201d she said.They had spoken tentatively of marriage. She was helping him prepare for the G.E.D., a major undertaking as he was \u201csomewhat illiterate\u201d when they started studying together. She was proud of him. After a neighbor left two months ago \u2014 possibly on the run \u2014 others in the building took the possessions left behind. \u201cAlex was disgusted by it,\u201d she recalled. He told her, \u201cPeople should not touch what\u2019s not theirs.\u201dBut on June 30, he received a phone call that, she said, seemed to trigger a psychotic episode. The person who had called him, a friend, passed along that \u201ca rumor was going around that an old friend had a problem with him,\u201d according to the girlfriend. Rather than dismissing it, Mr. Bonds \u201clatched onto\u201d the idea that someone was plotting against him, his girlfriend said.The next morning, she woke up to hear Mr. Bonds talking to himself. Agitated, he darted out of the apartment to see who was outside. He came back, but he kept rushing out again, convinced there was something out there to confront.The girlfriend said she had never before seen schizophrenia up close. She looked it up on Google.They headed to the clinic where Mr. Bonds\u2019s psychiatrist worked. On the way, Mr. Bonds\u2019s behavior grew more paranoid. A passing bicyclist unnerved him enough that he took off running. He talked about an unnamed enemy, even accusing his girlfriend of complicity.\u201cHe thought I had something to do with it, that his enemy had me date him in order to destroy him,\u201d she said.They arrived at the clinic midmorning. The psychiatrist, they were told, could see Mr. Bonds at 3:30 p.m. That was too long to wait. So the clinic called an ambulance to take him to St. Barnabas Hospital. When police officers arrived, along with the ambulance\u2019s crew, the girlfriend grew concerned that Mr. Bonds might grow more agitated and distressed. She explained to the officers, she recalled, that Mr. Bonds had been in prison and \u201cavoiding police contact is the main thing in a parolee\u2019s head.\u201dThe officers, the girlfriend recalled, treated Mr. Bonds respectfully and patiently.Inside the ambulance, Mr. Bonds seemed to show some understanding that he was paranoid and delusional. He exclaimed, \u201cOh, God, it\u2019s all in my head,\u201d and seemed in a rush to reach the hospital. There, Mr. Bonds was given some type of sedative, his girlfriend recalled.When Mr. Bonds awoke, he seemed stable. \u201cHe was relieved, he was happy, he was back to his normal self,\u201d she recalled. They returned to his apartment, on Rev. James A Polite Avenue in the Morrisania section of the Bronx.For the rest of that day, and much of the following day, things seemed to be all right, she said. They spoke about his struggles with mental illness. She already knew some details about a past psychotic episode, involving voices in his head. \u201cThe voices were telling him to do pull-ups,\u201d she said. \u201cOr ram into people in the street.\u201d He ended up in Bellevue Hospital.She also knew that he had not been taking his pills regularly \u2014 he complained they left him feeling dull. She insisted that he start taking his medication. Mr. Bonds fetched a large bag filled with pill bottles, all expired. She wondered if it might be more dangerous to take expired pills.The following night, he could not wind down. He talked and talked, with rising anxiety and frustration. The next morning, on July 3, she awoke to find Mr. Bonds fixated on the apartment next to his. No one lived there, but Mr. Bonds was not convinced.\u201cHe was talking about false walls,\u201d she said. Someone was staying there, someone planning to hurt Mr. Bonds and rape his girlfriend. He said he could hear sounds coming from that apartment.She called the clinic. His next appointment was for July 10, a week away. Could they get in earlier? The next day, July 4, they went to a barbecue with friends, but Mr. Bonds was drifting away.He would wander off, distracted by the passing cars, insisting that they were following him. He was convinced he was in great danger and insisted that others not walk near him \u2014 \u201che felt like a target, and he didn\u2019t want anyone to go down with him,\u201d she said.As it got dark, Mr. Bonds told his girlfriend to leave. It was too dangerous for her. She refused. \u201cI don\u2019t love you. Get away from me,\u201d he told her. But she would not leave.The next few hours are a jumble of cab rides, arguments in the street, 911 calls and rising helplessness.She began calling 911 around 9 or 10 p.m. to request an ambulance. Once or twice she hung up: Mr. Bonds would grab at the phone or accuse her of betrayal. At one point, as a police car approached, Mr. Bonds ran off to hide among parked cars.\u201cYou called the cops?\u201d he asked his girlfriend in disbelief. He explained that if his enemy ever saw him with the cops, he would be in trouble. \u201cI can\u2019t be seen with no cop. If I do, it\u2019s game over for me.\u201dAt one point, while the girlfriend spoke on the phone with a dispatcher, an ambulance approached. When Mr. Bonds grabbed for the phone, a struggle ensued and the ambulance drove right by.Finally, the 911 dispatcher directed her to stand at a certain corner. She waited there for 15 minutes. She tried flagging down police cruisers and ambulances. \u201cI would wave, they wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201dThe girlfriend said she never knew Mr. Bonds had a gun. \u201cI would not have allowed that \u2014 I would have wrestled him for the gun,\u201d she said.Mr. Bonds began to rant that he needed to find his enemy and talk to him, face to face, and try to appease him. At one point, Mr. Bonds began to bemoan the fact that he did not have enough money to offer \u2014 \u201cto make it all go away.\u201dShe listened as he sought guidance from the lights and sounds around him, hoping he would soon grow weary and seek rest. He stared at the headlights of passing cars. \u201cDo you want me to go there?\u201d the girlfriend heard him ask. \u201cOne blink means \u2018no,\u2019 two blinks mean \u2018yes,\u2019 \u201d he said.They were in taxis, and then they were back on the street, but in an area unfamiliar to her. They walked for a time, until they came across two cabs.\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked. He insisted that they go separately. From her cab, she said, she blew him a kiss, and headed home to wait for him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Carmen,\u2019 Boldly Rewritten as Therapy for a Modern Man", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France \u2014 At the beginning of Dmitri Tcherniakov\u2019s remarkable new production of Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d at the Aix Festival here, the audience is warned that \u201ctonight\u2019s performance contains scenes that may seem like actual danger. Please be aware that they are part of the show.\u201dSuch a disclaimer may be wise reassurance in these jittery times. But it is also a welcome promise: This daring Russian director plans to find some particularly modern anxiety in a work that has become dulled by overexposure.Like an opera-themed episode of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d Mr. Tcherniakov\u2019s production locks its characters in a mysterious but almost identifiable world. So Mr. Fabiano isn\u2019t exactly playing Don Jos\u00e9, at least not at first. In a spoken introduction before the overture begins, he is an emotionally withdrawn modern man, brought to the lobby of a clinic (the cold, pointedly impersonal set is by Mr. Tcherniakov) by his prim wife.As a result of a therapist\u2019s description of his social media presence, he is prescribed an enactment of \u201cCarmen\u201d to restore his ability to feel. Mr. Tcherniakov (who was cheered at his curtain call by a largely French audience, despite his staging\u2019s provocative alterations of a French classic) implies that we turn to the excessive passions and violence of \u201cCarmen\u201d \u2014 and perhaps opera in general \u2014 because they offer something visceral that modern life does not. But he is presenting a cautionary tale, not an escape.This Don Jos\u00e9 signs a release, hands over his wallet and phone and, still in the lobby, is soon surrounded by a chorus of suit-wearing men whose name tags identify them as soldiers. They guide him through the story of the opera, a plot in which he participates first with reluctance, then with increasing enthusiasm and, finally, with desperation.The stage is shorn of the usual Gypsies and bullfighters; Don Jos\u00e9 and the clinic\u2019s employees, reading from scripts, embody archetypes in a fantasy of masculine revenge. At one point, heavily armed police storm the stage (hence that audience warning), prompting what looks like genuine sympathy for Carmen from Don Jos\u00e9, and congratulations from his therapist (Pierre Grammont, in a speaking role). Some of the characters seem to realize that Don Jos\u00e9 might be getting carried away and suggest that they stop, but the therapist insists that they continue.Wearing a jumpsuit and lounging with abandon, Carmen offers to this alienated Don Jos\u00e9 the opposite of the wife who has taken him to the clinic (and who sings Mica\u00ebla, the third side of the opera\u2019s love triangle). At first, in a playful Habanera, Ms. D\u2019Oustrac\u2019s earthy mezzo skated on top of the music. As Carmen wore down Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s defenses, however, her voice deepened and grew in power.Mr. Fabiano\u2019s Don Jos\u00e9 is ultimately not very different from those found in many a traditional \u201cCarmen,\u201d though the claustrophobia of this staging increases the standard intensity. His glowering demeanor is at odds with his sensitive, vibrant lyric tenor. Only in his Act II \u201cFlower Aria\u201d does Mr. Fabiano\u2019s presence allow for some introspection, a welcome relief. In the dramatic finale, he pushes his voice to its limits.Mr. Tcherniakov has a convenient escape hatch: Sometimes his therapist-performers become visibly bored with their script. This allows the production to cruise through sections that don\u2019t clearly intersect with the concept. Mr. Tcherniakov is not well equipped to deal with the bullfighter Escamillo (given a macho interpretation by the cigar-chomping baritone Michael Todd Simpson) and his relationship with Carmen, and the production loses some steam when this interaction takes center stage.But that\u2019s not, in fact, the end. In a chilling epilogue, Carmen rises from the dead; the knife was only a prop. Don Jos\u00e9 has passed the final stage of his therapy with flying colors, and his doctor rewards him with a huge bouquet of flowers. The clinic\u2019s staff is too excited to notice that the treatment didn\u2019t work: The man they think they have cured is still locked in his own head, seemingly unable even to hear their praise, still believing he killed Carmen.Mr. Tcherniakov\u2019s vision is thoroughly dark, and finds no easy solutions in the past for the problems of the present. Even if your Facebook presence is as bleak as Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s in this staging, living in an opera may not be the answer.Advertisement"}

I did not want my already awkward 14-year-old character to be mired by something as taboo and shameful as homosexuality. And, for all the crushes on girls I could muster up, I cannot control my sexuality.But my weight, well, that is something easily manipulated.Often people associate eating disorders with young women. But it is not unique to females, nor to queer males, like me. When not-talked-about and societally shamed, one cannot overcome such emotional struggles..Lucy Kelly, 21, New ZealandAfter a summer of being sexually abused and a year of bullying and being isolated by my peers, compounded by years of depression and anxiety, I became fixated on this goal of being the thinnest. I wanted to be so thin that I turned into a little girl again ... I wanted to be so thin I would disappear. Before I could begin to comprehend what was happening, it had grown like a disease I was completely powerless to control or stop.Shannon Wills, 23, San Diego My eating disorder began when I was 13 years old, and was not managed until I was 19. It began with anorexia, and I worked my way through various other eating disorders through high school. It sucked all of the joy out of my life \u2014 all of the personality out of my body ... But the minute my eating disorder developed, my voice was gone. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s what they really do; eating disorders steal your voice, steal the space that you occupy. I learned that I was not allowed to take up space, and that the best parts of me were the areas that I did not fill.Lauren Lopez, 27, Brooklyn, N.Y. My eating disorder started at 16, I\u2019m now 27. It was an endless, exhausting pursuit to disappear. I wanted to disperse into thin air ... I eventually spoke less, felt less, physically became less. Almost like a child.Anonymous, 61, MichiganI knew I was in trouble, although I was not willing to talk about it. And, even though my parents were concerned enough to take me to two doctors, it went undiagnosed. I began to binge and purge, my way of trying not to starve to death, but not willing or able to get back into healthy eating patterns. What I remember is an intense and overwhelming compulsive mental state, akin to addiction as I would imagine it.This was in the 1970s and it was not recognized as readily as it would be now.Misha, 25, Bayreuth, Germany My experience with the disorder was confusing, among other things. I grew up in India at a time when there was minimal public awareness or discourse about eating disorders and the myriad ways in which they ravage a person\u2019s body and mind ... People around me started discovering my secret years before I got better, but there was no socially acceptable way to get me professional help, so they didn\u2019t try.Kathy P, 36, Los Angeles Eating disorders are far from glamorous. You don\u2019t walk into a hospital and have Keanu Reeves waiting to console you. You feel like crap, smell like vomit, hide secrets, lose friends, lose hair, lose muscle mass, suffer from severe isolation and basically become a shell of your once happy, hungry self.Recovering both physically and emotionally from my eating disorder took me many years. The worst thing I did was spend years ignoring it and not talking about it, when I could\u2019ve been reaching out for professional help and personal support. Like many people with eating disorders, I never thought I could recover completely, but I am proud to say that it is possible, and I am proof of that.Laura, 24, Florida I want people to know that recovery is not a matter of willpower. And it certainly is not a matter of hearing an impassioned speech from a motivated therapist. As media consumers, we yearn for the redemption narrative \u2014 the ravaged girl who is jolted out of her self-destruction by the right words delivered with enough passion. But the reality is that eating disorders are a complex web that cannot be swept away in one fell swoop.Sondra Storm, 33, Oregon U.S. culture is so messed up around weight and food that recovery from an eating disorder requires almost superhuman resilience. Diet and weight loss are discussed constantly, foods are categorized into \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Employers increasingly have wellness programs that promote this kind of discussion at work. I am frequently complimented on my body and on what I eat by others. The compliments are always about how \u201chealthy\u201d I am. I am not healthy, I am underweight and have an eating disorder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Way for Therapists to Get Inside Heads: Virtual Reality", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dawn Jewell recently treated a patient haunted by a car crash. The patient had developed acute anxiety over the cross streets where the crash occurred, unable to drive a route that carried so many painful memories.So Dr. Jewell, a psychologist in Colorado, treated the patient through a technique called exposure therapy, providing emotional guidance as they revisited the intersection together.But they did not physically return to the site. They revisited it through virtual reality.\u201cIt provides exposure in a way that patients feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can go to a location together, and the patient can tell me what they\u2019re feeling and what they\u2019re thinking.\u201dThe service is also designed to provide treatment in other ways, like taking patients to the top of a virtual skyscraper so they can face a fear of heights or to a virtual bar so they can address an alcohol addiction.The hardware and software they are working with is still very young, but Limbix builds on more than two decades of research and clinical trials involving virtual reality and exposure therapy. At a time when much-hyped headsets like the Daydream and Facebook\u2019s Oculus are still struggling to find a wide audience in the world of gaming \u2014 let alone other markets \u2014 psychology is an area where technology and medical experts believe this technology can be a benefit.As far back as the mid-1990s, clinical trials showed that this kind of technology could help treat phobias and other conditions, like post-traumatic stress disorder.Traditionally, psychologists have treated such conditions by helping patients imagine they are facing a fear, mentally creating a situation where they can address their anxieties. Virtual reality takes this a step further.\u201cWe feel pretty confident that exposure therapy using V.R. can supplement what a patient\u2019s imagination alone can do,\u201d said Skip Rizzo, a clinical psychologist at the University of Southern California who has explored such technology over the past 20 years.Such technology has also been effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans. Unlike treatments built solely on imagination, Dr. Rothbaum said, virtual reality can force patients to face their past traumas.\u201cPTSD is a disorder of avoidance. People don\u2019t want to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need them to be engaged emotionally, and with virtual reality, it\u2019s harder for them to avoid that.\u201dNow, headsets like Google\u2019s Daydream, which works in tandem with common smartphones, and Facebook\u2019s Oculus, the self-contained $400 headset that sparked the recent resurgence in virtual reality technologies, could potentially bring this kind of therapy to a much wider audience.After testing the Limbix offering, Dr. Jewell said it allowed patients to face their anxieties in more controlled ways than they otherwise could. At the same time, such a tool can truly give patients the feeling that they are being transported to a different locations \u2014 at least in some cases.Standing atop a virtual skyscraper, for instance, can cause anxiety even in those who are relatively comfortable with heights. Experts warn that a service like the one offered by Limbix requires the guiding hand of trained psychologists while still in development.Limbix combines technical and medical expertise. One key employee, Scott Satkin, is a robotics and artificial intelligence researcher who worked on the Daydream project at Google. Limbix also works with its own psychologist, Sean Sullivan, who continues to run a therapy practice in San Francisco.Dr. Sullivan is using the new service to treat patients, including a young man who recently developed a fear of flying, something that causes anxiety simply when he talks about it. Using the service alongside Dr. Sullivan, the young man, who asked that his name be withheld for privacy reasons spent several sessions visiting a virtual airport and, eventually, flying on a virtual plane.In some ways, the young man said, the service is still less than perfect. Like the Street View scenes Dr. Jewell uses in treating her patients, some of this virtual reality is static, built from still images. But like the rest of the virtual reality market, these tools are still evolving toward more realistic scenes.And even in its current form, the service can be convincing. The young man recently took a flight across the country \u2014 here in the real world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Threatened the Gonzalez Families?", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis Week in HateTwo nights before the inauguration, Katherine Gonzalez Morgan was watching TV with her nine-year-old son when police showed up at her door. They had received an email saying there was a bomb at her address, they said. She and her family would have to leave immediately.Ms. Morgan lives with her husband, their son and her parents on a five-acre farm in an unincorporated area outside the town of Pace, in the Florida Panhandle. The police evacuated the Morgans and their nearest neighbors to a soccer complex nearby while they searched the farm. Ms. Morgan was worried that someone might have placed a bomb in the horse barn or one of the sheds on the property. Her son was terrified. She and her mother both have a form of muscular dystrophy, and both were still recovering from recent surgeries when they were forced to leave their home.About two hours later, the Morgans were able to return; the officers had found no bomb at the farm. The Morgans were one of three families in Florida, in three different cities hundreds of miles apart, whose addresses had been mentioned in a bomb threat emailed to a detective. The only connection police could find among the three was that all had the surname Gonzalez, which is Ms. Morgan\u2019s parents\u2019 name and her maiden name.Reports of threats and harassment, especially directed at people perceived to be immigrants, spiked after the election of President Trump, according to many advocacy groups. But a threat against three families with the same last name is unusual, even unique.Although two of the three Gonzalez families targeted are Latino, there\u2019s no clear evidence that the crime was motivated by racism. In fact, more than six months later, no one knows who targeted the families, or why.The email that forced three families from their homes on January 18 read like a bizarre word problem.\u201cMe and 2 of my gang associates have a total of 6 bombs,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are setting them all off within the next hour. We also have a total of 1 pound of cocaine and 7 pounds of marijuana. If you come to all 3 of our houses within the next 45 minutes we will not set off ONE of the bombs, which is the one that will kill 4 police officers. Start is now, 6:57pm EST.\u201dThen it listed Ms. Morgan\u2019s address, another one 450 miles to the southeast in Kissimmee, Fla., and a third address in Sunrise, nearly 200 miles south of that. The email was sent to a detective at the police department in a fourth city, Ocala, using a disposable email address from a provider called Guerrillamail.Police in Ocala contacted police in Sunrise and sheriff\u2019s offices serving Pace and Kissimmee, and officers from the local agencies sped to each address, arriving by 8 p.m. No bombs were found.Guerrillamail, which bills itself as an anti-spam tool, includes the IP address of the sender in the header information of each email as a way to discourage abuse. The Sunrise police investigated the IP address of the threatening email, but were unable to turn up any leads. A spokesperson for the department said he believed the IP address was in a foreign country.The crime appears to have been an example of a practice called swatting: A perpetrator makes a false report of a bomb or shooter at a victim\u2019s address, with the goal of causing law enforcement officers, such as a SWAT team, to descend on the residence. Though no one knows exactly how the perpetrator found the Gonzalez families\u2019 addresses, the rise of data brokers has made it easy to find someone\u2019s address online. And swatting can be difficult to investigate and prosecute, since perpetrators can mask their identity and location.Eventually, authorities in Sunrise, Pace and Kissimmee all ended their investigations with no findings. The Ocala Police Department, which received the email, never opened an investigation because the addresses targeted were outside its jurisdiction. Police in Ocala notified the F.B.I. of the email, but a spokesperson for the bureau could not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation into the case.Meanwhile, for the three families involved, the effects of the experience lingered long after officers left. Evelyn Gonzalez of Sunrise, Fla., and her family were at her uncle\u2019s house a few blocks away when they got the call from the police. Ms. Gonzalez was terrified. Her family was with her, but she was worried about her dogs, still in the house, and her neighbors. Before that night, Ms. Gonzalez often didn\u2019t bother turning on the alarm system before leaving the house. Now she is thinking about getting security cameras. Something like this \u201cchanges your perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt changes your life completely.\u201dIn Kissimmee, Ramon Gonzalez was relaxing at home with his family when he saw lights outside. When his wife opened the door to see what it was, a sheriff\u2019s officer yelled, \u201cGet out of the house!\u201dOfficers evacuated the family to a nearby church while they searched the house. Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s wife, who asked that her first name not be used, was in her pajamas. The threat completely changed the way she views her house, she said. The feeling of security she used to have at home is gone now, all because \u201csomebody decided to write an email with our address,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201dInitially, Ms. Morgan believed the threat against her home was motivated by racial prejudice. The farm, she said in March, \u201cwas our sanctuary, and some ignorant, racist idiot decided to harass people and picked our name out of a phone book.\u201dMs. Morgan describes her ethnic identity as complicated. Her maiden name, Gonzalez, comes from her grandfather, who was adopted from an orphanage in Mexico by a Mexican-American family. She grew up watching Spanish-language TV with him, but she also identifies closely with her Irish heritage. The Gonzalez families in Kissimmee and Sunrise identify as Latino.Between Election Day and the end of March, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 1,863 incidents of hate or bias. Nearly 400 targeted immigrants or people perceived to be immigrants; 43 percent of those involved anti-Latino hate or harassment.\u201cWhen there\u2019s high level of media coverage with respect to a specific kind of crime, we often see a temporary spike in similar crimes by other groups or individuals,\u201d said Anthony Roman, a security expert.Still, it\u2019s not clear why someone chose to threaten the three Gonzalez families in Pace, Kissimmee and Sunrise out of thousands of people who share that surname around the country. The nature of the threat raises questions that, months later, no one can answer: Were all the families chosen at random? Was one of them picked out of personal animus, with the others added as decoys? Were all of them carefully selected based on some connection or commonality even they can\u2019t discern? Because the perpetrator hasn\u2019t been found, all of the families are forced to wonder if they were targeted personally, if the crime was somehow about them.Ms. Morgan now believes the threat might have been inspired by some of her Facebook posts. \u201cI\u2019m pretty vocal about not liking Trump and not liking right-wing politics in general,\u201d she said. Each of the three families targeted in the threat includes someone named Katherine Gonzalez, a fact that, like many in the case, feels significant but could be simple coincidence.For a while after the threat, Ms. Morgan stopped posting on Facebook, afraid of being targeted again. Recently, however, she started posting again, particularly about the Republican health care bill, which she said would stop her from getting the coverage she needs for her health problems. \u201cSome little idiot hiding behind their computer screen is not going to affect me,\u201d she said.She\u2019s grateful that no one was physically harmed, but wishes law enforcement had done more to investigate the threat. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a prank,\u201d she said.She worries that the person who targeted her family may go on to threaten more people, or worse. \u201cWhoever did this totally got away with it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they going to do next?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Among watch obsessives, the impact of Instagram can hardly be overstated. Facebook\u2019s explosively popular photo-sharing app not only serves to unite members of this fusty, long-obscure subculture the world over, but it has also helped spread watch obsession among the digital generation, turbocharging the vintage market in the process, several prominent dealers said.To Mr. Altieri, the twin spikes seem like more than a coincidence. \u201cWe\u2019ll post a new green Rolex anniversary model Submariner from 2004, complete with box and papers, and, usually within minutes,\u201d he said, people will message him, \u201c\u2018Hey, let me know the price.\u2019\u201dInstagram, by contrast, is everything that traditional watch collecting was not: young, colorful, brazenly digital and populist.

The names of the Israeli victims were not immediately made public.The three Palestinian protesters were fatally shot in separate clashes in and around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Health Ministry identified them as Muhammad Mahmoud Sharaf, 17, from the mostly Palestinian neighborhood of Ras al-Amud in East Jerusalem; Muhammad Abu Ghanam, from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of At-Tur, which is on the Mount of Olives; and Muhammad Lafi, 18, from Abu Dis, a Palestinian town on the outskirts of the city.The Israeli police said rioters threw rocks and firebombs and set off fireworks in the direction of the security forces, endangering them.President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, who had cut short a trip to China to handle the spiraling crisis over the metal detectors, announced late Friday that he was freezing contacts with Israel at all levels until it canceled the new measures around the Jerusalem holy site.It was not immediately clear if the suspension included the Palestinian Authority\u2019s security coordination with Israel, a crucial vestige of the relationship between the two sides. Peace talks have been at an impasse for years.The victims of the attack at the settlement were members of a family who had gathered for a traditional Sabbath eve meal. A neighbor, a soldier on furlough, heard the family\u2019s cries for help and shot the assailant through a window, according to reports in the Israeli news media.The authorities identified the attacker as Omar al-Abed, 19, from a nearby village in the Ramallah district. He posted a final message on Facebook a couple of hours before the attack.\u201cI am a young man who has not yet reached the age of 20, I have many dreams and ambitions!!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI loved life \u2014 to draw the smile on people\u2019s faces. But what life is this when our women and young men are killed unjustly and our Aqsa is facing desecration.\u201d He said he had a sharp knife, begged forgiveness from his family and signed off with emojis including hearts.The Israeli military distributed a graphic image from the site of the attack, showing a kitchen floor awash in blood.The clashes came as thousands of Palestinian Muslims prayed in front of police barricades in the streets around the Old City of Jerusalem after a tense, weeklong standoff over the metal detectors and other restrictions.After the attack, in a rare move, Israel temporarily closed the contested and volatile holy site \u2014 which is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary \u2014 and emptied it of all workers while the police conducted searches.The Israeli government\u2019s decision to introduce metal detectors when the site reopened rapidly became a source of friction and a symbolic rallying cry in the contest for control and sovereignty over the sacred compound. In an extraordinary turn, members of the Waqf, the Muslim trust that administers the site, called for a boycott of prayers there for as long as the metal detectors remained in place.According to the Israeli police, only a few dozen worshipers entered the compound for prayers on Friday. Earlier in the day, bracing for a possible eruption of violence, the police announced that only men over the age of 50 would be allowed access. (Women of all ages were permitted.)On a regular Friday, the number of Muslims entering the site can reach tens of thousands. This week, the police turned back busloads of worshipers heading to the city from other parts of the country.\u201cThe metal detectors are a political issue,\u201d said Jamal Zahalka, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, outside the Old City on Friday. \u201cThey have them all over the world, in supermarkets, shopping malls, everywhere. But they are there by consensus, not imposed by somebody else.\u201dAs tension built, the Israeli cabinet met into the night on Thursday. Ministers decided to leave the metal detectors in place, despite recommendations to remove them by the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service, and by other security organizations.\u201cIsrael is committed to preserving the status quo at the Temple Mount and the freedom of access to the holy places,\u201d Israeli officials said in a statement after the cabinet meeting.Critics said that the government was evading responsibility for keeping the metal detectors in place by leaving the ultimate decision up to the police. The police issued a statement in the morning clarifying that entry to the site through metal detectors was \u201caccording to the decision of the highest political echelon,\u201d and that the police would decide how strict the security checks would be based on assessments of the situation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has come under pressure from right-wing members of his coalition, who urged him not to \u201ccave in\u201d to Palestinian protest and who said that removing the metal detectors would send a message of weakness and lack of resolve regarding Israeli control of the area.Israel captured East Jerusalem, along with its holy sites, from Jordan in the 1967 war and then annexed the area in a move that was never internationally recognized. Aware of the potentially explosive religious and political sensitivities, Israel allowed the Waqf to remain in charge of day-to-day affairs inside the mosque compound under the aegis of Jordan. Jordan\u2019s special role in administering the site was reaffirmed in its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.Majd Al Waheidi contributed reporting from Gaza.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia, had any involvement in setting up the meeting. His emails showed a different story.Mr. Goldstone is not exactly a savvy political operative. He was born in Manchester, England, and lives in New York. He is currently on what he has termed a \u201cgap year,\u201d during which he is traveling around the world.After President Trump won the election, Mr. Goldstone posted a photograph of himself wearing a shirt with the word Russia printed across the front. The caption: \u201cHedging bets.\u201d (Mr. Goldstone\u2019s Instagram account is now locked, and The Guardian reported that he took down the photo after a reporter tweeted about it.)Twitter users have been gleefully posting other details and comments. One dug up a shot of Mr. Goldstone this year in Manila, where he was a guest judge for Miss Universe and wore a shirt with \u201cSexy\u201d scrawled across it.Another highlighted a video in which Mr. Goldstone entered a clear chamber where money circled around him and tried to catch some of the paper bills.How good a publicist is Mr. Goldstone? His company website takes credit for several impressive events, including a Sting performance in Central Park, a Friars Club roast of Quentin Tarantino that was hosted by Samuel L.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Seatless Subway Cars", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 8:16 a.m.Good morning on this cloudy Thursday.That\u2019s right. To accommodate more passengers, subway officials will remove seats from a few trains on certain lines, possibly later this year, starting with a pilot program on the L train between Brooklyn and Manhattan and the shuttle train between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal.This isn\u2019t the first time that seatless train cars have been proposed.If the prospect of disappearing subway seats leaves you sentimental, you could always buy one as a keepsake.Here\u2019s what else is happening:The rest of the week is looking down, as far as weather goes.Clouds will cover our skyscrapers today, with thunderstorms and showers possible this evening. And whatever rain we\u2019re able to dodge tonight should make a statement \u2014 in a bigger way \u2014 tomorrow.Meh.Several readers offered humorous, less practical solutions. Most simply complained.Here\u2019s a selection:\u201cFewer seats is a solution? Why not just strap us on to the top of the cars and tell us to hold on for dear life?\u201d\u2014 Mitchell Feinman, 63, Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u201cRemoving seats is a horrible and inhumane idea. There are many elderly people, pregnant women, people with back and foot injuries, and just exhausted people who have to ride the train for over an hour just to get to work and they need those few seats.\u201d\u2014 Angie Wojak, 49, Inwood\u201cI have, more frequently than I want to acknowledge, heard a number of parents who say to their children, \u2018Here you sit down.\u2019 And I\u2019m so old that I still remember the campaign that they desperately need to bring back, \u2018Little enough to ride for free?

For the rest of us who spend over an hour per day on the subway, we need them to fix the signals to permit more trains to run more often and more dependably.

{"Headline": "Flavors Cross Borders at Little Tong Noodle Shop", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosWheat noodles blur at the edges. At their core, they taste of cooked flour, or flour and egg, but toward the surface, they take on the flavor of their sauce. Think of pappardelle allied with a meaty rag\u00f9, or spools of ramen entwined with pork broth, throwing off starch, drinking in soup. Their boundaries dissolve.Rice noodles have very little flavor of their own and generally don\u2019t take on much, either. They tend to make a hard break with their surrounding flavors; the more intense those flavors, the more welcome the break. They are almost pure texture.Little Tong Noodle Shop plunges mixian into soups and sauces that make a definite impression. Yunnan shares borders with Tibet, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos; northern Thailand is not too far, either. The characteristic Southeast Asian tension of saltiness, sourness and chile heat creeps into these noodle bowls. They are buoyed by green herbs, too, by mint and cilantro, and by the tendency of the chef, Simone Tong, to twist contrasting strands of flavor together.Fundamentally, the banna shrimp mixian is a tomato soup, removed from Campbell\u2019s reach by a whiff of smoke and a slight taste of shrimp and crab shells. Wheels of pickled green chiles add not just heat but depth; there are fried shallots, too, and fresh mint, stirred in along with coconut.In the grandma chicken mixian, a dark and grainy oil slick \u2014 a distillation of garlic and black sesame \u2014 dyes and deepens a chicken broth that is already so full-bodied it\u2019s almost sticky. Resting on top of the rice noodles is chicken confit, which, in terms of moistness and flavor, is the exact opposite of the desiccated, used-up meat typically found in chicken soups. There are spicy red bits of fermented chile, some salty and sour pickles, an egg boiled in pu-erh tea, and long ivory chrysanthemum petals. It has to be the most interesting chicken noodle soup in the city right now.Another soup, the \u201clittle pot\u201d mixian, tastes something like a spicy miso ramen that has shed its excess weight and picked up extra flavors. Chopped shiitakes and pork belly sit on the surface of the salty, milky pork broth, along with garlic chives and minced stems of pickled mustard greens. If this had been ramen, I would have left some noodles behind, but I finished this bowl, all of it, in an astonished haze, and didn\u2019t regret it.Little Tong Noodle Shop is Ms. Tong\u2019s first restaurant as chef. She is also an owner. It is a modest place in many ways. The drinks list offers one red, one white, one ros\u00e9 and a handful of beers and sakes. (The best choice may be Yunnanese tea.)There are 28 indoor seats, some pale wood slats on one wall, and exposed brick on another. The Noodle Shop does not necessarily invite comparisons to a more famous Noodle Bar three doors south on First Avenue, but it does not exactly discourage comparisons to David Chang\u2019s restaurant, either.It\u2019s easier to see an American chef\u2019s sensibility in the section of the menu called \u201clittle eats,\u201d which are free of noodles and give Ms. Tong a chance to evoke Yunnan with East Coast ingredients. She coaxes impressive flavors from a small amount of cold Chinese broccoli dressed in citrus soy, with a salty, crunchy and smoky dusting of grated egg yolk. The \u201cmini stir fry,\u201d a seasonal improvisation, was made recently with fiddlehead ferns, pine nuts and tender, lime-green needles from the spring tips of spruce branches.They eat flowers in Yunnan, and Ms. Tong seems to recognize the value, in the age of Instagram, of a strategically deployed blossom or two. (They eat insects in Yunnan, too, but you don\u2019t see her garnishing plates with deep-fried bamboo grubs.) In the case of the excellent egg drop soup, the stray petals had less presence than the corn kernels and salmon roe and the rags of cooked egg whites in the translucent broth.But I liked the peppery bite that chrysanthemum brought to the grandma chicken mixian and found the rose petals on the Yunnan salad to be more than just decorative. You will think this salad belongs in a trattoria when I tell you that it is composed mainly of radicchio and prosciutto, but no Italian would then go on to add fresh pineapple and boiled beef tendon.One night I ate peanut butter cookies for dessert. I\u2019ve never seen them again. Where in Yunnan they came from, I don\u2019t know; where they\u2019ve gone, I can only guess. My latest meal there ended with six flavors of fruit sorbet in gumball-size scoops topped, of course, with edible flowers.The noodles cost either $14 or $15, except for one special, which is $16. Every appetizer is under $10 except the chopped raw beef, which is dressed with shallot oil and chile oil and can be spread on flaky, oily scallion bread with a daub of Sichuan-spiced beef fat or a swipe of smoked egg yolk. For this I paid $13 without griping. In fact, because Little Tong\u2019s prices include service, they all seemed too low to be real.I wouldn\u2019t mind if Ms. Tong asked $16 or $17 for noodles, rather than charging $1 each for chile oil, chile soy sauce and fermented chiles. People in Yunnan like to doctor their broth to taste from a whole range of condiments and spices; it\u2019s part of the experience. Ms. Tong has a precise palate, I think, but there were times when I wanted to recalibrate the broth.Little Tong Noodle Shop is strict about not seating incomplete parties, even when the place is empty. Once you have a table, though, the servers are quick and sympathetic.The dining room is overseen by Emmeline Zhao, who has the twin titles of general manager and panda caretaker. One of the sakes comes in a glass decorated with painted pandas, like an old Welch\u2019s jelly jar. Panda art hangs in the front window, and if you are ever called on to administer the Heimlich maneuver to a panda, the custom-drawn choking poster by the restroom door should provide all the information you need.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Esperanza Spalding Will Record \u2018Exposure\u2019 in Front of the World", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week at Carnegie Hall, Esperanza Spalding was slashing through a tangle of chord changes on her fretless electric bass. Behind her was a four-piece band; behind it, a symphony orchestra.But recently Ms. Spalding, 32, has grown a little wary of her own ambitions, and for her next album, which she announced on Wednesday, she is heading straight to the creative source. Starting the morning of Sept. 12, she will spend 77 straight hours in the studio, bringing with her a few musicians but no pre-written songs. Over those roughly three days, she will write, arrange and record a full-length album, \u201cExposure,\u201d while streaming the experience live to a web audience. She is aiming to finish 10 songs, most with lyrics.\u201cI think of it creatively as a context where you give all that\u2019s been cooking in there permission to come out at will,\u201d she said last week over Mexican food near her home in Brooklyn. \u201cI thought: I just need a break from framing. I\u2019m tired of backing everything up and explaining why this character does this and that.\u201dIf the three-day live stream sounds like a bit of a gimmick, Ms. Spalding sees it as a way to cancel out the noise of promotion and profit-chasing that often surrounds the recording process.In the past, she said, she has felt pressure from executives at Concord Music Group, her label, to change the choice of songs on an album, or to add a featured guest that will help her reach new audiences. (She has mostly resisted the suggestions.)\u201cYou\u2019re hard-pressed to find an artist, especially a commercial artist, who\u2019s able to create without the constraints of being able to prove that what you\u2019re making is going to earn \u2018us\u2019 money \u2014 us being the bank,\u201d Ms. Spalding said.John Burk, the president of Concord Records, said, \u201cWe believe in Esperanza 100 percent\u201d and called the live-stream project \u201cbold,\u201d adding that the label deserves to have some role in the recording process. \u201cWe view ourselves as partners; we\u2019ll have dialogue about things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not our philosophy to try and force her to do things that don\u2019t work for her creatively.\u201dBut with \u201cExposure\u201d Ms. Spalding is seeking \u201can environment where those factors are taken out,\u201d she said. \u201cI somehow convinced the label to pay for this, and I\u2019m eternally grateful for that. And they can\u2019t do anything about what happens, because the record is being made as we do this thing.\u201dMs. Spalding will record \u201cExposure\u201d entirely in the allotted 77 hours. She will mix and master it in the weeks after the live stream takes place, and she expects to release the album by midfall. Concord agreed to a limited release, and it will come out only on CD and vinyl \u2014 not digitally \u2014 which helps her sidestep demands to maximize her audience. (A total of 7,777 physical albums will be sold.)Ms. Spalding says she\u2019s aiming only for the listeners who are game for a personal journey, offering a raw and less manicured glimpse at her creativity.In preparation for \u201cExposure,\u201d she has been practicing composing quickly, which may mean more simply. She has found that when she limits her editing brain, she doesn\u2019t venture as far from the initial source of inspiration \u2014 which also means self-censoring less.\u201cI might be wrong during \u2018Exposure\u2019 and fall flat on my face, but it\u2019s because I believe my best stuff will come out in that context,\u201d she said.(Fans can get a preview of the material she has written using this new practice when she plays at the Prospect Park Bandshell in Brooklyn this Friday; she will be sharing the bill with Andrew Bird.)It all relates to a philosophy of direct expression \u2014 one that Ms. Spalding will bring to her new post at Harvard. She has been teaching in some fashion for over a decade, and she often tells students that in order to speak honestly in your own voice, you have to control the urge to plan everything out.\u201cOnly play in response to what you just played \u2014 and if you lose your focus, then only play in response to that,\u201d she tells students. This helps them focus on a conversational flow, maintaining contact with the energy of the moment rather than wandering through some calculated narrative. \u201cThey get in touch with what they already have going on. Which is a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On London\u2019s Streets, Black Cabs and Uber Fight for a Future", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "London\u2019s cabby wars are less about the disruptive power of an app, or a new business model, than about the disruption of Britain.Supported byLONDON \u2014 Shortly before 6 a.m., Zahra Bakkali tiptoed out of her bedroom for morning prayers. She prepared breakfast (black tea and toast with olive oil), saw her children off to school, then rode the elevator to the garage below her southeast London housing project. She unlocked her white Toyota Prius, switched on the Uber app and awaited the day\u2019s first job.In a modest bungalow on the opposite side of the city, Paul Walsh had coffee and toast with butter. He studied the sports pages (his soccer team, Queens Park Rangers, had been struggling) and waved goodbye to his wife and son. Then he fired up his black cab, which is actually half-pink with an Elvis ad from the Memphis tourism board, and set off for Heathrow Airport.They travel the same streets every day, strangers but also adversaries in what has become a familiar 21st-century conflict: the sharp-elbowed ride-hailing company Uber, versus entrenched taxi companies.And yet the clash in London is different, less about the disruptive power of an app, or a new business model, than about the disruption of Britain. London\u2019s cabby wars echo the culture wars that fueled Britain\u2019s vote last summer to leave the European Union \u2014 and that have brutally flared up again in recent weeks: immigrant versus native, old versus new, global versus national.Uber arrived in 2012, just before the London Olympics, but its 40,000 drivers already far outnumber the city\u2019s 21,000 traditional cabbies. They use satellite navigation to find their way around. Most of them are nonwhite, and many, like Mrs. Bakkali, are immigrants.Uber fares are about 30 percent lower than those of black cabs \u2014 a discrepancy that cabbies say signals a deliberate attempt to kill off their trade. \u201cLondon without black cabs,\u201d Mr. Walsh said, \u201cwould be like London without Big Ben.\u201dThe vote to leave the European Union, known here as Brexit, exposed a deep rift between those who have profited from globalization, sometimes spectacularly, and those who feel threatened by immigration and automation. Six out of 10 Londoners, including Mrs. Bakkali, voted against Brexit. But Mr. Walsh and most black-cab drivers interviewed for this article voted in favor.Mrs. Bakkali, the daughter of Moroccan farmers, and Mr. Walsh, the son of a north London construction worker, are small players in these much bigger dramas. They want the same thing: to claw their way into the middle class and give their children a shot at a better life. Yet they are on opposite sides of a kind of low-level guerrilla warfare on London\u2019s streets.\u201cThey drive up to you so close, you find yourself going through a red light,\u201d Mrs. Bakkali said of black cabs she had encountered. The drivers give the middle finger, she said, and shout abuse. And they certainly \u201cnever give way.\u201d Some black cabs have offensive cartoons on display. One even had a custom license plate: \u201cH8 UBER.\u201dFor Mrs. Bakkali, black cabs have become a byword for populism and racism. For Mr. Walsh, Uber is shorthand for everything he believes is wrong with globalization \u2014 and proof that successive governments have failed hard-working citizens like him.\u201cLook at all those cabdrivers, we are all from poor families,\u201d he recalled telling the minister, Sajid Javid, then the business secretary. \u201cI wanted to be my own boss. I\u2019ve done everything you said I should do. And you\u2019ve pulled the rug from under my feet.\u201d\u201cIn London, driving a cab is a vocation,\u201d Mr. Walsh said one morning in April. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201dHe drove past the Union Jack pub, then right, then left and into a hidden courtyard with everything a cabby could want: gas, parking, spare parts and a canteen that serves an all-day fried English breakfast.In other cities, the latest immigrant group to arrive takes up the taxi trade, Mr. Walsh said. Not here. \u201cFirst you invest several years studying,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen you invest 45,000 pounds in your cab,\u201d or about $58,000.Uber, he said, is not just killing a business model: \u201cIt\u2019s killing a culture.\u201dMr. Walsh proudly conforms to most stereotypes about London cabbies. Opinionated, witty and full of trivia about his city, he claims to be able to \u201cspeak for two minutes on any subject.\u201dInside the canteen, Chelsea was playing Sunderland on two flat-screen televisions. There was vinegar on the table and spotted dick on the menu. The place could not be more British. Except that the entire staff seemed to be Eastern European.A lot of Poles now live where Mr. Walsh grew up, in Harlesden, northwest London. When he was a boy in the 1960s and \u201970s, most children in the neighborhood were either black or had Irish roots, as he did: \u201cPlastic Dreads or plastic Paddies,\u201d said Mr. Walsh, now 53.His father worked in construction and his mother in a cookie factory, but they saved up and moved the family to Wembley, a more middle-class area. \u201cMy parents were aspirational and brought me up that way,\u201d he said.Earning a taxi badge was a ticket to upward mobility, but it required mastering the Knowledge. The dropout rate is 70 percent. Six days a week, Mr. Walsh would crisscross London on a scooter memorizing roughly 2,000 miles of road. He had regular 20-minute \u201cappearances\u201d \u2014 oral tests with examiners \u201cwho put the fear of the devil\u201d into him, he said. One of them had a wooden parrot on the windowsill and a stuffed Persian cat on his desk, \u201clike a James Bond villain,\u201d he recalled.\u201cHe would sit against the window \u2014 you\u2019d only see his silhouette, and it looked like the parrot was on his shoulder,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cThen he would grill you on the most obscure routes.\u201dAt night, Mr. Walsh dreamed of London and woke up sweating. Texas Legation to Union Chapel. Cumberland Market to Redhill Street. Policeman\u2019s Hook to Trinity Church. \u201cYou live and breathe the Knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes over your brain.\u201dHe got his badge on Nov. 10, 1994, a Thursday. It had taken him nearly three years, one year less than the average, and he was as proud as he had ever been.\u201cThree years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then Uber turned the Knowledge into an app.\u201dOn a sunny Thursday morning last June, one week before Britain voted to leave the European Union, Mrs. Bakkali dropped off her youngest child at school and then sat in her car, staring at the Uber app. She hesitated and finally turned it on. It was her first day on the job.She had come to London in 1997, at age 18, unable to read or write or drive, with a new husband she barely knew. Her husband, the son of Moroccan immigrants who had arrived in London in the 1960s, had escorted her from a village without electricity in the mountains behind Marrakesh to a new, unimaginable life. To mark the occasion, her mother-in-law had paid for a black cab from Heathrow Airport back to East Street Market in southeast London, her new home.Mrs. Bakkali had never left her country before, never taken an airplane, never even owned a passport. Asked for her signature, she could make only a clumsy doodle.Now 38, Mrs. Bakkali is hungry for education. She takes a weekly mathematics class at a community college in Westminster, her \u201cWednesday treat.\u201d She began taking English classes after giving birth to her first daughter, who is now 18 and plans to study math at university next year.\u201cGirls in my village were not allowed,\u201d she said of schooling.In 2010, Mrs. Bakkali was eight months pregnant with her fifth child, with her twins in a stroller and a child on each arm, when the bus driver, a black man, hissed at her, \u201cYou bloody foreigners, you come to this country and just keep having babies.\u201dIt was not the first time. \u201cI just started crying,\u201d Mrs. Bakkali recalled.That night, she told her husband they needed to buy a car, and he needed to learn to drive, because she never wanted to take public transportation again. Afraid of driving, he refused. So she got her own license.Mrs. Bakkali loved driving. About a year ago, over breakfast, she confessed her dream: to become a bus driver.\u201cWhat about Uber?\u201d her husband asked.They went online and booked an appointment for the next morning, a Sunday. By lunchtime she had registered with Uber, heard a presentation, taken an online topography test, received a certificate from the company and applied for the obligatory government background check. It took a few weeks to get a \u201cprivate hire license\u201d from Transport for London, the city\u2019s transportation regulator.Then she was, in Uber speak, \u201conboarded.\u201dBig Ben had just chimed 11 a.m. in its familiar jingle when Mr. Walsh was navigating his cab around Parliament Square, past Westminster Abbey and into an alleyway leading to the headquarters of the governing Conservative Party.A small but noisy crowd of cabbies were already demonstrating outside the building\u2019s main entrance. Their signs and slogans blamed Uber for an array of wrongs, including pollution and rape \u2014 and the government for siding with Uber.Rachel Whetstone, who was a senior executive at Uber until April, is married to Steve Hilton, a close friend of, and once an adviser to, former Prime Minister David Cameron. When Boris Johnson, as mayor of London, considered clamping down on Uber in 2015, for example by imposing a minimum waiting time of five minutes on riders, some 200,000 Londoners signed a petition in protest and he was reportedly told to back off.\u201cIt stinks,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. (Uber denied that Ms. Whetstone\u2019s close ties to Mr. Cameron had any impact on the mayor\u2019s decision.)Mr. Cameron campaigned to stay in the European Union, which is one reason that many cabbies voted to leave. \u201cUber loves Europe,\u201d Mr. Walsh said.\u201cYou basically have governments and big business in bed together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only loser is the working class.\u201dThe protesters slowly marched toward Victoria Street and the headquarters of Transport for London, or T.F.L. Cabbies say that T.F.L. stands for Totally Failing London.\u201cLook,\u201d said Mr. Walsh, who was back in his cab and now following the march by road. \u201cLondon has a great history of taking in refugees: the Huguenots, the Russians, the Jews after World War II,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a difference between refugees and economic migrants.\u201d\u201cThey come here and push down our living standards,\u201d he said. \u201cThere comes a day where you have to say, \u2018Stop.\u2019\u201d\u201cBrexit\u201d was just that, he said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Stop.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a racist thing,\u201d Mr. Walsh added. \u201cLots of cabbies are Jewish and Irish.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s wages have gone up in the 10 years since the crash, and everyone who\u2019s coming here is getting it on a plate.\u201dHe pulled out his phone to check his Facebook feed. A popular bagel shop on Brick Lane in East London had signed up with Uber Eats, the company\u2019s delivery service. Some drivers were calling for a boycott on the Facebook group Save Our Black Taxis.\u201cThat\u2019s your black cab trade gone,\u201d one comment read, followed by more of the same:\u201cI don\u2019t need Uber poison.\u201d\u201cFreaking disgraceful.\u201dUber says it receives hundreds of complaints a month from its drivers about abuse from cabbies. Some comments are rude (\u201cUber slave!\u201d); many are racist (\u201cGo back to your country!\u201d).Sometimes when a customer cancels, Mrs. Bakkali worries that it is because she is Muslim. In her photograph on the Uber app, she wears a head scarf discreetly tied at the back of her neck.There are several Muslim women on Mrs. Bakkali\u2019s WhatsApp group Uber Super Ladies (women make up a small minority of Uber drivers and cabdrivers). Some of them met at a party Uber held for them on International Women\u2019s Day. They shared pastries and stories about the relentless hostility coming from cabbies.\u201cThey have all these advantages,\u201d Mrs. Bakkali said: Black cabs can use bus lanes and taxi stands, and be hailed on the street, \u201cbut they are angry with us.\u201dOne friend, also a Muslim woman, was so shaken by a recent encounter that she almost quit. A cabdriver had gotten out of his taxi and come toward her car, waving a fist and shouting: \u201cYou Muslim, you can\u2019t even drive! Take off that scarf!\u201dMrs. Bakkali recently had a polite exchange with a cabby, a man from Somalia, who rolled down his window at a red light.\u201cSalaam aleikum, sister,\u201d he told her, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re taking our business.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my business, too,\u201d she replied.\u201cHow is it, sister? Small money?\u201d\u201cSometimes big, sometimes small.\u201dMrs. Bakkali once earned \u00a3340 in a single shift, working 20 hours straight. She dropped off her last customer in Weybridge, west of London, at 6:30 a.m., then found a parking lot, locked her car doors and napped before turning the app back on and making her way home.On average, though, she takes home closer to \u00a3300 a week after paying for insurance, gas and twice-weekly carwashes. Earning and controlling her own money for the first time is liberating, she says, but even with her husband\u2019s income from a part-time supermarket job, the family relies on benefits like subsidized housing.\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she admitted.Last year, Uber raised its commission on every ride to 25 percent, from 20, for new drivers. Mrs. Bakkali recently went to a drivers\u2019 meeting at Uber\u2019s biggest \u201cGreenlight Hub,\u201d or drivers\u2019 center, in London. The room was packed. Everybody had the same urgent plea: Could Uber cut its commission back to 20 percent?The answer was no.\u201cThey love riders more than drivers,\u201d Mrs. Bakkali said. When she took two weeks off around Easter, she found that in the days after, few jobs were sent her way. Her earnings were halved. \u201cThe app punishes you for taking breaks,\u201d she said. (Uber denies that its algorithm deliberately penalizes breaks, but all Uber drivers interviewed for this article believe that it does.)Mr. Walsh says that the cabbies\u2019 fight is with Uber \u2014 not with its drivers. \u201cWe see them sleep in their cars,\u201d he said. \u201cUber is turning the time back to the Victorian era.\u201dHe was having a cup of tea with fellow cabdrivers outside a small green wooden hut near Buckingham Palace, one of 13 remaining \u201ccabmen\u2019s shelters\u201d dating from the days when cabs were still horse-drawn coaches.One cabby recently sold his taxi because there was not enough work. He is leasing one now but may quit altogether, he said. \u201cMost weeks you\u2019re just trying to cover your costs.\u201dBefore Uber, Mr. Walsh would have 20 fares a day. Now the number is closer to five. \u201cThey want to price us out of the market,\u201d he said, \u201cand then they\u2019ll raise prices \u2014 you watch.\u201dAnd when cars go driverless, he added bitterly, \u201ccabbies and Uber drivers will both be history.\u201dMrs. Bakkali shrugs at the idea. She grew up without running water or a phone. To visit her grandparents, she had to walk \u2014 for a day.\u201cSo much has changed in my life,\u201d she said. If someday driving is no longer an option, she may start her own business, she said. Embroidery, perhaps, or sewing.\u201cCabdrivers\u2019 brains are bigger,\u201d Mr. Walsh said proudly.Navigation systems do not know nicknames like the Policeman\u2019s Hook. They cannot deal with incomplete addresses and do not know the best shortcuts when traffic is bad. And they cannot tell you where to buy the best salt beef bagels.\u201cWe\u2019re still better than the machines,\u201d he said. \u201cBut who will come and protect us?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS, Despite Heavy Losses, Still Inspires Global Attacks", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Three years ago, a black-clad cleric named Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ascended a mosque pulpit in the Iraqi city of Mosul and addressed the world as leader of a new terrorist state.The announcement of the so-called caliphate was a high point for the extremist fighters of the Islamic State. Their exhibitionist violence and apocalyptic ideology helped them seize vast stretches of territory in Syria and Iraq, attract legions of foreign fighters and create an administration with bureaucrats, courts and oil wells.Now, their state is crumbling.In Syria, American-backed militias have surrounded Raqqa, the group\u2019s capital, and breached its historic walls. Across the border, Iraqi forces have seized the remains of the Mosul mosque where Mr. Baghdadi appeared and besieged the remaining jihadists in a shrinking number of city blocks.But the loss of its two largest cities will not spell a final defeat for the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh \u2014 according to analysts and American and Middle Eastern officials. The group has already shifted back to its roots as an insurgent force, but one that now has an international reach and an ideology that continues to motivate attackers around the world.\u201cThese are obviously major blows to ISIS because its state-building project is over, there is no more caliphate, and that will diminish support and recruits,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington and a co-author of a book on the group. \u201cBut ISIS today is an international organization. Its leadership and its ability to grow back are still there.\u201dThe Islamic State has overshadowed its jihadist precursors like Al Qaeda by not just holding territory, but by running cities and their hinterlands for an extended period, winning the group credibility in the militant world and allowing it to build a complex organization.So even while its physical hold slips, its surviving cadres \u2014 middle managers, weapons technicians, propagandists and other operatives \u2014 will invest that experience in the group\u2019s future operations.And even though its hold on crucial urban centers is being shaken, the Islamic State is in no way homeless yet.In Iraq, the group still controls Tal Afar, Hawija, other towns and much of Anbar Province. In Syria, most of its top operatives have fled Raqqa in the past six months for other towns still under ISIS control in the Euphrates River valley, according to American and Western military and counterterrorism officials who have received intelligence briefings.Many have relocated to Mayadeen, a town 110 miles southeast of Raqqa near oil facilities and with supply lines through the surrounding desert. They have taken with them the group\u2019s most important recruiting, financing, propaganda and external operations functions, American officials said. Other leaders have been spirited out of Raqqa by a trusted network of aides to a string of towns from Deir al-Zour to Abu Kamal.American Special Operations forces have targeted this area heavily with armed Reaper drones and attack planes, disrupting and damaging the Islamic State\u2019s leadership and ability to carry out plots. But the battle for Raqqa still could last many months.It is all a new chapter in the history of a group whose roots go back to the United States\u2019 invasion of Iraq in 2003.Fighting under various names and leaders, the Sunni militants who would evolve into the Islamic State killed many Iraqis and American troops before Sunni tribal fighters paid by the United States decimated them, driving the survivors underground by the time the United States withdrew from Iraq in 2011.But new conflicts provided new opportunities. After the outbreak of the civil war in Syria in 2011, the group dispatched operatives there to build the force that later seized the country\u2019s east, including Raqqa, which became its administrative capital.Then it turned its sights back to Iraq, seizing Mosul in 2014, where Mr. Baghdadi made clear what distinguished his followers from Al Qaeda: They were not just insurgents, but also the founders of a state infused with extremist ideology.Now, senior American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say that more than 60,000 Islamic State fighters have been killed since June 2014, including much of the group\u2019s leadership, and that the group has lost about two-thirds of its peak territory.But those officials, including Lt. Gen. Michael K. Nagata, one of the Army\u2019s top Special Operations officers, also acknowledged that the Islamic State had retained much of its ability to inspire, enable and direct terrorist attacks.Internationally, the Islamic State has partly compensated for its losses at home by encouraging affiliates abroad \u2014 in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria and the Philippines \u2014 and by activating operatives elsewhere.Between 100 and 250 ideologically driven foreigners are thought to have been smuggled into Europe from late 2014 to mid-2016, nearly all through Turkey after crossing a now rigidly enforced border, European intelligence officials say.But they may not be the most dangerous threat facing the European authorities as long as Islamic State ideology continues to motivate attackers.Most were citizens of the countries they chose to strike.Since the Islamic State\u2019s rise, the United States and its allies have focused on breaking the group\u2019s control of territory, but much less planning has gone into how communities damaged by jihadist rule will be rebuilt and governed afterward. Indeed, the jihadists\u2019 departure could accelerate other conflicts.In Syria, the United States has armed and supported a militia called the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., to fight the jihadists. Most of its leaders are Kurds, many with roots in the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which the United States and Turkey consider a terrorist organization.The group\u2019s ascendance has angered Turkey, which considers it a threat, as well as many Syrian Arabs, who see it as a front for Kurdish empowerment at their expense. It also remains unclear how the bodies set up to govern areas seized from the jihadists can be financed so they can rebuild, restore services and provide security.The administration of President Trump has shown little interest in such measures, although experts consider them necessary to prevent the jihadists from returning.\u201cThere is a tension in the U.S. approach, to avoid extended commitments and nation-building on one hand and the need to prevent the possibility of a jihadist resurgence in the future on the other,\u201d said Noah Bonsey, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.In Iraq, the defeat of the Islamic State in Mosul sets the stage for new power struggles between the central government in Baghdad and the Kurds, who have taken control of the contested, oil-rich city of Kirkuk and plan to vote on independence later this year.The fight against the Islamic State has also fueled the proliferation of Shiite militias, many of which are funded by Iran and are driven by a sectarian creed that has marginalized and worried Sunnis.Many fear that with poor governance and sectarianism still the rule in Syria and Iraq, some reconstituted form of the Islamic State\u2019s extreme Sunni Islamism could yet find support.\u201cAll of these conditions in the end form the basic environment for the group,\u201d said Hassan Abu Haniyeh, a Jordanian expert in extremist groups. \u201cThey formed the environment for it to start and spread, and now they are increasing, not decreasing.\u201dThe caliphate also lives on in the virtual realm, as its operatives and supporters churn out propaganda, bomb manuals, encryption guides and suggestions for how to kill the largest number of people with trucks.Its members have played down their losses, portraying them as mere setbacks in the long-term, worldwide battle against those who reject their ideology.\u201cO brothers, I call upon you to rise up wherever you are and to surround them and monitor them, then attack them and kill them,\u201d a Chechen suicide bomber said in a video released posthumously last month. \u201cThe disbelievers have gathered today from every faith and attacked the caliphate, but this had only added to our faith and courage.\u201dAmerican officials acknowledged the difficulty of fighting the group online.\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,\u201d Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump\u2019s Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser, said last Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re proselytizing. It\u2019s troubling.\u201dStill, many Syrians and Iraqis whose lives the jihadists have ravaged are glad to see them chased out, despite worries about the future.\u201cI am happy that Daesh is dying, but the fear of what might come next is killing this happiness,\u201d said Ahmed Abdul-Qadir, a Raqqa native who was running an anti-jihadist media group in Turkey when gunmen he believes belonged to the Islamic State shot him in the jaw. He is now in France, and he communicated via Facebook chat because he is between surgeries that have made it hard to speak.\u201cIt makes me wish that this whole organization would vanish and that no one who believes in its doctrine would remain alive,\u201d he said.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alfred Angelo Bridal Chain Closes. Scrambling Ensues.", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese Bridezillas have a legitimate excuse.The closings added an element of panic to a wedding process often filled with stress, and brides and bridesmaids shared their exasperation on Twitter and Facebook. They rushed to figure out the status of their orders, and store employees were left trying to explain the situation.Cyndi Whitten of Houston, whose daughter had ordered a $1,500 gown from Alfred Angelo for her wedding in October, said: \u201cThis has turned into the most difficult and stressful part of the whole thing. You just wanted to sit there and burst into tears because your daughter\u2019s easy part of the wedding isn\u2019t so easy.\u201dThe company, which opened in 1933, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Patricia Redmond, a lawyer who represents Alfred Angelo, did not return a phone call.In a letter to customers obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Redmond wrote that the company would \u201cencourage\u201d the bankruptcy trustee to \u201cfinish and fulfill as many orders as possible.\u201d\u201cThe company regrets that this action will have dramatic impact on you,\u201d Ms. Redmond wrote in the letter.Despite the uproar after the store closings, Alfred Angelo has said nothing about the situation publicly. Some customers realized that the company had shut down after finding signs posted on locked store doors.A private company based in Delray Beach, Fla., Alfred Angelo sold its dresses at 1,400 other retailers, in addition to operating its own stores, according to its website. Like other bridal companies, it has faced pressure from bridal fashion start-ups and traditional retailers pushing low prices. In its bankruptcy filing, the company said it had no more than $50,000 in assets, but more than $50 million in liabilities.Alfred Angelo\u2019s failure led Alex Pacifico and her co-workers at the company\u2019s bridal store near Dayton, Ohio, to spend Thursday essentially running a guerrilla retail operation. They scrambled to get customers gowns they had ordered and told customers to take sample items they had on hand.\u201cIf we had what customers needed in the store, they were more than welcome to take it with them,\u201d she said.But other brides-to-be and members of their wedding parties were not so lucky.Christine Danielle, who also lives in Houston, ordered a dress from the bridal retailer in May to wear to a wedding. As of Friday afternoon, she had been unable to figure out where the $195 dress was.\u201cThere\u2019s no dress in sight, no refund in sight,\u201d Ms. Danielle said.Along with the brides, employees at Alfred Angelo were also left in the lurch. Pacifico worried that she would not get paid for hours worked this week and will lose out on sales commissions.She said the closing left some customers angry, blaming the workers for the situation. The employees at the Dayton store worked for about 12 hours that day \u2014 for no pay \u2014 trying to help customers, Ms. Pacifico said.\u201cThey cussed us out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey called us names. It\u2019s a very frustrating situation for all parties.\u201dMs. Whitten, the mother in Houston, said she and her daughter started hearing on social media and bridal chat boards that Alfred Angelo might be closing its stores. Her boss let her off work an hour early on Thursday so she could visit the store where her daughter had purchased a gown.When she arrived at the store around 5:30 p.m., the clerk who had helped her daughter let Ms. Whitten into the locked store. The clerk said she remembered Ms. Whitten\u2019s daughter and found a sample dress in the same style.\u201cShe put it in a bag and said, \u2018There, it\u2019s yours now,\u2019\u201d Ms. Whitten said.On Friday morning, the family got a phone call from a clerk \u2014 the store had found her actual dress.\u201cThey gave us one hour this morning, at 9 a.m., to get there and pick it up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a happy ending. It was very unexpected.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Civil War in the Democratic Party", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs Democrats try to unite around their new \u201cBetter Deal\u201d agenda, the supposed battle between the \u201csocialist\u201d left and the \u201ccorporatist\u201d center seems to have collapsed into a bland but serviceable slogan, with a reasonably progressive economic agenda that both Senators Elizabeth Warren and Charles Schumer can get behind. So much for that overhyped party civil war.But Democrats shouldn\u2019t be trumpeting party unity quite yet. The economic-left-versus-center debate has always been primarily an elite one.Among the Democratic rank-and-file, the more consequential divide is between those willing to trust the existing establishment and those who want entirely new leadership. It\u2019s a divide that Democratic Party leaders ignore at their peril.But I did find one area of notable discord between Clinton and Sanders supporters \u2014 their degree of disaffection with political institutions. Support for the political system correlated with positive feelings toward Mrs. Clinton, while voters who felt negatively toward the political system tended to feel positively toward Mr. Sanders.Most members of the Democratic Party establishment are pragmatists who made it where they are by working within the system that exists, not the one they wish existed. They often have frustration bordering on contempt for those who lack their hardheaded realism.No wonder many voters distrust institutions and the establishment. Their engagement with the party mostly consists of receiving fund-raising emails intended to enforce programmatic conformity while activating fear of and resentment toward the other party.Republicans have already suffered the costs of feeding their supporters a toxic diet of anti-Democratic Party propaganda. They wound up with Mr. Trump as their standard-bearer. Democrats should not make that mistake.What if, instead of spending billions on consultants, TV ads and mailers engineered to stoke zero-sum partisanship, party leaders and affiliated funders invested in increasing the paid staff of local party organizations, and then sought their input and advice?With a real investment, community organizations could help Democratic voters feel genuinely invested in their party, including giving them more of a role in helping to develop and select local candidates. Voters might gain more appreciation for the actual challenges of winning a majority \u2014 rather than just shouting about how the party establishment is corrupt from their Facebook pages.They\u2019d also help Democratic Party leaders get a better feel for what communities across the country are thinking, rather than relying on high-priced consultants with data analysis that is too often a lagging indicator or just \u201cproves\u201d what the consultants have been saying for decades. If Democrats had invested in meaningful community organizing in 2016, they might have detected the crumbling of the \u201cblue wall\u201d (states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, which had voted Democratic in recent elections) sooner, and been able to adjust course.If Democrats need to moderate their message for 2018, local organizers will probably know it, and have a sense of how. If Democrats need to sharpen their message to motivate reluctant supporters, these organizers should know that, too.Finally, this investment would improve turnout. People are much more likely to get involved and vote when there\u2019s genuine social pressure from people they know (not just random volunteers parachuting into town or calling on the telephone).Ultimately, the challenge the Democrats face in their party is the challenge of democracy writ large. If voters feel that institutions are not responsive to them, and they have no say in how those institutions are run, powerlessness and resentment have a tendency to erupt in unpredictable and destructive ways.Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, is the author of \u201cThe Business of America Is Lobbying: How Corporations Became Politicized and Politics Became More Corporate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The multiple sexual assaults and domestic violence, the drugs I used to numb myself to my reality (I\u2019ve been clean, should you wonder, for well over a decade), the number of times I got within a hair of killing myself because I was so exhausted I didn\u2019t know if I could go forward any longer \u2014 there\u2019s no real way to bring up this part of my life in most social situations. If I do speak up, I risk being looked at as if I\u2019m a particularly pitiable three-headed demon, an object of praise (\u201cYou\u2019re so strong!\u201d) that nobody actually wants to touch. This is what made me obsessed with true crime.People who have survived trauma are often avidly attentive to true crime films, TV shows and podcasts because they help us reflect on the violence we\u2019ve experienced and put it into context. None of us glorify or fetishize serial killers, or see ourselves as far removed from those who inflict violence or those who are subject to it.True crime stories allow for a lack of resolution that police procedurals do not. Many true crime shows deal with unsolved cases or missing people who seemed to disappear in thin air, and even shows that take on solved cases often provide little in the way of definitive answers. Those of us who have experienced violence and find refuge in true crime are looking not for closure but for empathy, for understanding, for a world that doesn\u2019t turn its back on the fact that day-to-day violence exists, and that it is less freakish than banal.Ms. Hardstark\u2019s and Ms. Kilgariff\u2019s warmth and humanity are evident in every episode. They\u2019re thrilled when fans send them even the smallest handmade tokens, and they frequently own up to their own mistakes. (There is even a rather self-effacing \u201cCorrections Corner.\u201d) Fans have responded in kind; there are an endless number of \u201cMy Favorite Murder\u201d fan groups on Facebook, including a book group, a group for fans with pets, a group for fans who work in child protection and child welfare and a group for those who have had close encounters with violence.Until our society gets better at preventing violence, true crime stories will never be in short supply. And they will attract those far removed from the subjects and those of us who know violence all too well. We are all fascinated with our dark places. But as the genre continues to broaden and deepen, growing to cover a larger variety of experiences and perspectives, the films, books and podcasts that are well-researched, fair and empathetic will be the most fulfilling to those of us who know violence, who seek a place to breathe. We deserve stories that reveal what we know to be true about human nature \u2014 that all of us are capable of the most terrible acts, the most incredible resilience and everything in between.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Build Resilience in Midlife", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMuch of the scientific research on resilience \u2014 our ability to bounce back from adversity \u2014 has focused on how to build resilience in children. But what about the grown-ups?While resilience is an essential skill for healthy childhood development, science shows that adults also can take steps to boost resilience in middle age, which is often the time we need it most. Midlife can bring all kinds of stressors, including divorce, the death of a parent, career setbacks and retirement worries, yet many of us don\u2019t build the coping skills we need to meet these challenges.The good news is that some of the qualities of middle age \u2014 a better ability to regulate emotions, perspective gained from life experiences and concern for future generations \u2014 may give older people an advantage over the young when it comes to developing resilience, said Adam Grant, a management and psychology professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Scientists who study stress and resilience say it\u2019s important to think of resilience as an emotional muscle that can be strengthened at any time. While it\u2019s useful to build up resilience before a big or small crisis hits, there still are active steps you can take during and after a crisis to speed your emotional recovery.Last year Dr. Dennis Charney, a resilience researcher and dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, was leaving a deli when he was shot by a disgruntled former employee. Dr. Charney spent five days in intensive care and faced a challenging recovery.\u201cAfter 25 years of studying resilience, I had to be resilient myself,\u201d said Dr. Charney, co-author of the book \u201cResilience: The Science of Mastering Life\u2019s Greatest Challenges.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s good to be prepared for it, but it\u2019s not too late once you\u2019ve been traumatized to build the capability to move forward in a resilient way.\u201dHere are some of the ways you can build your resilience in middle age.While it sounds trivial, thinking positive thoughts and surrounding yourself with positive people really does help. Dr. Steven Southwick, a psychiatry professor at Yale Medical School and Dr. Charney\u2019s co-author, notes that optimism, like pessimism, can be infectious. His advice: \u201cHang out with optimistic people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about learning to recognize the explanatory story you tend to use in your life,\u201d Dr. Southwick said. \u201cObserve what you are saying to yourself and question it. It\u2019s not easy. It takes practice.\u201d\u201cTelling yourself that a situation is not personal, pervasive or permanent can be extremely useful,\u201d Dr. Grant said. \u201cThere is almost no failure that is totally personal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to relate to your former self than someone in another country,\u201d said Dr. Grant. \u201cLook back and say, \u2018I\u2019ve gone through something worse in the past. This is not the most horrible thing I have ever faced or will ever face. I know I can deal with it.\u2019\u201dSallie Krawcheck, a former Wall Street executive, said that after a very public firing, she reminded herself how fortunate she still was to have a healthy family and a financial cushion. While she has never studied resilience, she believes early challenges \u2014 like being bullied in middle school (\u201cIt was brutal,\u201d she said) and going through a painful divorce \u2014 helped her bounce back in her career as well. \u201cI just believe in comebacks,\u201d said Ms. Krawcheck, who recently founded Ellevest, an online investment platform for women. \u201cI see these setbacks as part of a journey and not a career-ending failure. There was nothing they could do to me on Wall Street that was as bad as seventh grade.\u201d\u201cAny way you can reach out and help other people is a way of moving outside of yourself, and this is an important way to enhance your own strength,\u201d said Dr. Southwick. \u201cPart of resilience is taking responsibility for your life, and for creating a life that you consider meaningful and purposeful. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big mission \u2014 it could be your family. As long as what you\u2019re involved in has meaning to you, that can push you through all sorts of adversity.\u201dThe key, Dr. Groppel said, is to recognize that you will never eliminate stress from your life. Instead create regular opportunities for the body to recover from stress \u2014 just as you would rest your muscles between weight lifting repetitions. Taking a walk break, spending five minutes to meditate or having lunch with a good friend are ways to give your mind and body a break from stress.\u201cStress is the stimulus for growth, and recovery is when the growth occurs,\u201d said Dr. Groppel. \u201cThat\u2019s how we build the resilience muscle.\u201d\u201cThere is a biology to this,\u201d said Dr. Charney. \u201cYour stress hormone systems will become less responsive to stress so you can handle stress better. Live your life in a way that you get the skills that enable you to handle stress.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Townes stayed briefly with the group but soon headed for the airport, where he took a red-eye flight back home.\u201cAll of a sudden, Mike was gone,\u201d Ms. Lewell said. \u201cI figured, \u2018Well, I live in Canada and he lives in South Carolina, that\u2019s the last I\u2019ve seen of that guy\u2019 \u2014 I was really sad to see him go.\u201dBut almost immediately, most of the group began chatting via Facebook, and Ms. Lewell and Mr. Townes embarked on sidebar conversations that highlighted such common interests as \u201cwonky politics,\u201d as Mr. Townes put it, as well as a love of travel, comic books and science fiction movies.\u201cShe was always on my mind,\u201d Mr. Townes said. \u201cMost of the things I texted her about were really just excuses to talk to her again.\u201dIndeed, she received a text when he took his two children \u2014 Annmarie, now 8, and Reeve, 12 \u2014 to a minor league hockey game, and another when he attended a 50th anniversary screening of \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d sending her a picture of his ticket stub with the words \u201cha ha, be jealous,\u201d scrawled across it.Each passing text tugged at Ms. Lewell\u2019s heart, pulling her toward a new life that beckoned beyond the border.\u201cWhen you really connect with somebody, there\u2019s an intangible thing where you almost instantly start to share and speak the same language,\u201d she said. \u201cYou understand what the other person means, and we had that right from the get-go.\u201dThey grew closer online, watching most of the Winter Olympics from Sochi, Russia, in February 2014, and trading comments about the performances of their fellow countrymen.Later that month, Mr. Townes sent Ms. Lewell a different sort of comment. \u201cAt the risk of what seems like a fairly strong friendship here,\u201d he texted, \u201cI really just have to say, I hope it\u2019s not too weird, but if we lived in the same city, there\u2019s really no way I wouldn\u2019t have asked you out by now.\u201dHe was speaking her language.\u201cThe chemistry between us was so evident,\u201d Ms. Lewell said. \u201cOne of us just had to acknowledge it.\u201dIn June 2014, Mr. Townes visited Ms. Lewell for the first time, spending 10 days in her native Saint John, where fishing is one of the region\u2019s major industries. She gave him a tour that included several restaurants for sampling sticky buns and fish and chips, and a visit to the majestic Hopewell Rocks, which stand up to 70 feet tall and are washed over by some of the highest tides in the world.\u201cI really enjoyed it,\u201d Mr. Townes said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in Saint John that reminds me of home, especially the people, who go out of their way to be polite, and have that Southern sensibility that family is first.\u201dThe next month, Ms. Lewell joined Mr. Townes and his family on their annual summer trip to Edisto Island, S.C.\u201cI met everyone at once, and we had a great time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Mike and I had already fallen in love by then, but at that point, we were all in.\u201dShe visited him again at Christmas, and they began a long-distance relationship that did not become known to their \u201cJeopardy\u201d friends until spring 2015, when Ms. Lowell and Mr. Townes reached out to six of them to plan a reunion in Washington.Ms. Lowell told Ms. Hammerstrom that she was bringing her new boyfriend but gave no name, saying only that \u201che feels like he knows you already.\u201dMs. Hammerstrom remembered thinking, \u201cPoor Mike, he will be so upset.\u201dBut a few weeks later, Ms. Lewell revealed her boyfriend\u2019s identity to the other \u201cJeopardy\u201d teachers, posting photos of her and Mr. Townes on one of their nerdy pursuits: \u201cThey were standing in front of Stephen King\u2019s house in Bangor, Me.,\u201d Ms. Hammerstrom said, laughing. \u201cThe cat was finally out of the bag.\u201dAt the reunion, Ms. Lewell told everyone what she had been telling her own family about Mr. Townes.\u201cMy life works better when he\u2019s in it; everything just runs more smoothly,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019m a single lady of 40 with no kids, and this guy, who\u2019s a dad, comes into my life with two awesome kids and gives me the opportunity to be a stepparent, which is something I never expected or knew that I wanted,\u201d said Ms. Lewell, her voice beginning to quiver. \u201cIt has been one of the greatest gifts of my life.\u201dThey were married July 7 at St. Andrew\u2019s Catholic Church in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, where Msgr.

They dictate what information should appear on a wine bottle\u2019s label, how big a boat you can build without installing emergency lighting, the criteria your house should meet if you want it on the National Register of Historic Places. They\u2019re all listed, broken down into 50 categories, in the Code of Federal Regulations, a document that came in at just under 180,000 pages as of 2015. Every consumer, business and industry in the country encounters these regulations in one form or another, and as such they\u2019re constantly debated.President Donald J. Trump dived headlong into that debate this February, issuing an executive order creating \u201cRegulatory Reform Task Forces\u201d across the federal agencies. These groups, the order explained, would evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations about which to keep, scrap or modify. Most government agencies declined to disclose information about their deregulation teams.The task was not made easier by the agencies themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to get names,\u201d Ms. Ivory said. Both she and Mr. Faturechi filed numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, many of which have yet to receive a response. Of those they did get, some included only partial information \u2014 the titles but not the names of task force members, for example. \u201cBut it\u2019s just been radio silence for the most part,\u201d Mr. Faturechi said.One big break came when Ms. Ivory, in what she described as a \u201cfit of frustration, because we just weren\u2019t getting any records from the agencies,\u201d dug through publicly available documents on the Department of the Interior\u2019s website. There, she found the handwritten visitor logs from the department\u2019s front desk. She and Mr. Faturechi were then able to track the meetings task force members at the department had been taking. \u201cWe found dozens of instances of industry representatives meeting with these particular task force appointees, which gave us a window we wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise,\u201d Mr. Faturechi said.The Times and ProPublica have been partnering for nearly a decade, on everything from Sheri Fink\u2019s 2009 Pulitzer Prize-winning report on Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to the Edward Snowden leaks in 2013. \u201cWe hew to very similar journalistic ambitions and standards,\u201d said Rebecca Corbett, an assistant masthead editor of The Times. \u201cWe offer a huge audience, so their journalism can get read,\u201d she said, \u201cand it amplifies our own.\u201dStill, their work, like that of the task forces themselves, is far from over. Mr. Faturechi and Ms. Ivory hope readers will come forward with further information on task force members, many of whom remain unknown.

{"Headline": "Arks of the Apocalypse", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "FeatureAll around the world, scientists are building repositories of everything from seeds to ice to mammal milk \u2014 racing to preserve a natural order that is fast disappearing.Supported byA few Norwegian radio stations and newspapers reported the incident at the time, but it received little international attention until May, when it was becoming clear that President Trump was likely to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. Suddenly the tidings from Svalbard were everywhere, in multiple languages, with headlines like \u201cWorld\u2019s \u2018Doomsday\u2019 Seed Vault Has Been Breached by Climate Change.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter that the flood happened seven months earlier, or that the seeds remained safe and dry. We had just lived through the third consecutive year of the highest global temperatures on record and the lowest levels of Arctic ice; vast swaths of permafrost were melting; scientists had recently announced that some 60 percent of primate species were threatened with extinction. All these facts felt like signposts to an increasingly hopeless future for the planet. And now, here was a minifable suggesting that our attempts to preserve even mere traces of the bounty around us might fall apart, too.It seems to be a human impulse to collect things just as they\u2019re vanishing. During the Renaissance, wealthy merchants and aristocrats exhibited their personal compendiums of mastodon bones, fossils and all manner of dried, pickled and stuffed creatures in what were called cabinets of curiosity. Some anthropologists believe their discipline emerged when Europeans began to experience a sort of nostalgia for the native populations they had wiped out with their diseases and guns. That feeling sent them scurrying off to gather up ethnographies, dying languages and sometimes even living subjects. Zisis Kozlakidis, the president of the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories, an organization that represents some 1,300 biobanks containing specimens like viruses and the reproductive cells of clouded leopards, told me a collecting rush is underway, which he likened to an international space race. \u201cThere is,\u201d he said, \u201ca very intense feeling that we\u2019re losing biodiversity quicker than we can understand it.\u201dWe build banks to better understand, but also perhaps to save, our disappearing world. The plan is to study these specimens now but also to deliver them to the future, when scientists will presumably be more advanced than we are, technologically \u2014 and hopefully smarter. Geneticists can already clone animals; breed genetic diversity back into species at the brink of extinction via in vitro fertilization; rewrite genomes; and fabricate synthetic DNA. Glaciologists reconstruct ancient climate and atmospheric patterns (and predict future ones) by studying molecules trapped in ice. Marine biologists grow threatened corals in underwater nurseries. Botanists recently sprouted a delicate, white-flowered plant from genetic material inside seeds buried by squirrels in the Siberian permafrost 32,000 years ago. What will we be capable of in 10,000 years, or even 100?\u2014Deep under the rock and permafrost of Plataberget Mountain, researchers have amassed what they hope might serve as a backup copy of the world\u2019s agricultural crops. Stacked inside cavernous, ice-crusted chambers, these seeds contain the genetic diversity necessary to breed new varieties able to withstand the vagaries of a changing climate.This subterranean safe house can hold up to 2.25 billion seeds and currently contains some 5,000 species of essential food crops. The facility\u2019s temperature is maintained at just below 0 degrees Farenheit, which is cold enough to keep seeds viable for decades, and perhaps even thousands of years.On its shelves are 160,000 varieties of rice, like those seen here, as well as thousands of essential grains and legumes \u2014 including some from Syria, which will be used to re-establish food production there once the fighting stops.\u2014For the Amphibian Ark, an international collaboration among scientists at more than 180 research facilities in 32 countries, herpetologists breed and maintain what they call \u201ccaptive insurance colonies\u201d like this one at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo with the aim of saving amphibians from a global die-off so severe that many regard it as an \u201cextinction crisis.\u201d They intend to someday release the specimens back into the wild.No one has seen a Panamanian golden frog in the wild since 2009; the species is among many being ravaged by the deadly chytrid fungus. The frog at left, at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo, was captured 15 years ago and is considered a \u201cfounder.\u201d His offspring are helping to rebuild the species in captivity. On the right is a female, her abdomen swollen with eggs.\u2014The Coral Restoration Foundation sustains the world\u2019s largest collection of ocean-nursery-raised corals, which in the wild are increasingly endangered by overfishing, agricultural runoff, warming water temperatures and ocean acidification. Located a few miles off the coast of Key Largo, Fla., more than 400 coral \u201ctrees\u201d grow here in the Tavernier Coral Nursery, including five threatened species.Having pioneered a method for growing coral on treelike structures made from PVC pipes, the foundation grows coral in an underwater nursery for six to nine months before the specimens are taken to the ocean, glued into place and used to repopulate faltering reefs.Depending on the coral species, researchers might let a specimen grow to the size of a softball or a cantaloupe in the nursery before replanting it. Coral reefs are some of the richest ecosystems on the planet; despite being present on less than 2 percent of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter to about a quarter of all known marine species.\u2014The National Lab for Genetic Resources Preservations in Fort Collins, Colo., is run by the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. Here, a researcher checks coral sperm cryogenically frozen and collected by Smithsonian scientists and stored alongside other genetic samples at the lab. This summer, they will grow coral from this cryopreserved and thawed sperm and, for the first time, transplant it into the wild.Most corals are hermaphroditic; one way they reproduce is by releasing tiny, floating packets that contain both sperm and eggs. When reefs die off and become fragmented, it is harder for corals to reproduce naturally. Researchers preserve sex cells cryogenically for future breeding.\u2014The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington stores 16,000 frozen samples of milk from approximately 180 species, making it the world\u2019s largest collection of frozen exotic-animal milk in the world. Here, researchers milk a critically endangered Bornean orangutan named Batang. In addition to breast-feeding her infant, Redd, Batang permits regular milking for the milk bank.Milk samples from a giant anteater, whose species has declined by 30 percent over the last 10 years. Milk is essential to the survival of mammals; along with basic nutrition, it contains hormones, microbes and molecules critical to immune function.\u2014A 10-foot-by-20-foot room inside the San Diego Zoo keeps the living cells of more than 1,000 species from around the world \u2014 the Hawaiian bird called the po\u2018ouli, which is believed to be extinct; the northern white rhino; the western lowland gorilla; the Somali wild ass \u2014 preserved in liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees. This is, says Oliver Ryder, the zoo\u2019s director of conservation genetics, \u201cthe greatest density of vertebrate biodiversity anywhere in the galaxy.\u201dThe living cells of Amani, a female southern white rhino about 9 years old. When thawed, the cells can be used to grow new rhino cells.The living cells of Kamilah, a female western lowland gorilla, age 40, are also preserved in the Frozen Zoo.\u2014This 55,000-cubic-foot, minus-33-degree freezer holds some 62,000 feet of ice rods augured with machines out of ice sheets and glaciers. The study of air bubbles, dust and ash particles, isotopes, gases and organic materials frozen in the ice helps scientists understand past climates and predict future ones. The oldest ice stored in the lab is 417,000 years old and comes from Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica. Another core, 11,168 feet long and drilled from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is an archive of atmospheric history going back 68,000 years. In a nearby decontaminated \u201cclean room,\u201d researchers bundled in winter coats and hats slice the cores, measure their electrical conductivity and analyze individual ice crystals using high-resolution macrophotography. To better understand long-ago climates, ice core scientists, engineers, and drillers from 24 countries are currently searching for a suitable site to drill a 1.5 million year old or older ice core.The cross-section of an ice core at left is from the South Pole, taken from a depth of about 5,300 feet and estimated to be about 50,000 years old. The brown and gray layers of the processed ice core at right are bits of ash deposited by a volcanic eruption some 22,000 years ago.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pasta, Herbs and Plenty of Melting Mozzarella", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetitePasta with heaps of melting mozzarella can take many forms, and most of them are baked.Dishes like lasagna have their charms, but they\u2019re wintry ones of the hot and bubbling variety. They\u2019re perfect when you want to cozy up next to your oven in February, but a whole lot less appealing in the sticky heat of July.This summery pasta is a wonderfully gooey exception. The only cooking you\u2019ll need to do is to boil the pasta. Its residual heat will melt the milky, mild cheese as you toss all of the ingredients together.This one is different. It skips the tomatoes but keeps the basil, blending the fragrant leaves \u2014 along with fresh mint, Parmesan, garlic and a little chile \u2014 into a vibrant, pestolike sauce. At the very end, pine nuts are added to the bowl for crunch, and more fresh herbs are tossed in for brightness. It\u2019s both light and rich, with a garlicky bite. It\u2019s also extremely fast and easy to make.One thing to consider is the type of mozzarella you use. The softer and milkier your cheese is to begin with, the more it will melt and run, while firm varieties, usually those that have been salted, will retain more of their shape.Both types work well here. Firm mozzarella will give you pockets of supple but not-quite-melted cheese. Ultra-creamy burrata collapses into a luscious sauce, mixing with the pesto and turning it all a speckled light green. Buffalo mozzarella usually splits the difference; its more tender core melts while its outer skin tends to stay intact. In any case, it\u2019s important to let the cheese come to room temperature before adding it to the bowl so it doesn\u2019t cool the pasta.While the cheese is warming up on the counter, I like to marinate it in some of the pesto mixture so it can absorb as much flavor as possible even before meeting the other ingredients.This dish is best served immediately after all of the ingredients are tossed together, while it\u2019s hot or at least warm, and the cheese is still nice and gooey.It may be summer, but that doesn\u2019t mean oozing cheese is any less alluring.cookingAdvertisement"}

And that seemed to bring the story to a close.But now here was Mr. Inman, six years later, captured on the surveillance camera at the Bank of America just up Highway 25 in Simpsonville, his expressionless face offering no clues about the gears churning behind it. The police accused Mr. Inman 48, of walking into the bank on the morning of June 24 in a pair of khaki shorts, giving the teller a note that stated he was armed and fleeing with an undisclosed amount of cash. Mr. Inman was arrested two and a half hours later in Franklin County, Ga. He remains in custody at the Greenville County Detention Center.And so, this working-class town of 4,000 people was moved to ponder how, exactly, their former chief\u2019s mug shot ended up in a $1.50 scandal sheet, The Jail Report, on sale at the Sav Way filling station.Had Mr. Inman\u2019s Facebook transgressions snared him in a professional purgatory from which he could not escape? Did all of this have something to do with the brain surgery Mr. Inman underwent while in office \u2014 the one some said had affected his personality? Was it something more complicated? Something less?\u201cIt\u2019s like he didn\u2019t even care,\u201d said Sydney Lawson, 26, an employee of a storefront cash-loan business, marveling that a former lawman would neglect to wear a mask to a bank heist.\u201cI\u2019m a retired state trooper, man, so don\u2019t nothing surprise me,\u201d said Mark Perry, 46, who was waiting for a trim recently at Turner\u2019s Barber and Style Shop. \u201cAnyone can be a cop. And anyone can turn out to be a criminal.\u201dMr. Inman took over as chief here in July 2009, after about 15 years at other law enforcement agencies around upstate South Carolina. \u201cMy goal is to see every citizen treated with fairness and respect,\u201d he told The Anderson Independent-Mail when his hiring was announced.Phyllis Lollis, the former town administrator, said that Mr. Inman came with strong recommendations and the bonus of a college degree. Carthel Crout, the mayor at the time, said that Mr. Inman proved to be an able administrator of the 17-officer force, instituting a neighborhood watch and cracking down on drug dealers.A few months into his tenure, Ms. Lollis said, Mr. Inman had a brain tumor removed, and from that point he seemed less focused. \u201cWhen he came back he was totally different,\u201d she said, \u201cand we knew that he was on a lot of medication.\u201dIn summer 2011, Mr. Clardy, who served as mayor before Mr. Crout, brought the chief\u2019s Facebook posts to the attention of the Town Council. One of the posts, according to The Independent-Mail, referred to a portable toilet as a \u201cMexican spaceship.\u201d In another, Mr. Inman listed the languages he spoke: \u201csarcasm (fluent), Ethiopian, Semitic, Afrikaans and jive.\u201d\u201cRichard didn\u2019t get upset when the mayor asked for his resignation,\u201d recalled Ms. Lollis, who said she believed Mr. Inman was not a racist. \u201cHe didn\u2019t raise his voice. He was very calm. As a matter of fact, I was sitting there, and I said, \u2018Richard, how could you be so stupid?\u2019\u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 And I couldn\u2019t help the tears just start to flowing.\u201dMs. Lollis stayed in touch with Mr. Inman for a few years. She said he struggled to find work. Mr. Crout said Mr. Inman had been living with his mother. Mr. Inman\u2019s family members declined to comment.\u201cI\u2019m certain I haven\u2019t talked to him in several years, but occasionally he\u2019d text or he\u2019d send a meme or some Seinfeld quote, just random stuff,\u201d said A. Keith Morton, chief of the Fountain Inn, S.C., Police Department, where Mr. Inman worked from 2001 to 2009.Records provided by the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy show that Mr. Inman did not work anywhere in the state as a law enforcement officer after his resignation in Williamston.\u201cMost police chiefs probably subscribe to the same theory as I, which is that I don\u2019t need any help looking stupid,\u201d said Mr. Morton, who has served as Fountain Inn\u2019s chief for nearly 25 years. The advent of the social media age and its attendant pitfalls, Mr. Morton said, has prompted him to reflect on his father\u2019s homespun admonition to err on the side of discretion: \u201cGod gave you two ears and a mouth, boy. You just listen twice as much as you talk.\u201dWilliamston, once a mill town, is now a bedroom community for workers in the auto and auto parts plants around booming Greenville. It is dotted with empty storefronts, and vacation Bible school is a summertime main event.Amber Rumsey, 28, Ms. Lawson\u2019s co-worker at the cash-advance business, said Williamston was the kind of place that makes social media redundant. \u201cYou don\u2019t need Facebook to know everybody\u2019s business,\u201d she said.Some still hold a personal grudge against Mr. Inman. Ludy Garcia, 47, suspected him of anti-Hispanic bias when he stopped by her house and demanded that she separate the small sticks from the large branches among her yard waste. Ms. Garcia\u2019s sister, Maria Vasquez, accused the police of that era of subjecting Hispanic drivers to racial profiling.\u201cKarma is karma,\u201d she said.Tony Hagood, an African-American who is the only minority member on the town\u2019s council, said he was unsurprised by Mr. Inman\u2019s troubles. The 2011 Facebook posts, he said, revealed something about the man\u2019s character. He quoted from the Book of Luke: \u201cThat which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.\u201dHere in Anderson County, nearly 70 percent of voters supported Donald J. Trump in the November election. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s searing put-downs on Twitter, many conservatives maintain that for lesser public figures like Mr. Inman, certain rules of decorum and political correctness still apply.At the McDonald\u2019s recently, no one in a group of white regulars meeting for their daily bull session came to the defense of Mr. Inman\u2019s 2011 Facebook posts.\u201cWords have consequences,\u201d said Greg Cothran, 47, the owner of a towing company.A few minutes later, Mr. Crout sauntered in, ordered a biscuit and took his place among the men. He said that Mr. Inman was a good police officer, but one who had made a \u201cdumb\u201d mistake in 2011 and had not done his job so well after his surgery.When Mr. Crout saw the image from the bank, he knew it was Mr. Inman. And yet, he said: \u201cI hurt for him. Because that\u2019s not him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Donald Jr. Cheat Sheet", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNobody can talk about anything but Donald Trump Jr. and his Kremlin connections. You probably have some questions. Fire away. If Donald Jr. got convicted of a crime, do you think his father would pardon him?When the latest story about adventures with the Russians first appeared, the president did seem uncharacteristically reserved. He announced, through a spokeswoman, that his son \u201cis a high-quality person,\u201d which sounded as though Junior was a washer-dryer on sale at the mall.It made you wonder if Dad was trying to distance himself a bit. However, Trump finally took to Twitter and announced: \u201cThis is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!\u201d That sounded much more sympathetic, unless you want to note that the finale of most witch hunts is not executive clemency. Who do you think is Worst Trump Child? Junior has certainly rocketed into the lead. Although frankly, if the president is playing Godfather in this particular drama, all the grown sons are Fredo.That includes son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was in on the meeting with that Russian attorney who was supposed to be bearing dirt on Hillary Clinton. Which Kushner neglected to mention on disclosure forms he filled out when he went to work at the White House. As senior adviser on Middle East peace, reorganizing government, combating drug abuse, China and Mexico.Eric gets credit for keeping a low profile. Really, he hasn\u2019t said anything very strange since he compared waterboarding to a fraternity hazing. Except for the time he said nepotism was \u201ca beautiful thing.\u201d So is the family going to stick together?The Trumps are acquiring different lawyers now, and cynics might presume that eventually somebody\u2019s going to turn on somebody. If so, my money\u2019s on Jared. What about Mike Pence?The vice president, a spokesman said crisply, \u201cis not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.\u201d If Trump originally sounded a bit cool, Pence was Antarctica, pre-global warming.Who really set up the meeting between Junior and that Kremlin-connected lawyer \u2014 the pop singer from Russia or the British P.R. guy who keeps posting pictures of himself in funny hats?We do like that P.R. guy, Rob Goldstone, who also announced on Facebook when he checked into Trump Tower for the secret meeting. But Emin Agalarov, the singer, seems to be the central figure. His father, Aras, is a billionaire oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin. He met the Trumps when the Agalarovs paid almost $20 million to bring the 2013 Miss Universe pageant to Moscow.Emin is also the executive vice president of his dad\u2019s business, allegedly in charge of the malls and restaurants. You can see how he and Junior would bond. Is Emin a good singer?His website says that his \u201crock star good looks\u201d have made him \u201ca household name in Russia.\u201d It also brags that he was \u201cthe first person ever to persuade Donald Trump to appear in a music video.\u201d That was during the Miss Universe pageant, which seems slated to become the most politically important entertainment event since Nero fiddled while Rome burned.\u201cEMIN was WOW!\u201d Trump tweeted after the singer performed at the pageant. The woman who was Miss Australia told The Financial Times recently that he was terrible. (\u201cUs girls all knew he had zero talent.\u201d)So somewhere in between those two things. Junior certainly appears to have agreed to accept political help from a close connection of the Russian government. Is there any possible explanation that doesn\u2019t involve collusion?Well, the Trump family apparently had a deal with the Agalarov family to bring a Trump Tower to Moscow. It was put on hold when Donald ran for president. But it\u2019s possible that Junior was trying to keep Emin happy because he was hoping to eventually get the plan back on track.So you could certainly argue that the president\u2019s son was only pretending he was working with a foreign power trying to manipulate the results of the American election. When his real motives were just making a profit off the presidency. Be fair.What ever happened to the other Russian all the Trump people were talking to during the campaign \u2014 the jolly ambassador?Ah, Sergey Kislyak. Great guy for a party. So much fun that national security adviser Michael Flynn couldn\u2019t stop chatting him up. So easy to be with that Jeff Sessions didn\u2019t even remember they\u2019d met.He\u2019s going home. The Russians are reportedly replacing him with a guy who helped plan an invasion of Ukraine. How are we supposed to feel about the way the Don Jr. crisis has brought the administration to a standstill?If the question comes up at a party, feel free to choose one of the following responses:A) Fine by me.B) Is this going to require a discussion of that health care bill?C) Damn, we\u2019re never going to get an ambassador to Norway.Advertisement"}

Brian X. Chen, The Times\u2019s personal technology writer, who is based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You explain, highlight and solve everyday tech problems for readers. How do you use tech to keep track of the issues and new tech that is coming out? Nothing beats listening to people rant about the tech they\u2019re frustrated with. Nearly everyone seems angry about connectivity issues: sluggish, unreliable Wi-Fi, spotty cell coverage or shoddy broadband service. Other than that, battery life continues to be a source of people\u2019s misery.At The Times, we have access to analytics about the people reading our articles, and the consistent strong readership we get from stories about these topics reaffirms that people continue to be frustrated with these issues.What kind of testing setup do you use to tell us if a whiz-bang gadget or app or service is for real?In addition to objective tests, my reviews are subjective. I keep in mind what I know average people care about when it comes to tech, other than a checklist of features. The setup needs to be simple and intuitive, the product needs to be durable and work well, the company\u2019s customer service needs to be delightful and a gadget\u2019s design needs to be aesthetically pleasing enough that you would feel proud about carrying it around or leaving it on your coffee table.What is the favorite piece of tech you have reviewed for The Times so far?Do you still use it?What was your least favorite tech product to review and why?It\u2019s a decent product, but the problem with reviewing it on Day 1 was that there were no great \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, available for it yet to get a feel for whether an always-on, always-watching gadget in your home would be useful. Blank-slate products like Echo Show create a dilemma for reviewers. Should we evaluate the product based on what it can do currently (which is very little), or what we think it has the potential to do in the future? I\u2019m not a fortune teller, so I lean toward the former and render a \u201cwait and see\u201d verdict that seems repetitive. But even when people take the latter approach and predict a gadget\u2019s potential, it\u2019s unhelpful for informing people whether they should buy something today.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?In my kitchen, I\u2019m currently growing basil and scallions, and I\u2019m experimenting with propagating succulents and other types of nonedible house plants with the planter.What could be better about it?The pods are too expensive. You can buy them in sets of three for $20, which seems like too much for dirt and seeds.When you\u2019ve had enough of tech and want to get away, what\u2019s your escape route?My corgi is the boss of me, so on the weekends you\u2019ll usually find me at a dog park, beach or mountain trail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Thing Silicon Valley Can\u2019t Seem to Fix", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSilicon Valley is the only place on Earth not trying to figure out how to become Silicon Valley,\u201d Robert Metcalfe, an inventor of the Ethernet, once wrote. Every year hundreds of people, tourists and entrepreneurs alike, come to the Bay Area hoping to \u201csee Silicon Valley.\u201d So much so that an article in The Mercury News last year suggested that the Valley is giving Alcatraz, the Golden Gate and the Bay Area\u2019s other tourist attractions a run for their money.But what does Silicon Valley look like? Where could one send tourists \u2014 or even locals, for that matter \u2014 hoping to \u201csee\u201d it?Solving this isn\u2019t rocket science; it\u2019s common sense. Don\u2019t design buildings that function only as pristine objects with no relationship to their surroundings. Don\u2019t put workplaces in locations inaccessible to transit. Do consider the broader context.The built environment of the Valley does not reflect the innovation that\u2019s driving the region\u2019s stratospheric growth; it looks instead like the 1950s. Looking at aerial views of midcentury campuses like the Eero Saarinen-designed Bell Labs next to contemporary ones like Apple, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell the midcentury structures from the 21st-century ones.Designing job centers this way contributes mightily to the region\u2019s ever-worsening traffic. If you found yourself stuck on Highway 101 between San Francisco and San Jose, you\u2019d really see what Silicon Valley looks like for many. Building campuses on isolated suburban tracts guarantees long commutes, and this is one of the worst in the country.In a region where the disruption of existing norms is everything, why does this decades-old paradigm of the office persist?In 2011, when asked by a City Council member what benefit the new Apple headquarters would have for Cupertino, Steve Jobs responded that it\u2019d get to keep the company there. And that\u2019s about the extent of what it got. A project like the new Norman Foster-designed Apple Park shows a blatant disregard not only for the citizens of Cupertino but also for the functionality of the region.Every modern building is at some point described as looking like a spaceship. This building actually succeeds at it, but there\u2019s too much that makes it incredibly backward thinking (and not just its lack of child-care facilities). The circular structure has not only nearly three million square feet of office space but also about three million square feet devoted to parking spaces. For a company investing no small amount of its significant capital on driverless cars, that\u2019s incongruous. There is much to emulate at Apple \u2014 but not that almost 1:1 ratio of office to parking.What could they have done differently?Why do we remain so wedded to the old suburban, car-dependent model for workplaces? If autonomous vehicles (or even flying ones) are truly imminent, why are we building millions of square feet of supposedly soon-to-be-obsolete parking spaces? With so many studies touting the benefits of walkable, bike-able and transit-accessible environments, why are we designing in such a way that makes long, painful commutes inevitable?One can\u2019t point a finger solely at the companies themselves; the public sector, the community and the private sector all need to collectively tackle these problems.Allison Arieff is a writer on architecture and design and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snopes, in Heated Legal Battle, Asks Readers for Money to Survive", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySnopes, the fact-checking website that once focused on debunking flimsy internet rumors but has expanded into a 16-person operation that calls out political leaders for dishonesty, is locked in a legal battle that it says has drained the money it needs to survive.\u201cWe have had no income whatsoever for the last several months,\u201d Mr. Mikkelson said in an interview on Monday.When asked how long the site could last without a successful fund-raising drive or legal victory, Mr. Mikkelson responded: \u201cNot a whole lot longer.\u201dProper Media and its lawyers tell a starkly different story. They say that Snopes employees will continue to be paid from the advertising revenue, and that Mr. Mikkelson should be removed from the company because of wasteful spending.The two sides, which have sued each other in separate claims, present entirely conflicting descriptions of who owns the company and what is being withheld from whom. The earliest chance for resolution appears to be a court hearing scheduled for next week.Whether the squabbling will affect Snopes\u2019s ability to produce its popular mythbusting remains to be seen, but the disputes are unlikely to be settled until there is legal clarity on the underlying structure of the company.Proper Media considers itself an owner of Bardav, not a vendor. As Proper Media tells it, Barbara Mikkelson, Mr. Mikkelson\u2019s ex-wife, sold her 50 percent share to Proper Media in 2016, but for tax purposes it was bought in the name of its individual members \u201cfor the benefit of Proper Media.\u201d Two Proper Media officers, Drew Schoentrup and Christopher Richmond, would get 20 percent stakes in Bardav, while three others would own 3.33 percent stakes.Proper Media said the deal included Mr. Schoentrup taking a seat on a two-person board alongside Mr. Mikkelson.But Mr. Mikkelson, who owns the other 50 percent of the Bardav shares, said that Mr. Schoentrup does not sit on the board, and that the five shareholders should be viewed individually, as opposed to collectively, giving Proper Media equal ownership.Mr. Schoentrup\u2019s on or off status on the board is crucial in Mr. Mikkelson\u2019s decision to cancel Bardav\u2019s contract with Proper Media, which handles many of the technological and advertising services for Snopes. In March, Bardav gave Proper Media a 60-day notice that it would be terminating the contract, effective May 8. Mr. Mikkelson said the contract was agreed to when Snopes was a much smaller company, but now it had its own business-focused employees and other services \u201ccan be obtained much more cheaply from other vendors.\u201dKarl Kronenberger, a lawyer for Proper Media, said in an interview on Monday that Mr. Mikkelson cannot cancel the contract without calling a board meeting \u2014 which, in Proper Media\u2019s view, would include Mr. Schoentrup. The company has continued as if the contract remained valid.Last week, a court ordered Proper Media, which cannot directly pay Snopes employees, to release $100,000 of the advertising revenues to Bardav, on the condition that the money be used for expenses and not be paid to Mr. Mikkelson, according to Mr. Kronenberger. Proper Media sued Mr. Mikkelson in May, accusing him of mismanaging the company\u2019s funds and abusing his position. (Mr. Mikkelson said he hadn\u2019t received money from the company this year aside from expenses and salary, which he said made him the lowest-paid employee at Snopes.)Mr. Kronenberger said Mr. Mikkelson has locked Proper Media out of Bardav\u2019s bank accounts and \u201ckey databases it needs to do its job,\u201d and he disputed that Proper Media had locked Bardav out from making technological changes.\u201cMr. Mikkelson has absolute control of this domain name,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kronenberger said. \u201cHe can move it within minutes.\u201dAs for the advertising revenue, \u201cOur position is nothing is being wrongfully withheld,\u201d he said.But on the crowdfunding page, Mr. Mikkelson wrote that \u201calthough we maintain editorial control (for now), the vendor will not relinquish the site\u2019s hosting to our control, so we cannot modify the site, develop it, or \u2014 most crucially \u2014 place advertising on it.\u201dBoth sides hope a court hearing scheduled for Aug. 4 will begin to bring some clarity. Proper Media hopes the judge will remove Mr. Mikkelson from the company, while Bardav is hoping the judge requires Proper Media to hand over the rest of the advertising revenue, including some money from before the contract termination took effect.For more than 20 years, Snopes has been a destination for batting down the urban legends and viral misinformation all too commonly found on the internet, first in email forwards and later in popular but misleading articles. At first run entirely by David and Barbara Mikkelson, it developed a reputation as an authority on declaring simply whether such tidbits could be believed.On Monday, Snopes used its website and social media accounts to promote its crowdfunding effort. It reached its $500,000 in about one day.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to pick a number that we\u2019re sure we can continue operations for, let\u2019s say, through possibly the end of the year, or at least the next several months while all this is happening,\u201d Mr. Mikkelson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At a Family Workshop Near Paris, the \u2018Drowned Mona Lisa\u2019 Lives On", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArcueil JournalARCUEIL, France \u2014 The most famous person to have died in the Seine River has no identity at all. She is \u201cL\u2019Inconnue de la Seine\u201d \u2014 the Unknown Woman of the Seine.Here is her story. In the late 19th century, the body of an unidentified young woman was fished out of the Seine in Paris. Because her body was free of wounds and blemishes, she was presumed to have committed suicide. The pathologist at the morgue that received her body was so mesmerized by her beauty that he called in a \u201cmouleur\u201d \u2014 a molder \u2014 to preserve her face in a plaster death mask.In the decades that followed, the mask was mass-produced and sold as a decorative item for the walls of private homes and studios, first in Paris, then abroad. L\u2019Inconnue became a muse for artists, poets and other writers, among them Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Rainer Maria Rilke and Vladimir Nabokov. L\u2019Inconnue hung in the studio of Albert Camus, who called her a \u201cdrowned Mona Lisa.\u201d She inspired some of the films of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.L\u2019Inconnue is kept alive these days in an out-of-the-way, family-run workshop in the southern Paris suburb of Arcueil. Founded in 1871, the workshop, L\u2019Atelier Lorenzi, creates handmade, perfectly molded plaster copies of figurines, busts, statues and masks the way it has for four generations. But it is best known for L\u2019Inconnue.In a box on the second floor of the atelier is its most precious possession: a 19th-century, chestnut-brown plaster mold of a death mask that is said to be that of L\u2019Inconnue.\u201cYou ask me if my great-grandfather made the mold himself, and I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Laurent Lorenzi Forestier, who runs the family business. \u201cYou ask me how the morgue organized the casting of the mold, and I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that we have a mold from that period in time.\u201dL\u2019Inconnue\u2019s face is serene. Her cheeks are round and full, her skin smooth, her eyelashes matted to give the impression that they are still wet. Her hair is parted in the middle and pulled back behind her neck. She is young, perhaps still a teenager. She is pleasant-looking, but not classically beautiful.It is the mystery of her half-smile that haunts. Her lips lack definition, perhaps the result of her body\u2019s deterioration. She seems happy in death or maybe only asleep. And her eyes look as if they might open at any time.Skeptics have claimed that the woman depicted in the mask could not have been a drowning victim, because her features are too perfect. Some scholars assert that it was common practice to resculpt death masks at the time.L\u2019Inconnue has been imagined in literature as a victim: an orphan who drowns herself in the Seine after an English aristocrat seduces and then abandons her. She also has been portrayed as a witch who destroys a young poet, and as a seductress who witnesses a robbery and murder in a clockmaker\u2019s shop. No documents survive in the Paris police archives. No trace of her body was found.\u201cMaybe the mold was taken before her facial muscles began to fall,\u201d said Juan Jos\u00e9 Garcia, a master mold maker here for 29 years. \u201cMaybe. Maybe.\u201dCopies of the mask hang in most of the rooms in the two-story wood-beamed building, which was built as a relay postal station in the 19th century and is badly in need of roof repair. It overflows with other treasures: copies of ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman busts; medieval figurines; Renaissance nudes; antique polychrome Chinese horses.A copy of Houdon\u2019s \u201cBust of Moli\u00e8re\u201d is for sale, as are busts of Benjamin Franklin, Mozart, Napoleon, Henry IV, Julius Caesar and Dante. Boxes of assorted body parts line the wall of one storage room. In another, the casts are dried the old-fashioned way: with the heat of a potbellied, coal-fueled stove.In recent years, the family has added to its repertoire and now makes the casts in silicone \u2014 much like silicone baking molds. Many of the works are now made in resin, which is more durable than plaster, especially in outdoor installations. The casts can be painted to resemble various materials, including gilded wood, bronze, terra cotta, marble and stone.Much of the shop\u2019s business comes from governmental and commercial commissions. When the four sculptures outside France\u2019s National Assembly began to crumble, the Lorenzis were called in to replace them with copies in resin. They have made resin trees for Disneyland Paris and resin stonelike decorations for Versailles. Film studios, boutiques and fashion houses including Herm\u00e8s and Dior have rented sculptures from them.The company\u2019s best sellers are busts of Marianne, the symbol of the French republic, which sit in most local, regional and national governmental offices in France; and, of course, L\u2019Inconnue ($130 for her death mask in white plaster, $175 with a shiny glaze).In 2008, high rent forced the family to abandon its original shop on Rue Racine on the Left Bank near the Seine and consolidate its entire operation in the workshop in Arcueil. Then crises in the family made it more difficult to keep the business going.\u201cThere seemed to be no solution except to close,\u201d Mr. Forestier said. \u201cBut it was my great-grandfather who opened the atelier when he moved to Paris, originally from a small town in Tuscany. We have more than a century of history. I couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201dBut the works can be expensive \u2014 a mold can cost $2,000 to make, a cast upward of $1,000. Mr. Forestier often is asked why he doesn\u2019t mass-produce the casts in China.\u201cOut of the question!\u201d he said.In the 1960s, L\u2019Inconnue became famous in a different way \u2014 as a first aid mannequin to teach CPR. Peter Safar, an Austrian doctor, had recently developed the basics of CPR. He turned to Asmund Laerdal, a Norwegian toymaker, who coincidentally had rescued his young son from drowning, and they decided to create a life-size mannequin as a training tool.Mr. Laerdal wanted a female doll, assuming that men would not want to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a male dummy. He saw a death mask of L\u2019Inconnue at a relative\u2019s home, was struck by her beauty and decided to make her his model. She was called \u201cResusci Anne\u201d (\u201cCPR Annie\u201d in the United States) and became a physical symbol of salvation. Since then, millions of people have learned CPR on her, making her the world\u2019s most beloved life-size doll.As the company\u2019s website explained: \u201cInspired by the \u2018young woman of the Seine,\u2019 CPR Annie has become the symbol of life for millions of people around the world who have received training in modern techniques of resuscitation and for those whose lives have been saved from unnecessary death.\u201dB\u00e9reng\u00e8re Sim contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Front in the War Over Reproductive Rights: \u2018Abortion-Pill Reversal\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureAfter high school, Stettler moved from Idaho to New York to Washington, taking classes here and there in things like design and music production. By her early 20s, she was restless and began praying to find a path that was \u2018\u2018meaningful and selfless.\u2019\u2019 So she moved again, this time to attend nursing school in Pittsburgh. She became active in the anti-abortion movement there, traveling to attend the March for Life, a huge annual gathering of anti-abortion activists in Washington. But although her faith felt revived, she began \u2018\u2018living a double life,\u2019\u2019 she told me, casually dating a much older restaurateur, whom she described as a \u2018\u2018billionaire.\u2019\u2019 In late October 2015, a month before graduation, she found out she was pregnant.She had always looked forward to pregnancy, even the silly rituals like posting maternity photos to Facebook. This just wasn\u2019t what she had imagined. She thought about how a pregnancy would affect the nursing career she was so close to starting. She didn\u2019t want to marry her boyfriend or be attached to him forever through co-parenting. And being a single mother, she feared, would make it harder to attract the kind of \u2018\u2018good Catholic guy\u2019\u2019 she hoped to settle down with eventually.About a week later, she made a decision that nearly one million American women make each year: She would have an abortion. After reading about the abortion pill online, she made an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic a block from her downtown apartment. She would rather face her forgiving God, she thought, than her anti-abortion family and friends. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t want the baby, but I also didn\u2019t want to have the abortion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I just wanted it all to not exist, which is kind of what the pill allows a woman to think can happen.\u2019\u2019The \u2018\u2018abortion pill\u2019\u2019 is really two separate drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, taken 24 to 48 hours apart. Stettler took the first pill in the clinic, after what she recalls as a 10-minute meeting with a counselor who reassured her that she ought to \u2018\u2018chase [her] own dreams.\u2019\u2019 Within an hour, she said, she was overcome with remorse. She pulled herself away from suici\u00addal daydreams, but as the hours slipped by, she couldn\u2019t shake the sense that she had made a grave error. The second dose of medication, four tablets that would cause her to expel the fetus from her body, sat in a brown bag on her kitchen counter like a time bomb. She was supposed to take them the next day.That night, she searched for \u2018\u2018abortion pill regret\u2019\u2019 on Google. One of the first hits was a website with a photo of a pretty young woman staring morosely into the middle distance. At the top of the screen she saw a toll-free number and the words \u2018\u2018Abortion Pill Reversal: It may not be too late.\u2019\u2019 She picked up the phone.Neither prediction proved true. A graph of the abortion rate since Roe v. Wade in 1973 looks something like a long playground slide viewed from the side. There\u2019s a steep climb up to the peak of 1981, and then a gentle but significant slope downward. In 2014, the number of abortions in the United States dropped below one million for the first time since 1975. Nor did medication abortion immediately transform how those dwindling numbers of abortions were administered. A decade after RU-486\u2019s arrival in the United States, fewer than 18 percent of abortions took place via medication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even among women whose pregnancies were eligible for the abortion pill \u2014 at the time, eight weeks\u2019 gestation or less \u2014 almost three-quarters underwent surgery instead.As public discussion about abortions has focused on surgical abortions, the anti-abortion movement has notched victory after victory, chipping away at abortion access through a constellation of state laws that heavily regulate clinics, starve providers of funds and require women to undergo \u2018\u2018counseling\u2019\u2019 or waiting periods before procuring the procedure. As a result, at least 162 abortion providers closed or stopped offering the service between 2011 and 2016, according to a Bloomberg analysis, while just 21 new providers opened. In the Midwest and the South, more than half of all women live in counties with no abortion provider at all.But today, 17 years after RU-486 was approved, medication abortion is approaching its initial promise \u2014 or threat, depending on your point of view. American women now end their pregnancies with medication almost as often as they do with surgery, according to data analyzed last fall by Reuters. And last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued new label guidelines making the abortion pill more accessible than ever. Mifepristone is now recommended up to a gestational age of 10 weeks; the new guidelines also reduced the number of required doctor visits and the recommended dosage. The experience of taking a few pills in private is on the cusp of becoming what we mean when we say \u2018\u2018abortion.\u2019\u2019This steady rise of medication abortion, or what the anti-abortion movement calls chemical abortion, presents the movement with a significant challenge, one that has turned out to be more complicated than the fear that abortion would become more common. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve consistently lost the debate when the debate has been over the status of human life immediately after conception,\u2019\u2019 says the historian Daniel K. Williams, author of the 2016 book \u2018\u2018Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement Before Roe v. Wade.\u2019\u2019 Medication abortions take place relatively early in pregnancy, and they are eliminating many of the images and narratives \u2014 the abortionist\u2019s instruments, the impersonal clinic \u2014 that have historically served as persuasive scare tactics. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really thought through these things all that carefully, and we\u2019re still fighting, with good reason, the battle over surgical abortion,\u2019\u2019 says Charles Camosy, the anti-abortion author of the 2015 book \u2018\u2018Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018With chemical abortion, we\u2019re not where we need to be.\u2019\u2019And \u2018\u2018abortion pill reversal\u2019\u2019 implies exactly that \u2014 that a woman made an uninformed decision and has now thought better of it. The brainchild of a San Diego doctor named George Delgado, \u2018\u2018reversal\u2019\u2019 is a medical protocol that floods a woman\u2019s body with progesterone, the so-called pregnancy hormone, within hours after she has taken mifepristone, the drug that begins a medication abortion. \u2018\u2018If you have something that\u2019s poisoned a specific spot in your body and we know what the antidote is, then you just take the antidote,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has enthusiastically promoted reversal to its members. For all the challenges that the abortion pill poses to the anti-abortion movement, it turns out to have at least one unexpected benefit: The hours between the two doses of medication represent an extra decision point to interrupt and redeem. \u2018\u2018With a surgical abortion, once the instrument enters the uterus, then it\u2019s over,\u2019\u2019 Delgado says. Medication abortion, by contrast, gives women \u2018\u2018a second chance at choice.\u2019\u2019Delgado was raised Catholic, but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s that he began thinking in earnest about how his faith should affect his work as a doctor. In the early years of his career, he prescribed hormonal birth control and performed vasectomies. But he stopped doing both after he read Pope Paul VI\u2019s encyclical \u2018\u2018Humanae Vitae\u2019\u2019 in the late 1990s. The document, written in 1968 at the height of the sexual revolution, is a holistic statement on the sacredness of all human life, from conception to death. It also firmly restated the church\u2019s teaching against most forms of birth control. When Delgado read it, he felt deeply convicted. \u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t being consistent in how I was living my life and how I should be living my life according to my faith,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018From then on, I decided everything I would do would be consistent with what God wanted me to do.\u2019\u2019In 2004, he traveled to Nebraska to pursue certification in Natural Procreative Technology, a Catholic-friendly approach to women\u2019s reproductive health. Developed by an anti-abortion OB-GYN named Thomas Hilgers who was also inspired by \u2018\u2018Humanae Vitae,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018NaProTechnology\u2019\u2019 eschews most forms of birth control and fertility treatments and relies instead on tracking widely used \u2018\u2018biomarkers\u2019\u2019 like cervical mucus and body temperature. At Hilgers\u2019s Pope Paul VI Institute in Omaha, Delgado learned to use progesterone to treat issues like repeated miscarriage and postpartum depression. The next year, he moved from the Bay Area to San Diego to join Culture of Life, a Catholic clinic founded by local longtime anti-abortion activists named Ken and Marie Finn.In 2009, Delgado says, he received a call from an acquaintance who ran an anti-abortion ministry focused on counseling women outside abortion clinics. A young woman in El Paso, Tex., had just taken the first pill to begin a medication abortion and immediately regretted it. She found the activist\u2019s phone number online and called in a panic. Was there any way to undo her mistake? By this time, Delgado had been using progesterone for years to treat women dealing with fertility issues. And he knew that mifepristone, the first drug in the abortion-pill protocol, works by blocking progesterone from the uterus. Couldn\u2019t an extra dose of progesterone overcome the mifepristone? Within hours, he sketched out a plan to inject the woman with 200 milligrams of progesterone and to con\u00adtinue giving the progesterone until the end of the first trimester. Through a national network of NaProTechnol\u00adogy-friendly doctors, he quickly found a doctor in El Paso who had the right form of the hormone available in her office and was willing to try it. The fetus survived, and the baby girl was born healthy.Delgado later found out that a doctor in North Carolina, Matthew Harrison, had received a similar call from a crisis pregnancy center in 2006 and independently made the same guess about progesterone counteracting the effects of the mifepristone. That fetus, too, survived, after the mother received progesterone injections through her 26th week of pregnancy. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t make a whole lot of noise about it because I knew that people would try to write it off,\u2019\u2019 Harrison says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not like we have women every day knocking on our door to reverse abortions.\u2019\u2019Over the next few years, however, Delgado and Harrison occasionally heard from doctors and activists who wanted to know more about their interventions. In 2012, Delgado put up a simple website and opened a hotline for women to call for information about reversal. That year, he and Mary Davenport, a doctor in the Bay Area, started contacting a few other doctors who had performed reversals with progesterone. They soon published a small case series in the journal Annals of Pharmacotherapy. The article, just four pages long, describes seven pregnancies treated with progesterone after mifepristone. Two of the abortions completed, but four of the fetuses survived. (One woman evaded the doctors\u2019 attempts to follow up.) \u2018\u2018The experience of these patients suggests that medical abortion can be arrested by progesterone injection,\u2019\u2019 Davenport and Delgado concluded. \u2018\u2018If further trials confirm the success without complications of this or similar protocols, it should become the standard of care for obstetrician-gynecologists, family physicians and emergency-department physicians to attempt mifepristone reversal on patient request.\u2019\u2019Delgado\u2019s hotline received just 28 calls in all of 2012. But the volume increased over the years: 200 calls in 2013, more than 400 in 2014 and more than 600 for each of the last two years, according to the reversal program\u2019s executive director, Sara Littlefield. Today 17 nurses across the country take shifts answering the calls, which are routed to their cellphones. When a call comes into the hotline, the nurse\u2019s job is to connect the caller as quickly as possible with a local doctor willing to administer the reversal protocol. The program has a network of about 350 doctors who are familiar with it and prepared to see patients. If the caller doesn\u2019t live within driving range of one of those providers, the hotline nurse immediately starts calling local doctors and hospitals to explain what reversal is, hoping to find a sympathetic provider. Catholic hospitals are usually a good place to start.Within the last few years, Delgado and Harrison have become something like celebrities within the anti-abortion movement. Conservative media outlets report on reversal at length in flattering terms, and several of the women who have undergone the procedure have begun telling their stories in public, too. Delgado has delivered presentations at events hosted by the National Right to Life Committee and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, where he serves on the board. Harrison and Delgado also started promoting \u2018\u2018emergency abortion pill reversal kits,\u2019\u2019 glorified instructional pamphlets intended for emergency rooms and crisis pregnancy centers. One fan gave Harrison a T-shirt that read \u2018\u2018Reversed RU-486. Now reverse Roe vs Wade.\u2019\u2019But the anti-abortion movement has found stories about it impossible to resist. Headlines in conservative magazines and websites highlight the pregnant woman\u2019s epiphany after taking mifepristone: \u2018\u2018All at Once It Hit Me That I Had Just Made the Worst Decision Ever,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018After Taking the Abortion Pill, She Knew She Made a Mistake, But Her Baby Was Saved When This Happened,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Reversing Regret.\u2019\u2019 It doesn\u2019t get much more memorable than a tale of near-death, a sudden awakening and salvation.Cynthia has one of those stories. (She asked me not to use her last name to protect her son\u2019s privacy.) Cynthia was 18 in 2010 when she found out she was pregnant, and she knew immediately that she would take the abortion pill. \u2018\u2018I, myself, would never have even considered it if it was just like the surgical abortion,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently, settled into a sleek white armchair in the sunny counseling room at Culture of Life. Taking a few pills, by contrast, sounded easy \u2014 almost like birth control. \u2018\u2018You just take it, and it\u2019s over.\u2019\u2019 But after taking the mifepristone, she told her mother what she had done, and her mother confessed her daughter\u2019s half-completed abortion to a priest. The priest called Delgado and also went to Cynthia\u2019s house to talk to her. Delgado, meanwhile, invited Cynthia to come in for an ultrasound the same day to see if the fetus was still alive. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s just see,\u2019\u2019 her boyfriend urged her.In Cynthia\u2019s memory, it wasn\u2019t the pressure from a priest, a doctor, her mother and her boyfriend that changed her mind. It was the ultrasound. \u2018\u2018When I saw the heartbeat, I mean, truly everything changed,\u2019\u2019 she recalled in the clinic, a large wall decal behind her reading \u2018\u2018I Can Do Hard Things.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t even a question anymore.\u2019\u2019 After the ultrasound, Delgado\u2019s wife, who is a nurse, injected her with 200 milligrams of progesterone; she was the first patient whose medication abortion Delgado himself \u2018\u2018reversed.\u2019\u2019 She delivered a healthy baby boy named Christian at 36 weeks gestation.Women who regret their abortions, and are willing to speak publicly about it, have long been valued spokeswomen for the anti-abortion message. But reversal offers a twist to those stories: a happy ending. It also represents a concrete action that women can take to atone for their initial mistake. \u2018\u2018This gives them the actual physical way in which they can in effect reverse their regret,\u2019\u2019 says Jody Lyne\u00e9 Madeira, a professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law who has written about the rhetoric of abortion and regret. \u2018\u2018She can say she did everything she can to stop it once she changed her mind.\u2019\u2019For all of reversal\u2019s anecdotal power, however, the science itself is still disputed. While Delgado claims that flooding a woman\u2019s body with progesterone saves the fetus, other doctors say that in many cases the fetus would have survived if the woman simply declined to take the second pill, misoprostol, after the initial dose of mifepristone. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a strongly worded statement against reversal in 2015 that said the fetus would survive 30 to 50 percent of the time. Dr. Daniel Grossman, a prominent reversal skeptic and director of the research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at University of California, San Francisco, published a literature review that same year in the journal Contraception. He concluded Delgado and Davenport\u2019s case series was of \u2018\u2018poor quality with few details,\u2019\u2019 and that embryonic survival after mifepristone is as high as 46 percent. The question, in other words, is whether the progesterone protocol is effectively just a placebo. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no evidence that any kind of treatment is better than doing nothing,\u2019\u2019 Grossman says.Davenport, Delgado and Matthew Harrison recently published their own literature review in Issues in Law & Medicine, a journal that often features anti-abortion perspectives. When they looked at studies in which the mifepristone dose was comparable to the current F.D.A. regulations, they found survival rates of less than 25 percent. Delgado and Davenport are also preparing a larger case series for publication later this year, which they say will include about 350 women. Delgado says it shows that the most effective progesterone protocol results in an embryo survival rate between 60 and 70 percent. No one has seen that research yet, although conservative media outlets have recently started promoting the results. Critics say that even if those numbers are valid, they aren\u2019t what they seem. Many women who decide to take progesterone undergo an ultrasound first, to see if the pregnancy remains viable; those whose fetuses have died do not go forward with reversal, which means the initial pool of subjects is skewed toward women whose pregnancies had a good chance of continuing even without progesterone. Delgado declined to share a draft of his paper and told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the percentage of women included in the case series who underwent ultrasounds.Although the research remains immature, not everyone is quick to dismiss its basic medical logic. \u2018\u2018It makes biological sense,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Harvey Kliman, director of the reproductive and placental research unit at the Yale School of Medicine. \u2018\u2018I think this is actually totally feasible.\u2019\u2019 Kliman, who has published research on progesterone and miscarriage, is in favor of abortion rights, and made clear he wasn\u2019t advocating widespread use of the treatment. But if one of his daughters came to him and said she had somehow accidentally taken mifepristone during pregnancy, he said, he would tell her to take 200 milligrams of progesterone three times a day for several days, just long enough for the mifepristone to leave her system: \u2018\u2018I bet you it would work.\u2019\u2019 The protocol, however, has attracted almost no interest from the mainstream medical community, in part because the presumed audience is so small.But while Delgado and his associates labor to legitimize reversal, some state lawmakers are racing ahead of them. Since 2015, legislators in 10 states have introduced bills requiring doctors to inform women procuring the abortion pill that they can change their minds after taking the first dose. \u2018\u2018These laws are essentially forcing physicians to tell their patients about a treatment that is unproven and essentially kind of encouraging them to participate in an unmonitored research experiment,\u2019\u2019 Grossman says. In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert signed a bill in March that requires women receiving the pill to be informed that mifepristone alone does not always end a pregnancy; a similar law went into effect in South Dakota last year. Arkansas requires women to be informed that \u2018\u2018it may be possible to reverse the effects of the abortion if the pregnant woman changes her mind.\u2019\u2019 A 2015 Arizona law passed but was then revised to strip its mention of reversal. Similar bills were debated in Colorado, California, Indiana, Idaho, North Carolina and Georgia. Americans United for Life, an influential lobbying group, flagged its model legislation on reversal as a strategic focus for 2017.In time, she found a different kind of redemption. The nurse who answered the reversal hotline stayed in touch with her after her pregnancy ended, praying with her over the phone when she felt despondent. She started volunteering for the hotline, talking to women in the same position she was once in. And in March, she moved to San Diego to start working full time as the nurse manager at Culture of Life. She sees the work she does now as something like atonement. \u2018\u2018I knew that Remy\u2019s life had to stand for something,\u2019\u2019 she told me. God has a plan, she added, \u2018\u2018for literally every life, living or dying in his arms.\u2019\u2019The anti-abortion movement has effectively promoted the idea that many women regret their abortions. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, considered a wild card on abortion questions, waxed eloquent on the topic in his ruling in Gonzales v. Carhart, a 2007 case that upheld the ban on \u2018\u2018partial-birth\u2019\u2019 abortion. \u2018\u2018It seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in the majority opinion. \u2018\u2018The state has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed.\u2019\u2019 That assumption undergirds huge swaths of contemporary abortion law: waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds and requirements that doctors give women more (sometimes dubious) information about the procedure and its effects. The idea seems to be that many women understand what an abortion is only after they have one.The entire legal strategy of \u2018\u2018protecting\u2019\u2019 women seemed to be in jeopardy last year, however, when the Supreme Court, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, struck down Texas\u2019 harsh clinic regulations developed under the guise of safeguarding women\u2019s health. Some legal experts predicted the ruling would force the anti-abortion movement to refocus its attention from the mother\u2019s health and emotions, back to the fetus itself. But reversal legislation suggests the anti-abortion movement isn\u2019t giving up so fast. In fact, the movement seems to be \u2018\u2018doubling down on the emphasis on women,\u2019\u2019 says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and author of the 2015 book \u2018\u2018After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.\u2019\u2019 Stories from individual women who struggle with remorse remain a powerful weapon in the anti-abortion arsenal, and the abortion rights movement has often stumbled in its attempts to respond. \u2018\u2018Because there are so many stories that the pro-choice side wants to represent and has to represent, to cover its bases, it sounds weaker and less coherent than pro-life \u2018abortion harms women, women regret abortion,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Madeira says. \u2018\u2018That cohesive message is always much stronger and more unified.\u2019\u2019Promoting legislation like the recent crop of reversal bills can be its own reward, Ziegler says, even if the laws are eventually struck down or the protocol turns out to be ineffective. Just raising the question of uncertainty and regret affects the abortion pill\u2019s reputation. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re changing cultural norms about what people think about this kind of abortion,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018You can do that regardless of what the research ultimately shows.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

It will send out more than two million razors this year as it places more emphasis than ever on introductory marketing, often earning enthusiastic and appreciative social media posts in the process.But the free razors \u2014 and the \u201cwelcome to manhood\u201d messages that accompany them \u2014 can be bemusing when sent to the wrong people, particularly in this age when seemingly every move people make online turns into a data point that helps marketers target them. A quick check of social media turned up people posting photos of the Gillette giveaway, with good-natured comments wondering why they had received it.Kody Meyer, a 19-year-old student in Toledo, Iowa, said she received an erroneous birthday razor last month, the second year in a row that has happened. She believes her name to be the culprit.\u201cI kind of understand because Kody isn\u2019t exactly the most feminine name and I\u2019ve had a lot of miscommunications, like being invited to a lot of football camps,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who informed the brand about its mistake on Twitter on June 30. Still, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad as far as promotions go \u2014 it is a really nice razor.\u201dGillette\u2019s mailings are built on the idea that it is providing men with their \u201cfirst real\u201d (or #FirstReal) razors. The packages arrive with booklets outlining the differences between, say, a first suit and a \u201cfirst real suit.\u201d They also include lines like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t claw your way into manhood only to shave with a toy.\u201dThat made the package particularly odd for Jeddie Bristow, a 25-year-old student who lives in Cross Timbers, Mo., and received one in March, two months after her birthday.\u201cThey\u2019re talking about how it\u2019s their first real shave, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ve been shaving since I was 11 \u2014 what are you talking about?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Bristow, who noted that she already buys Gillette\u2019s Venus razors at Walmart. \u201cBut I used it because, hey, free razor, those things are expensive. But it was less than impressive, honestly \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant for leg shaving.\u201dMs. Greer of Alabama was especially mystified by the birthday greetings because the mailing was addressed specifically to her \u201chousehold.\u201d\u201cMy husband and I have different last names and then my kids all have my husband\u2019s last name, so I\u2019m the only Greer,\u201d she said. No clues emerged from her magazine subscriptions or her Amazon account, she said, though she took a close look at the sports socks she bought for her father-in-law recently.The error stood out to Ms. Greer given that many of the ads she sees online tend to be \u201cfreaky on point.\u201d For example, she often likes posts on Facebook related to the St. Louis Cardinals, her hometown baseball team, and the University of Alabama football team, she said, and recently saw an ad for a shirt that read, \u201cMy two passions in life are the St. Louis Cardinals and the Crimson Tide.\u201d\u201cThat was creepily specific to me to the point it\u2019s disconcerting,\u201d she said.The razor was a harmless mistake at the opposite end of the spectrum and so entertaining that she wondered if Gillette did it on purpose in hopes of getting people to post about it on social media, she said.Bret Dodson, a 48-year-old in Seattle who works in cancer research, posted to Facebook about receiving the package on June 27, joking that the company was \u201conly 30 and a half years late.\u201d He said in an interview that he had not liked or followed the brand on social media or made any online purchases that would indicate he was 18. He assumed the company had bought a faulty batch of data that skewed some of its mailings.\u201cI work with a bunch of young people and so I\u2019m very frequently joking about \u2018us hip young millennials,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever entered myself as a millennial online because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d put as my date of birth. Maybe Gillette is really good with data mining and they know I joke about being younger than I am.\u201dBarbara Diecker, a spokeswoman for Gillette, said the number of mix-ups was \u201cvery small\u201d over all. She added, however, that such reports might increase after bigger mailings and that the brand had \u201cjust sent out a fairly large shipment over the last few weeks.\u201d\u201cAs you can imagine, it takes a lot of data to reach two million men \u2014 and there are a number of steps between identifying the men, securing shipping information and then fulfilling the razors,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen dealing with such a large volume over a period of time, there are apt to be some mishaps.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Football Becomes an Unlikely Force in the Gay Rights Movement", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Most weekends, in stadiums across Australia, thousands of spectators line the stands to take in the Australian Football League. And on most weekends, they can see Sam Gilbert, a defender with the St. Kilda Saints, arrive for match day wearing a rainbow-striped gay pride beanie.Mr. Gilbert, 30, epitomizes the modern A.F.L. player: tall and athletic \u2014 and mindful of equality. He\u2019s straight, but he joins a pride march every year.\u201cI want to help,\u201d he said after a recent practice. \u201cI want to be a straight ally and be a voice.\u201dOn Saturday, St. Kilda played in its second annual pride match: an awareness-raising game heavily featuring the signature pride rainbow, including on each player\u2019s uniform. It is just one example of how the A.F.L. \u2014 one of the top sports leagues in the world in terms of average attendance, roughly on par with American baseball \u2014 has tried to present itself as a force for inclusion.By some estimates, almost half of the league\u2019s fans are women, and over the past few years, the league has introduced events and matches that raise awareness of breast cancer as well as gay pride, and also celebrate the country\u2019s Indigenous and multicultural populations.Some fans like James Krstic, a St. Kilda supporter, find it all a bit much, arguing that the league is too involved in social issues. \u201cI think a sport is a sport and should remain as such,\u201d he said.But the league\u2019s push into L.G.B.T. politics comes at a time when Australia\u2019s government is stalled on gay marriage, with lawmakers caught up in an endless debate about whether gay marriage should be addressed in Parliament or by referendum, if at all. And for some activists, the A.F.L. has become an unlikely ally, showing how sports can move faster than politics.\u201cIf the A.F.L. was a parliament, we\u2019d have marriage equality now,\u201d said Clint McGilvray, who works with the Equality Campaign, a national effort to expand Australia\u2019s marriage laws. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion.\u201dStill, the A.F.L. has struggled mightily with issues of equality. Incidents of racial vilification, sexism and homophobia have continued to tarnish the league\u2019s image. Recently, a popular player-turned-presenter was accused of transphobic behavior after referring to Caitlyn Jenner as \u201cit\u201d on a popular weekly A.F.L. TV show.Many players and fans see the league \u2014 like Australia itself \u2014 as still in transition to a more uncertain future.So far, no A.F.L. player, current or retired, has come out as gay, even though some players and trainers believe there are several who could. Some argue that that act may be the real measure of cultural change.\u201cThe A.F.L. have never acknowledged that there\u2019s a problem to be fixed,\u201d said Jason Ball, a former amateur footballer who became the sport\u2019s most high-profile gay player when he revealed his homosexuality in 2012. \u201cThe fact that no players have felt comfortable to come out is reflective of that.\u201dGame TimeOn a cold Saturday night this month, old and new versions of Australian masculinity were on display inside St. Kilda\u2019s locker rooms.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the balls to go out there and play our game,\u201d an assistant coach barked before game.The players wandered around the locker room purposefully, hugging each of their teammates, one by one.It was not a gay pride-themed game, but among the St. Kilda cheer squad\u2019s oversized pompoms and giant banners, a pair of pride flags waved with each goal.\u201cThe culture of the league is changing,\u201d said Sharon Baynes, a longtime Saints supporter wearing a rainbow scarf. \u201cHopefully, soon there might be a gay player coming out.\u201dShannon Downey, a 32-year-old fan who has played Australian rules football since he was a child, was more skeptical. Reflecting a view that is common among sports fans in the United States, Mr. Downey said the league\u2019s displays of social conscience were mostly a business strategy.\u201cIt\u2019s getting a bit farcical, the number of initiatives they\u2019re pushing down people\u2019s throats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re running a corporation that\u2019s trying to capture as much of the market as they can.\u201dLeague officials insist that their commitment is real. Eddie McGuire, the president of the Collingwood Magpies, is a prominent, divisive figure who has alienated some progressive fans and players with off-color jokes. Still, even he argues that the league is ahead of Australian society on progressive issues.\u201cI\u2019ll back the A.F.L. and its clubs ahead of every institution in this country: churches, politicians, political parties, businesses, universities \u2014 the lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely serious.\u201dMr. McGilvray, the marriage equality activist, said he appreciated Mr. McGuire\u2019s enthusiasm, but he noted that \u201cwe have many organizations \u2014 sporting clubs, religious institutions, corporations, councils \u2014 all having a crack in their own way.\u201dIf there were issues that were unresolved, Mr. McGuire added, that was simply because the league reflected the larger context of Australia and human nature. \u201cThere are people who are still bigoted,\u201d he said. \u201cOr are frightened. Or don\u2019t understand.\u201dMany players, fans and officials say that the league\u2019s evolution on sexuality cannot be understood without first reflecting on its fraught history with minorities.In April 1993, Nicky Winmar, an Indigenous player for St. Kilda, was on the receiving end of racist taunts from the Magpies cheer squad. As the match ended, with the Saints victorious, he lifted his shirt in defiance, staring down the crowd as he pointed to his bare skin.It became a watershed moment for the league. Two years later, a rule banning racial vilification was introduced.But the years since have been littered with racially charged incidents.In 2015, Adam Goodes, the most accomplished Indigenous player in the league\u2019s history, spent the twilight of his career draped in boos, after he had security eject a young woman who called him an ape.In April, the Adelaide Crows player Eddie Betts was also called an ape by an opposing team\u2019s fan on a Facebook post that went viral. Last year, Mr. Betts had a banana thrown at him by a fan of the same team.Mr. Winmar, who altered Australia\u2019s debate on race when he lifted his shirt, said the A.F.L. was on the right path to mending its divides. The pride game represents an intersection for Mr. Winmar, whose once-estranged son is gay.\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cLetting people know that they\u2019re safe being who they are, to fulfill their full potential, it\u2019s important.\u201dMr. Gilbert of St. Kilda said that on the field, the culture had already changed. Homophobic \u201csledging,\u201d or trash talk, was now rarely if ever heard, he said.\u201cPeople are starting to understand that it\u2019s not right to say \u2014 that goes with not just sexual orientation, that\u2019s religion and race, too,\u201d he said.On a recent Saturday night in Melbourne, not a half-hour after Mr. Gilbert arrived in his rainbow beanie, a young family filed into an elevator at Etihad Stadium. Inside, wedged between his mother and older brother, a boy no older than 5 wore a pride beanie from last year\u2019s game.Emblazoned across the front, it read, \u201cHow I want to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Baker\u2019s Crusade: Rescuing the Famed French Boulangerie", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAP FERRET, France \u2014 Pascal Rigo was just 7 when he fell in love with baking. Summering with his family here on the Atlantic coast, he began an apprenticeship in a small boulangerie, one of dozens that dotted L\u00e8ge-Cap-Ferret, a spit of land about an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Bordeaux.Over the years, as he built a fortune in the baking business in the United States, one boulangerie after another closed until there was only one left in this tiny town at the tip of the peninsula where he has a home \u2014 a turn of events Mr. Rigo considers an affront to French baking.His opinion of that bakery\u2019s bread isn\u2019t much higher. \u201cPeople say the French are eating less bread because of gluten-free, because of low-carb,\u201d Mr. Rigo said, sitting in a cafe here and dunking a flaky croissant into a hot chocolate made the French way, with melted chocolate diluted by warm milk. \u201cBut bread like that \u2014 that is the reason.\u201dAnd so Mr. Rigo, an ebullient baker with a seemingly perpetual gaptoothed grin, has embarked on a personal crusade to rescue this pillar of French cuisine one bakery at a time, starting here with La P\u2019tite Boulangerie du Ferret, a shop that he opened last summer. He sees it as the first in a nationwide chain of what he calls microboulangeries.He has also started scouting for shuttered boulangeries in small towns, hoping to overhaul their finances and reopen them. The plan is to connect young bakers to defunct bakeries in communities with 2,000 or more people, 20 to 30 miles from a major city.\u201cBread is part of our heritage,\u201d said Mr. Rigo, evoking the popular demand for bread that prompted the infamous phrase \u201cLet them eat cake\u201d during the French Revolution. \u201cI\u2019d like to restore that for my country.\u201d\u201cThe problem is with the economics of the boulangerie, not the bread,\u201d Mr. Rigo said. \u201cI\u2019m going to show that you can make good bread and good money.\u201dAfter much study, he has determined that the old business model simply doesn\u2019t work anymore. \u201cThe real estate would cost 400,000 euros, and then they had to buy equipment, so by the time they opened, the average boulanger was 800,000 euros in the red,\u201d he said. \u201cThey then would be working 20 hours a day because they couldn\u2019t afford to hire anyone to help them, and still, they had trouble turning any profit.\u201dHe plans to get around that problem by shrinking each store, reducing the number of people needed to run it, buying ingredients centrally to enhance the shops\u2019 bargaining power and limiting the number of products sold. \u201cTo try to make profit, boulangers were trying to sell anything and everything, instead of trying to sell more of the things people really want \u2014 the baguettes des copains, the ficelles, the boules,\u201d Mr. Rigo said.To make matters worse, the mills that for years supplied flour to French bakers started becoming competitors in the 1990s, investing in chain bakeries that pump out pain quotidien on an industrial scale often using preformed frozen dough.\u201cThey would sell two baguettes for the price of one, three for the price of two, things like that, and soon, every time a Marie Blach\u00e8re store opened\u201d \u2014 part of a large chain of mill-backed bakeries \u2014 \u201cthree boulangeries in three small towns would close,\u201d Mr. Rigo said.The number of boulangeries in France dropped to 28,000 in 2015, from 37,800 just 20 years earlier. Alexander Goransson, the author of a 2014 report on bread in France and a lead analyst at Euromonitor, a research firm, said that rate has slowed during the past decade, although bakeries continue to close.Mr. Goransson said Mr. Rigo may be putting his plan in motion at just the right time, because more French consumers are showing an interest in high-quality breads \u2014 they call them \u201cartisanale\u201d \u2014 that use minimal ingredients and are baked fresh.On a blustery, overcast Friday morning, Virginie De Laval was picking up four baguettes at La P\u2019tite Boulangerie in Cap Ferret. \u201cI\u2019m buying it because it\u2019s good bread,\u201d she said.She said she sometimes purchased supermarket bread, but only in a pinch. \u201cI think people today are returning more and more to foods that are artisanal, without preservatives and other ingredients that are unfamiliar,\u201d Ms. De Laval said. \u201cThere\u2019s a better appreciation of the way things were done in the past.\u201dOver a span of two hours, 67 customers \u2014 just 600 people live here during the off-season \u2014 pulled up to the tiny bakery to buy baguettes, chewy ficelles and buttery croissants, all made by Maud Moinard, 23, the boulanger who runs the 290-square-foot space.She has all the equipment she needs \u2014 a water chiller, a mixer, an oven, a sink, a proofer, big sacks of flour and a refrigerator, built in under the classic marble display case \u2014 and works her doughs while she sells the breads. She knows her customers so well that before many even step out of their cars, she is already twisting a piece of thin, noisy brown paper around their customary purchases.\u201cSure, it\u2019s sometimes busy doing sales and baking, too, but that\u2019s how I know what I need to make,\u201d Ms. Moinard said.The bakery sold a daily average of 2,000 baguettes des copains last summer, until volume dropped to about 400 when the vacationers left, Mr. Rigo said. In comparison, Mr. Rigo\u2019s La Boulangerie shops in San Francisco each sell about 50 baguettes daily.La P\u2019tite Boulangerie also sells sandwiches and pastries made in a patisserie Mr. Rigo has opened in Cap Ferret, where traditional sweets are made with a local twist. A classic g\u00e2teau Basque, for instance, is made with pine nuts that grow in the forests here and a Bordeaux rum, and is playfully called G\u00e2teau Presque Basque, or \u201cnearly\u201d a g\u00e2teau Basque. And there are a few imports: The shop sells bags of the granola that is a hit at his San Francisco shops.Carole Garcia, the town\u2019s adjutant mayor, stopped in to buy a couple of savory ficelles to enjoy with aperitifs that evening, and sampled a bite of the g\u00e2teau. She said she buys loaves from the other boulangeries here as well \u2014 \u201crelationships, you know; I\u2019m adjutant mayor\u201d \u2014 but the P\u2019tite Boulangerie bread is \u201cwithout comparison.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like bread used to be,\u201d she said.Ms. Garcia has known Mr. Rigo for years. He and his business partners here played soccer together when they were children, and he has become something of a local celebrity as the boy who left home and made good.He grew up east of here in Paillet, where his mother was the postmaster. The family spent summers in Cap Ferret; Mr. Rigo apprenticed here and at two other French bakeries.Soon Mr. Rigo also was making breads for restaurants like L\u2019Hermitage and the dining room at the Checkers hotel, where Thomas Keller was chef. \u201cWe were making bread for about 70 of the best restaurants in Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Rigo said. \u201cIt was hard work, but fun.\u201dHe relocated to the Bay Area to be close to the bakery, which he still owns, and soon opened the La Boulange chain. The shops were supplied in part by his commercial kitchen, but they also had their own kitchens, and they fast developed a passionate fan base. By the time he sold the business to Starbucks in 2013, La Boulange was 23 stores, and the commercial bakery had 1,500 employees creating products for retailers like Trader Joe\u2019s and Costco.Mr. Rigo then took on another job that seemed folly to Wall Street and many Starbucks consumers: helping the coffee giant retool its baked goods, which were notoriously bad. This meant finding commercial kitchens around the country that could match the quality of his own, and finding space in Starbucks stores for ovens to heat the products.The experience left Mr. Rigo deflated and defensive. Even though many of the new baked goods sold well, he said, he felt the company was hesitant to put its marketing heft behind them. \u201cNo matter how big the improvements were that we made \u2014 and the improvements were significant \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to talk about them because they didn\u2019t want Wall Street to think they were a food company,\u201d Mr. Rigo said.(Asked to respond to that criticism, Sanja Gould, a spokeswoman for Starbucks, noted comments made late last year to Wall Street analysts and investors by Sharon Rothstein, the company\u2019s global chief marketing officer. \u201cOur food platform represents the biggest growth opportunity for our business,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said.)Since then, much of Munchery\u2019s management has changed, and the business has turned around, said Baochi Nguyen, its vice president for marketing. \u201cThere are distinctions between food delivery models,\u201d Ms. Nguyen wrote in an email. \u201cSome are proving to be not as effective at scale, while others, like Munchery, are yielding really promising results.\u201dBy the time Mr. Rigo left Munchery, he had decided to open La P\u2019tite Boulangerie here.He and his wife, Virginie, have begun spending more time in Cap Ferret now that their three children are older. He is known for tooling around town on his bicycle in shorts, whatever the weather. \u201cI never take the car when I\u2019m here \u2014 it\u2019s much more fun to get around by bicycle,\u201d he said.He issues a steady stream of ideas: a drive-through pizza business in California, how to obtain organic ingredients for the best price. \u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cI have too much energy as it is.\u201dOne of his most ambitious plans is to open a training school for young bakers here to ensure a ready supply of boulangers. If the students go on to open boulangeries in small towns, Mr. Rigo and his partners will provide financing packages that will allow those students to own up to 70 percent of their businesses.\u201cI really think we can become the biggest smallest business in France,\u201d he said.An article last Wednesday about the baker Pascal Rigo\u2019s plan to start a chain of boulangeries in France misstated the surname of an executive of Starbucks, which bought a business from Mr. Rigo. She is Sharon Rothstein, not Rothman.Advertisement"}

Later, a mutual friend told me she\u2019s been doing Botox and fillers. The Botox user and I talk freely about our kids and husbands. We\u2019re good friends.

I don\u2019t blame us for thinking our views should be shared on a nonstop basis.

Forty years later, it\u2019s hard to get people to shut up about their therapists. Times change.On to baby showers. In the old days, parents-to-be, their siblings and their parents would never give a baby shower. (Aunts and cousins were somehow fine.) This was because it was appalling \u2014 just appalling, right, Margot? \u2014 to think of people giving a party where they, or their immediate family, would collect gifts. Today, we\u2019re all in on the joke: Baby showers simultaneously celebrate a joyful event and outfit the nursery. Gifts are 100-percent baked into the enterprise.It is silly to distinguish between cousins and siblings (or parents-to-be, for that matter) as appropriate hosts. For folks who like the fantasy (\u201cWhat? A gift?\u201d), let them keep asking others, sotto voce, to host their showers for them. But why judge a pregnant lady who wants to give her own party? And now, for the mind-blowing finale: You don\u2019t have to give a gift if you don\u2019t want to. Simply share in the joy of the cupcakes and the coming birth. Ka-boom!A neighbor asked to borrow my blender. She had picked a lot of blueberries and planned to use them in breakfast smoothies that week. I delivered the blender with a smile. She promised a smoothie in return. That was two weeks ago. How do I get my blender back, and how do you explain her failure to give me a smoothie?ANONYMOUS, QUEENSA call to your neighbor should see your blender safely home: \u201cCan you return my blender, please?\u201d As for her failure to deliver on the smoothie promise, add: \u201cWhatever happened to my smoothie, Baby Jane? I was looking forward to it.\u201d People generally mean well. But sometimes we get distracted and forget, or sleep late and fail to make smoothies, as our hoard of berries rots in the fridge. Turn the other cheek (and tell her you\u2019re using the blender the next time she asks for it).I sat next to my friend\u2019s husband at the lunch counter where I often see him. When the waitress came, he couldn\u2019t remember which salad he usually orders. (He always has the chef salad.) Should I warn my friend that her husband may have Alzheimer\u2019s?You people are working my last nerve this week! No, you may not frighten your friend. Unless you are a physician qualified to diagnose dementia and have evidence other than a momentary salad lapse, please be quiet about your (baseless) suspicions.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.Advertisement"}

The laws remain murky, but the government is unlikely to prosecute you, and the streaming video services have shown no desire to go after customers.But so far, Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming companies have indicated that they\u2019re either quietly accepting of the practice or possibly even cheering it on as a marketing strategy.In 2016, two court decisions led some to conclude that password sharing is illegal, but whether the decisions apply to your Netflix account remains in dispute.In the dissent, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the decision could be applied to everyday password sharing.\u201cIf we interpret \u2018without authorization\u2019 in a way that includes common practices like password sharing, millions of our citizens would become potential federal criminals overnight,\u201d he wrote.But the majority opinion disputed the sentiment, dismissing fears as hypotheticals while writing that \u201cthis appeal is not about password sharing.\u201d Much of the media coverage focused on the dissenting opinion.Legal experts have said both cases leave a lot of uncertainty.\u201cA lot of times you get legal clarity when there are cases,\u201d said Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University who represented Power Ventures. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have cases because the government doesn\u2019t prosecute password-sharing cases, or hasn\u2019t, and the companies have not brought lawsuits either. So we just don\u2019t know.\u201dJamie Williams, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the organization is among those seeking clarity from the Supreme Court.\u201cAs a technical matter, it is illegal,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cWill the federal government prosecute you for it? Probably not.\u201dNetflix, HBO, Hulu and Amazon declined to comment for this story. But in past statements, the companies have indicated they\u2019re not too worried about the trend.\u201cPassword sharing is something you have to learn to live with, because there\u2019s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s no bright line, and we\u2019re doing fine as is.\u201d\u201cShould it become a big number, we will deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will change the number of concurrent streams that are available. But right now, the number really isn\u2019t significant.\u201dOne reason the companies appear hesitant to police the passwords harder: Freeloaders could become the next customers.\u201cWe could crack down on it, but you wouldn\u2019t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief financial officer David Wells said in September, according to Reuters.In both cases, there might be a lingering sense that if you like the content enough to be watching it, you ought to pay a bit of money so the creators can keep creating things like it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Decline of the Dollar Means", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe value of the dollar has fallen steadily since the beginning of 2017, erasing a sharp rise immediately after President Trump\u2019s election.To take one example, the number of euros that can be obtained for one dollar has declined to the lowest level in more than a year. The dollar has also declined against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi.Is that bad? It sounds bad.The exchange rate is a price \u2014 the price of money. When the price of milk goes down, that is good for families and bad for dairy farmers. When gas prices fall, commuters are happy and Exxon Mobil is sad. When the dollar drops, there are also winners and losers.The winners are American companies that sell goods and services to foreigners \u2014 manufacturers like Caterpillar; tourist attractions like Disney World; technology companies like Facebook \u2014 because those customers can exchange their currencies for more dollars.The losers are American consumers who now must pay more dollars to obtain foreign goods and services.Of course, many Americans are in both categories. They may benefit at work and suffer at the supermarket.Why is the dollar losing value?The dollar strengthened after the presidential election because investors expected Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans to increase domestic growth by fulfilling campaign promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations, among other measures. The reversal of those gains reflects diminished confidence that Mr. Trump will be able to deliver.So we\u2019re back where we started?The climb started in 2011 as the American economy began to recover more quickly than the economies of the rest of the developed world. Domestic growth was sluggish by historical standards, but things were worse everywhere else. The United States was \u201cthe cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry basket,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis investment firm.There was also a rush into dollar-denominated assets. At the beginning of 2011, Mr. Paulsen noted recently, the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was a little lower than the available return on a portfolio of debt issued by other major nations, including Britain, Germany and Japan. By 2016, the Treasury rate was as much as five times as high as the global portfolio.The rest of the world now appears to be doing a little better. The International Monetary Fund said in June that it was cutting its forecast for the growth of the United States economy, but stronger growth elsewhere would offset the impact on the world economy.Should the United States push down the dollar?Mr. Trump has said that he would like the dollar to decline in value.Some economists think he is right.The value of the dollar, relative to other currencies, is supposed to reflect the strength of the American economy, relative to other countries. But exchange rates can be distorted by investors, which in turn can distort patterns of economic growth. And there is some evidence the price of the dollar remains above its actual value, which tends to encourage imports and discourage exports.Could the United States push down the dollar?Exchange rates are determined by open trading on financial markets. Some governments actively participate in those markets to influence the value of their currencies. The United States in recent decades has mostly stayed on the sidelines.Recent administrations have focused instead on pressing other nations to stay out of the market. The Bush and Obama administrations, for example, made progress in persuading China to allow the value of the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar.The Trump administration has not articulated a consistent policy on these issues.How is the value of the dollar measured?The dollar can be exchanged for a wide range of currencies. At last count, the United Nations recognized about 180. The Federal Reserve calculates an average of exchange rates by weighting rates based on the volume of trade with the United States, so the price of dollars in Japanese yen is more important than in Icelandic kronur.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Duolingo", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationI didn\u2019t buy a smartphone until I was forced to in 2013, when my ancient flip was put out of its misery by a spilled can of Vanilla Coke. As a new convert, I quickly came to believe my phone would soon improve my life. I began downloading apps that promised to make me better: more organized, better read, more cultured. I was convinced I could swipe my way to self-improvement.Eventually, I learned about Duolingo, which turns the complex task of learning a new language into something like a video game. Users start by picking the language they want to study (there are currently 23 options available for English speakers, from Swahili to Welsh), after which they\u2019re greeted with about 100 vocabulary and grammar \u2018\u2018skills,\u2019\u2019 structured like a tree. Finish a skill, and you\u2019re rewarded with a dopamine burst in the form of points. Then you do another one.I did a couple of French lessons, which took all of five minutes. It was easy, and I was smitten by the possibilities. Maybe I\u2019ll even take up German, I thought as I started the second lesson. I would become cosmopolitan and sophisticated, skipping across Europe and impressing local shopkeepers with my breezy fluency wherever I went. Maybe I would learn to differentiate among various wursts. Anything felt possible.Of course, I soon lost interest and stopped using Duolingo, or for that matter, any apps that weren\u2019t Instagram or Tinder. (Turns out, self-improvement apps are way more engaging when you\u2019re just using them to distract yourself from other problems.) Then, one night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I tried reading a book, then I tried scrolling through the Facebook profiles of people I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school, but neither worked. Soon it was 3 a.m., and I was still awake, but now I was also full of self-loathing. If I was going to stay up and waste time online, I might as well do something that wasn\u2019t going to make me feel awful. For the first time in two years, I opened my Duolingo app, and I decided I wanted to learn Dutch.The app eventually became a type of productive therapy, replacing other time-wasters in my life. Can\u2019t sleep? Let\u2019s learn more Dutch. In the mood to text an ex? Maybe I should start the Danish course instead. Fighting the urge to tweet that ill-thought-out opinion on current events? You\u2019ll feel so much better reviewing Dutch prepositions.I liked how structured it was, that I could measure my progress in terms of winning points and completing levels and outdoing my friends. I am a frustratingly left-brained person: I take comfort in things that can be quantified. But more than that, though the points gave me a sort of rush similar to getting a stack of Instagram likes, it never felt like an empty thrill. I had finally committed to a self-improvement project, and every time I leveled up in a language, I felt I was one step closer to fluency. I became obsessed.Learning a language to fluency requires discipline, frequent practice, ideally immersion \u2014 much more than a simple language-learning game can offer. That\u2019s fine, though. Fluency stopped being my goal a while ago, when I realized that trying to master several different foreign languages in the span of a few months would only be another stress-inducing, insurmountable project, exactly the sort of thing that led me to seek distractions in the first place. More than anything, though, Duolingo made me confident in my decision-making \u2014 I had good taste in bad ways to spend my time.Any online time-waster offers an escape from the world, often by preying on your worst instincts: envy, pettiness, poor impulse control. But Duolingo offered an escape that made me feel connected to the better parts of the world, and of myself. I may not have become a globe-trotting polyglot, but language learning did trigger a curiosity into other lives lived. My phone hadn\u2019t made me a better person, exactly, but at least it didn\u2019t make me worse.It took me about two weeks to make it through the Swedish course earlier this year \u2014 helped, of course, by never having to speak it out loud. To celebrate, I found a stream of \u2018\u2018The Devil\u2019s Eye,\u2019\u2019 the film by Ingmar Bergman. Five minutes in, I realized I couldn\u2019t understand a word they were saying. I turned on English subtitles and watched the rest of the movie, phone comfortably in hand.Anna Fitzpatrick is a writer living in Toronto.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Quick, Satisfying Fix for Weeknight Chicken", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteWhen it comes to boneless, skinless chicken breasts, there are few problems that a good pounding can\u2019t fix.For years I thought I inherently disliked boneless chicken breasts, but I realize now that it wasn\u2019t the chicken\u2019s fault. It was mine for not taking enough care to properly prepare the breasts.Proper cooking begins with a proper pounding \u2014 that is, hitting the meat with a mallet, a rolling pin or a big heavy frying pan until it compacts into a cutlet.The point isn\u2019t so much punishment as it is a corrective measure. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have two major strikes against them: unevenness of form and leanness of flesh. Fixing the shape helps ensure the meat\u2019s juiciness.When pounded, the tapered shape of a chicken breast (bulging in the middle, slimmer at the ends) flattens out into one even layer. You can whack them thin (one-quarter inch) or thicker (one-half inch or so), but thinner breasts are more apt to overcook. Always keep an eye on them while they are on the heat.Once you have an evenly sized piece of meat, it is much easier to control the cooking, no matter the method. Whether grilled, broiled or saut\u00e9ed, a chicken breast is done just as soon as it turns opaque on the surfaces, but stays slightly pink in the center \u2014 well before it has a chance to dry out. Because there is so little fat, the juices are the only thing moistening the meat. Lose those, and the chicken breast turns rubbery.Like brining, marinating the chicken with salt and other seasonings helps the meat hold on to its juices. Here, I use a combination of salt, olive oil, garlic, lime zest and paprika. Even a 30-minute stint makes a big difference in terms of taste and texture.This combination of juicy, garlicky chicken and spicy, herbal cucumbers is satisfying in any season, and particularly perfect in summer.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Pharma Spends on Share Buybacks, but R&D? Not So Much", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameUnder fire for skyrocketing drug prices, pharmaceutical companies often offer this response: The high costs of their products are justified because the proceeds generate money for crucial research on new cures and treatments.The paper\u2019s five authors concluded that from 2006 through 2015, the 18 drug companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index spent a combined $516 billion on buybacks and dividends. This exceeded by 11 percent the companies\u2019 research and development spending of $465 billion during these years.The authors contend that many big pharmaceutical companies are living off patents that are decades-old and have little to show in the way of new blockbuster drugs. But their share buybacks and dividend payments inoculate them against shareholders who might be concerned about lackluster research and development.A few companies have spent more money repurchasing shares than they allocated to research over the period, the study found. They included Gilead Sciences, which spent $27 billion on buybacks versus $17 billion on research, and Biogen Idec, which repurchased $14.6 billion in stock and spent $13.8 billion on research and development.\u201cThe key cause of high drug prices, restricted access to medicines and stifled innovation, we submit, is a social disease called \u2018maximizing shareholder value,\u2019\u201d the study\u2019s authors concluded.This concept, the authors said, is actually \u201can ideology of value extraction.\u201d And chief among the beneficiaries of the extraction are drug company executives, whose pay packages, based in part on stock prices, are among the lushest in corporate America.\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of spending on R&D in the U.S. economy, and no shortage of spending on life sciences, even though it has declined somewhat in real terms,\u201d one of the authors, William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said in an interview. \u201cBut there really is very little drug development going on in companies showing the highest profits and capturing much of the gains.\u201dWhile stock buybacks appear to be particularly troublesome among drugmakers, big companies in other industries \u2014 in sectors like banking, retail, technology and consumer goods, among others \u2014 are also buying back boatloads of their shares. Through May, some $390 billion in buybacks have been announced this year, $13 billion more than at this time in 2016, according to figures compiled by Jeffrey Yale Rubin at Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm.Many companies contend that stock buybacks are a great way to return value to their shareholders. Investors often agree. By reducing the equity outstanding at a company, the repurchases increase its per-share earnings, often giving a boost to its stock.Buybacks made at low cost can be a fine use of a company\u2019s capital. But when share repurchases replace a company\u2019s research-and-development spending, that indicates its management is unable or unwilling to spend on innovation that could generate future earnings to shareholders.As the buyback binge continues, another new academic study shows, a heavy reliance on them actually hurts corporate performance over the long haul. These researchers found that the more capital a business invests in stock repurchases based on its current market capitalization, \u201cthe less likely that company is to experience long-term growth in overall market value.\u201d\u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d is by Robert U. Ayres, emeritus professor of economics, political science and technology management at the global business school Insead, and Michael Olenick, a research fellow there. It compares the performance of companies that lean heavily on buybacks with those that do not.Spending money on buybacks and dividends has increased among United States companies from negligible levels in the 1980s, the researchers said, to 38 percent of earnings in 2000. By 2011, buybacks had grown to 79 percent of earnings, rocketing to 110 percent in 2015.Mr. Ayres and Mr. Olenick found that 199 companies repurchased shares equal to at least half their current value. Some 64 companies spent over 100 percent of their current market capitalization on buybacks.When the academics combined these companies\u2019 current market values with the amounts they had spent on buybacks, the sum showed what the companies should have been worth if they had invested the money in a money-market account instead.Fifty companies have spent more inflation-adjusted capital buying back stock than their businesses are currently worth in market value, the study found. Companies on this list include HP Inc., J. C. Penney and Sears Holdings.By contrast, the research identified 269 strong performers that have repurchased stock worth just 2 percent or less of their current market values. They include Facebook, Xcel Energy, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.Company executives who buy back large numbers of shares instead of investing in their businesses are committing corporate suicide, Mr. Olenick said. \u201cWhen managers can\u2019t create value in the business other than buying their own stock,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cit seems like it\u2019s time for a management change.\u201dHis co-author, Mr. Ayres, said he suspected the buyback craze was rooted in executives\u2019 laser focus on short-term results. \u201cThey have short-term expectations,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re in their jobs for a few years at most; they\u2019re not really interested in the long-term future of the company.\u201dShare buybacks provide immediate gratification, the stock market equivalent of a sugar high. That makes them alluring in the short term. Until the crash that usually follows.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Advertisers might target you accordingly.Jamie Lee Williams, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said information about the size of a home and the amount of furniture in it could allow advertisers to deduce the owner\u2019s income level. Eventually, it might even be possible to identify the brands the owner uses.\u201cEspecially combined with other data, this is going to be able to reveal a ton of information about what people\u2019s lifestyles are like, what people\u2019s daily patterns are like,\u201d Ms. Williams said.Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said that if iRobot did share the data, it would raise a variety of legal questions.What happens if a Roomba user consents to the data collection and later sells his or her home \u2014 especially furnished \u2014 and now the buyers of the data have a map of a home that belongs to someone who didn\u2019t consent, Mr. Gidari asked. How long is the data kept? If the house burns down, can the insurance company obtain the data and use it to identify possible causes? Can the police use it after a robbery?Some who reacted online on Monday and Tuesday were alarmed.\u201cYour friendly little Roomba could soon become a creepy little spy that sells maps of your house to advertisers,\u201d tweeted OpenMedia, a Canadian nonprofit.In its written response, iRobot said that it was \u201ccommitted to the absolute privacy of our customer-related data.\u201d Consumers can use a Roomba without connecting it to the internet, or \u201copt out of sending map data to the cloud through a switch in the mobile app.\u201d\u201cNo data is sold to third parties,\u201d the statement added. \u201cNo data will be shared with third parties without the informed consent of our customers.\u201d\u201cInformed consent,\u201d of course, can be a vaguely defined term; Ms. Williams and Mr. Gidari noted that it might simply involve a privacy policy that few consumers read. But this criticism is \u201creally applicable across the board to everybody\u2019s privacy policy,\u201d Mr. Gidari said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to criticize one without criticizing all.\u201dMr. Gidari added that in today\u2019s technological climate, iRobot\u2019s plans were unsurprising. \u201cIt kind of goes with the mantra that everything that can be connected will be connected,\u201d he said, and a corollary \u201cis that all the data that can be collected will be collected.\u201dBut in the long term, what iRobot does with individual users\u2019 data may not be the most important question. The third-party collection and dissemination of information about the inside of homes could have implications for the privacy laws that constrain the government and law enforcement.The Supreme Court has held that Americans have \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy in your home,\u201d Mr. Gidari said. \u201cOnce your home is turned inside out, does that reasonable expectation of privacy dissipate?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated iRobot\u2019s plans, based on a Reuters report that was later corrected. The company said it might share mapping data with customers\u2019 consent, not sell it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Social Media, Vietnam\u2019s Dissidents Grow Bolder Despite Crackdown", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 A prominent blogger and environmental activist in Vietnam was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison on charges of national security offenses, including sharing anti-state propaganda on social media.Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, better known by her online handle Mother Mushroom, had been held incommunicado since she was arrested in October, and attendance at her trial was strictly controlled.\u201cI hope that everyone will speak up and fight, overcome their own fears to build a better country,\u201d she said, according to the lawyer. The statement was reposted thousands of times.In authoritarian Vietnam, the internet has become the de facto forum for the country\u2019s growing number of dissenting voices. Facebook connections in particular have mobilized opposition to government policies; they played a key role in mass protests against the state\u2019s handling of an environmental disaster last year. Now, the government is tightening its grip on the internet, arresting and threatening bloggers, and pressing Facebook and YouTube to censor what appears on their sites.\u201cFacebook is being used as an organizing tool, as a self-publishing platform, as a monitoring device for people when they are being detained and when they get released,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.Facebook is being used \u201cto connect communities that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be connected,\u201d he said.Nguyen Anh Tuan, 27, a pro-democracy activist, said the growing number of dissidents forging connections through social media had emboldened him.The first time the police interrogated him in 2011, he said, he felt utterly alone. His parents and friends disapproved of his political writings, and he knew few other people he could turn to for help.Mr. Tuan still faces police harassment and his passport has been confiscated. But the most recent time he was called in for questioning, he posted a copy of the summons to Facebook, along with a satirical note demanding to be paid for the time he spent in custody.His note went viral, and other people followed suit, posting their own police summonses on Facebook and asking for compensation. \u201cRegarding activism, I cannot feel lonely anymore,\u201d he said.Vietnam\u2019s Facebook users \u2014 who now number 45 million, almost half the country\u2019s population \u2014 use the site to organize prison visits and vigils outside police stations for detainees, and to solicit donations for political prisoners. And dissidents are increasingly migrating political and personal blogs, which can be easily blocked by the government, onto Facebook, which is so widely used that blocking it entirely would not be feasible.Mr. Tuan helps run a fund that supports the families of prisoners of conscience, including Ms. Quynh\u2019s mother and two young children. He said that much of the support now came from people inside the country sending money from their personal bank accounts, which the state can trace. In the past, he said, overseas Vietnamese communities drove most of the dissent and supplied most of the money.\u201cThey know very well that they could be checked by the government, but they dare to do it,\u201d he said of his local donors.That has not gone unnoticed by the government, which is also asserting its authority in new ways. Ms. Quynh is one of over 100 bloggers and activists jailed in Vietnam, according to Human Rights Watch. Pham Minh Hoang, another popular blogger, was stripped of his citizenship and deported last week to France, where he also holds citizenship.The government has strategically cut access to Facebook when protests are expected, and earlier this year asked both Facebook and YouTube to help it eliminate fake accounts and other \u201ctoxic\u201d content, like anti-government material, saying it had identified up to 8,000 YouTube videos that fit that description, according to the local newspaper Tuoi Tre. The government also warned Vietnamese companies that their ads must not appear next to that sort of content.Facebook has said its policy is to abide by local laws, although there was no indication it had removed content in Vietnam thus far.Last week, shortly before a planned interview, he was picked up by police near his house and taken for a five-and-a-half-hour drive to the seaside and back. He said he had been similarly detained 11 other times in the past year and a half.\u201cI guess that they are too afraid,\u201d Mr. Quang A said. \u201cThey see the situation is too dangerous for them, and they see peaceful activists as a very dangerous enemy.\u201dThe report relies partly on the activists\u2019 own photos and videos of their injuries, often filmed shakily on smartphones and quickly shared online.Jonathan London, a Vietnam specialist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said that despite recent repression, the transformation wrought by the internet in a short period had been \u201castonishing and hopeful.\u201dIt is \u201cremarkable that in a country that as recently as 15 or 20 years ago had one of the lowest rates of telephone usage in the world has thrust rapidly into an era of 24-hour news and continuous social and political criticism accessible to everyone,\u201d he said.Pham Anh Cuong, 45, an electrical engineer, was not outspoken about politics until two years ago, when an activist he followed online, Nguyen Chi Tuyen, 43, was severely beaten by five men. Mr. Cuong saw photographs of Mr. Tuyen\u2019s bloody face and was alarmed by the brutality of the attack.Today, he considers himself \u201cone who raises my voice,\u201d if not fully a dissident. His goal is to share information with family and friends, rather than depend on the mainstream news media, which is nearly all state-owned.\u201cThe very first time I wrote on Facebook, nobody even \u2018liked\u2019 it \u2014 they were scared of pressing the like button,\u201d he said. \u201cNow people are starting to like and they are starting to share as well.\u201dIn a cafe in Hanoi last week, the two friends simultaneously chatted, chain-smoked and checked Facebook. They noticed a state media story criticizing Mother Mushroom for receiving a cash prize from a human rights group in Stockholm. Mr. Tuyen immediately tagged a Swedish diplomat to alert her to the piece and asked the rights group for comment.The two began scrolling again.\u201cHere\u2019s news from one of my friends, a doctor in Saigon, who just heard the news that Mother Mushroom is in debt,\u201d Mr. Tuyen said.\u201cThe doctor in Saigon raised his voice that we should contribute to give money to her family,\u201d he said.He typed for a moment, then looked up again.\u201cI just commented, \u2018I will join.\u2019\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mitch McConnell, Master Tactician, Faces Daunting Challenge: A Health Bill", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell excels at devising crafty ways for Senate Republicans to avoid paying a high price on politically explosive issues.Take, for instance, his ingenious 2011 plan to clear the way for increases in the federal debt limit without Republican fingerprints. The McConnell maneuver turned the always-contentious process on its head and allowed Republicans to register their opposition to the increases while simultaneously permitting the necessary rise in the debt limit to avoid an economic meltdown. Even critics tipped their hats.Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, is going to need all the creativity he can muster to escape his current predicament.The Senate\u2019s Republican health care plan is in real trouble, and the fight that will be renewed next week on Capitol Hill is exposing the limits of Mr. McConnell\u2019s prowess in bending his colleagues and the Senate to his will. Deep understanding of Senate procedures and shrewd political instincts can only get you so far when many of your colleagues are truly anxious and fear the consequences of taking major action on health care policy.\u201cIt could not be more different from the difficulty of raising the debt limit because it is policy that affects millions of Americans and health care is so personal,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who is among those who have balked at her party\u2019s plan.Mr. McConnell knew his best chance to pass the bill was a quick strike before the Fourth of July recess, and he was right. As expected, the weeklong break has only complicated his already difficult task. Even usually certain Republican votes such as Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Hoeven of North Dakota have joined the cadre of Republicans expressing resistance to the health care proposal, creating more distance between Mr. McConnell and the magic number of 50 votes needed to pass the bill.At the same time, conservative advocacy groups have intensified their demand that Republicans follow through on their repeated promises to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care bill or incur their wrath. They have also gotten behind a proposal by two Republican senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, that would move the health care proposal to the right and potentially drive off more support than it gathers.Mr. McConnell has expressed mounting frustration at the inability of the unified Republican government to make progress on health care and other issues.\u201cThe American people said, \u2018We elected a Republican president, a Republican House and a Republican Senate and we want to see some results,\u2019\u201d he told an audience in Kentucky over the recess. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t say anything other than I agree with you. But it is not easy, and we are going to continue to wrestle with this and try to get it done.\u201d\u201cNo action is not an option,\u201d he emphasized. That remark seemed aimed at quelling calls to simply repeal the law, an alternative that faces steep procedural obstacles because it would require Democratic votes and Democrats will not provide them.On Thursday, Mr. McConnell again suggested that Republicans might find themselves in negotiations with Democrats on a modest plan to shore up the existing health insurance exchanges if they cannot advance their own legislation. His comment both laid the groundwork for a defeat while trying to provide an incentive for Republicans to get behind the leadership plan.The health care fight does not play to Mr. McConnell\u2019s typical strengths. It is an extremely complex policy matter, and Mr. McConnell has often reveled more in tactics and procedure than the arcana of community rating and adverse selection.Even some fellow Republicans acknowledge that Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal to allow hearings on the health care proposal has backfired, denying Republican lawmakers the opportunity to hear from experts, gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the legislation, and discern potential lines of attack as well as the support for any changes.Republicans are finding how constituents respond when Congress tries to take a benefit away. The closest comparison might be the decision in 1989 to repeal a new Medicare catastrophic coverage law.But it was overturned in only about a year with the enthusiastic approval of the people who were supposed to benefit from it. The Affordable Care Act has had much more time to become enmeshed in the health care system, with millions of people relying on it \u2014 especially those receiving guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions. The beneficiaries of the law are now making their sentiments clearly known.\u201cI think it is so difficult for Mitch to thread the needle on this given the narrow majority in the Senate,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how he does it. But I don\u2019t ever underestimate his abilities.\u201dMr. McConnell has had failures in the past, like his inability to prevent the 2013 government shutdown. But he has more often fashioned a way out that few others saw, whether it was cutting a deal on student loans and transportation spending or keeping the Congress and the country from plunging over a fiscal cliff.He has compared the current situation to a Rubik\u2019s cube, where he is busily twisting and turning until he finally lines up the elusive 50 votes. But in this case, he is discovering that there is no solution within easy reach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China appears to have received help on Saturday from an unlikely source in its fight against tools that help users evade its Great Firewall of internet censorship: Apple.Software made by foreign companies to help users skirt the country\u2019s system of internet filters has vanished from Apple\u2019s app store on the mainland.A search on Saturday showed that a number of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on the company\u2019s app store there.ExpressVPN wrote in its blog that the removal was \u201csurprising and unfortunate.\u201dIt added, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China\u2019s censorship efforts.\u201dSunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been taken down from the app store.\u201cWe gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.\u201dIn a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license. \u201cWe have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThis is not the first time that Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a new reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet.But they also mark the first time China has successfully used its influence with a major foreign tech platform, like Apple, to push back against the software makers.Greater China is Apple\u2019s largest market outside the United States. That has left the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean itself off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.In response, Apple has made a number of moves to ensure that it stays on Beijing\u2019s good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.This month, the company said it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in China.Apple has operated its app store in China for many years with only the occasional run-in with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing\u2019s move in December to target news sites indicate that China\u2019s internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple\u2019s China app store.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the software produced by Golden Frog. It is VyprVPN, not VyperVPN.Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Malcolm is expected to outpace the rest in the 25-mile bike ride on the Henry Hudson Parkway. Doug, who has completed four marathons, should prevail in the roughly six-mile run through Central Park. Calvin, now in his fourth triathlon, said he was aiming for second place in each leg, and Greg \u2014 the only Sigelbaum doing the competition for the first time \u2014 is the wild card.\u201cThis is going to be our first group race where all five of us are doing it together,\u201d said Calvin, who was the first Sigelbaum to compete in the triathlon, in 2014.\u201cWe\u2019re all going to have a lot of fun, but at the same time I can\u2019t let Malcolm beat me. I can\u2019t let my dad beat me. I can\u2019t let my youngest brother beat me, especially, and I just want to keep up with this guy,\u201d he added lightheartedly, pointing to Doug, who he said can outrun the rest of the family \u201cby a long shot.\u201dGrowing up, the four brothers would often compete two-on-two in games like basketball and table tennis. They plan to do the same at the triathlon, adding up the times of the oldest and youngest brothers, and comparing that result with the combined times of the middle two brothers, to determine the family champions.It makes sense that the Sigelbaums are competing as a pack. With the exception of Doug, who flew in from San Francisco, they all live within a mile of one another in the city. They often go to Knicks games, run the reservoir in Central Park and eat Sunday night dinners as a unit.The triathlon will include professionals, paratriathletes and others from 45 states and 40 countries as far away as Australia and Japan. We asked the Sigelbaums to share race-day advice for first-timers taking on the challenge this weekend.\u201cStay hydrated, drink little gels and keep your nutrition going during the race,\u201d Doug said. \u201cAlways drink water when offered.\u201d\u201cPace yourself; don\u2019t let the adrenaline get to you in the beginning,\u201d Calvin said. \u201cWork on your transition times because you can either help or hurt yourself there,\u201d he said, referring to the minutes spent at the changing station, moving from water to bike, and then from bike to run.And in the Hudson, \u201cdon\u2019t put your feet on the ground,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty gross down there, so if you\u2019re getting tired, just float.\u201dTheir father chimed in: \u201cGetting out of the swim, do not let your feet drop as you\u2019re coming to the ramp; it\u2019s just this disgusting, slimy silt at the bottom there.

{"Headline": "Aligot\u00e9, Burgundy\u2019s Other White Grape, Makes Its Case", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourMARSANNAY, France \u2014 In a cramped cellar under a courtyard in this small town on the northern edge of Burgundy, Sylvain Pataille drew a sample of a 2016 white wine from an old barrel and filled our glasses.The wine was young and a bit cloudy, but its energy and breadth were already evident, with flavors of citrus, herbs and, above all, a penetrating, stony minerality. It was delicious.\u201cI adore the precise terroir expression of aligot\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Pataille said.The great reds and whites of Burgundy, made of pinot noir and chardonnay, are among the most coveted and expensive wines in the world. But aligot\u00e9?For the last two years, I have had so many delicious aligot\u00e9s that I traveled to Burgundy in an effort to understand why the wines were not more appreciated.Since 2013, Mr. Pataille has been bottling separate cuv\u00e9es of aligot\u00e9, planted in some of his best plots, to demonstrate how well it can transmit the character of a place.\u201cAligot\u00e9 expresses terroir almost more than chardonnay,\u201d he said.Why? Because, when the grapes are farmed conscientiously and the wines are made with precision, they can be delicious and distinctive, full of the energy and minerality that are the hallmarks of aligot\u00e9.It is wonderful with food. It\u2019s great with shellfish and other seafood, and Mr. Pataille said it goes particularly well with chicken in cream sauces. I love it with pasta sauces, like pesto or white clam sauce, that would ordinarily point to an Italian white.The grape has been grown in Burgundy for centuries. Back in the 19th century, before the phylloxera aphid destroyed European grapevines, aligot\u00e9 was often intermingled with chardonnay in the best vineyards. When growers replanted, they mostly replaced aligot\u00e9 with chardonnay, though aligot\u00e9 was still found in the grand cru Corton-Charlemagne vineyard up until the 1970s.The cultural connotation of aligot\u00e9 may have particular meaning today in a region where newfound fame and wealth may in the long run overwhelm a culture built on the image of the community of vignerons, the small farmers who tend the vines, make the wines and know the land inside and out.\u201cThere is no question of doing something else,\u201d Mr. Roulot said. \u201cThey are in all the family stories.\u201dHe grows the grapes organically and does the same work in the vineyard as he does with his best Meursaults. The treatment diverges in the cellar, however, where he ferments and ages aligot\u00e9 in steel tanks, instead of in oak, which preserve freshness rather than encouraging complexity.\u201cIt\u2019s simple, but it has to speak of the estate,\u201d Mr. Roulot said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be a pretentious wine, all puffed up. It was a wine for the family and the worker. Maybe I\u2019m a prisoner of old habits, but a simple wine is a simple wine, and there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201dMr. Roulot\u2019s aligot\u00e9s are textured, precise and alive. The 2014, an exceptional vintage for aligot\u00e9, was fresh, linear and tangy, while the \u201915, a vintage in which aligot\u00e9 can seem a little unfocused, was nonetheless lively, chalky and refreshing.Surprisingly, his aligot\u00e9s can age beautifully. He pulled out a 2007, which at 10 years of age was rich, vibrant and deep, with salty, savory flavors.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s less recognizable as aligot\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Roulot said.Aligot\u00e9\u2019s potential may often be overlooked, even by those who make it. Burgundy worships the notion that good wine is an expression of the place and the culture that produced it. This notion of terroir is communicated on the label of every bottle of Burgundy made of pinot noir or chardonnay.For a village wine, you won\u2019t find the name of the grape, just the place where the grapes were grown \u2014 Gevrey-Chambertin or Chassagne-Montrachet, for example. For a premier cru, one step up, a vineyard name might be added. For a grand cru, the pinnacle of the terroir hierarchy, the name of the vineyard alone suffices: La T\u00e2che, say, or Musigny.\u201cThe best terroirs for aligot\u00e9 are the best terroirs, period, hillsides and limestone,\u201d Mr. Pataille said.There are two exceptions to the generic appellation rule. One is a small plot of aligot\u00e9 on the slope above the grand cru Clos de la Roche vineyard in Morey-St.-Denis. Domaine Ponsot has nursed this plot for more than a century, and it alone among aligot\u00e9s in Burgundy has the right to be called a premier cru.\u201cIt\u2019s the only place where the vignerons didn\u2019t hear the siren call of chardonnay,\u201d said Pierre de Benoist, Mr. de Villaine\u2019s nephew, who runs the estate. Only in Bouzeron, Mr. de Benoist said, does aligot\u00e9 continue to occupy the best plots on the slopes.Maintaining the best strains of aligot\u00e9 is just as important, Mr. de Benoist said. Much of the aligot\u00e9 planted in Burgundy is the vigorous aligot\u00e9 vert, which produces quantity rather than quality. Only the aligot\u00e9 dor\u00e9, Mr. de Benoist and others insist, can produce good wine. In an effort to preserve this preferred strain, Mr. de Benoist has created a conservancy to maintain it.The de Villaine Bouzeron is produced with meticulous care. The grapes are grown organically, and each plot is vinified separately in large barrels before being blended into a single Bouzeron wine.These wines are particularly saline, with great texture and depth. The 2015 de Villaine had lovely concentration and saltiness, with lingering flavors of lime, herbs and minerals.\u201cNobody else wanted it,\u201d Mr. Altaber said. \u201cNobody else cared. It\u2019s heritage!\u201dHe works with minimal intervention, and has experimented with his aligot\u00e9s, including a sparkling one and a gorgeous golden-colored, ginger-and-herb-flavored cuv\u00e9e in which the fermented wine was left in contact with the grape skins, allowing it to develop color and texture like a red.Champ Forey is fresh and herbal; Clos du Roy is more saline, delineated and complex; Auvonnes au P\u00e9p\u00e9 is tangy, herbal and citrus; and, best of all, Charme aux Pr\u00eatres is penetrating, deep, linear and mineral.\u201cIt\u2019s the Charlemagne of aligot\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Pataille said.Even with his various cuv\u00e9es, Mr. Pataille only makes small amounts of the wines. \u201cNobody in France understands aligot\u00e9,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody cares.\u201dThat may be true for everybody but the winemakers, who care deeply. I asked Mr. de Benoist of Domaine de Villaine a question I\u2019d been wondering about. How did he feel making wine in Bouzeron, which some might consider a sideshow compared with exalted Roman\u00e9e-Conti?\u201cIt\u2019s rare to be able to produce the three great varieties of Burgundy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very lucky.\u201dDozens of good Burgundy producers make aligot\u00e9, including cult favorites like Domaine Leroy and Coche-Dury, which can run from $80 to $150. Here are 10 excellent, more reasonably priced aligot\u00e9s from among the best producers who make it. Other names to seek out include Hubert Lignier, Paul Pillot, Arnaud Ente, Fran\u00e7ois Mikulski, Comte Armand and Claire Naudin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo the Editor:Having immersed myself in studying Jane Austen and her novels for more than 40 years \u2014 long before she became a scriptwriter and media darling \u2014 I am not too surprised to see that once again someone has written a book claiming that everything we know about Jane Austen is wrong, wrong, wrong. (See John Sutherland\u2019s review of \u201cJane Austen: The Secret Radical,\u201d by Helena Kelly, July 16.)From D.W. Harding\u2019s \u201cRegulated Hatred\u201d (she disliked everybody) to Marvin Mudrick\u2019s \u201cIrony as Defense and Discovery\u201d (the smile is more of a rictus) to critics who discovered she was a communist, or a lesbian, or the secret lover of William Wordsworth\u2019s sailor brother, there is almost no interpretation, no matter how radical, that has not nor will not be made. Addressing the cult of Janeites, Henry James wrote witheringly of \u201ceverybody\u2019s dear Jane\u201d while Kipling made her a central figure in a particularly jingoistic short story \u2014 to each his/her own.Which is fine, if it keeps people reading her novels and drawing their own conclusions. Jane Austen is a writer particularly vulnerable through the transparency of her prose and the slyness of her wit to those people (even those gunning for academic tenure) to find hidden meanings, which satisfies if not their pride, then certainly their own prejudice.\u2666To the Editor:Having taught the 19th-century British novel for 35 years, I would argue that the durable love Jane Austen inspires results from two things: She\u2019s good and she wrote short, teachable novels. So she ends up on many syllabuses designed to start the semester with the charm and manageability that attract college students. My research specialty in George Eliot required that I teach \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d as well \u2014 just as good but a terrifying 800 pages long. Going to prison? Castaway? You want more substance than the splendid but spare Jane Austen.\u2666To the Editor:\u201cWhat makes Austen immortal?\u201d you ask. Her pinpoint pictures of the world and the human heart, for a start, then her sense of humor and the graceful prose that conveys her generous spirit.Perhaps most of all, Austen\u2019s crystal clear depiction of social class. The folderol of rank never fooled our friend Jane, and even as she detailed inequality\u2019s structures, she always stood on equality as the foundation of her vision.This quick skewering of an obnoxious young man in \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d is only one example. Why does he treat the people around him with undisguised contempt, she asks, then answers: \u201cIt was the desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed in establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach anyone to him except his wife.\u201d\u2666To the Editor:The charming sketch of Steventon rectory is very welcome as an illustration with Amy Bloom\u2019s review of \u201cJane Austen at Home\u201d (July 16).The credit line mentions a stock photo agency, but it would be appropriate also to give credit to the artist, Ellen G. Hill (1841-1928), whose distinctive style is immediately recognizable. She studied in Paris and showed work at London exhibitions, and through the early 1900s was a prolific illustrator of books including \u201cJane Austen: Her Homes and Her Friends\u201d (1902) by her sister, Constance Hill (1844-1929).\u2666To the Editor:I was surprised when reading the review of Michael Wallis\u2019s \u201cThe Best Land Under Heaven\u201d (July 9) that more emphasis was not placed on the purely American philosophical impetus of the Donner Party. Tragedy aside, this was a group of North American pioneers enraptured by the open lands and promises of the Western frontiers and beyond. Indeed, this push to the West Coast is Jeffersonian in nature, as the founding fathers themselves contemplated the notion that their experiment would one day stretch across the continent. And let us not forget that a young attorney from Springfield, Ill., named Abraham Lincoln was personally close to James Reed, a leading member of the Donner Party. A newly discovered Lincoln document is thought to have accompanied the group from the start of their journey through to its conclusion in California.\u2666To the Editor:Tejal Rao\u2019s Critic\u2019s Take essay (\u201cComfort Food,\u201d July 20), did not mention that the \u201cLondon Ritz Book of Afternoon Tea\u201d was written by none other than the short story writer Helen Simpson. It was published in 1986, a few years before her first collection of stories, \u201cFour Bare Legs in a Bed.\u201dAs for the book\u2019s \u201csnotty\u201d advice, I must defend Simpson\u2019s prejudice against using poor quality chocolate in baked goods, though I concede this is a matter of taste. But as for it being \u201csnotty\u201d to state that the quality of tea used in tea bags is worse than that of loose tea, that is simply a fact. Does that mean that a cup of Lipton might not be someone\u2019s elixir of choice over the finest cup of loose tea served perfectly steeped at just the right temperature? Of course not.Letters may be edited for length and clarity. We regret that we are unable to acknowledge letters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Three New Novels, Summer Escapes Prove Illusory", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistIt\u2019s July 1964 on Maine\u2019s Seven Island, where the blue-blooded Quick and Hillsinger clans long ago replaced their ancestors\u2019 logging camps with a pair of imposing summer homes. The families, based in New York and Washington, are rival power brokers, the type that, as Jim Hillsinger puts it, have \u201cthe quasi-magical ability to change perception and even reality. They could make careers, make money, change public opinion.\u201d On the island, as the youngsters skylark in an unsupervised bunkhouse, their parents tipple and gossip in well-appointed, well-staffed drawing rooms. \u201cAll anyone needs in order to be made whole is one night under these roofs, in these beds, and in front of these fires,\u201d Jim\u2019s wife, Lila, declares.In reality, Seven Island serves less as an antidote for urban drudgery than as a theater for psychological warfare. The Cold War is throwing its heat. Jim has recently been dismissed from the C.I.A. on suspicion of treason, and Lila appears to have had an affair with his nemesis, Billy Quick, whose dead wife (who happened to be Lila\u2019s sister) had dabbled in Communism. To reclaim both his career and his marriage, Jim must spy on his own life.Nagy\u2019s novel roguishly equates international brinkmanship with interpersonal relations, an analogy that underscores the ways in which both can abjure immutable truths. One\u2019s survival, Jim and his adversaries cynically assert, depends on fashioning a framework as believable as it is self-serving. In their view, human existence is a black operation.Nagy is acutely attuned to the conventions of the well-heeled: the monogrammed silver trays, the social hypoxia that lies north of 96th Street in Manhattan, the fact that it\u2019s \u201conly the unknown drunks that anyone objects to.\u201d But he untangles his narrative largely in bursts of italicized flashback, a technique thin on intrigue and thick on intelligence-report exposition. Hastily drawn characters \u2014 grandchildren, house guests, island staff \u2014 cruise past like lobster boats, and resolutions arise as mechanically as the traps are pulled up.Nagy\u2019s most gripping subplot involves Jim\u2019s decision to exile his young son to an undeveloped island in a kind of muscular christening. What lesson are he and the others teaching their heirs? \u201cVictory,\u201d Jim\u2019s father grunts. Power doesn\u2019t preserve itself.Such a hefty assemblage of themes is spawned by a complicated plot: Avalon houses a defense contractor, Grudder Aviation, which may be leaching toxins into the community\u2019s groundwater. Leslie Marshall, a former hippie and prodigal town belle, has returned home with Jules, her African-American husband, and a local teenager named Maddie defies her reactionary and abusive father by pursuing Jules and Leslie\u2019s son. Maddie\u2019s little brother is discovering he\u2019s gay, and her grandmother has come back from retirement in Florida, intending to kill herself. The E.P.A. is investigating Grudder, which might have to merge with a rival. The island\u2019s sea wall is crumbling. Eastside Avalonians (the rich) are sparring with Westsiders (the poor). Rising above this maelstrom are hordes of gypsy moth caterpillars, whose literal and symbolic drone is the song of the summer.Aiming to suppress their woes, Fierro\u2019s libertine characters imbibe and inhale all manner of drink and drugs, but they rarely breathe. Their various pathologies are less embodied than performed, and although Fierro hurls plenty of 1990s cultural particulars (Cool Ranch Doritos, Piercing Pagoda, \u201cCowabunga!\u201d) at the page like splatter paint, this verisimilitude never hardens into authenticity.Still, the novel\u2019s late depictions of Maddie\u2019s anxious relationship with her family hit hard, giving the narrative a savage momentum. A final crescendo of violence appears to bring some peace, although, like Avalon\u2019s gypsy moths, the menace may merely be starting its cycle anew. \u201cLet them believe for now,\u201d we are told. \u201cLet them play.\u201dMonninger\u2019s story line, countering its antagonist\u2019s zest for rebellion, observes the rules of romance fiction: Heather and Jack meet cute on a packed train; Jack woos Heather through adrenalized exploits (careering down the autobahn in a Mercedes convertible while he spoon-feeds her Ben & Jerry\u2019s); Heather devotes herself to Jack despite her hunch that he harbors a game-changing secret. Yet Monninger\u2019s affable prose offers distinct seductions (\u201cthe subway station smells like panting\u201d) and the platitudinous love affair (\u201cJack took me to bed in the late afternoon and devoured me\u201d) is spiced with sharp repartee and social criticism. \u201cAmerica never gets tired of bombs,\u201d a wizened porter tells the couple. \u201cMarried people always know exactly what single people should do,\u201d a friend carps. In fashioning a reductionist take on the coed brain, Monninger privileges the hyphen. Heather ponders \u201cboy-tears,\u201d \u201cman-candy\u201d and \u201cthe no-man zone.\u201d Her first fight with Jack? Call it \u201cwho-exactly-is-this-person-and-why-out-of-all-the-people-in-the-world-am-I-spending-time-with-him-question-mark-question-mark-question-mark.\u201d\u201cThe Map That Leads to You\u201d is a gossamer confection, spun sugar at the summer carnival. It\u2019s also an inspiriting estival fling, one that, as Heather says of her relationship with Jack, melts any residual winter ice.Mike Peed has written for The New Yorker, The Washington Post and other publications.

{"Headline": "The Annie Leibovitz of the Alt-Right", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookDuke\u2019s subjects have included the belligerent blogger Charles Johnson, the conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, the flamboyant rabble-rouser Milo Yiannopoulos, the \u201cguerrilla journalist\u201d James O\u2019Keefe and the documentary filmmaker Phelim McAleer, a pro-fracking climate-change denier. Duke\u2019s surreal portrait of Malik Obama, Barack Obama\u2019s Trump-supporting half brother, appeared on the front page of The New York Post last July. Perched atop his head is a red Trump hat; he\u2019s flashing the \u201cO.K.\u201d hand sign and smiling impishly, as though he\u2019s in on some secret joke. (Which he is; the innocuous gesture is something right-wing trolls have made charged by semi-ironically claiming it as their own.)After the sun had gone down, Duke and I made our way to a nearby Italian restaurant for dinner. \u201cI know you probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but a lot of people don\u2019t read,\u201d he told me over beers and pasta. \u201cThey look at the pictures.\u201d He\u2019s somewhat mystical on the topic of images; he believes that his photographs operate on a hypnotic level, an idea he picked up from Scott Adams, the creator of \u201cDilbert,\u201d who predicted that Trump would win the election over a year in advance and has been cashing in on his bet ever since. Adams, who frequently blogs about Trump, claims that his experience as a trained hypnotist gives him special insight into the president\u2019s rhetorical modes.Duke is an Adams devotee and often cites his books and theories in conversation. But he also believed, after examining Adams\u2019s online presence, that he looked like a \u201ctotal dork.\u201d One image in particular, which Adams described to me as his \u201cdouchebag photo,\u201d is often employed to accompany negative coverage. (It was taken, Adams says, about 20 years ago, for a Playboy shoot; hands raised before him, eyes to the sky, he looks like a kind of crazed Sunday preacher.) So in one pose, Duke shot Adams close-up, in black and white, with an old flannel blanket draped over his shoulders. The photo looks like a cross between an Eddie Bauer ad and a Richard Avedon portrait. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole level of visual persuasion,\u201d Adams told me, \u201cabove anything I had in my own inventory.\u201dDuke believes in the primacy of visual culture, and most right-wing figures, he says, don\u2019t take enough care to make themselves look good. Newt Gingrich, he tells me, is \u201cdisheveled\u201d; Steve Bannon is a \u201cschlub\u201d; Trump\u2019s hair is \u201cproblematic.\u201d At the same time, he thinks left-leaning media outlets \u2014 which is to say, just about anything other than Breitbart News and The Drudge Report \u2014 go out of their way to present the right in a negative way. Recently, he drew my attention to New York magazine\u2019s March cover story on Kellyanne Conway. Though he hadn\u2019t read the article, Duke was bothered by Martin Schoeller\u2019s clinically lit portrait, \u201cthe equivalent of being rendered by a fax machine,\u201d he griped in an email.\u201cThere\u2019s no Vanity Fair for the right,\u201d Duke told me, and such an assertion hints at the rather quixotic nature of his project. Within the alt-right, a loose-knit movment of online reactionaries, Duke is seen as a kind of hidden-hand figure, doing his part to influence the movement\u2019s image from the shadows. During the election, for instance, Duke worked behind the scenes as the creative director for MAGA3X, a nebulous \u2014 and now defunct \u2014 coalition of Trump supporters who believe they helped elect the president, in part, by propagating online memes. Duke often doles out imaging advice to those in his orbit; he persuaded Cernovich, for example, to quit wearing Under Armour and put on a collared shirt. Duke\u2019s subjects seem to appreciate his input; most of them have used his portraits on their social-media profiles.Duke\u2019s goal is to get the American public to view his subjects the way he does. Whether such a goal is realistic or not, his project inadvertently exposes the inner workings of the alt-right mind-set \u2014 its pathologies, its obsessions \u2014 laying bare the depth of the movement\u2019s distrust of the mainstream, its finicky need to conquer reality and construct alternative versions of everything.But Duke didn\u2019t feel entirely comfortable making his views known until he met Andrew Breitbart, the firebrand conservative and eponymous founder of the news site. Duke first encountered Breitbart, who died in 2012, at a meeting of the Pacific Palisades Republican Club in October 2011, and he was impressed by his musings on politics and the media. Duke shot Breitbart\u2019s portrait that day. It became the first installment in Duke\u2019s collection, and also a statement of intent. In the image, Breitbart is dressed, raffishly, in a dark blazer and white button-down, his chest hair exposed; it looks as if he\u2019s making a point, or about to, and raising an index finger.In 2014, Duke found a test case in Charles Johnson, the 28-year-old conservative journalist with a reputation for online trollery. Johnson runs GotNews.com, a sensationalist website on which he has posted a number of false allegations, and WeSearchr, a crowdfunding platform that functions like a kind of vindictive Kickstarter for the right; rather than funding projects, users raise \u201cbounties\u201d on information that could be damaging to their ideological opponents. Looking him up on Facebook, Duke found his appearance lacking but figured he could use Johnson\u2019s bright-red mop and thick, scruffy beard to his advantage. \u201cI said, \u2018You look like a muppet, and I want to make you look like a rock star,\u2019\u201d Duke recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018You can do that?\u2019\u201d Duke shot him outside the Los Angeles Gun Club, looking casually defiant in his Wayfarer-style sunglasses, metal rings, and gray T-shirt. \u201cHe really gets my essence,\u201d said Johnson, who now allows only Duke to photograph him. Not long after that, Duke shot Johnson in more formal attire \u2014 on the same day Johnson, on GotNews, sought to out the anonymous University of Virginia student at the center of Rolling Stone\u2019s now-discredited gang-rape story. (He identified the wrong woman.)Through Johnson, who is now a close friend of Duke\u2019s, Duke connected with several more subjects, including Cernovich, the right-wing social-media personality who helped spread the PizzaGate myth, which imagined a vast child-sex ring run by powerful Democrats out of a pizza restaurant in Washington. In December, Duke took his portrait at a protest in Los Angeles. Cernovich was sweating through his shirt when Duke found him, so he mopped him down and snapped a few shots, one of which Cernovich has used as his Twitter profile \u2014 head cropped within the frame and tilted at an angle, his slightly wet-looking hair brushed jauntily to the side and his squinting blue eyes matching his collared shirt. \u201cMy intention,\u201d Duke said, \u201cwas to make him look like a strong, forceful personality.\u201dDuke had a similar idea in mind on a tranquil afternoon in February, as he photographed Anthime Gionet, the right-wing provocateur better known by his digital stage name, Baked Alaska. Wearing ripped black jeans and a camouflage T-shirt and cap, Gionet was situated before a seamless white background at a spacious studio with high, lofted ceilings in Culver City, Calif. He was squatting, froglike, and staring off into the distance. \u201cChin up,\u201d said Duke, camera in hand, prostrate on the floor. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, peering through the viewfinder and chuckling. \u201cBe the frog, man, be the frog.\u201d Duke clicked away.Gionet, who is 29, was channeling Pepe the Frog, the cartoon amphibian appropriated as a symbol of the alt-right. Like Pepe himself, the Anchorage native was in need of an image reboot. During the election, Gionet found some fame orchestrating pro-Trump flash mobs (along with releasing a string of seemingly earnest rap videos with titles like \u201cMAGA Anthem\u201d and \u201cWe Love Our Cops\u201d). But he had recently gotten himself into trouble over a series of coded anti-Semitic tweets. (\u201cJews control the News,\u201d he wrote in one; in another he referenced the \u201cJQ,\u201d or \u201cJewish question.\u201d) Duke didn\u2019t care about that. As he saw it, Gionet was a victim of a politically correct culture. At the photo shoot, he handed Gionet a Barbie doll covered in fake blood and nailed to a cross of wooden blocks. \u201cThis is a symbol of me,\u201d Gionet said approvingly. \u201cI am the sacrificial lamb.\u201dLater, Duke pulled out a black pitchfork, onto which he had mounted a laser sight, and told Gionet he could use it to go after crooked politicians. Staring menacingly into the camera, Gionet clutched the pitchfork in a pose reminiscent of Grant Wood\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gothic.\u201d \u201cRevolution!\u201d he yelled.A few months after the shoot, I would find that one image from the shoot that day had made it onto the cover of Gionet\u2019s self-published book, \u201cMeme Magic Secrets Revealed.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s this kind of, I think, phony idea that things are objective \u2014 when you push the button, that\u2019s the objective reality, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d Duke told me, not long ago, on our early evening walk along the bluffs. Duke sees photography as a kind of weapon in the culture wars, and in a way, it may be the perfect medium for a movement like the alt-right, which wants to refashion reality on its own terms. Pictures are, after all, factually malleable vessels that do not present reality as it is but suggest an alternative one as the photographer sees it.As the sun set on the Pacific, Duke asked me if I wanted my picture taken. I initially declined, skeptical of his intentions. But high on the cliff, I decided to trust him. \u201cIt looks pretty nice right here,\u201d he said reassuringly. \u201cI can make you look good.\u201d As he leaned down for a better angle, adjusting the ISO on his camera, I was surprised to find his presence somewhat calming; the shutter of his camera fluttered gently as he made off-handed remarks between shots. I could imagine, in the moment, how he would pull the humanity out of his subjects.A few days later, Duke sent me the photo in an email attachment. Examining my expression, I couldn\u2019t help but think that I looked profoundly uneasy, and even slightly disgusted. But I wasn\u2019t sure if that was my doing or his.Matthew Kassel is a writer living in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Delicious World of Bruno, Chief of Police", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Pour15 PhotosLE BUGUE, France \u2014 As the police chief of the sleepy fictional town of St.-Denis in the P\u00e9rigord region of southwestern France, Bruno Courr\u00e8ges has battled murderers and arsonists, truffle fraud and archaeological vandalism, drug pushers and terrorists.Not surprisingly, given the priorities here, where the St.-Denis tennis club is tricked out with a well-appointed kitchen \u201csince no communal activity could take place without there being food and wine involved,\u201d many of the battles between local tradition and globalization play out over issues of gastronomy.Bruno grows vegetables and keeps chickens. He hunts black truffles and small birds. And he cooks well, rustic yet aristocratic fare like terrines, fish soups, veal stews and roasted chickens. A ham hangs in his kitchen, and while he loves a glass of good wine, he is mostly content with the local stuff sold out of a tank by Hubert, his local wine merchant.I have been especially intrigued by Bruno\u2019s world because the P\u00e9rigord, where duck fat is a way of life, is a backwater for wine, even if it is just an hour inland from Bordeaux.I paid a visit to Mr. Walker, 70, in late spring. When he is not in London or Washington, he lives with his wife, Julia Watson, in a small town, Le Bugue, which straddles the V\u00e9z\u00e8re river and serves as a model for the fictional St.-Denis.He spent almost three decades writing for The Guardian and served as bureau chief in Moscow and Washington. It was while living in Moscow in the mid-1980s that he and his wife discovered this corner of France.\u201cDear friends had moved there, and we would visit every year,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when we were in Moscow, to be able to eat the food of the P\u00e9rigord was pretty good.\u201dIn 1998, they bought their own place, an old farmhouse, barn and pigeon tower on a quiet country lane, and quickly adapted to the rhythms and flavors of P\u00e9rigordin life. Though it\u2019s an area rich in the pleasures of the table, the region is among the poorest in the country by certain socio-economic standards.\u201cBut it\u2019s the highest quality of life,\u201d Mr. Walker said over an evening aperitif, served with a rough country p\u00e2t\u00e9 and bread in his yard. \u201cIt\u2019s the gastronomic heartland of France. The food just goes back and forth, and it\u2019s a very nice way to live. Bartering fosters community.\u201dGetting into the spirit, Mr. Walker and Ms. Watson planted a potagerie, the garden of vegetables and herbs that is essential to French country life, and acquired a flock of hens, presided over by a rooster named Sarkozy.As one would expect from a rooster, Sarkozy can be loud and blustery. Still his presence is a problem in other ways.The couple cannot sell their eggs at the market in Le Bugue, which will celebrate its 700th anniversary in 2019, because European Union regulations prohibit a rooster from living with the egg-laying chickens. So they have entered the barter economy themselves.\u201cWe\u2019re all in the underground,\u201d Ms. Watson said. \u201cNot fighting the Nazis, just all the silly laws.\u201dThe European Union and its rules are a sore subject for residents of the region, who often see new regulations, no matter how well intentioned, as intrusions on a time-honored way of life. Pig butchering, sausage making, cattle farming, cheese production and the traveling still, which circulated the countryside on the back of a bicycle, are among the traditions that have been altered by rules intended to safeguard the health and well-being of the citizens.\u201cWhen we bought our house 20 years ago, the main industry was farming,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cNow it\u2019s tourism.\u201dThe British have always been drawn to this part of France, which they ruled until ejected from France at the conclusion of the Hundred Years\u2019 War in the 15th century. The international success of the Bruno series has also contributed to P\u00e9rigord\u2019s allure as a tourist destination.Mr. Walker and Ms. Watson had just welcomed a busload from Florida who wanted to see where Bruno had pulled a body from the river in \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Cave,\u201d the sawmill opposed by the Greens in \u201cBlack Diamond,\u201d and the cafe where Bruno gets his croissants (every morning in every book). The books do especially well in Germany, and a constant procession of German Bruno fans passes through Le Bugue and the neighboring towns.\u201cThe P\u00e9rigord without Bruno is not the P\u00e9rigord,\u201d said Raymond Bounichou, a former intelligence officer and gendarme who lives down the road from Mr. Walker.Tourism comes with a cultural cost. Three supermarkets, catering largely to tourists, now compete with the local march\u00e9, which appears Tuesdays and Saturdays. Le Bugue is served by five bakeries, each with its own following, though the tourists seem to prefer what Mr. Walker described as \u201chorrible sandwiches in plastic triangles.\u201d\u201cEvery time I see one my soul shrivels up,\u201d he said.As much as he is enamored of the food and wine, Mr. Walker is at heart a historian and storyteller who is drawn to the P\u00e9rigord by its layered, copious history. Aside from its prehistoric residents, the region \u2014 dotted with castles, chateaus and fortifications \u2014 has been a center of conflict for centuries. The Moors came around the year 600 and stayed until 750. The Vikings arrived next. \u201cThen came the real curse, the English,\u201d Mr. Walker said.The legacies of the French Revolution, of World War II, of Indochina and the Algerian conflict still run deep, and age-old conflicts are seared in local memory. Numerous plaques commemorate French citizens killed by the Nazis.History also partly explains why the wines of Bergerac, made from a similar set of grapes as Bordeaux\u2019s wines, are so little known compared with their coastal siblings. Aside from Bordeaux\u2019s longtime advantage controlling the port and placing duties on Bergerac wines, Bergerac\u2019s woes are partly self-inflicted.Rather than replanting after phylloxera, the ravenous aphid that destroyed much of Europe\u2019s grapevines in the late 19th century, the local government had a better idea, Mr. Walker said.\u201cRadical socialists in power pushed tobacco as the new wonder crop,\u201d he said. \u201cThe black tobacco of Gauloises was grown around here.\u201dNowadays, many of the growers in Bergerac sell their grapes to the local cooperatives, which make cheap wines sold in supermarkets. Mr. Walker makes it a practice to visit some of the better winemakers in the region, often accompanied by his friend Mr. Bounichou.\u201cIt\u2019s a deep pleasure knowing the guy who made the wine, to hear them talk about it,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThe look of pride as they pour the wine, I adore that.\u201dSadly, of these producers, only Tiregand is sold in the United States, and only in the Chicago area.\u201cThe image of Bergerac is not great,\u201d said Caro Feely, who has documented her family\u2019s experiences running Ch\u00e2teau Feely in the books \u201cGrape Expectations\u201d and \u201cSaving Our Skins.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re better off selling it as organic, biodynamic Vin de France than using the appellation.\u201dWhile tradition reigns supreme here, the region is not an insular, unwelcoming place. At a big Sunday market in the nearby town of St.-Cyprien, where Mr. Walker waved to the butcher and said hello to his friend St\u00e8phane, a cheesemaker and neighbor who is also the basis for a character in the Bruno books, most of the vendors sold the local specialties. But Japanese temaki, pad Thai and goods from Burundi and Morocco could also be found.Mr. Walker describes himself as \u201ca welcome stranger\u201d in the community, though his adaptation seems complete. He makes vin de noix, a local liqueur made from green walnuts. He takes part in a cassoulet competition that pits the P\u00e9rigord against Toulouse: \u201cWe maintain it has to have a stuffed duck neck; they think it\u2019s all about sausages.\u201d And he relishes recounting a bit of farm wisdom for determining whether a calf can offer real milk-fed veal (which involves probing the rearward orifice).In between planning meals and visiting vineyards, Mr. Walker, like Bruno, takes care of business, retreating to his office in the pigeon tower, where he does most of his writing \u2014 at least 1,000 words a day.\u201cIt\u2019s the classic journalist\u2019s dream,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Their Identities Denied, Afghan Women Ask, \u2018Where Is My Name?\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 These are some of the terms Afghan men use to refer to their wives in public instead of their names, the sharing of which they see as a grave dishonor worthy of violence: Mother of Children, My Household, My Weak One or sometimes, in far corners, My Goat or My Chicken.Women also may be called Milk-sharer or Black-headed. The go-to word for Afghans to call a woman in public, no matter her status, is Aunt.But a social media campaign to change this custom has been percolating in recent weeks, initiated by young women. The campaign comes with a hashtag in local languages that addresses the core of the issue and translates as #WhereIsMyName.The activists\u2019 aim is both to challenge women to reclaim their most basic identity, and to break the deep-rooted taboo that prevents men from mentioning their female relatives\u2019 names in public.\u201cThis is just a spark \u2014 the posing of a question mostly to the Afghan women about why their identity is denied,\u201d said Bahar Sohaili, one of the supporters of the campaign.\u201cThe reality is that women also remain silent \u2014 they don\u2019t protest this,\u201d Ms. Sohaili said, adding that she and other activists were discussing offline steps to bolster the social media discussion.Like many social media efforts, this one began small, with several posts out of Herat Province in the west. Since then, more activists have tried to turn it into a topic of conversation by challenging celebrities and government officials to share the names of their wives and mothers.The discussion has now made it to the regular media, with articles in newspapers and conversations on television and radio talk shows.Members of the Parliament, senior government officials and artists have come forward in support, publicly declaring the identities of the female members of their families.Farhad Darya, one of Afghanistan\u2019s most renowned singers, put out a heartfelt message about his struggle to make sure he always mentioned his mother and wife by name in concerts and interviews over his decades as a performer.The campaign also has its detractors. Some on social media have said it is against \u201cAfghan values,\u201d while others have deemed it too small to make a difference.Modaser Islami, head of a youth organization, wrote on his Facebook page: \u201cThe name of my mother, sister and wife are sacred like their head scarf, and it\u2019s a sign of their honor.\u201dHe then addressed the activists: \u201cThe name of my mother, sister and wife will be mentioned where they see necessary. You should get yourselves head scarves and pants.\u201dMs. Sohaili, the activist, said she hoped men would look inward and consider why it was taboo to write a woman\u2019s name, even in a doctor\u2019s prescription. \u201cIs it cultural, is it religious?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre there any logical roots to this at all?\u201dThe denial of women\u2019s basic identity in public is emblematic of how deep misogyny runs in this society, when even male schoolchildren often get into fights to defend their honor, which they are taught is besmirched if someone mentions their mother\u2019s or sister\u2019s name.Hassan Rizayee, an Afghan sociologist, said the custom was rooted in tribal ways of life.\u201cAccording to tribal logic, the important thing is the ownership of a woman\u2019s body,\u201d Mr. Rizayee said. \u201cThe body of a woman belongs to a man, and other people should not even use her body indirectly, such as looking at her. Based on this logic, the body, face and name of the woman belong to the man.\u201dReversing such deeply ingrained traditions will take a long time, he said, including changing what children are taught.\u201cThis is a traditional and cultural issue; it needs a long-term cultural struggle and fight,\u201d he said. \u201cBy weakening tribal cultures, and awareness through the media, this type of thinking about woman could be changed.\u201dSomaia Ramish, a member of the Herat provincial council, recently wrote that women had been \u201cerased systematically\u201d throughout history and reduced to their relations with men.\u201cThe child comes out of the mother\u2019s womb, but in no document relating to the child \u2014 from infancy to old age \u2014 does the mother\u2019s name get registered,\u201d she said in an online article. \u201cThe interesting thing, however, is that the mother then, out of habit and tradition, becomes identified by the child. The woman whose name has no place in laws all of a sudden becomes \u2018the mother of Ahmad\u2019 or \u2018the mother of Mahmoud.\u2019\u201dMs. Ramish wrote that she had noticed the gravity of the problem when the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, in his inaugural speech three years ago, mentioned his wife by name. There was so much surprise, she wrote, \u201cas if no one had heard a woman\u2019s name before.\u201dIn that speech, as strongmen and former warlords whispered to one another in the back of the hall, Mr. Ghani thanked his wife, Rula \u2014 a Lebanese-born former journalist and humanitarian worker, whom he called by her adopted Afghan name, Bibi Gul \u2014 for her \u201ccontinued support for me and Afghanistan.\u201dMs. Ghani has taken up a much more public role as first lady than Zeenat Karzai, the wife of the previous president, Hamid Karzai. A medical doctor by training, Dr. Karzai had very little public presence during the first years of Mr. Karzai\u2019s presidency, and she took a back seat completely for much of the remaining years.Ms. Ghani often accompanies her husband to meetings and on provincial trips.Mr. Islami, the opponent of the campaign, said in an interview that he agreed with the idea of normalizing women\u2019s identities in public but that he saw the social media push as the work of a \u201cprivileged few,\u201d pitting women against men.Others pointed to how social media can be deceptive when trying to gauge change in offline habits. Some online users want to be part of a viral wave without really taking the message to heart. That was illustrated best in one male user\u2019s snide Facebook post.\u201cI joined the #WhereIsMyName campaign,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cMy name is Akram. The name of Mother of My Children? I will not say it even if I am ripped into pieces.\u201dFahim Abed and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Salenger focused on the happiness and well-being of Mr. Oswalt and Ms. McNamara\u2019s 8-year-old daughter, Alice.\u201cWho gave you the position to judge when it\u2019s \u2018too soon\u2019 for a person who has suffered the worst to be able to find happiness and companionship again?\u201d Ms. Roman wrote in her blog post. \u201cHow long should a widow sit in isolation before you are comfortable enough to release them from their solitary confinement?\u201dMs. Roman congratulated the couple on their engagement and said she was glad to see that Mr. Oswalt\u2019s heart \u201chad expanded.\u201d\u201cI used that word intentionally,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI say expanded because that\u2019s what widowed hearts do.

She lived at New York City\u2019s flagship animal shelter in East Harlem. On June 14, the police say, somebody stole her.The thief was a man who went to the shelter that day looking to adopt a dog, shelter officials said. When he was not allowed to because he had what he called two unneutered \u201cguard dogs\u201d at home, he got mad and grabbed the rabbit instead, shelter officials said.It also comes just a few weeks after the shelter made a new rule that the rabbit and dog cages be kept unlocked to make the shelter seem like a friendlier place and encourage adoptions.A veteran rabbit volunteer at the shelter, Amy Odum, questioned the wisdom of the open-cage policy.\u201cIf the cat incident had never happened, I would consider this just na\u00efve,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to look like a rescue and not like the city pound, I get that. But they took away the one small measure of security they had, which is simply to lock the cages. How can you think that would not have consequences when you\u2019ve just had a theft?\u201dThe only people there were two developmentally disabled young women who were looking to become volunteers. The man asked them to help him take Sunny out of her cage and get her into his bag, Ms. Hansen said. Not knowing better, they helped him. He took Sunny and left.Ms. Hansen said that while Sunny\u2019s captor remains at large, the rabbit cages are locked. But that is a temporary measure. The open-cage policy will stay, she said, because by and large the shelter does not think people will steal pets and because there are usually a lot of people around who would deter a theft.The theft of the floppy-eared rabbit is a petty larceny \u2014 a misdemeanor, legally equivalent to stealing a pack of cigarettes.\u201cThe 23rd Precinct in the last 28 days has investigated 59 felony crimes, including multiple felony assaults, robberies, rapes and burglaries,\u201d the official said on Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. \u201cThose are a higher priority of crime than a petty larceny.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanks to Venmo, We Now All Know How Cheap Our Friends Are", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuture TenseMargaret Pennoyer, an elementary school teacher in Manhattan, had just returned from a bachelorette party in Napa Valley when she received an email that had been sent to all the guests. The two organizers had itemized each woman\u2019s individual expenses, which they had covered, and requested reimbursement through Venmo, an app that transfers money between users who have linked their bank accounts to their phones. Ms. Pennoyer owed $31.98 to one woman and $20.62 to the other.In a previous time, the organizers likely would have asked everyone to bring enough cash to repay them in person or to mail a check afterward, courteously rounding down to $30 and $20. But the Venmo request, calculated to the penny, struck Ms. Pennoyer, 29, as emblematic of how the app, the most popular among her fellow millennials for everything from entertainment expenses to rent shares, \u201cchanges friendships and makes them more transactional,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nickel-and-diming everything, literally.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s making people less generous and chivalrous,\u201d Ms. Pennoyer said. \u201cIt used to be you\u2019d go to a restaurant, and you\u2019d put down your credit cards and split it 50-50, even if one person had steak and one had chicken. But now people pay exactly to the cent.\u201d\u201cWhen there are three cookies,\u201d she added, \u201clet someone have the extra cookie \u2014 you don\u2019t have to split the third one.\u201dSome users have observed a decline in magnanimity, particularly for small purchases.\u201cI have a friend who\u2019s against Venmo because he believes it harms the norm of social reciprocity,\u201d said Zach Fuchs, 30, who works in private equity in San Francisco, where the app is much in fashion. Mr. Fuchs noted that a colleague might normally feel compelled to buy the next round of happy hour drinks, for instance, but with Venmo he can pay back the buyer of his drink, and be done.Once two people have decided to repay a debt with Venmo, there is the additional awkwardness of asking for payment. The easiest way is turning the app into a verb, with the casually tossed off \u201cJust Venmo me.\u201d But if you\u2019re at a bar and putting someone\u2019s drinks on your tab, the instruction may well be forgotten amid a morning hangover. The app also allows users to request payment \u2014 in other words, to send an acquaintance a formal invoice.To assist with record-keeping, the app also requires users to write a short memo declaring what the money is for. The memos are sometimes bluntly functional \u2014 \u201cdrinks,\u201d \u201crent\u201d \u2014 but, perhaps to mitigate the businesslike feel, are often whimsically annotated.\u201cI\u2019m paying you money, but it\u2019s not this cold, hard cash transaction,\u201d James Auchincloss, 26, a law student at Fordham University, said of the mentality behind the less serious memos. \u201cIt\u2019s a memory of this thing we did together. I can\u2019t tell you how many people just send a beer emoji or an emoji of a sport from a game.\u201dYet, as with anything emoji-speckled or exclamation-point-riddled, there is a performative aspect to the memos, especially since the default mode is that transactions (though not the dollar amount) and contact lists are publicly viewable. Moreover, the app can search one\u2019s phone contacts or Facebook network for users, and its default setting is to add new ones as they sign up for the service. As such, it is like any other social network in that you can lose yourself for hours roaming through the financial transactions of others (or just seeing who someone\u2019s Venmo \u201cfriends\u201d are). Within a minute I was able to see what a friend \u2014 whom I\u2019m not even connected with on the app \u2014 pays for internet access and electricity, since her roommate itemized the charges in the memo.It is possible to make one\u2019s ledger and contacts private, but many users overlook these options, don\u2019t care, or might even desire the visibility: both to document their own experiences as though in a photo album and to broadcast their curated lifestyles to others. Venmo, meet FOMO.\u201cA part of me wants people to see that I\u2019m doing stuff,\u201d Mr. Auchincloss admitted. \u201cI kind of like that people say, \u201cOh, James went out to a baseball game or got drinks with people.\u2019\u201dScrolling through her friends\u2019 ledgers, Ms. Pennoyer saw that two of her cousins socialized recently and didn\u2019t invite her.\u201cThe same way you can see on Instagram that you were left out, you can tell on Venmo,\u201d she said.Though calling attention to in-demand tickets or a fancy meal may inspire envy among one\u2019s peers, and philanthropic payments can signal one\u2019s virtue, it is just as possible to run across less glamorous or upstanding transactions. Ms. Pennoyer noticed that a friend\u2019s mother had sent her a Venmo payment with the memo \u201callowance.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just embarrassing,\u201d she said.Public transactions also mean that intimate relations are often made legible and subject to scrutiny.\u201cYou can tell who\u2019s hooking up, if there\u2019s enough of a pattern between two people that you thought were just friends but seem to be more than friends, because they leave a trail of clues via Uber payments or breakfast payments,\u201d Mr. Auchincloss said.One man used Venmo to write a lovelorn memo to his former girlfriend; a screenshot was quickly circulated among their mutual contacts and beyond.More supportively, Noam Waksman, a 24-year-old who works in digital marketing in New York, said he has \u201cbeen called out by friends before, for charging my girlfriend for a meal,\u201d which they had spotted on Venmo.Mr. Waksman has, in turn, peered at how other couples financially relate to each other, and has seen people \u201csurprise-Venmo\u201d their significant others \u201cwith memos like \u2018Have fun at the movies with your friends, love you,\u2019\u201d he said.But the strongest demonstration of intimacy might be abandoning the service altogether. Mr. Fuchs and his fianc\u00e9e used to use Venmo, but in preparation for their recent wedding, the two opened a joint checking account and now pool their expenses there.\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped settling up,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Crows Over Putin\u2019s Meeting With Trump", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsked repeatedly about the two presidents\u2019 conversation about accusations of Russian hacking during the 2016 American election, Mr. Putin said at a news conference in Hamburg, Germany, that Mr. Trump had paid a lot of attention to the issue, asking multiple questions.\u201cWhen possible, I answered his questions in detail,\u201d Mr. Putin said, noting that he had reviewed previous exchanges that he had had with former President Barack Obama on the topic. \u201cI got the impression that my answers satisfied him.\u201dAnd asked repeatedly whether Mr. Trump believed his denials about Russian interference, Mr. Putin said each time that a reporter should ask the American president.One Russian tabloid called the meeting \u201chistoric,\u201d and over all there was a sense of relief that if short on concrete agreements, the talks seemed to halt the downward spiral in relations and lack of contact between the two countries.This meeting \u201copened the way to a second, a third, a fourth meeting, where meaningful decisions will be made,\u201d Sergei Markov, a political commentator close to the Kremlin, wrote on Facebook. He hailed the return to \u201cnormal contacts,\u201d which he said had been destroyed by Mr. Obama, who sought to isolate Russia after it seized Crimea in March 2014.Amid the cheering in Moscow, however, there were notes of caution about the frequent gaps between what Mr. Trump says and what he does and can deliver. And more important, there was a recognition that the domestic mood toward Russia in the United States remained sour.The main message that emerged after more than two hours of talks on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg on Friday was that deals were possible, analysts said, and the mere fact that the two presidents had met in person for the first time since Mr. Trump was elected mattered more than the lack of a breakthrough.\u201cIt is important that they finally met because if you look at the history of the relations between Washington and Moscow, these relations always depended to a large extent on the personal contact between the two leaders,\u201d said Andrei V. Kortunov, the director of the Russian International Affairs Council, a foreign policy research group, in an interview. \u201cThey defended their trenches, but tried to keep options for future compromises open.\u201dThe two accounts of the meeting \u2014 one from Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and the other by the American secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the only two officials in the room besides the two presidents \u2014 differed in some important details.Notably, Mr. Tillerson said that Mr. Trump had confronted Mr. Putin about Russian interference in the 2016 election during a \u201crobust and lengthy\u201d discussion. In Mr. Lavrov\u2019s account, Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial.\u201cBelieve Lavrov,\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Saturday when asked about the divergent accounts. Some Russian officials expressed particular delight at that version.\u201cThe neocons are furious,\u201d Alexei K. Pushkov, a former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian Parliament, wrote on Twitter, referring to neoconservatives in the United States. \u201cTrump accepted Putin\u2019s words about Russia\u2019s noninterference in the American election. He does not want to stand at the \u2018anti-Russian hysteria\u2019 bus stop.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was important for Trump to hear Putin: After all, back in Washington, he is fed informational gruel that is mixed up in the fake.\u201dMr. Putin seemed to try to break the ice with Mr. Trump by referring to his travails with the news media back home. Mr. Putin gestured toward members of the press who had been allowed to photograph them before the meeting started and said, \u201cThese are the ones that insulted you?\u201d according to a Twitter message from a member of the Kremlin press pool. Mr. Trump could be heard agreeing, saying, \u201cYou are right about that.\u201dDuring his news conference, Mr. Putin called the fact that the two sides were working together on the de-escalation zones in Syria \u201ca massive step forward.\u201d He noted that work on delineating the zones and providing security had to be hammered out. \u201cThis is painstaking, even tedious work, but it is extremely important,\u201d he said.The Russian president also said he thought that the American position on Syria was becoming more \u201cpragmatic\u201d with the realization that combined efforts might be better.That sentiment provoked some gloating in Moscow. \u201cIt has become clear that Trump recognizes Russia\u2019s serious intentions in Syria and wishes to join the settlement process and to be a party to the resolution of problems in Syria alongside Russia,\u201d Adalbi Shkhagoshev, a member of the foreign affairs committee in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency Tass.Yet several Russian analysts also noted that the Trump administration had yet to settle on a Syria policy and that previous cease-fire agreements had not stuck. While there are points of agreement, the two countries also have significant differences, particularly America\u2019s opposition to Iranian efforts to leverage the Syria conflict to gain broader influence in the Middle East.As long as the countries are talking, however, there is a sense that American and Russian military forces fighting with different forces on the ground there will not come to blows. \u201cThe overall public reaction here is positive because people were concerned how this confrontation might end,\u201d Mr. Kortunov said.Broadly, Russians recognized that this was just a first step, and that senior Trump administration officials like the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, often take a harder line on Syria or Ukraine.Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader and no stranger to difficult summit meetings, hailed the two presidents\u2019 meeting while noting that Mr. Trump was \u201cunpredictable.\u201d\u201cThat the president of the United States, for his part, spoke positively of the results of the meeting is very good,\u201d Mr. Gorbachev was quoted as saying by Interfax, an independent news agency. \u201cNow, the most important thing is for concrete steps realizing these agreements to follow.\u201dGiven the level of rancor in the United States toward Russia at the moment, there was some recognition that would be difficult.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know how able President Trump is in terms of delivering on anything specific in these agreements because Russia is still toxic in Washington,\u201d Mr. Kortunov said. \u201cAnything he agrees will be looked at with suspicion in Washington.\u201dHe and others noted that the open hostility toward the United States, particularly on Russian state television and in the government bureaucracy, might diminish now that Mr. Putin seemed to regard relations as moving in a better direction. There was no immediate report on some issues stressed by Moscow before the meeting, including the return of two Russian diplomatic compounds that the United States seized in December.Mr. Putin also wanted to use the meeting to further his goal of restoring Russia to its position of global influence and to project his own power, particularly important for a home audience that will vote in a presidential election in 2018.\u201cI really hope so,\u201d he said when asked whether his meeting with Mr. Trump would lead to improved ties between Moscow and Washington, adding \u201cit seems to me that the special preconditions for this have been created.\u201d\u201cAs for relations on a personal level, I believe we have established them,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cTrump\u2019s TV persona differs sharply from the real man. He is a very straightforward person, grasps precisely what his interlocutor says, quickly analyzes and responds to questions or new elements of the discussion.\u201dMr. Putin twice ignored questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s speech in Warsaw in which he urged Russia to cease \u201cits destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere.\u201d Mr. Putin also said that he was not worried about competition with the United States over gas sales to Poland as long as they were not politicized.Mr. Putin exuded confidence, the Russian expert said, while Mr. Trump seemed to show a lack of it by sitting on the edge of his chair. Mr. Putin \u201ccontrolled the situation and decided its tone,\u201d the expert said, concluding that over all the meeting was \u201ca psychological victory for the Russian president.\u201dLincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Urban China, Cash Is Rapidly Becoming Obsolete", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 There is an audacious economic phenomenon happening in China.It has nothing to do with debt, infrastructure spending or the other major economic topics du jour. It has to do with cash \u2014 specifically, how China is systematically and rapidly doing away with paper money and coins.Almost everyone in major Chinese cities is using a smartphone to pay for just about everything. At restaurants, a waiter will ask if you want to use WeChat or Alipay \u2014 the two smartphone payment options \u2014 before bringing up cash as a third, remote possibility.Just as startling is how quickly the transition has happened. Only three years ago there would be no question at all, because everyone was still using cash.\u201cFrom a tech standpoint, this is probably one of the single most important innovations that has happened first in China, and at the moment it\u2019s only in China,\u201d said Richard Lim, managing director of venture capital firm GSR Ventures.Even so, the attendant cultural shift was graspable only in person. I recently moved to Shanghai and felt the change with cash acutely because my first few weeks in the metropolis of more than 20 million were spent cut out of the system. Because of an issue with my bank, I couldn\u2019t immediately link my account to WeChat, which has become a virtual wallet for so many.That meant I had to navigate China the way I would have three years ago: with a stack of red 100-renminbi notes.At coffee shops and restaurants, I held up lines as I fumbled out my wallet and peeled off the bills to give the cashier. If I was hungry I had to go outside and find a restaurant, while bowls of noodles, groceries and coffee materialized at our office, ordered by my colleagues and paid for on the phone. If I had to get somewhere, I couldn\u2019t use my phone to unlock one of the ubiquitous bicycles that are a part of China\u2019s bike-sharing craze.Even the buskers were apparently ahead of me. Enterprising musicians playing on the streets of a number of Chinese cities have put up boards with QR codes so that passers-by can simply transfer them tips directly.\u201cIt has become the default way of life now,\u201d said Shiv Putcha,\u00a0an analyst with the research firm IDC. \u201cLiterally every business and brand in China is plugged into this ecosystem.\u201dSome Scandinavian countries have also weaned themselves from cash but still use cards frequently. In China, the change has been to phones.\u00a0One friend didn\u2019t realize how reliant she had become on mobile payments until her bank called her. She had left her A.T.M. card in the machine three weeks earlier and had not noticed its absence.In practical terms, this means Tencent and Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, the two Chinese internet companies that run WeChat and Alipay, respectively, are sitting atop a gold mine of staggering proportions. Both companies can make money off the transactions, charge other companies to use their payment platforms and all the while collect the payments data to be used in everything from new credit systems to advertising.Mr. Lim said that according to recent data, Ant Financial and Tencent were set to surpass credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in total global\u00a0transactions per day in the coming year. The key is that both companies are able to provide payments on the cheap,\u00a0partly\u00a0by allowing smaller vendors to make use of a simple printout of a QR code or their phone, instead of an expensive card reader. A back-end system that stores\u00a0a record of user accounts, instead of having to communicate with a bank, also keeps costs down.While Tencent does not break out what it makes from mobile payments, in the fourth quarter of 2016 the \u201cother services\u201d item in its earnings almost tripled from a year earlier to 6.4 billion renminbi, or $940 million, driven largely by mobile payments.There are some potential future problems with China\u2019s sweeping embrace of online payments. As the country builds its entire consumer economy around two private smartphone payment platforms, it is slowly locking out people unable to get onto those networks, and locking itself into those companies.At the simplest level, that makes life difficult for tourists and business travelers who are unlikely to open a bank account in China and so will find it hard to turn their phones into wallets.More broadly, it means things could get harder for foreign and local businesses alike. Foreign companies hoping to sell to Chinese consumers now must deal with Alibaba and Tencent or risk being unable to take payments. Likewise, Chinese companies reliant on Alibaba and Tencent have to build out separate structures to deal with the world of Facebook, Google and credit cards that still dominate elsewhere.There is a corollary for what could happen here. In Japan in the early 2000s, flip phones could do everything from stream cable TV to pay at stores. But because the phones were so advanced, Japan was slow to adopt smartphones, and it went from tech giant to tech laggard in 15 years.No doubt aware of this, Alibaba and Tencent are pushing to expand beyond China to ensure their newest innovation doesn\u2019t go the way of the dinosaurs. Still, competition is most likely looming.\u201cThe million-dollar question is: Will Western firms decide to build a system and compete?\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cThe answer is probably yes.\u201dUntil then, new arrivals like me have to deal with being locked out of China\u2019s online payments infrastructure.Earlier this month, though, I lucked out using cash. As I was trying to get a pile of stuff from Ikea back to my new apartment, a cabdriver looked skeptically at the huge rolled-up mattress pad I was planning to load into the back of his car.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take you,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI can only take cash.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I have,\u201d I said to my fellow Luddite, who grumpily agreed to ferry me home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traces of Controversial Herbicide Are Found in Ben & Jerry\u2019s Ice Cream", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA growing number of foods commonly found in kitchens across America have tested positive for glyphosate, the herbicide that is the main ingredient in the popular consumer pesticide Roundup, which is widely used in agriculture. But few brands on that list are as startling as the latest: Ben & Jerry\u2019s, the Vermont ice cream company known for its family-friendly image and environmental advocacy.The Organic Consumers Association announced Tuesday that it found traces of glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the company\u2019s ice creams \u2014 although at levels far below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency.Rob Michalak, global director of social mission at Ben & Jerry\u2019s, said the company was working to ensure that all the ingredients in its supply chain come from sources that do not include genetically modified organisms, known as G.M.O.s. None of its plant-based ingredients, for instance, come from a genetically engineered crop like corn or soy, where glyphosate is used in production. The company is also trying to figure out a cost-effective way for the dairy farms that supply its milk to use non-G.M.O. feed.\u201cWe\u2019re working to transition away from G.M.O., as far away as we can get,\u201d Mr. Michalak said. \u201cBut then these tests come along, and we need to better understand where the glyphosate they\u2019re finding is coming from. Maybe it\u2019s from something that\u2019s not even in our supply chain, and so we\u2019re missing it.\u201dMonsanto and other companies that make products containing glyphosate hotly dispute those studies and say there is no reason for concern. Government and other regulators tend to agree that very low levels are not harmful to humans.Ronnie Cummins, a founder and the international director of the Organic Consumers Association, said the amount found in Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream would not violate any regulations. \u201cNot everyone agrees with the acceptable levels governments have set,\u201d Mr. Cummins said. \u201cAnd, anyway, would you want to be eating this stuff at all?\u201dIt\u2019s far from clear. Divergent findings over glyphosate\u2019s impact on health have divided governments, scientists, regulators and even the World Health Organization, with its International Agency for Research on Cancer linking it to cancer and another unit of the organization insisting on its safety.Here is what we know:Among the flavors tested, Ben & Jerry\u2019s Chocolate Fudge Brownie showed the highest levels of glyphosate, with 1.74 parts per billion, and glyphosate\u2019s byproduct aminomethylphosphonic acid registering 0.91 parts per billion.Such amounts might seem negligible. John Fagan, the chief executive of the Health Research Institute Laboratories, which did the testing for the Organic Consumers Association, calculated that a 75-pound child would have to consume 145,000 eight-ounce servings a day of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream to hit the limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the government body charged with setting a ceiling on the amount of glyphosate allowed in food.An adult would have to eat 290,000 servings to hit the agency\u2019s cutoff, Dr. Fagan said.Even European regulatory limits for glyphosate consumption, which are almost six times lower than limits in the United States, find that a child would have to eat 25,000 servings a day and an adult 50,000 for the herbicide to pose a threat.\u201cBased on these government thresholds, the levels found in Ben & Jerry\u2019s Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream would seem totally irrelevant,\u201d he said.In that study, conducted by a group of scientists at King\u2019s College London and led by Michael Antoniou, a molecular biologist, the rats consumed in a day an amount of glyphosate equivalent to a child\u2019s portion of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream, Dr. Fagan said.\u201cThere were a number of criticisms of that study that were absolutely not true,\u201d said David Schubert, a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies who works on neurodegenerative diseases. \u201cBut the industry does what it can to make the science very confusing to a layperson.\u201d\u201cIt basically confirms what Antoniou showed in his research,\u201d Dr. Schubert said.The Organic Consumers Association has been working with an organization called Regeneration Vermont to persuade Ben & Jerry\u2019s to go organic. Federal regulations governing organic agriculture prohibit the use of glyphosate.To make its point, the association also had the Health Research Institute test four organic brands of vanilla ice cream \u2014 Alden\u2019s, Three Twins, Julie\u2019s and the Whole Foods Market brand 365. The lab found 0.25 to 0.5 parts per billion of glyphosate\u2019s byproduct, aminomethylphosphonic acid, in the 365 sample, but no detectable traces of glyphosate or its byproduct in the other samples.\u201cIf they went organic, they wouldn\u2019t have this problem,\u201d said Will Allen, a founder of Regeneration Vermont and an organic farmer who has met with Ben & Jerry\u2019s executives.Many of those products have few or no ingredients derived from genetically engineered crops like corn, soy and sugar beets, which are meant to withstand glyphosate. Some of those products have nonetheless tested for glyphosate registered at much higher levels than those found in Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice creams.Both Mr. Cummins, of the Organic Consumers Association, and Mr. Michalak, of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, said the glyphosate found in Ben & Jerry\u2019s probably comes from add-ins like peanut butter and cookie dough. Such products contain ingredients like wheat, oats and peanuts that are often sprayed with the herbicide to dry them out.\u201cRegulators have turned a blind eye toward trying to figure out what levels of glyphosate are in our food supply,\u201d Ms. Gillam said.The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment.The agency, Ms. McSeveney said, is in the process of testing four food commodities: corn, soy, eggs and milk.Some food and commodity companies have decided they can\u2019t wait on the government. The Scoular Company, which sells grains and other commodities, has begun requiring farmers who sell the company soybeans and corn to notify it before using any defoliants, including glyphosate.\u201cWe are concerned about the general increase in chemical residues in foods,\u201d said Greg Lickteig, a director at Scoular, \u201cand some of our customers are concerned, too. That\u2019s just the way it is. We now have the ability to know what\u2019s in our food more than we ever have before.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the lab that tested the ice cream for the Organic Consumers Association. It is Health Research Institute Laboratories, not Health Resource Institute Laboratories.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a journal that published a study led by Dr. Michael Antoniou. The study was published in Scientific Reports, a journal from the publishers of Nature, not in Nature.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which the International Agency for Research on Cancer released findings linking glyphosates to cancer. The announcement was made in 2015, not this year. In addition, the article referred incorrectly to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s plans to test four food commodities. The agency is in the process of testing those commodities, not planning to begin testing them. Advertisement"}

However, inside a former gas chamber, there should be mournful silence. It\u2019s not a stage.\u201dMr. Higgins, 55, a Republican from Louisiana\u2019s Third Congressional District with a penchant for making provocative videos, described the killings that took place at Auschwitz-Birkenau in German-occupied Poland at length in a five-minute video posted on YouTube on July 1. He said that the site, where over 1.1 million people were killed, inspired a \u201cgreat sense of dread\u201d in him.\u201cThis is why Homeland Security must be squared away, why our military must be invincible,\u201d he said at one point, walking through what is now a memorial and museum.At the end of the video, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to walk away from gas chambers and ovens without a very sober feeling of commitment, unwavering commitment, to make damn sure that the United States of America is protected from the evils of the world.\u201dLate Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Higgins\u2019s office released a statement from him, saying: \u201cI filmed the Auschwitz message with great humility. My intent was to offer a reverent homage to those who were murdered in Auschwitz and to remind the world that evil exists, that free nations must remember, and stand strong. However, my message has caused pain to some whom I love and respect. For that, my own heart feels sorrow. Out of respect to any who may feel that my video posting was wrong or caused pain, I have retracted my video.\u2019\u2019The videos, for which he improvised his own comments on specific crimes, found a sizable audience online. One such clip even made its way to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon in the summer of 2015.\u201cI want that guy to run for president,\u201d Mr. Fallon joked at the time. \u201cI love him!\u201d\u201cKill them all,\u201d Mr. Higgins concluded the post. \u201cFor the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all.\u201dIn his video from the former extermination camp, Mr. Higgins was comparatively sober, touring the site and speaking directly to the camera about what he was learning. At one point in the video, which has a mournful dirge as a soundtrack, he emphasizes the importance of historical memory in preventing tragedies like the one the camp witnessed. \u201cWe must remember these things,\u201d he said. \u201cMan\u2019s inhumanity to man can be quite shocking.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Obama Aides Lead Opposition to Health Care Repeal", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Several former Obama administration officials were on their regular Wednesday morning conference call this week, plotting against Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, when Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said on CNBC that his party should shoot for \u201cthe lowest common denominator\u201d on health care.As Senate Republicans make a final, urgent push this week to repeal the law they deride as Obamacare, they face a fierce and sophisticated opposition campaign by scores of former Obama administration officials working overtime to prevent Mr. Trump from gutting the policy they helped create.Motivated by the assault on President Barack Obama\u2019s top domestic achievement, many of his former aides and allies have put aside family vacations and deferred new careers to participate in what has become a reunion of sorts to save the Affordable Care Act.From her perch at the Century Foundation, Jeanne M. Lambrew, who was one of the chief White House architects of the health care law, is churning out detailed analyses warning about the effects of the Republican repeal proposals.Kathleen Sebelius, Mr. Obama\u2019s first secretary of health and human services, will soon embark on a monthlong bus tour designed to pressure members of Congress to oppose the health care law\u2019s repeal.And a few blocks from the Capitol, a political war room run by Leslie Dach, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s top health care officials, is coordinating a nationwide anti-repeal campaign by liberal think tanks, local \u201cresistance\u201d groups, sympathetic governors, medical and insurance lobbyists, Democratic activists, polling experts and academics.Conceived in the hours after Mr. Trump was elected in November, the group, called Protect Our Care, is at the heart of the effort to oppose a repeal. It hosts strategy calls at 8:30 and 9:45 every morning to develop talking points, plan TV ads and discuss the latest vote counts from the House and Senate.\u201cThe most important thing is that people understand what repeal means for them,\u201d Mr. Dach said. \u201cAnd what repeal means is millions losing their insurance, costs going up, not down, and anxiety coming back in their lives.\u201dThe Obama aides have helped direct about $6 million toward television ads by Save My Care, a separate group in Washington.The aides insist they are just one part of a broader liberal network that has been organically animated by anger about the Republican efforts to repeal the health care law. But they bring years of experience to the political fight, and their efforts have not gone unnoticed.In late February, Mr. Trump accused his predecessor of being the hidden hand behind town hall meetings where angry citizens accused lawmakers of trying to take away their health care. \u201cI think that President Obama is probably behind it, because his people are certainly behind it,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News at the time.His former aides have taken a more active role.Anita Dunn, Mr. Obama\u2019s onetime communications director, is helping to spread the anti-repeal message, placing opinion articles in newspapers and distributing letters, including one from a group representing 7,000 Catholic nuns who oppose repealing the health law.Meaghan R. Smith, who served as the communications director at the Department of Health and Human Services under Mr. Obama, and Lori Lodes, who was the spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have become the de facto press secretaries for the effort, working to influence stories written by political and health care reporters.And Kristie Canegallo, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy implementation, is directing frequent strategy sessions with the opposition leadership. She has essentially reprised her White House role as the logistics person responsible for ensuring that a sprawling bureaucracy stayed on task as the health care law went into effect.Ms. Canegallo\u2019s conference calls have continued almost nonstop, even while she was on vacation in Australia, according to one participant.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a simple goal from the beginning, which is to stop the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, to protect Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Dach said in an interview this week.Part of that strategy involved a public effort to broadly portray the Republican repeal effort as a threat to people\u2019s existing health care choices.Mr. Slavitt\u2019s tweets are revered among Obama alumni for their sharp edges. Last week, when the Congressional Budget Office released its latest estimate of the effects of the Republican bill, Mr. Slavitt did not mince words.A state-by-state look at who could lose insurance under the proposed Republican health care plans.Among the episode titles: \u201cKill Bill Vol. 2.\u201dBut the campaign against repeal is also more targeted, aimed directly at a handful of Republican senators who have expressed concern about the effects that scrapping the Affordable Care Act could have on their poorest constituents.After Mr. Heller and Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, voted on Tuesday to open debate on repealing the health law, Save My Care released television ads on Wednesday chiding both of them.That vote marked a setback in the battle to save Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. But in the hours since, the opposition campaign has celebrated a bit. Votes on several variations of repeal legislation failed to pass the Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday and Wednesday.Still, the former aides to Mr. Obama said they did not intend to drop their guard. When a repeal bill failed to pass in the House in March, they relaxed their efforts, only to see the legislation roar back to life a few weeks later.\u201cThe lesson here is eternal vigilance,\u201d Ms. Dunn said. \u201cWe all prematurely celebrated after the first House vote. Until we can control one body, we can\u2019t afford to walk away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Amanda Sullivan, a camp coordinator and a postdoctoral researcher in early childhood technology, smiled. \u201cThey\u2019ve been debugging their Hokey Pokeys,\u201d she said.To prepare, children need to start as early as preschool, educators say. Foundational skills that affect whether people thrive or fall behind in the modern economy are developed early, and achievement gaps appear before kindergarten.\u201cIt\u2019s a real misnomer that simply learning to code is the answer,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a chairman in engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWe don\u2019t need everybody to be extremely capable Python coders. It\u2019s a way of understanding what machines are good at and what they\u2019re not good at \u2014 that\u2019s something everybody needs to learn.\u201dIt\u2019s not that technology should be avoided; many researchers say children should be exposed to it. But we don\u2019t know what machines will be able to do in two decades, let alone which programming languages software engineers will use. And children learn better, they say, by playing and building instead of sitting behind screens.\u201cThat\u2019s key for programming, and it\u2019s key for life,\u201d she said. Her curriculum, used in schools nationwide and abroad, teaches skills like sharing and perseverance, and is woven into all subjects in the school day: Children program robots to act out a story they\u2019re reading, for example.At the Tufts summer camp, the children were programming the robot \u2014 which has no screen but uses colored wooden blocks and a bar code scanner \u2014 by building a sequence of blocks labeled with commands like \u201cturn right\u201d or \u201cspin.\u201dThey had already learned an important piece of syntax: The program must begin with a green \u201cbegin\u201d block and end with a red \u201cend\u201d one. Nico Luker, 6, decided to test what would happen if he scanned a program without the \u201cend\u201d block. \u201cIt won\u2019t work without an end,\u201d predicted Noam Webber, 6. Sure enough, the robot sat still.Meanwhile, the children were learning about teamwork, failure and sharing. \u201cTechnology can be a vehicle to help people create and collaborate better, but at the end of the day, people need to learn to work with people,\u201d Ms. Umaschi Bers said. To begin, teachers place all the materials on tables, and children take what they need.

{"Headline": "The Art and Artistry of Double Dutch", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe main ingredients? A pair of swirling ropes, two turners to maneuver them and at least one jumper to feel out the rhythm, slip seamlessly in between the ropes and bounce in perfect time. Double Dutch may sound like child\u2019s play, but it\u2019s more than just skipping rope. This game that came to life in the streets of New York City \u2014 practiced mainly by girls \u2014 is an integral piece of African-American culture.Double Dutch has been a competitive sport since the 1970s, its popularity in cities intertwined with the birth of hip-hop. While just about anyone can do it, the best practitioners use athleticism, finesse and musicality to transform it from a game into a choreographic feat. Yes, double Dutch is very much an art form. And who knew? It even has roots at Lincoln Center.\u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized that I had to go back and find this history. It\u2019s a story that I wanted to make sure was told from the viewpoint of an African-American woman.\u201d\u201cI saw all of the black and brown faces on the plaza of Lincoln Center,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my lifetime, I haven\u2019t seen that happen ever again. I thought, we have to revitalize this competition, but it has to be more than just a competition.\u201d\u201cThis is about preserving the legacy and the history of double Dutch,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cIt kind of fell off the scene, people would say, but it\u2019s really been a thriving form. It just found its feet outside of the urban communities in and outside of the United States.\u201dMs. Walker took over the league from her father, David A. Walker, a New York City police detective who, along with his partner, Ulysses Williams, saw double Dutch\u2019s potential and helped it become a competitive sport. In 2009, it became a varsity sport in New York City public schools.But double Dutch is also related to aspects of dance. In 1983, it was part of Dance Black America, a festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music produced by Mikki Shepard. Ms. Johnson said, \u201cWhen I think about its living legacy, I think about choreographers and dancers like Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and Camille A. Brown, who both integrated double Dutch into their work.\u201dMs. Brown, who was raised in Queens, attended the competition at Lincoln Center, as well as neighborhood ones, as a child. \u201cI never competed,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI could never jam like they did. That was on another level.\u201dFor her, double Dutch is about identity and African-American culture. \u201cIt speaks to the African rhythms and African traditions that continue to be within African-American culture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the game play, it\u2019s also about traditions \u2014 you can hear those rhythms and the complexity of the double Dutch games.\u201dAs with dance, double Dutch is an oral tradition in which information is passed down from one generation to the next. And within the technique, there is room for individuality. \u201cTrue, there\u2019s athleticism that\u2019s involved, but the way the jumpers move their body \u2014 their timing, their rhythm, their steps,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s dance!\u201dThere are three components of the Summer Classic competition: speed, a two-minute drill in which every left step is counted; compulsory, or specific steps that a jumper must execute, like two turns to the left followed by two turns to the right; and freestyle, a showcase of artistry and acrobatic ingenuity.Delores Finlayson, a member of the Fantastic Four \u2014 the champion team featured in \u201cPick Up Your Feet\u201d \u2014 will be a judge. \u201cWe would actually dream of tricks,\u201d Ms. Finlayson said. \u201cIf someone said something couldn\u2019t be done in the ropes, it almost became our job to prove them wrong.\u201d\u201cWe were dedicated,\u201d Ms. Finlayson said. \u201cWe were competitive. And I must say, we had a certain discipline that I have yet to see with a lot of our young people. I think the younger people today just have so many more distractions with technology.\u201dTheir desire, as kids, she said, was to go outside and play. \u201cWe wanted to jump, we wanted to be creative,\u201d she said.The artistry behind double Dutch is not lost on Ms. Finlayson. \u201cIt requires balance, resilience, coordination, timing, and there\u2019s a lot of gymnastics involved as well \u2014 especially nowadays. I see it as poetry in motion.\u201dFittingly, this weekend such poetry \u2014 involving daredevil flips and breathtaking rhythmic coordinations \u2014 will return to Lincoln Center. \u201cIt will be right there at the fountain where it originally was,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cThat was central to the idea of this program: To reclaim that cultural space.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "MTV Mines the Past for Its Future: \u2018Total Request Live\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent Wednesday afternoon, Chris McCarthy, the newish president of MTV, was standing at a corner of 44th Street and Broadway and gazing up at the second floor of Viacom\u2019s Manhattan headquarters.\u201cWhen you came into Times Square, you would say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to MTV,\u2019\u201d he said, recalling a better time when MTV was, well, relevant.Mr. McCarthy, 42, was looking at the space that used to house \u201cTotal Request Live,\u201d the MTV afternoon show from 1998 to 2008 that helped make the host, Carson Daly, a star and was a must-stop destination for musicians, Times Square gawkers and advertisers eager to reach a young audience.That was then. Ratings at MTV in the last five years have nose-dived, turnaround strategies have failed and the cable network\u2019s parent company, Viacom, has watched its stock go into free fall.So, what\u2019s a media executive to do?Apparently, bring back \u201cTRL.\u201dMr. McCarthy said \u201cTRL\u201d would return in October, and a massive studio facing Times Square was under construction in the hope of capturing the old magic.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to come back and reinvent MTV, the studio is a given,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the centerpiece.\u201dIt is also the centerpiece in what Mr. McCarthy believes is the beginning of MTV\u2019s comeback. Though many observers say that is a long shot, there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks.Ratings for MTV\u2019s core audience \u2014 18- to 34-year-olds \u2014 went up in June and July, the first time the network has experienced back-to-back months of ratings growth in four years.So far, those gains have come courtesy of re-engineered reality shows like \u201cFear Factor\u201d and \u201cWild \u2019n Out,\u201d a sketch comedy show.A new slate shepherded by Mr. McCarthy will have live shows (including \u201cTRL\u201d and late-night programs) and familiar-looking reality fare, including a show reminiscent of \u201cLaguna Beach\u201d called \u201cSiesta Key,\u201d which premieres Monday.The latest strategic pivot at MTV is vital to the fortunes of Viacom, which also owns other cable channels like Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.The company, which has experienced a chaotic year and a half, has tried to stabilize itself with a strategy targeting six core cable channels, MTV included. Viacom was also in the hunt to buy Scripps, the company that owns networks like HGTV and Food Network, before pulling out of the negotiations late last week.But no matter what, it\u2019s going to be an uphill climb.Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson Research, said MTV had several challenges, including a fickle audience that is preoccupied with social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.\u201cLooking at it month to month, week to week, you could see some early winds, but there\u2019s heavy skepticism of a multiyear recovery,\u201d he said.Mr. McCarthy, who oversaw turnaround projects at MTV\u2019s sister cable channels VH1, Logo and MTV2, is not lacking in confidence, saying that he and his team have already \u201ctotally turned the business around after five years of decline.\u201d\u201cI see that math, I see the shows we are about to green-light, I see that landscape for the next few months \u2014 we\u2019re stable,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do I know that? I could be wrong, but I haven\u2019t missed an estimate in the 12 years I\u2019ve been doing TV.\u201dRobert Bakish, Viacom\u2019s chief executive, said he was heartened by MTV\u2019s recent results and credited Mr. McCarthy, who took over in late 2016.\u201cWhen Chris got in, he analyzed the situation, we talked about it and he quickly arrived at the conclusion that the programming direction was wrong,\u201d Mr. Bakish said. \u201cHe reset the brand filter, cleaned out the pipeline and began building a new MTV that\u2019s much more based on reality, unscripted and music content.\u201dWhen Mr. McCarthy came aboard, he quickly killed more than 100 projects in development.He regarded the decision in 2015 to pour resources into MTV News \u2014 which hired, among others, several prominent journalists from Bill Simmons\u2019s old website, Grantland \u2014 as misaligned with the network\u2019s mission and pulled the plug.\u201cMTV at its best \u2014 whether it\u2019s news, whether it\u2019s a show, whether it\u2019s a docu-series \u2014 is about amplifying young people\u2019s voices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put young people on the screen, and we let the world hear their voices. We shouldn\u2019t be writing 6,000-word articles on telling people how to feel.\u201d\u201cWhy should it be a man?\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cIt could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.\u201dMr. McCarthy is also developing a show called \u201cWe Are They,\u201d a seemingly by-the-numbers reality show that will focus on young people\u2019s coming-of-age moments (going to college, first relationships) with a twist that all of those featured will be gender-nonconforming.Whether these moves come off as pandering or connect with young people remains to be seen.Then in October, MTV will unveil the revival of \u201cTRL.\u201d The original iteration \u2014 which featured a countdown of music videos, a studio audience and frequent appearances from star musicians \u2014 was, in a way, a throwback itself, an updated version of \u201cAmerican Bandstand.\u201dThe newer version of \u201cTRL\u201d will initially run an hour a day, and Mr. McCarthy said that might grow to two to three hours a day as the show developed. (There will also be unique daily content for Instagram, Snapchat and other social media channels.)MTV is hoping the \u201cTRL\u201d name is enough of a star. Mr. Daly will not return as host, and the network instead will rely on five co-hosts who are relatively unknown, including DC Young Fly, a rapper and comedian, and Erik Zachary, a Chicago radio host.Mr. McCarthy hopes that the pedestrian plaza outside the Times Square studio will be open to concerts, along with an alleyway behind the Viacom building.Charlie Walk, the president of Republic Records, which has musicians like Drake and Lorde on its talent roster, said that in recent years MTV had abandoned the music business and that bringing \u201cTRL\u201d back was a big step in the right direction.\u201cWho\u2019s not going to support a platform that\u2019s covering all of the buckets of social media and cable to allow your artist to go on, play a video, perform a song and to talk about their new music that just got released?\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you say no to that? We\u2019re going to give it a shot, a big shot.\u201dThere will be plenty, of course, who roll their eyes.Mr. McCarthy does not care.\u201cIt\u2019s the right route,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you talk to artists and they say to you, unaware of what we\u2019re doing, can you bring back \u2018TRL\u2019? We\u2019d be crazy not to reinvent that.\u201d\u201cMTV\u2019s reinvention,\u201d he continued, \u201cis coming by harnessing its heritage.\u201dAt least, that\u2019s the latest game plan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hat. Rabbit. Spy Cam? Claims of Skulduggery at a Hot Magic Show", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. DelGaudio was presenting a monologue about a painful childhood memory, to be capped off with a vanishing effect that left the audience gasping, when a technician in the booth at the back of the 155-seat Daryl Roth Theater in Manhattan looked down at a security monitor and became suspicious about a light pulsing from a smartphone propped up in an audience member\u2019s breast pocket.At one point, the man in the audience took the phone out of his pocket and held it under his chin, as if pointing it at Mr. DelGaudio. The behavior of your average souvenir-hunting cellphone scofflaw, perhaps \u2014 if not for two odd twists.First, the pulse was visible on the monitor, which has infrared capability, but apparently not to the naked eye, according to two theater employees quietly summoned to observe. And the man turned out to be another professional magician.But word of the incident \u2014 which was captured on a video the technician shot off the security monitor using his own smartphone \u2014 began spreading through the insular world of magicians, and a few days later Mr. Meade received a text message from a mutual connection of his and Mr. DelGaudio\u2019s, saying he had been \u201cwarned\u201d about Mr. Meade.Mr. Meade promptly sent a Facebook message to Mr. DelGaudio, whom he does not know personally, but received no reply. In the Facebook message, Mr. Meade expressed bafflement over the claim of surreptitious filming, a sentiment he repeated in an email to The New York Times.\u201cAs the usher checked and can attest, I had absolutely zero video, photo or audio recordings from Derek\u2019s show,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be absolutely clear. I categorically refute these claims.\u201dMr. DelGaudio said that he never saw the message, which he said had landed in Facebook\u2019s folder for messages from people outside his friend network. But his guard was up, and a few days after Mr. Meade\u2019s visit, Mr. DelGaudio said, he spotted another person \u2014 recognized as a magician by an usher who had seen him at \u201ca local magic hangout,\u201d as Mr. DelGaudio put it \u2014 filming the show\u2019s ending, and asked him to delete the footage.Mr. DelGaudio, 33, is fiercely protective of his original material. But he said that he was also alarmed by what he saw as attempts to bottle \u201cthe capital-M magic\u201d of a show intended to be an in-person-only experience.\u201cI\u2019m kind of living my childhood fantasy of creating a Willy Wonka factory,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we have real-life Slugworths tying to steal our gobstoppers.\u201dWhatever took place the night Mr. Meade visited Mr. DelGaudio\u2019s show, which has been extended through Dec. 30, was less dramatic, if perhaps as hard to puzzle out as some of the onstage effects.The technician\u2019s video clearly shows a pulsing light from Mr. Meade\u2019s phone. It also shows Mr. Meade taking the phone out of his pocket and propping it under his chin, pointed at the stage, without looking at the screen. After putting it back, he glances down quickly, then adjusts its position in his pocket, keeping his torso straight. (Mr. DelGaudio showed the video to The Times but would not allow it to be published.)Someone who wants to turn a smartphone into a spy cam can find plenty of help. There are night-vision apps, tweaks that let you film while your phone appears to be off, apps that stash files in hidden locations, cameras disguised as phones.In a small theater, during a part of the show when the audience is in \u201ccomplete blackout,\u201d any ordinary light \u201cwould have been visible from a mile away,\u201d said Jake Friedman, Mr. DelGaudio\u2019s manager and one of the show\u2019s co-producers.Whatever the truth about what happened the night Mr. Meade visited Mr. DelGaudio\u2019s show, word that other magicians may have surreptitiously filmed him drew a strong response from some fellow performers.\u201cThere is rampant stealing, in my estimation, in our industry right now,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cThose of us who fight it, those of us who have ethics, we try hard to protect each other.\u201dOriginality in magic is a slippery concept. But Teller, the less talkative half of Penn & Teller, said that people, including \u201cuncreative magicians,\u201d have no idea how difficult it is to create substantially new tricks and illusions, like one in Penn & Teller\u2019s current show involving a live cow, which he said took six years to develop.\u201cIf you want to write a piece for the piano, you can write a piece for the piano,\u201d Teller said. \u201cBut with magic, you basically have to invent the magical equivalent of a piano, then figure out how to build it, then how to play it, then how to play it in front of an audience.\u201d\u201cHe said he was using a different method, but that makes no difference to the public,\u201d Teller said of the other magician. \u201cAll they see is the effect.\u201d (The judge agreed.)Magicians certainly admit to trying to suss out one another\u2019s methods. Teller said that when he went back a second time to see Mr. DelGaudio\u2019s show during its initial run last year, in Los Angeles, he was \u201cwatching for every little possibility.\u201d\u201cI saw one major thing I had missed the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Damn, he\u2019s good!\u2019\u201d Still, he said, \u201cthere are several things where I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing it.\u201dMr. Meade offered similar praise for Mr. DelGaudio\u2019s show, calling the ending \u201cthe best thing I\u2019ve ever seen in a live stage show in my entire career.\u201dHe also extended an invitation: \u201cI hope Derek will come see my show some day so he can be assured it\u2019s nothing like his.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet Your New Data-Driven Travel Agent", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayUnlike big, impersonal online agencies, the best travel agents know a great deal about their clients and their travel choices. Now several new travel companies are creating data-driven, automated agents that rely on users\u2019 personal preferences to make the travel-planning process easier.Whether they use human knowledge or artificial intelligence (or both), these next-generation travel agents do the search-culling for you, tailoring the results to your stated preferences and potentially cutting down on web-browsing time. They also use text messaging as their primary communications mode, often via a chatbot, a computer program designed to converse in text.\u201cRather than going into an online travel agency and doing a search and seeing a list of 150 hotels, you enter in your profile what you\u2019re looking for and a chatbot serves up a curated list of three to four in a messaging interface,\u201d said Douglas Quinby, a senior vice president at the travel research firm Phocuswright. \u201cThe ideal is fewer options more tailored to your request.\u201dMost of these services are challenging the do-it-yourself system of browsing as offered by services like Expedia. New-wave agents \u2014 human, robotic or a combination \u2014 will also allow users to continue a search over time, rather than start anew with a browser each session.\u201cThis is very much the early alpha stage of all of this,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the president of Atmosphere Research Group. \u201cIt\u2019s very much the first wave, which is exciting, but the use of artificial intelligence is far from established and also, frankly, far from perfect.\u201dThe following pioneers are tinkering with the way travel is planned and booked, with payment models that vary from subscriptions to pay-per-use.\u201cPana was borne out of two pain points,\u201d said Devon Tivona, its chief executive. \u201cFirst, all the technology pulled me away from just emailing to get something done because I\u2019ve become my own travel agent. Second is getting access to real-time help.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our strategy, not just a computer\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Rowan, describing the service as managing airline and hotel bookings not just to travel cheaply but to accrue status with travel companies. \u201cThe downside of working with us is the onboarding is intense. We get to know you as a human, not just a set of data points.\u201dMembership fees start at $1,000 a month for unlimited travel planning, which they say eliminates the conflict of interest inherent in a commission-based system, where revenue rises with more expensive bookings.

{"Headline": "Uber Is Dealt a Fresh Blow in European Legal Case", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Uber suffered a blow to its expansion plans in Europe on Tuesday after a senior adviser to the region\u2019s highest court said that the ride-hailing service should have to abide by tough rules governing taxi services.The French authorities brought criminal proceedings last year against the ride-hailing service for infringing a law that required any vehicle carrying passengers for a fee to be licensed as a taxi service and to have appropriate insurance.Uber had argued that the law was also a \u201ctechnical regulation\u201d over digital services. That being the case, the company said, the French authorities were required to notify the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, before adopting the legislation. Because France did not do so, Uber contended, the law could not be enforced.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.\u201cWe have seen today\u2019s statement and await the final ruling later this year,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. She said that the company had stopped offering the services in question, and that it now worked only with professionally licensed drivers in France.The court typically follows the recommendations of its senior advisers, but it could still rule in the company\u2019s favor.\u201cThe two ways Uber sold itself \u2014 as a digital company and as a ride-sharing service \u2014 don\u2019t stand up, according to this legal opinion,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Cass Business School at City University in London.When companies like Uber and Airbnb, the short-term rental company, set up, he said, \u201cThey skirted around national laws, and that was what made them competitive and cheap.\u201d He added, \u201cMany national regulators are beginning to chip away at that.\u201dUber already operates in many European cities in compliance with transportation rules, but some of its services \u2014 particularly those that do not require drivers to have a taxi license \u2014 have been banned and face stiff opposition.The pushback against Uber is part of wider tensions between the European authorities and American technology companies.After months of turmoil and questions about its leadership and culture, the company is now without a chief executive \u2014 a committee of executives is in charge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Profit and Revenue Surge, Despite Company Predictions of a Slowdown", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For more than a year, investors have braced for Facebook to reach the limit of its moneymaking capacity. The growth of its advertising business, the company has warned, would eventually start to slow down.It turns out that Facebook has barely broken stride.\u201cWe just continue to see businesses coming to both Facebook and Instagram to find people on mobile,\u201d David Wehner, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. \u201cMobile continues to be the driver of growth.\u201dFacebook reported $9.3 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up 45 percent from the same period last year. Profit rose to $3.9 billion, up 71 percent from last year, or $1.32 a share, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $1.12 a share on $9.2 billion in sales.Facebook also said it continued to attract new users and businesses, even though it already served a large portion of the world\u2019s population. More than 2 billion people visit Facebook on a monthly basis, 17 percent more than a year earlier. About two-thirds of those visitors use the site every day.Mr. Wehner said that despite the company\u2019s growth soaring over all, Facebook expected growth in advertising revenue to continue slowing the rest of this year as it reaches the limit of the number of advertisements, or \u201cad load,\u201d it can place in its news feed without disturbing users.\u201cThis ad load ultimatum has led to a more improved news feed experience for all users, but obviously takes additional time and resources for marketers to deliver compelling ads,\u201d said Andrew Foxwell, a founder of Foxwell Digital, a social media advisory firm.Facebook also warned that it would be spending a great deal of money for the foreseeable future. The company now has more than 20,000 employee, 43 percent more than a year ago. And it had more than $1.4 billion in capital expenditures in the second quarter \u2014 a category of spending the company does not see slowing any time soon.Such warnings do not appear to have spooked investors. After a brief dip in after-hours trading, Facebook\u2019s share price rose to more than $172, a record high.Still, company executives see a number of opportunities in the near future that may excite investors. Instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by Facebook, is selling ads in more places within its app, including its \u201cStories\u201d product, which takes many cues from the messaging app Snapchat.Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, two of the company\u2019s messaging properties, are just now starting to dabble in generating revenue. Expanding those efforts could accelerate in the coming months.\u201cI want to see us move a little faster here, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to get this right,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s executive, said on a conference call with investors on Wednesday.Advertisement"}

Distractify\u2019s complaint, which seeks a jury trial, was filed in June and lists 51 examples of 22 Words committing \u201cacts amounting to digital piracy and plagiarism.\u201dIn each of the articles cited, the content in 22 Words was similar but not identical to the content in Distractify.Among the examples:In a statement, Brainjolt said Distractify had no claim to ownership over the subjects 22 Words covered.\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve been told, Distractify seems to be complaining about our use of content that is readily available on social media, and which Distractify is not the original author,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs such, we believe that Distractify\u2019s claims are without merit, and will defend ourselves and our reputation vigorously.\u201dA lawyer for Distractify declined to comment.You might be wondering: Doesn\u2019t this happen all the time?Indeed, aggregation (or curation \u2014 whatever you\u2019d like to call it) of content on other sites is a major driver of reader traffic to many articles, especially in viral content publications. They tend to focus on emerging memes, entertaining social media posts and uplifting stories that can be written up quickly. Publications compete against each other for clicks, which lead to advertising revenue.And a writer at Someecards said on Twitter that Distractify had \u201cstolen\u201d her posts.The Distractify lawsuit raises the question: Can the underlying topic of an article be subject to copyright? While the laws governing online media are far from settled, experts were skeptical.Daniel Nazer, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said facts and story concepts generally can\u2019t be copyrighted. Short phrases like headlines or titles likely wouldn\u2019t be subject to copyright, either, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s only so many ways to say that someone used a Spotfiy playlist to break up with someone, and that fact is no more copyrightable than the fact that the president fired the F.B.I. director,\u201d he said.While some would consider attribution to be ethically important, it isn\u2019t relevant to copyright law, Mr. Nazer said. And plagiarism, while a major publishing no-no, is not itself a crime unless the duplicated material was copyrighted.The challenge for Distractify would be proving that there was enough original creativity in its articles to claim ownership, and he said that might be difficult.\u201cMy first thought was: How is this infringement if their original articles aren\u2019t infringement?\u201d he said.Original content creators, like photographers, often see their work appear on sites without permission or payment, said Scott Burroughs, a lawyer at Doniger/Burroughs, a law firm based in Venice, Calif., that focuses on copyright law.\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit rich for Distractify to be claiming 22 Words is ripping off its content when we know at least some of its content is the work of others that they\u2019ve essentially ripped off,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Death of a Muslim Recruit Revealed a Culture of Brutality in the Marines", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "FeatureRecruits at Parris Island have been subjected to severe hazing, far beyond that experienced in other U.S. military boot camps. Is this really the only way to create a warrior?Supported bySilence.\u2018\u2018Raheel?\u2019\u2019 she said. The phone was dead. The call lasted less than five seconds. In her darkened living room in Taylor, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, Ghazala worried. The previous morning, Raheel, a 20-year-old Marine Corps recruit, left for boot camp on Parris Island, S.C. He had promised to call his parents when he arrived, and Ghazala and her husband, Masood, had been waiting by the phone. But the call, when it came, was strange, with an almost deafening noise in the background. Ghazala couldn\u2019t be sure it was even him. In the morning, she phoned Raheel\u2019s recruiter. \u2018\u2018No one knows my son\u2019s voice better than me,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018That didn\u2019t sound like my son.\u2019\u2019The Siddiquis, who emigrated from Pakistan in the 1990s, hadn\u2019t wanted their precious oldest child, and only boy, to join the Marines. Slender and unathletic, Raheel had always seemed most content designing video games on his computer. He graduated ninth in the class of 2014 from Taylor\u2019s Harry S. Truman High School, a valedictorian with his pick of colleges, including a full academic scholarship to Michigan State. After months of deliberation, he decided on the University of Michigan\u2019s Dearborn campus, where he enrolled in September 2014, lured by its new program in robotics engineering. But the following July, after his freshman year, Raheel drastically changed course, announcing to his family that he had decided to leave college and enlist in the Marines.Ghazala didn\u2019t understand. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re intelligent \u2014 why?\u2019\u2019 she pleaded with him. Raheel tried to placate her. It was a \u2018\u2018golden opportunity,\u2019\u2019 he told his parents. \u2018\u2018After three years in the Marine Corps, I can do anything.\u2019\u2019That call was the last time she heard her son\u2019s voice.Raheel was raised in public housing and spent his high school years intent on escaping his shabby hometown. \u2018\u2018He always wanted challenges,\u2019\u2019 says Jerry Abraham, a former guidance counselor at Truman High whom Raheel frequently enlisted to help him find the hardest classes. In pursuit of a perfect G.P.A., Raheel had virtually no social life, though he had a na\u00efve optimism unusual for a teenager. \u2018\u2018He saw the world as nothing but a wonderful place,\u2019\u2019 says Karey Lee, Raheel\u2019s supervisor at a nearby Home Depot, where he worked part time on the customer-service desk. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think he knew that hatefulness existed, to be honest.\u2019\u2019Military recruiters were fixtures at Truman High. The Marines, the most selective of the armed services, came to campus twice a week. \u2018\u2018They targeted the kids that were more college-oriented and capable of being successful,\u2019\u2019 says Abraham, whose office was in the same building as the school\u2019s R.O.T.C. program. They were also quick to reject students who failed to meet their standards, which include scores in the top third on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (Asvab) test and no history of serious drug use, crime or tattoos that the Marines consider \u2018\u2018undesirable.\u2019\u2019 Like many of his classmates, Raheel took the Asvab and scored high. With his talents, drive and rigid focus, he would very likely have struck recruiters as the \u2018\u2018golden goose,\u2019\u2019 as one former Marine put it.The University of Michigan-Dearborn was the most prestigious school to which Raheel applied, and in April 2014 he was accepted and given a $2,000 scholarship. It was not the full academic scholarship he was offered by Michigan State, but with the hefty financial aid he would receive, it was \u2018\u2018technically a full free ride,\u2019\u2019 Raheel announced on Facebook. The assistance, however, came with strings: Should his grades dip below a C average, he wouldn\u2019t receive any more money until they went back up.Raheel enrolled in Michigan\u2019s honors program, a special track requiring students to maintain a 3.2 G.P.A. He assumed it would be easy. Lee, his boss at Home Depot, estimated that Raheel probably worked about 20 hours a week his freshman year, though it never occurred to her to ask why he needed to work so many hours if school was paid for. \u2018\u2018He never talked about what he did with the money,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I assumed he was doing well at school because, I mean, he was a genius.\u2019\u2019After high school, Raheel had told his mother she should stop working odd jobs and let him contribute to the family\u2019s income. Massood didn\u2019t make much at an auto-parts factory, and Raheel was concerned about how the family would pay for his 16-year-old sister to attend college. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s face it,\u2019\u2019 he confided to a friend, \u2018\u2018she\u2019s not going to get a full scholarship, and my parents can\u2019t afford to send her, so I have to make sure she goes.\u2019\u2019It was a lot for an 18-year-old. His grades began to suffer. By December, Raheel was getting Cs. Worried that he might fail chemistry, he texted his friend Nathan Pykor, also a student at the Dearborn campus: \u2018\u2018I just feel too STRESSED over all of my classes because I haven\u2019t dedicated enough time.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You\u2019re fine,\u2019\u2019 Pykor, who had known Raheel since high school, replied. \u2018\u2018You know that it\u2019s nearly impossible to get a 4.0 in college.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not fine,\u2019\u2019 Raheel texted back.His solution, he told Pykor, was to withdraw from his classes and \u2018\u2018start fresh\u2019\u2019 in the spring, which he did, finishing the semester with three As and a B. But as Pykor told me, withdrawing from his classes very likely meant Raheel would owe the University of Michigan the money it had given him to attend classes in the fall. It also could have jeopardized his aid package for the following year.On June 16, 2015, Raheel posted on Facebook for the first time in a while. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m thinking about joining the military. Maybe the Marines.\u2019\u2019 Just three weeks later, on July 8, he signed his enlistment papers and entered the Marines\u2019 Delayed Entry Program, which, lasting anywhere between a month and a year, is designed to stagger the number of recruits the corps can train at any one time. It\u2019s also intended to indoctrinate \u2018\u2018poolees,\u2019\u2019 as they are called, into the culture of the Marines. \u2018\u2018The D.E.P. is all about selling the Kool-Aid,\u2019\u2019 says a lance corporal who also enlisted in the Marines in 2015, after his freshman year. (\u2018\u2018I decided I didn\u2019t like college enough to justify all that debt,\u2019\u2019 he told me.) \u2018\u2018You meet every Saturday, and they\u2019ll tell you stories, do little workouts,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018tell you some lies.\u2019\u2019 Like \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Yeah, I\u2019m always in my room playing Xbox,\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s all this time to party\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 \u2014 anything that will appeal to college kids.Raheel spent close to eight months in the D.E.P. under the tutelage of his recruiter, who the Siddiquis said told them that Raheel was his most motivated poolee. Ghazala marveled at the changes in her son, who now woke each day at 4 a.m. to spend hours at the gym. Any doubts his mother had about his education were assuaged by Raheel\u2019s own assurances: He said he had been told that he could continue his education while serving, and that, having chosen a technical specialty, working on Marine aircraft, he might not even have to fight unless he wanted to. (In fact, Marines I spoke to said it was nearly impossible to pursue an education during their first enlistment; once deployed, every Marine has to be prepared to fight if suddenly under attack.) At Raheel\u2019s urging, Ghazala visited the recruiting office in Taylor, where she says that recruiters assured her that Raheel\u2019s safety wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u2018\u2018I feel like they\u2019re really good at lying,\u2019\u2019 says the lance corporal, who was sold on the corps by recruiting videos that presented the Marines as \u2018\u2018badasses\u2019\u2019 on humanitarian missions to save refugees or deliver food and water. Raheel told his parents that enlisting in the Marines would put him on the fast track to join the F.B.I., which, to their total surprise, had become his life\u2019s dream. A few weeks before he left for boot camp, Raheel stopped by Truman to tell some of his old teachers about his plans. Abraham pressed him on his decision, but Raheel\u2019s mind was made up.\u2018\u2018Be careful,\u2019\u2019 Raheel\u2019s friend Hussein Chehab, who worked with him at Home Depot, says he told him before he left. \u2018\u2018Just .\u2009.\u2009. watch yourself. You don\u2019t know what kinds of people are down there. You don\u2019t know how other people think.\u2019\u2019History, or what Marines call \u2018\u2018knowledge,\u2019\u2019 lives on Parris Island. Everything about the place is an elegy to the corps, from the statue of Marines lifting the flag on Iwo Jima to the street names, each one its own small lesson: Boulevard de France, Cuba Street, Wake Boulevard, Saigon Drive. Inside the Recruit Chapel, a series of stained-glass windows depicts chapters of Marine heroism and sacrifice. In one, a platoon of Marines rests in the hand of God. In another, a ragtag band of soldiers and sailors stands before the gates of heaven guarded by stoic, crisply dressed Marines.The Marines are America\u2019s smallest conventional military force, with just 184,000 active-duty troops. They are also the military\u2019s most insular warriors \u2014 with the possible exception of Navy SEALs \u2014 whose tight bond, or \u2018\u2018esprit de corps,\u2019\u2019 grows out of the codes, traditions and reverence for suffering that Marines believe set them apart from civilians and all other military branches.Central to this identity is the uniquely miserable experience of boot camp, where since World War II, as the historian Aaron O\u2019Connell writes in his 2012 book, \u2018\u2018Underdogs: The Making of the Modern Marine Corps,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Recruits [have] learned in ways they would not forget that what made Marines exceptional was their ability to endure more pain than members of their sister services.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Making\u2019\u2019 Marines, as the corps calls recruit training, is a three-part process, with boot camp being the first and most grueling test. Its purpose, unlike Army boot camp, is not to train war-fighters; for Marines, that comes in the second and third phases of training. Boot camp is meant to create the \u2018\u2018warrior spirit,\u2019\u2019 as the corps puts it, over three months of group indoctrination intended to strip recruits of individuality and, through repeated exposure to pain and physical challenge, condition them to accept and perform violence.In his 1984 memoir, \u2018\u2018First to Fight,\u2019\u2019 the esteemed Marine lieutenant general Victor Krulak, known as Brute, spoke of the \u2018\u2018almost mystical alchemy\u2019\u2019 that happens during boot camp, whose shared hardships he saw as \u2018\u2018the genesis of the enduring sense of brotherhood that characterizes the corps.\u2019\u2019 But the lines between hard training and abuse can blur. Like every other branch of the military, the Marine Corps has official strictures against hazing, which it defines as any unauthorized verbal or physical conduct of a \u2018\u2018cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning or harmful\u2019\u2019 nature. The Marines have nonetheless investigated hundreds of hazing allegations in the past five years alone. (The particulars of the hazing incidents in this article were taken largely from redacted reports prepared by the Marines in the course of their investigations. Details like names and dialogue were provided by eyewitnesses and other recruits.) \u2018\u2018There is a natural tension between an organization that trains people for lethality and the larger culture,\u2019\u2019 a Marine reserve officer told me. \u2018\u2018Inside the culture, you\u2019re supposed to be able to take a punch and give a punch and crush a skull. Outside, this is not something that\u2019s valued.\u2019\u2019The bedrock of Marine tradition is a long-ago era when buff, male and mostly white combat Marines launched amphibious early-morning assaults on enemy beaches armed with M1 rifles and Ka-Bar knives. Today\u2019s far less homogeneous troops roll into battle in armored Humvees or tanks, with sophisticated high-powered weaponry and thermal-imaging goggles. Many never leave their base at all, waging war remotely while operating a joystick or writing code. In many ways, the Marines have become indistinguishable from the Army.Adapting to these harsh truths hasn\u2019t been easy for the corps, whose current and former officials, with some exceptions, were reluctant to speak openly about these challenges except on condition of anonymity. \u2018\u2018The Marines have a purpose, and it\u2019s a militant purpose,\u2019\u2019 one senior officer says. \u2018\u2018We are an organization grounded on the physical, but wars are not as physical anymore. The character of war has evolved a lot from the early 20th century. The question is: Has our force evolved? I don\u2019t think it has.\u2019\u2019Once inside the doors, the mystical journey from civilian to Marine known as the Transformation begins. It\u2019s pandemonium. Drill instructors scream from every direction as the kids, scrambling to individual metal desks, are ordered to fill out administrative paperwork, signaling their completion by raising their right hand, with pen, above their heads. From there it\u2019s on to the phone bank, where, with instructors bawling at them to finish, recruits are told to make three- or four-second calls home, reading as fast as they can from a five-line script taped to the phone box:The rest of the intake process, known as \u2018\u2018receiving,\u2019\u2019 follows over the next few days: buzz cuts, boots, uniforms, shots. They are given physical-fitness tests, fed what most describe as truly awful food and ordered to perform seemingly meaningless tasks, like standing at attention while holding their heavy gear in front of them until their arms give out, or sitting cross-legged and motionless on the floor for hours. Some Marines I interviewed recalled being kept awake for nearly two days after arriving. \u2018\u2018All you can think about is sleep,\u2019\u2019 one said. \u2018\u2018Those are the main tools: fear and sleep deprivation.\u2019\u2019Drill instructors, or D.I.s, are revered on Parris Island, where they roam the base with a special aura. \u2018\u2018Nobody will counter them,\u2019\u2019 one senior Marine official told me. \u2018\u2018Without them, there is no Parris Island.\u2019\u2019 Some D.I.s are not much older than the recruits. Only a small fraction have been to war. Almost all adopt the mien of an infantry grunt, though in truth, most D.I.s, like most Marines, aren\u2019t combat troops but rather part of the corps\u2019s expanding cast of supporting players: mechanics, air traffic controllers, technicians, clerks. Some Marines I spoke with described boot camp as a performance: The lead actors are the D.I.s, men and women who for the first time in their professional lives are embodying the macho warrior archetype they were taught to venerate as recruits.To qualify for D.I. training, a Marine must have finished at least one term of enlistment and be given a clean psychological bill of health as determined by what the Marine officials insist is rigorous testing aimed at weeding out those Marines suffering from PTSD. They must also complete an 11-week drill-instructor school, where, as one former officer puts it, they are taught to \u2018\u2018mold these guys into killers.\u2019\u2019 D.I. school, by all accounts, is almost as intense as boot camp. This is by design; every moment of a drill instructor\u2019s schedule is tightly scripted and charted on what the corps calls its \u2018\u2018training matrix.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The system is very unforgiving on the D.I.,\u2019\u2019 says Gary Lee, a retired Marine sergeant major who helped design the training program in 1995. \u2018\u2018They never get a break from their responsibilities.\u2019\u2019 During a 12-week training cycle, D.I.s spend almost all their time on their feet. Their voices croak with exhaustion and strain. They barely sleep.The stress of the job, coupled with the near-unbridled power given to drill instructors, creates a dangerous alchemy. This has been particularly true on Parris Island, whose violent \u2018\u2018shadow culture,\u2019\u2019 as it has been described to me, exceeds San Diego\u2019s. Since 2014, there have been 24 official hazing investigations on Parris Island, half of them substantiated. There is a perspective on the base \u2018\u2018that somehow you can make a better Marine by beating the shit out of him,\u2019\u2019 says the retired Marine general Charles Krulak, Brute Krulak\u2019s son. \u2018\u2018I have argued consistently that it\u2019s not true \u2014 you do not make a better Marine by treating them that way; in fact, it\u2019s totally against what we as a Marine Corps stand for. But it\u2019s a mentality that has existed down there for so long.\u2019\u2019In 1995, Charles Krulak became the commandant of the Marine Corps and decided this culture had to change. Krulak and his team came up with what they called the transformation process, which overhauled boot camp to incorporate an agenda based on the Marines\u2019 \u2018\u2018core values\u2019\u2019 \u2014 honor, courage, commitment \u2014 into every aspect of basic training. The goal, Krulak says, was to create \u2018\u2018a smarter, more selfless, more adept and more educated Marine.\u2019\u2019 It channeled the violence of Marine Corps training into specific moments, the most important being the Crucible, a grueling 54-hour physical and psychological endurance test that comes at the end of the training cycle, and was intended as the final and, in Krulak\u2019s mind, only arbiter of whether a recruit is ready to become a Marine.The transformation process managed to curtail hazing for a few years, says Krulak, who retired from the corps in 1999. \u2018\u2018As I recall, the number of courts-martial had a significant decrease during those four or five years when I was commandant. Problem was, after I left we had a changing world. I think in all these years of war, we lost a bit of our focus,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018There are people who think war entitles them to behave any way they want.\u2019\u2019As new waves of recruits passed through Parris Island after Sept. 11, the Marines rushed to meet the demands for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of the reforms Krulak had put in place began to erode. Without the structure to support them, it was easy for some drill instructors to fall back on the violent methods they themselves experienced at boot camp. In 2005, a film crew from a South Carolina TV station inadvertently caught a terrified-looking recruit named Jason Tharp being hit by a drill instructor at the Parris Island pool. The following day, Tharp drowned during water-survival training; his drill instructor was charged with negligent homicide (and later acquitted). In 2011, a Parris Island drill instructor was sent to the brig for more than a year after he was found guilty of ordering one of his recruits to record a video of himself masturbating on the D.I.\u2019s cellphone. The next year, a trainee received second- and third-degree burns to his buttocks requiring skin grafts after his drill instructor ordered him \u2018\u2018to perform unauthorized exercises under an upside-down laundry bin on a floor covered in bleach,\u2019\u2019 according to Marine Corps documents. The D.I. was court-martialed in 2014, having been turned in by his senior D.I., who himself would later be court-martialed for ordering his platoon into the showers and making them run in place, while thickening the air by pouring bleach down the drain. After these stories broke, some Marines recalled the routine nature of such punishments and how infrequently they were ever brought to light. \u2018\u2018Reporting it would have gotten nowhere,\u2019\u2019 a onetime Parris Island recruit, who claimed that he was made to scrub the floors with pure bleach, wrote in a Reddit thread in 2014. \u2018\u2018I saw too much other stuff get swept under the rug.\u2019\u2019In June 2014, Lt. Col. Kate Germano arrived at Parris Island to head up the Fourth Battalion, which trains the corps\u2019s female recruits. She found a culture badly in need of reform. Two of her female drill instructors were facing courts-martial for mistreating recruits and, in one case, abusing other, lower-ranking drill instructors, a phenomenon known as \u2018\u2018hat hazing.\u2019\u2019 Abuses toward the recruits included ethnic slurs, so-called hard corrections like pushing and shoving and refusing to give recruits bathroom breaks. Germano, who spent 2004 and 2005 as an adjutant and Marine Corps legal officer in Iraq, was so alarmed that she decided to give her subordinates a PowerPoint presentation on Abu Ghraib. \u2018\u2018I saw a direct similarity between the culture in both places,\u2019\u2019 she says.Germano believed that much of the failure rested with the depot\u2019s regimental commander, Col. Daniel Haas, who had been at Parris Island since July 2013. (The Marines declined to make Colonel Haas available for a response.) Haas had a remote leadership style \u2014 \u2018\u2018not the type of guy that will care and feed you,\u2019\u2019 one of his other battalion commanders later said \u2014 that clashed with Germano\u2019s more hands-on approach, which included impromptu walk-throughs and counseling her subordinates to demand more of the female recruits to help them compete effectively with their male counterparts. While many of her Marines made changes, others perceived Ger\u00admano as meddlesome.In April 2015, less than a year after coming to Parris Island and 11 months before Raheel\u2019s arrival, Germano received the results of the battalion\u2019s annual Command Climate Survey, in which lower-ranking officers and noncommanding officers evaluate their commanders. In her survey, Germano\u2019s subordinates described her as \u2018\u2018hostile, unprofessional and abusive.\u2019\u2019 Though Germano maintains she was none of those things, the commanding general of Parris Island relieved her of her command following an investigation.Isolated in a remote corner of the depot, the Third had long been a rogue fief on Parris Island, its silent pact with Marine officialdom being that it would create the most disciplined recruits but would do so in its own way. It had operated in this manner for more than 60 years, and even in the era of values-based training, the Third was virtually unchanged.In 1998, a Navy chaplain, Thomas Creely, now retired, came to Parris Island to serve as chaplain for the recruit training regiment and noticed a particularly stark pattern of abuse in the Third. \u2018\u2018For example,\u2019\u2019 he later wrote in a paper presented to the International Society for Military Ethics, \u2018\u2018after lunch recruits were made to drink water until they vomited. Then they were made to do push-ups in their own vomit.\u2019\u2019 Creely worked with the command until 2003 to try to eradicate the problem, but the \u2018\u2018blind loyalty of drill instructors,\u2019\u2019 who remained silent in the face of abuse, stood in the way. \u2018\u2018What you have in the Third Battalion is a cycle of abuse,\u2019\u2019 Creely told me recently. \u2018\u2018And until that cycle is broken, it doesn\u2019t matter how much education you do.\u2019\u2019Lt. Col. Joshua Kissoon, who commanded the Third Battalion while Germano was on the base, was a by-the-book Marine who publicly took a hard stance against hazing. Shortly after assuming command, he instituted a zero-tolerance policy on the touching of recruits by their D.I.s and put his staff on warning: Any violation of the rules would be investigated. Between 2013 and 2015, 221 preliminary hazing investigations were conducted across the depot\u2019s four battalions; 69 of those were from the Third, and more were punished from that battalion than any other. This included three D.I.s who were recommended for courts-martial after an investigation first reported by Wade Livingston at The Beaufort Gazette in February 2015 revealed a \u2018\u2018staggering level of misconduct and recruit abuse,\u2019\u2019 with recruits reporting that they were choked, kicked and punched in the face, and that they had their heads slammed against walls.Some junior officers felt the D.I.s were being punished unfairly, though they themselves were never in the squad bays. (One later said his presence in the barracks \u2018\u2018undermines\u2019\u2019 the drill instructors.) When Colonel Kissoon received the results of his own Command Climate Survey in April 2015, they were not much better than Germano\u2019s. That spring, Kissoon began to take a softer line in some cases, according to Marines in the battalion. On his desktop, his subordinates later said, he kept a redacted copy of the command investigation that led to Germano\u2019s firing. \u2018\u2018This could happen to me,\u2019\u2019 he told colleagues.It was into this environment of \u2018\u2018inconsistent decision making,\u2019\u2019 as some of Kissoon\u2019s officers put it, that a new group of Third Batallion recruits landed in April 2015. Most were straight out of high school. A few had been college students. Two had master\u2019s degrees. Another had been living in his car. All now learned their survival depended on how they handled the cognitive dissonance between what they learned as official Marine Corps policy and how that policy was systematically ignored.Jake Weaver, then 19, a new member of Platoon 3054, Lima Company, recalls that when he met his D.I.s, they gave him and his fellow recruits a choice. \u2018\u2018You want to be trained like Marines, right? Not like crappy \u2018individual\u2019 Marines?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Individualism\u2019\u2019 was a sign of what the D.I.s called \u2018\u2018the new corps,\u2019\u2019 a place where \u2018\u2018everyone can walk through and become a Marine,\u2019\u2019 Weaver recalls, and drill instructors couldn\u2019t get away with what they used to. \u2018\u2018They\u2019d convince us to feel like it was wrong to be trained by the book,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018and if we wanted to be trained right, the old-school way, we had to let them beat us and haze us and not say anything, because that\u2019s how you become a Marine.\u2019\u2019Weaver, who grew up in rural Interlachen, Fla., was the grandson of a Marine who fought in the Korean War. His senior drill instructor was a squarely built Marine who told his recruits he\u2019d served in Iraq. He also claimed he was involved in a friendly-fire incident in which 10 Marine infantrymen were killed, though most officials I spoke with say the story is doubtful. (\u2018\u2018There wasn\u2019t an incident in that whole war where you had 10 or 12 people killed in one swoop,\u2019\u2019 Krulak told me.) As Weaver saw it, his D.I. behaved like a person with PTSD. \u2018\u2018He lost his temper like crazy. Some days he\u2019d be supermotivating toward us,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018and then an hour later we\u2019d be almost done for the day, and he\u2019d walk in the squad bay and just flip out.\u2019\u2019During the day, platoons were put through the standard exhaustive physical and tactical training, interspersed with classes or informal discussions on moral courage in battle. But the real making of Marines went on at night. When darkness fell, a D.I. would sometimes dump a bottle of Gain detergent on the floor and order recruits, both hands on their wooden scrub or \u2018\u2018scuzz\u2019\u2019 brushes, to run across the length of the squad bay in a bear-crawl position, an exercise that they timed and called the Indy 500. Other nights, the drill instructors would create what they called a \u2018\u2018hurricane\u2019\u2019 by dumping everyone\u2019s things on the floor, sometimes covered with detergent, sunscreen or shaving cream. Over the months, recruits in the battalion lost consciousness, were revived and never told a soul. A few developed life-threatening rhabdomyolysis, a rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, often caused by overexertion.Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix was one of Lima Company\u2019s most aggressive D.I.s. Recruits knew to be scared of Felix, even those like Weaver who weren\u2019t in his platoon. \u2018\u2018He was pretty frickin\u2019 psycho,\u2019\u2019 one Marine recalls. Felix, a swaggering man with a shaved head, enlisted in 2002 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, working as a crew chief maintaining aircraft and their weapons systems. He talked about his resentment toward Muslims, whom he blamed for killing some of his friends in the war. (Felix\u2019s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.) Ameer Bourmeche, a Muslim recruit from Brooklyn and Weaver\u2019s platoonmate, soon became Felix\u2019s target. \u2018\u2018I remember him calling Bourmeche a \u2018terrorist,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 recalls the recruit in Platoon 3054, who asked not to be identified. \u2018\u2018He used to mess with him: \u2018Where are the W.M.D.s?\u2019 \u2018Were you part of 9/11?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Though Bourmeche, who declined to comment for this article, never talked about his faith to anyone\u2019s recollection, the platoon was made aware of it during their first week of training, when one of their drill instructors polled the group on their religions. Weaver thought it was strange: \u2018\u2018He was giving us this talk about how we\u2019re all brothers in the Marine Corps, and how we\u2019re all in this together, no matter what race or religion we are. Then he was asking us: \u2018What religions do we have here? I\u2019m sure we have Christians. I\u2019m sure we have an atheist. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a Baptist.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 He looked at Bourmeche. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s your religion?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Islam, sir,\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche replied.The sergeant seemed intrigued. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with recruit Bourmeche being a Muslim,\u2019\u2019 he said.Less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the Marine Corps is Muslim. Across the entire United States military, there are fewer than 6,000 self-reported Muslim active-duty and reserve troops, or about 0.27 percent out of a total force of 2.2 million. Many of the recruits had never met a Muslim in their lives. \u2018\u2018I was pretty narrow-minded when I came in,\u2019\u2019 one of Bourmeche\u2019s platoonmates admits. \u2018\u2018I was like: \u2018Why is he here?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Bourmeche seemed to be singled out nearly every day for punishment. \u2018\u2018He was one of the smartest kids in the platoon, scored really high on all his tests, but they just messed with him,\u2019\u2019 Weaver says. He remembers Bourmeche twice being sent to the medical unit after punitive intensive training sessions intended, his friends figured, to force him to drop out. He refused. In early July, Platoon 3054 took part in their final, 54-hour test, the Crucible, grinding through 90-degree heat. Each recruit finished the course and earned the precious eagle, globe and anchor pins and the title \u2018\u2018Marine.\u2019\u2019On July 14, 2015, Felix and several other D.I.s entered the squad bay in the middle of the night. It appeared they\u2019d been drinking in the small office, or \u2018\u2018D.I. hut,\u2019\u2019 at the far end of the barracks, where drill instructors on night duty sometimes slept. Felix was so drunk \u2018\u2018he might not have known what he did the next day,\u2019\u2019 according to one member of Platoon 3054.\u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the terrorist?\u2019\u2019 Felix said. He ap\u200bproached Bourmeche\u2019s rack. \u2018\u2018You a terrorist?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018No, sir!\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You a Muslim?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, sir!\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Attention!\u2019\u2019Bourmeche jumped down.\u2018\u2018Column left!\u2019\u2019 Felix and another D.I. marched him into the shower room, where, as Bourmeche would later tell investigators, the drill instructors turned on the water and made him do push-ups, high-knees and crunches. Then, when he was thoroughly wet, they marched him into the laundry room.\u2018\u2018Get in the dryer.\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche folded his six-foot, 157-pound frame into the Speed Queen. Felix said that the Marine Corps has \u2018\u2018a way of weeding out spies.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to find out who you really are.\u2019\u2019 Then he closed the door.\u2018\u2018Who are you working for?\u2019\u2019 Felix called.\u2018\u2018Nobody, sir!\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche answered.Felix ran the dryer for half a minute and opened it.\u2018\u2018What\u2019s your religion?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Islam, sir!\u2019\u2019In the squad bay, Weaver and the others, ordered out of their beds, were pushing a recruit around like a scuzz brush. They heard Bourmeche\u2019s body thud as it hit the bottom of the dryer. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re going to kill us the first chance you get, aren\u2019t you, terrorist? What are your plans?\u2019\u2019Inside the dryer, Bourmeche began to cry. His neck and shoulder were burned.Felix opened the door. \u2018\u2018Are you still a Muslim?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, sir!\u2019\u2019A half an hour later, it was over. Bourmeche, damp and shaken, was told to go back to the squad bay. As he was standing by his bed, a D.I. approached him. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s pretty effed-up what they did to you back there,\u2019\u2019 he said. Bourmeche agreed. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to tell a senior drill instructor about this, though, right?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018No, sir,\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche answered.The next night, it happened again. Felix told Bourmeche to hand him his martial-arts belt. He tied Bourmeche\u2019s shoelaces together, then took the belt, wrapped it around Bourmeche\u2019s neck, strung it under his laces and tightened it so Bourmeche bent at the waist. \u2018\u2018Are you a terrorist?\u2019\u2019 Felix held the end of the belt like a leash. He began to walk him like a dog. \u2018\u2018Are you a spy?\u2019\u2019Bourmeche, in pain, began screaming. \u2018\u2018No, sir!\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yell \u2018Allah akbar.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Allah akbar!\u2019\u2019While the rest of the platoon looked on, Felix crushed the platoon\u2019s flagpole into Bourmeche\u2019s toes. Then he handed him a scuzz brush. \u2018\u2018Cut off his head,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to another new Marine. \u2018\u2018Show us you\u2019re a terrorist.\u2019\u2019Bourmeche struck his platoonmate in the neck with the brush several times. Felix seemed pleased. \u2018\u2018This is how the Taliban would do it,\u2019\u2019 he told the platoon. \u2018\u2018And he\u2019d cut your head off just as quick as his brethren.\u2019\u2019Another D.I. shook his head. \u2018\u2018We let a full-blood terrorist join the corps,\u2019\u2019 he said. Afterward, no one said a word. What happens on Parris Island stays on Parris Island \u2014 that had been the message all through boot camp.Weaver, one of the platoon\u2019s highest-performing recruits, was shaken. During a family picnic just before his graduation, he told his parents that \u2018\u2018crazy stuff\u2019\u2019 happened during training. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t talk about it here,\u2019\u2019 he said nervously. \u2018\u2018After we get off the island, we can talk about it.\u2019\u2019Over the next few months, Weaver tried to push what he experienced to the back of his mind, but it was always there. He had believed the Marines was an ethical organization. Then a D.I. bashed his head against a wall for seemingly no reason. And another, after asking if he was a devout Christian, taunted him: \u2018\u2018Say \u2018goddamn.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 That fall, Weaver, then in his last phase of training in Pensacola, Fla., suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized with suicidal thoughts.Having lost his desire to serve, he received word he was being given an \u2018\u2018other-than-honorable discharge\u2019\u2019 from the Marines. His father, Troy, decided to phone his commanding officer and tell her what he knew. \u2018\u2018The fact is, the abuse would have never been reported had I not stood up and said, \u2018Look, you\u2019re not going to give him a bad discharge because of what he went through at Parris Island,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Troy told me. \u2018\u2018Those kids weren\u2019t talking.\u2019\u2019 (Weaver was given an other-than-honorable discharge, which he continues to contest.)On Nov. 5, 2015, Marine officials on Parris Island began an investigation into allegations of abuse based on statements Weaver, Bourmeche and another former recruit from Platoon 3054 had given their commanding officer. Weaver claims the investigators spent only 10 minutes talking to him. Kissoon, through his lawyer, maintains that during this period, Col. Paul Cucinotta, who had replaced Haas as regimental commander in the summer of 2015, refused to brief him on the inquiry as it was unfolding. Internal Marine reports later described the investigation as \u2018\u2018suboptimal.\u2019\u2019When the investigators submitted their findings to Cucinotta in January 2016, the training regiment\u2019s executive officer, Lt. Col. Christopher Lynch, found the evidence persuasive enough to recommend that those involved be \u2018\u2018sat down\u2019\u2019 or suspended from their duties. Cucinotta later claimed he agreed. (\u2018\u2018We disagree with Colonel Cucinotta\u2019s testimony,\u2019\u2019 says Kissoon\u2019s attorney, Colby Volkey.) As of February, however, none of those implicated in the investigation had been suspended. Four months after the hazing reports, Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix returned to the Third Battalion and assumed the title of senior drill instructor, this time for Platoon 3042, Kilo Company.As the recruits sat crossed-legged, Sergeant Felix stepped forward. \u2018\u2018I am your senior drill instructor,\u2019\u2019 he said with the signature barking cadence D.I.s use to exert their authority, and then began his scripted pledge. He promised to treat them with \u2018\u2018firmness, fairness, dignity and compassion,\u2019\u2019 and informed them that abuse would not be tolerated.There wasn\u2019t anything particularly unusual about that first day. The new recruits were ordered to perform hundreds of burpees. They were told to dangle their rifles off the ends of their pinkies. They were \u2018\u2018dog-piled\u2019\u2019 into a corner and then ordered to run back and forth, over and over. One of Raheel\u2019s platoonmates, who shared with me his detailed recollections on the condition of anonymity, thought he was going to pass out. \u2018\u2018And I was in pretty good shape,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I remember one kid had a panic attack and started throwing up, and I think he peed himself, too.\u2019\u2019 The officers stood in the back of the squad bay, he says. When they left, \u2018\u2018that\u2019s when the real hell started.\u2019\u2019On the morning of March 13, less than 24 hours after being picked up by his platoon, Raheel announced to his D.I.s that he\u2019d rather die than continue training. He would jump out the squad-bay window if he had to.When a recruit threatens suicide, everything stops. At first the D.I.s tried to reason with Raheel: What would his mother think were he to come home without becoming a Marine? \u2018\u2018I\u2019d tell my mother goodbye and kill myself,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The future does not matter.\u2019\u2019 The Marines took Raheel\u2019s belt and boot laces to prevent him from strangling himself.Suicide threats are common during the early weeks of boot camp, though how many are serious is unclear. \u2018\u2018Everyone knows saying you\u2019re suicidal is a ticket off Parris Island,\u2019\u2019 Raheel\u2019s platoonmate says. Sickness or broken bones, on the other hand, will get a recruit a long stint in medical, after which they will simply be assigned to another company and start training all over again.Base officials determined Raheel didn\u2019t qualify for emergency transport to the hospital. Instead, he was \u2018\u2018cross-decked\u2019\u2019: They moved him, still without laces or a belt, to another platoon\u2019s squad bay. Over the next 24 hours, he sat there cross-legged on a mattress in the middle of the room while a \u2018\u2018shadow watch\u2019\u2019 of recruits shined a flashlight on his face and took turns monitoring him around the clock. At some point during this period, Raheel, who had to request permission to leave the mattress to use the bathroom, recanted his suicide threat and said he\u2019d decided he wanted to be a Marine.The next morning, Felix escorted Raheel to recruit liaison services, an office set up to ascertain if recruits had enlisted fraudulently (such as by failing to disclose a history of suicidal ideation), and to motivate struggling recruits to return to training. Drill instructors who accompany recruits to these sessions usually sit in a waiting area, but Felix \u2018\u2018stood about 10 feet away,\u2019\u2019 according to the report, while Raheel provided what was referred to as a \u2018\u2018voluntary statement\u2019\u2019 retracting his threat. \u2018\u2018This recruit thought it was the only way to quit,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018This recruit never meant that and regrets it.\u2019\u2019 The base\u2019s mental-health unit deemed him to be at a \u2018\u2018low risk for harm,\u2019\u2019 and Raheel went back to training.It would be noted later, in the Marines\u2019 report, that Raheel, shortly after saying he wanted to kill himself, confided to the military police who were going to escort him to the hospital that he \u2018\u2018could not handle\u2019\u2019 being hit by his drill instructors. The allegation was noted and disregarded several times by what appeared to be several officials.In reviewing the incidents of that week, the Marines made no mention of the four days after Raheel resumed training. His platoonmate, though, recalls them as torture. As one report noted, Platoon 3042\u2019s senior drill instructor \u2018\u2018taught his subordinate drill instructors that in order to be successful at training recruits, they needed to \u2018hate recruits.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 They were called \u2018\u2018bitches,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018faggots,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018maggots,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018little bitches,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018pussies\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018retards.\u2019\u2019 A Russian-born recruit was called \u2018\u2018the Russian,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018the cosmonaut,\u2019\u2019 and was asked if he was a Russian spy. Raheel was called a terrorist. Felix asked on one occasion if he needed his turban.Raheel\u2019s platoonmate didn\u2019t understand why Raheel had joined the Marines. Orders seemed to confound him. Rather than simply following them, he thought about what he was asked. \u2018\u2018Like a normal person,\u2019\u2019 the platoonmate says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not necessarily wrong, but it\u2019s not how they wanted it. It wasn\u2019t the Marine way of doing things.\u2019\u2019 This earned Raheel, who always \u2018\u2018looked like a scared animal,\u2019\u2019 as his platoonmate says, undue attention from the D.I.s. \u2018\u2018Anything that\u2019s not masculine \u2014 if you\u2019re not six feet tall and built like a football player \u2014 that\u2019s not what they want. They want people who are the definition of Marines. Anyone else, you have to prove yourself.\u2019\u2019Once, the platoonmate recalls, Felix stuffed a recruit in a footlocker. Another time, he made a recruit eat nothing but Jell-O and mashed potatoes for a few days, and threatened that if he didn\u2019t improve, he\u2019d have to stuff him in a locker, too. Choking recruits until they were gasping for air was common. Some of the D.I.s, the platoonmate suspected, were almost as terrified of their senior D.I. as the recruits were. One drill instructor, he recalled, became so ill that he projectile-vomited all over the squad bay while simultaneously yelling at the recruits after he himself had been screamed at by Felix moments before. \u2018\u2018We never knew if it was blood or Gatorade, but he\u2019s vomiting this red stuff while screaming, and we were like, What is going on?\u2019\u2019On March 17, Platoon 3042 received instruction on Marine Corps mixed-martial-arts punching techniques. According to the Marines\u2019 report, recruits in Lima Company were instructed to throw a \u2018\u2018flurry of punches\u2019\u2019 as hard as they could, and not to listen to their instructors\u2019 directions but instead \u2018\u2018just to keep punching.\u2019\u2019 It was routine, recruits later said, for their drill instructors to pair bigger or stronger recruits against the weaker or poorly performing recruits. During the March 17 drill, recruits were punched repeatedly in unprotected parts of their body, including their jaws. One sustained two broken ribs. The abuse, according to the report, caused one recruit \u2018\u2018to cry during the event.\u2019\u2019 The platoonmate believed one of the targeted recruits was Raheel, but he can\u2019t be sure. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really all a blur,\u2019\u2019 he says. It was only Day 4. Many recruits didn\u2019t even know one another\u2019s names. Terror caused them to avoid making eye contact. \u2018\u2018Lots of stuff happened while we slept,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Or in the dark.\u2019\u2019At around 2 a.m. on March 18, Raheel woke up his bunkmate. He was in pain, he said. We\u2019re all in pain, the other recruit told him. Two hours later, the recruits awoke and prepared to sound off before leaving for chow. Raheel pointed to his throat and silently mouthed words. When two D.I.s started yelling at him, Raheel handed one of them a note. \u2018\u2018This recruit has to go to medical. This recruit\u2019s throat has been swollen for three days and is getting worse,\u2019\u2019 it said. \u2018\u2018This recruit also coughed blood a few times last night. And this recruit completely lost his voice and can barely whisper. This recruit\u2019s whole neck is in a lot of pain.\u2019\u2019A D.I. told Raheel they would deal with the matter after breakfast. He sat silently through the meal, zombielike. Upon returning to the barracks, the platoon set about cleaning, and Raheel was called to the front of the squad bay. He was supposed to fill out a form so he could go to the medical unit. He stood before Felix but failed to greet him properly, perhaps because he couldn\u2019t speak. His silence seemed to enrage the senior drill instructor. \u2018\u2018Get back!\u2019\u2019 he shouted. Raheel ran 144 feet across the squad bay from one end to the other. \u2018\u2018Siddiqui, run!\u2019\u2019 Felix continued. \u2018\u2018Get back! Run!\u2019\u2019His platoonmate, who had been quietly making his bed and trying to stay out of the D.I.s\u2019 line of sight, watched Raheel running back and forth. Suddenly Raheel grabbed his throat, crying, and fell to the floor. Some recruits thought he was faking. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know if he did it willingly, I don\u2019t know if he was just exhausted, but he dropped,\u2019\u2019 the platoonmate says.\u2018\u2018Get up, Siddiqui!\u2019\u2019 Felix shouted. \u2018\u2018I know you\u2019re faking. Get up!\u2019\u2019At this point, reports differ. Raheel appeared to be unconscious. A D.I. claimed he rubbed his knuckles across Raheel\u2019s sternum to revive him. Other recruits and drill instructors say that never happened. The platoonmate I interviewed recalls seeing Raheel, on the floor, clutching his throat. Leaning over, Felix slapped him across the face. Five feet away, Raheel\u2019s platoonmate thought at first the D.I. was \u2018\u2018acting like an emergency responder,\u2019\u2019 trying to revive him. But then he slapped him again, so hard that the sound echoed across the squad bay.\u2018\u2018And Siddiqui gets up, and he starts dead sprinting, which I thought was a logical thing to do: This is boot camp, he\u2019s running away,\u2019\u2019 his platoonmate says. But he was running too fast. \u2018\u2018He is literally sprinting the fastest I\u2019d ever seen anyone sprint,\u2019\u2019 he says. Slowly it dawned on him what Raheel was about to do. \u2018\u2018We were all still cleaning, kind of dispersed around the squad bay.\u2019\u2019 The doors, he recalls, were open. \u2018\u2018And he straight-up jumped.\u2019\u2019An air ambulance was requested to take Raheel to a hospital in Savannah, Ga., 40 miles away, but the request was denied because of heavy fog. A second air lift was scuttled, and so Marines drove him to Beaufort Memorial Hospital, where after an hour of sustained effort in the emergency room, doctors decided Raheel needed higher-level care. Three hours after his fall, he arrived at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. It was too late: At 10:06, after more than an hour of attempts to save his life, Raheel was pronounced dead.The following day, an autopsy was performed at the hospital. The medical examiner concluded that Raheel died of blunt-force trauma sustained during his fall. But the autopsy report, details of which were shown to me by the Siddiqui family, also found evidence of petechial hemorrhaging, which can be caused by anything from heavy coughing to vomiting or asphyxiation and strangulation. Several days later, J. Edward Allen, the Beaufort County coroner, wrote a final autopsy report concluding that \u2018\u2018in light of the history provided and the autopsy findings,\u2019\u2019 Raheel had committed suicide.A week after Raheel died, his body was sent back to his parents in Michigan. At the funeral home, the family stared down in horror at their son. His arms, chest, stomach and legs were purple. There were ligature marks, not unlike the ridges of a webbed military belt, around his neck, which had not been mentioned in the autopsy report. To Ghazala it looked as if her son had been tortured.In Beaufort, a city with three military installations that collectively pump over $1.5 billion into the local economy, the news that a Marine recruit had died on Parris Island was met with studied silence. \u2018\u2018Marine Corps boot camp isn\u2019t the Boy Scouts,\u2019\u2019 one reader posted on the Facebook page of The Beaufort Gazette, which broke the story on March 20. \u2018\u2018Stay home if you can\u2019t handle some hazing.\u2019\u2019 Hazing had not been mentioned publicly at this point, but in Detroit, the Siddiquis\u2019 Democratic congresswoman, Representative Debbie Dingell, heard through an anonymous tip that religious bias might have played a role in Raheel\u2019s death. In April, Dingell wrote to the Marine commandant, Gen. Robert Neller, asking that an \u2018\u2018unbiased inquiry\u2019\u2019 be made into the matter. Dingell recently told me that soon after she wrote the letter, she received anonymous calls telling her to stay out of Marine business. \u2018\u2018Some of my own colleagues warned me, \u2018You don\u2019t want to challenge the Marines on their training methods,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 she said.The official investigation into the death of Raheel Siddiqui lasted over a year and spawned two other investigations: a more thorough examination of the hazing allegations in the Bourmeche case and a broader hazing inquiry requested in spring 2016 by the Obama White House, after the president received an anonymous email from unnamed \u2018\u2018concerned loved ones of innocent recruits\u2019\u2019 claiming their children were being abused.On Sept. 8, 2016, the Marine Corps released the findings of these investigations. That same day, the corps announced that 20 Marines \u2014 including, it was later revealed, three teams of drill instructors, several junior officers, Kissoon and the depot\u2019s new regimental commander, Col. Paul Cucinotta \u2014 had been relieved of duty and faced punishment pending the results of further investigation. (In early June, Kissoon appeared before the military\u2019s version of a grand jury, and he is still awaiting charges. Six Marines, representing much of the chain of command, were granted immunity or other considerations to testify against him, according to Kissoon\u2019s lawyer.) The reports were heavily redacted; in the 132-page command inquiry into Raheel\u2019s death, the last 43 pages were entirely blacked out.Of those involved in the three investigations, just six Marines have been formally charged with wrongdoing. Four Marines \u2014 one of whom was acquitted at trial, another who pleaded guilty, a third who made \u2018\u2018a pretrial agreement with prosecutors,\u2019\u2019 according to a Marine spokesman, and a fourth who faces a general court-martial \u2014 had charges levied against them for abuse-related incidents elsewhere in Lima Company. Felix and another drill instructor, Staff Sgt. Michael Eldridge, were charged with a range of offenses including cruelty and maltreatment, drunk and disorderly conduct and failure to obey a general order. In Felix\u2019s case, the charges also included obstruction of justice stemming from the dryer incident involving Bourmeche and the hazing of Raheel. Both face general courts-martial later this summer.A number of former and current Marine officials, including several high-ranking officers, say they are agonized by the reports. \u2018\u2018What I\u2019m hearing makes my stomach turn,\u2019\u2019 the senior officer I spoke to says. \u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t rocket science. We have procedures and policies and rules on the books against this stuff, and people have to enforce them. I mean, who is in charge? If you are having a hard time controlling those drill instructors, you\u2019re not a leader.\u2019\u2019Though it would be tempting to blame the allegations of abuse on a few Marines \u2014 the \u2018\u2018few bad apples\u2019\u2019 theory \u2014 Raheel\u2019s platoonmate told me that rough practices in his platoon continued long after Felix and his drill instructor team were replaced, the very next day, with another team, and after that team was later replaced with another. The message, he says, was \u2018\u2018the D.I.s could pretty much get away with anything. Let\u2019s say you did report something. They\u2019d change the D.I., and what happens after that? Another D.I. who presumably was friends with the prior D.I. is going to make your life hell.\u2019\u2019On Aug. 7, nearly a year and a half to the day that Raheel Siddiqui arrived on Parris Island, Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix will stand trial, a proceeding expected to last at least two weeks. The charges against him are technically violations of military discipline; he has not faced broader criminal charges like assault. The Siddiqui family thinks the charges are insufficient. \u2018\u2018We were advised that an assault charge was not brought because the [other charges] carried a harsher penalty,\u2019\u2019 says Shiraz Khan, the family\u2019s lawyer. \u2018\u2018Well, the elements of assault are much different, and so are the implications. The systemic hazing, abuse and maltreatment suffered by Raheel Siddiqui while at Parris Island was not the result of a single incident by one individual. We aren\u2019t blind to what Raheel\u2019s body and autopsy say.\u2019\u2019When I visited the Siddiquis\u2019 small apartment late last fall, Ghazala, wearing jeans and a sparkly blue hijab, showed me photographs she took of her son\u2019s body at the funeral home. \u2018\u2018Why would they do this to my son?\u2019\u2019 she said, distraught, pausing over a photograph of Raheel\u2019s neck. Taking me upstairs, she led me into his room, which was spotless, almost antiseptic, a shrine to a sometimes mischievous yet fundamentally obedient boy who prayed at least four times a day, dressed in colorful shirts and smiled so much and so often that those who knew him could never imagine him being depressed. Ghazala showed off Raheel\u2019s academic awards and his orange Home Depot apron inscribed with good-luck messages written by every one of his colleagues. The dress-blue uniform he would have worn upon graduating boot camp hung in his closet, neatly pressed. The Marines had dressed Raheel\u2019s body in it. \u2018\u2018He was brainwashed,\u2019\u2019 Ghazala said, wiping away a tear. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s smart, intelligent, beautiful, excellent boy. Perfect. I am so proud of my son.\u2019\u2019 Ghazala spoke of him in the present tense.No one from the family has agreed to be interviewed since last winter. \u2018\u2018Their son is gone, there are no answers and they\u2019re suffering,\u2019\u2019 says Khan, who told me that his office has received only 20 or so of about 220 pages they\u2019ve requested from the investigation, and have had very little direct discussion with the Marines. For the most part, he says, they have learned about any progress in the case by reading the newspapers.Kate Germano, who retired from the Marines in 2016, isn\u2019t surprised. \u2018\u2018The last thing the Marines would want is anyone connecting the dots,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently. \u2018\u2018This is a cultural issue. The conduct that is considered acceptable at Parris Island, from the failures in leadership to the hands-on methods the drill instructors use, would not be acceptable anywhere else in the Marine Corps. But down there, for whatever reason, it\u2019s considered a badge of honor. Those who don\u2019t see it that way are considered weak. But it\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault.\u2019\u2019The island\u2019s new commanding general, Austin Renforth, known as Sparky, who took control several months after Raheel\u2019s death, insists they are rooting out the problem. Under his watch, officers play a more active role in supervising drill instructors, something many officials believe is essential to reforming the culture. Renforth, though, insists the problems on Parris Island aren\u2019t cultural. \u2018\u2018This place is such a fishbowl \u2014 when someone does something wrong it gets national attention, but it\u2019s not systemic,\u2019\u2019 he says. That said, he allowed, \u2018\u2018I have to make sure it never happens again.\u2019\u2019 Renforth doesn\u2019t explain how he plans to do this, other than to say he wants everyone involved in making Marines to have \u2018\u2018buy-in,\u2019\u2019 as he puts it.Renforth is the epitome of a combat Marine: graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, commander during the first gulf war and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, son of a World War II veteran who himself went through boot camp on Parris Island in 1941. This is his first training command, and he says he was surprised that many of his D.I.s were not combat vets. A year ago, in the very beginning of his tenure, Renforth, who has five children, considered reaching out to Ghazala and Massood. He changed his mind. \u2018\u2018I just didn\u2019t feel it was my place,\u2019\u2019 he says.Tragedies happen. But a vast majority of recruits, he says, make it through boot camp just fine. \u2018\u2018We want them all to transform,\u2019\u2019 Renforth says. \u2018\u2018If they show up with a little \u2018want to\u2019 in their hearts, they\u2019ll make it.\u2019\u2019 Renforth has no plans to change the fundamentals of training. \u2018\u2018I believe in the way we make Marines, and I believe in the product,\u2019\u2019 he says. In the end, it\u2019s about instilling \u2018\u2018core values.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We get kids from all over the nation, and we try to fill them up with values,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It changes their lives.\u2019\u2019An article on July 9 about Marine recruits at Parris Island misspelled the name of the town where Jake Weaver, a former Marine, grew up. It is Interlachen, Fla., not Interlaken. The article also misidentified the rank of Victor Krulak. He was a lieutenant general at the time of his retirement in 1968, not a brigadier general.An article on July 9 about Marine recruits at Parris Island referred incorrectly to the tenures of Col. Daniel Haas and Lt. Col. Kate Germano. Haas had been there about a year \u2014 not several years \u2014 before Germano arrived in 2014, and Haas left in the summer of 2015, not the fall. And it was the commanding general of the depot \u2014 not Haas \u2014 who relieved Germano of her command.Janet Reitman is an investigative journalist and contributing editor at Rolling Stone, where she covers politics and national security.Advertisement"}

A month into their relationship, she invited him to her house to watch a movie. The baby woke up, crying to be fed, and it was Mr. Dulaney\u2019s willingness to help that captured her heart. \u201cHe saw me struggling to hold my son and fix the bottle, so he made the bottle for me,\u201d Ms. Dulaney said. \u201cWe were in our early 20s, and that simple gesture sealed the deal for me.\u201d Sixteen years later, they are now a family of four.Sara Dulaney and Brian Dulaney, Germantown, Md.Claire Grantham was taken aback when she saw Sam Grantham, her boyfriend at the time, dancing. \u201cAs I saw him dancing and mouthing the words to \u2018I Know You, I Live You\u2019 by Chaka Khan, I knew it was love,\u201d Ms. Grantham said. \u201cNo other guy I had ever dated had ever been confident enough to get up and dance alone.

{"Headline": "Through the Outback", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "It has been mythologized in poetry and song, made horrific in films like \u201cWake in Fright,\u201d and infused into Australia\u2019s history and psyche. Yet few Australians, including myself, have fully explored its realities.I grew up in what we call regional Australia \u2014 the small cities outside the major capitals \u2014 but my mum was from Yeoval, a farming village that was also the childhood home of Banjo Paterson, the Australian poet who romanticized bush life. Until my grandfather died, a slide carousel was a staple of family Christmases: the photographs of Nan, Pop and their five daughters dressed in white English pomp for a country show or the horse races were my own iconic images of this mysterious land.I spent most of the last dozen years away from Australia, making photographs of other people\u2019s mythical and mysterious places: Afghanistan and Iraq, Greece and Ireland, India and the Middle East. In December, I turned my eye on remote regions much closer to home.Mine was a journey of more than 19,000 kilometers (12,000 miles), crisscrossing desert, mines, wheat belts and cattle stations. The path was dotted with roadkill, mainly kangaroos: I hit seven myself, killing five.One night in Queensland, two greys hopped onto the road and one stopped and stood upright; I could neither stop nor swerve, only watch it explode on impact into a pink mist. Another time, in the Northern Territory, wedge-tailed eagles dived between the sporadic cars and trucks to feed on rotting animal carcasses.DarwinPormpuraawCairnsTennant CreekMcKinlaySelwynSolomon HubAlice SpringsMarchmont StationIslay PlainsWarakurna CommunityAUSTRALIATamboWilunaBrisbaneCoober PedyTibooburraBourkePacksaddleKalgoorlieWilcanniaPlumbago StationPerthCassilisCopi Hollow YeovalAdelaideSydneyHayCarwoolaTooleybucHarrowMelbourneBallaratHobartDarwinPormpuraawCairnsTennant CreekMcKinlaySelwynSolomon HubAlice SpringsMarchmont StationIslay PlainsWarakurna CommunityAUSTRALIAWilunaTamboBrisbaneCoober PedyTibooburraBourkePacksaddleKalgoorlieWilcanniaPlumbago StationPerthCassilisCopi HollowYeovalAdelaideSydneyHayTooleybucHarrowCarwoolaMelbourneBallaratHobartDarwinPormpuraawCairnsTennant CreekMcKinlaySelwynAlice SpringsIslay PlainsWarakurna CommunityTamboWilunaAUSTRALIABrisbaneCoober PedyBourkePacksaddleKalgoorliePerthWilcanniaCopi HollowHayTooleybucSydneyHarrowBallaratHobartThe outback of Australia\u2019s post-colonial imagination \u2014 or at least the version of my suburban, 1980s childhood imagination \u2014 involves an explorer confronting an untamed land, trying to forge a country through hard work and freedom; its archetypes include drover, stockman, Aboriginal tracker, gold miner, shearer, landlord and outlaw.The population of the area has been dropping for decades, especially as a proportion of growing Australia. At the same time, Aboriginal Australians are a growing presence, a majority in many small towns losing white residents to bigger cities: They are 3 percent of Australia\u2019s people, but a quarter of those in remote areas.One clich\u00e9 that rang true on my travels was genuine country hospitality. I started out trying to set up subjects ahead of time, but found it difficult to predict which events or personalities would yield the best stories. So I abandoned plans in favor of walking into a country pub and seeing who wanted to chat at the bar.Isla Hughes, a young governess, was holding a jug of Midori cocktails on the veranda of the pub in Tibooburra, New South Wales, on New Year\u2019s Day. The night before, I had noticed Michael Koke, 18, in the stock yards at the local rodeo. Theirs were among a series of portraits I made \u2014 using film instead of digital cameras \u2014 throughout my time on the road, a collection of faces, clothing and backdrops that I see as puzzle pieces of the outback I discovered.Word of mouth was my best asset in the bush. One publican introduced me to the owner of a sheep station near Tambo, where I met shearers whom I reconnected with 200 miles away a few weeks later. That same farmer posted on Facebook that I was looking for a cattle muster, which led me to Islay Plains, where I met a family that had turned its farm organic after a drought. When I was vouched for by one person, I was O.K. to another.I found Lynette Warn at the Walkabout Creek Hotel in McKinlay \u2014 the town where the bar scenes for \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d were filmed \u2014 and ended up drunk with her daughter and the daughter\u2019s boyfriend. The next day, they took me to the trailer-home that Lynette and her husband, Adam, live out of as they roam from job site to job site installing fences.Ms. Warn, 45, grew up in the bush \u2014 her parents had a fence-building business, too. They dug holes for the posts with a shovel back then, not a custom hydraulic driver. \u201cAdam can drive 75 posts in a day,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cMy father, if he put 10 posts in a day, he had a bloody good day.\u201dThe nearest supermarket, though, remains a two-and-a-half hour drive away, so Ms. Warn said she went shopping only once every two weeks, adding, \u201cYou have to be organized living out here.\u201d\u201cI like the remoteness,\u201d she added. \u201cI like people, and meeting people, and that sort of thing, but I like to be able to walk away and go back to my own area. I could never live with a neighbor there and a neighbor there \u2014 that just does my head in.\u201dOne morning, Fred Appleton took me up in his helicopter as the day\u2019s first sun splashed across the gum trees of Islay Plains cattle station, which he has owned since 2007. We bounced and weaved, spotting black and brown cows, then swooping down to muster them in a common direction. Young ringers on motorbikes rounded up the stragglers, and four hours later a herd of 800 was ready for counting and branding.I heard many complaints about this method from old-timers like Azzie Zilla Fazulla, 90, a former drover in Tibooburra. \u201cThe young fellas, I don\u2019t know, they are a good mob of blokes, but they are too fast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t push cattle too hard. Some of the old stockmen would turn over in their graves.\u201dMr. Appleton, though, is a man who embraces change. Three years ago, he and his wife, Anna, invested $1.2 million in a long-term water supply and organic processes to insulate their operations against global warming.\u201cDuring the drought in 2012, \u201913, \u201914, the prices were crap, something had to change,\u201d explained Mr. Appleton, who is 40. \u201cWe had heard about organics and I thought it would all be a load of wallop, but we looked into it a bit more. We decided we were basically organic anyway, so we thought: Why not get accredited for it?\u201cAt the time, beef was $3 a kilo on the hook and an organic one was $5.50 a kilo,\u201d he said, citing Australian dollar figures. The difference equated to $500 an animal.Adrian and Julie Brown, farmers at Marchmont Station in Queensland, had practically the reverse experience. The drought led them to sell 1,000 head of cattle and 10,000 head of sheep in 2014 and 2015. The castrated rams, called wethers, brought $46 to $48 each. In 2016, when the rains started, they restocked with 5,500 sheep \u2014 at $90.50.\u201cAnything with four legs is very expensive at the moment, which is good if you have something to sell, but if you\u2019re buying back it\u2019s expensive,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cOnce upon a time in a drought you could just close the doors, the business would stop, you could stop your expenditure. Now rents and rates are really high, they are two of my biggest costs. We are a long way short of recovering from the drought.\u201dThere are 400 mines producing 19 different minerals, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and mining employs 266,000 people, with the nation\u2019s highest average hourly wage ($56.90 in the local currency).One of those people is Tom Schluter, 49, an Australian who moved to Thailand six years ago and now is part of the \u201cfly-in, fly-out\u201d work force, or FIFO for short, that is deeply resented by many of the old-timers I met. He works for two weeks, then is off for one. When he works \u2014 on the road crew at Solomon Hub, the flagship mine of the Fortescue Metals Group, in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia \u2014 it\u2019s more than 80 hours per week.\u201cIt\u2019s more like a lifestyle out here than a job,\u201d Mr. Schluter said.But in Kalgoorlie, one of Australia\u2019s legendary mining towns, I saw the flip side of the FIFO coin. Kenneth Smith, 74, has owned the Grand Hotel since 1983. He told me stories about a pub so packed he needed four barmaids on a shift; there were three drinkers the night I visited. The pub itself looks like a movie set that was abandoned 20 years ago.\u201cWe don\u2019t get workers from the gold mine coming to the pub anymore,\u201d Mr. Smith lamented. \u201cThey fly out and the money leaves the town, or they don\u2019t come because they are too tired from long shifts. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s killing the place.\u201dTimor SeaDarwinGulf of CarpentariaINDIANOCEANNitmilukNational ParkCoral SeaCairnsOperatingminesNORTHERNTERRITORYKarlamilyiNational ParkAlice SpringsQUEENSLANDWESTERNAUSTRALIAUluru-Kata TjutaNational ParkSOUTHAUSTRALIAOpalminesBrisbaneNullarbor PlainPerthNEW SOUTHWALESGreatAustralianBightAdelaideSydneyCanberraMelbourneVICTORIATasman SeaTASMANIAHobartTimor SeaDarwinGulf of CarpentariaINDIANOCEANNitmilukNational ParkCoral SeaOperatingminesCairnsNORTHERNTERRITORYKarlamilyiNational ParkAlice SpringsQUEENSLANDWESTERNAUSTRALIASOUTHAUSTRALIAOpalminesBrisbaneNullarbor PlainPerthNEW SOUTHWALESAdelaideSydneyGreatAustralianBightCanberraMelbourneVICTORIATasman SeaTASMANIAHobartDarwinTimor SeaCoral SeaINDIANOCEANNORTHERNTERRITORYCairnsOperatingminesAlice SpringsQUEENSLANDWESTERNAUSTRALIAOpalminesBrisbaneSOUTHAUSTRALIANEW SOUTHWALESPerthAdelaideSydneyCanberraGreatAustralianBightMelbourneVICTORIATasman SeaTASMANIAHobartDarwinCoral SeaTimor SeaINDIANOCEANCairnsOperatingminesOpalminesBrisbanePerthAdelaideSydneyGreatAustralianBightTASMANIAHobartOpal is Australia\u2019s national gemstone. In Coober Pedy, a town in South Australia where temperatures soar so high people live underground in shallow burrows they call \u201cdugouts,\u201d freelance prospectors stake their claims and dig for opal to sell to tourists or Chinese dealers.\u201cYou can work for three months and not see a chip of opal,\u201d explained Rudi Fletcher, 81, an Austrian who came to Australia at 23 for a working holiday with a mining company and never left. \u201cOpal is where opal wants to be, not where we want it to be.\u201dGeorge Kountouris, 60, is a second-generation Australian whose family is from Sparta, Greece, and a second-generation opal miner. He sleeps at his store to protect his stones, with a 88-pound Doberman named Sir Winston and four security cameras.He remembers when there were \u201cthree or four thousand miners\u201d in the town back in the 1970s, and says \u201cnow there\u2019s probably 10 or 15 at the most.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about your biggest find,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one likes, Australians in general, no one likes a smart arse or a bragger.\u201dWilcannia had the country\u2019s third-highest per-capita crime rate last year: Suicide, alcoholism and unemployment are also all rampant. I remember when I was growing up, people joked that it was a place you should not stop. These were usually white Australians without much direct experience or close interaction with Indigenous Australians. I had never spent much time in Aboriginal communities, either.Now, as a journalist eager to understand all kinds of people, of course I wanted to stop.A pink sunset was fading as I pulled in to find a group of Aboriginal teenagers, some on foot and some on BMX bikes, meandering down a wide empty street. Their dress was American hip-hop, a sign of what Virgean Wilson, a social worker, said was \u201cstrangling our culture.\u201d\u201cI look out the window here and I see our children dressed like the American Negro and using that horrible slang and listening to that mind-boggling music that doesn\u2019t have a meaning to us,\u201d she said.Though many young Indigenous Australians would undoubtedly disagree, Mrs. Wilson connected this trend with the rising suicide rate in the community. \u201cIt takes them down this pathway of more misery,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI hear young people, as young as 7, say, \u2018I am going to kill myself.\u2019\u201dBenita Kennedy\u2019s brother, William Roger Shane Kennedy, hanged himself at their auntie\u2019s house last year. The photo on his funeral program showed a smiling William holding a half-crushed can of Victoria Bitter beer. He was 25.Talking to dozens of Aboriginal Australians during my travels, I kept asking about the source of the deep social problems plaguing their communities. No one had any clear answers, but it felt like their world had just changed too fast: for 40,000 years, their ancestors were hunter-gatherers guided largely by nature\u2019s rhythms; in less than 250 years, they had that land taken and were forced to assimilate into a white man\u2019s world.Daisy Ward, a Ngaanyatjarra elder in Warakurna, Western Australia, embodies the transition. She recalls going into town every two weeks as a child to watch black-and-white Hollywood westerns on a projector \u2014 and walking home into the desert, barefoot. When she was 9, she went on a field trip to Perth, the state capital, and she remembers \u201cgoing to a statue and asking the statue, \u2018Can you give me water, please?\u2019\u201d A friend whispered to her, \u201cYou have to turn the tap on.\u201dWe picked wild tobacco in the hill near where Ms. Ward was born in the bush, and she found a honey ant nest. Digging at the earth with an iron rod, she collected hundreds of ants whose abdomens were translucent sacs of sweet liquid, and we sucked them around a campfire while other elder women cooked kangaroo tails they bought frozen at the community store.\u201cI feel proud to be an elder, to speak out and say what\u2019s good, what\u2019s better for young kids,\u201d said Ms. Ward, who works as a community liaison at a local school. \u201cI\u2019m waiting with my hands out to give helping hands if they need it.\u201d\u201cWelcome to Paradise,\u201d says a rusty sign in Wiluna, a town clear across the country from Wilcania \u2014 more than 1,800 miles, to be exact \u2014 but in a startlingly similar situation. A town once thriving with miners and stockmen, now dilapidated. Many of the white men have moved on with the profits of the land, leaving the traditional owners behind.Several folks I met there described it as the place where, in the 1970s, some of the last desert-dwelling Aboriginal Australians wandered, naked and dusty, spears in hand, into the white man\u2019s industrialized world. Under the awning of the Wiluna Hotel, whose windows were boarded up, I met Jefry Stewart, who told me he was the last surviving child of one of those last desert nomads.Mr. Stewart asked me to buy him some beer, because it was one of the three days each week when Wiluna residents are restricted to buying only midstrength alcohol, but outsiders can still get full strength. I gave him a cigarette instead.Alcoholism and drug abuse \u2014 codeine, fentanyl and illicit drugs like methamphetamine \u2014 are among the scourges that Superintendent Greg Moore is fighting in Bourke, a town with one of the highest crime rates in the country. That includes stock theft, trespassing, cybercrime and domestic violence.\u201cThere\u2019s complex reasons for that,\u201d Superintendent Moore said, referring to his town, whose population is about 40 percent Aboriginal, as \u201cquite an eclectic blend, because we have 22 separate language groups represented.\u201d He said he had tried to learn some of the local tongues.Darren Farmer, 47, speaks three Indigenous languages, and sells sandalwood from the desert for use in perfumes. While we chatted under a tin shelter a mile outside Wiluna, Mr. Farmer attacked the carcass of an emu he had hunted the day before, ripping the flesh off the bone with his teeth.The Aboriginal social structure, community leaders like Mr. Farmer told me, is based on shared possessions, not the competitive capitalism that is the basis of Australia\u2019s economy and culture. He worried that young people were leaving the bush for the city, saying: \u201cIf we give up our land, we give up our identity.\u201dIt was fascinating, throughout my trip, to hear so many different people in so many places reflect on the changes they had seen in their hometowns, their homeland. Like so many others, Barney Davey, 91, lamented that ranchers now use the horsepower of motorbikes to move cattle rather than the power of actual horses.But Mr. Davey, the longtime publican in Tibooburra, where I had spent New Year\u2019s Eve, had a sunny-side-up attitude you had to appreciate. \u201cThey say the good old days, but I like these days too,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe have air-conditioning, microwave ovens, the roads have improved.\u201d\u201cWe get a lot more tourists through, which is good for the town,\u201d Mr. Davey added, and I wondered if that\u2019s how he saw me, though I am as Australian as he is. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see them and say g\u2019day.\u201dA behind-the-scenes look at Adam Ferguson\u2019s three-month, 12,000-mile odyssey across Australia\u2019s vast interior.In this week\u2019s Australia Letter, we visit Lismore, a small town ravaged by a surging river.

{"Headline": "Health Care Compromise: Not Likely!", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe latest version of the Republican health care bill was unveiled today and within moments, two Republican senators announced their opposition. One more \u201cno\u201d and the bill goes down.That may lead to renewed talk of the fanciful notion of a bipartisan compromise between the more moderate elements of each party. Before today\u2019s release, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell even suggested he might reach out to his Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer (who has reciprocated by signaling a willingness to work together.)Yeah, and I\u2019m about to discover oil in my backyard.The chances of Republicans and Democrats finding common ground on almost any issue are small, and on health care they are infinitesimal.For one thing, the two parties have become far more polarized across the spectrum of issues. That\u2019s not just an oft-repeated perception; it\u2019s a fact backed up by research.As the chart below shows, political scientists have used voting records to demonstrate that the degree of extremism in the Congress is greater today than at any time since Reconstruction.To be sure, the two sides still manage to agree occasionally. The Senate voted 98-2 to impose tougher sanctions on Iran and Russia. And some kind of compromise involving spending on infrastructure and reform of corporate taxation is vaguely imaginable.But among the possibilities for common ground, health care isn\u2019t one of them. Deep philosophical differences \u2014 particularly as to the role of government \u2014 separate the two sides.Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Democrats have, if anything, moved closer philosophically to the idea of a single-payer program in which the government provides all Americans with guaranteed health care in return for modest premiums, similar to what it does with Medicare.To a considerable degree, that shift reflects the rising influence within the Democratic Party of its more progressive wing, led by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Their faction believes that a more government-driven policy agenda would have led to a different outcome in the 2016 election.On the other side, the Freedom Caucus in the House and its fellow travelers in the Senate led by Ted Cruz and Rand Paul want the federal government extricated from the health care sector to the fullest extent possible.In their minds, regulatory oversight would largely be the province of the states, but even better, the free market would be left to work. In addition, programs like Medicaid would be transformed from entitlements (which just means that every qualified American would receive assistance) to block grants or per capita cap programs, leaving millions unaided.Some serious people think that gap can be bridged. Really?Not even the most centrist Democrats \u2014 senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 have shown the slightest sign of backing off from the key elements of the Affordable Care Act.The Republicans are divided between those who want to flat-out repeal Obamacare and those who want to eviscerate many of its key elements.The differences between the two sides were not always so great. Remember that the core principles of Obamacare were embraced by conservatives back in the 1990s as a more market-based alternative to the more government-oriented plan promoted by Hillary Clinton when she was the first lady.And the same conservative principles were adopted by Mitt Romney in his health care plan while he was governor of Massachusetts.Those conservative ideas still make sense. If Republicans are serious about working across the aisle, they should recall the genesis of those ideas and accept that the fundamental core of the A.C.A. must remain intact.Sure, some changes \u2014 even some alterations favored by Republicans \u2014 would make the national health care program work better.In particular, to keep premiums down, we need to improve the functioning of the exchanges on which individuals not covered by employers can purchase insurance by encouraging greater participation by younger, healthier Americans. Accomplishing that would require greater enforcement of the requirement to buy insurance, including stiffer penalties, instead of the administration\u2019s approach of essentially signaling that no one will be punished for not participating.But we should also adopt a Republican proposal to scrap the current provision that insurance for older Americans can\u2019t cost more than three times what younger Americans pay (and include higher subsidies for needy older Americans). That was a well-meaning attempt to keep premiums down for those nearer retirement, but instead it has meant prices so high for younger enrollees that many have chosen to drop out.Other Republican ideas, like reforming how Medicaid services are delivered, are worthy of consideration, but let\u2019s have genuine experiments, not clandestine efforts to eviscerate the program.Last, the federal government needs to give more certainty to insurers by continuing to fund cost-sharing subsidies (for low-income people to cover their deductibles and co-pays) and help states create adequate reinsurance pools to cushion insurers against losses.Most important, if the two sides genuinely want a better health insurance system, they need to provide all participants with an assurance that the rules won\u2019t keep changing with every election.Advertisement"}

Her struggle is to project an image of sociability, compliance and quiet competence over her barely concealed seething indignation. In a cynical coda to each video, the death metal cuts off, our heroine clicks her heels together and purrs, \u201cTomorrow is a new day!\u201dAs a concept, Aggretsuko isn\u2019t exactly revolutionary \u2014 she\u2019s basically a feminist Dilbert. More interesting is where she came from: She is the latest character from Sanrio, the Japanese consumer goods empire that plasters adorable images on lunchboxes and stationery sold around the world.For decades, Sanrio\u2019s central export has been Hello Kitty, an emblem of infantile feminine charm who wears an oversize bow on her head and doesn\u2019t even have a mouth. She embodies the Japanese concept of kawaii, a cuteness ascribed to the small, vulnerable and helpless. She\u2019s an Aggretsuko who never gets wasted or unleashes her wrath.Sanrio characters are imbued with very basic \u201cback stories\u201d by the company \u2014 Hello Kitty, which debuted in 1974, is said to be a third-grade girl from the London suburbs who is \u201cas tall as five apples and as heavy as three\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s through the sale of branded stuff that the characters really \u201ccome to life,\u201d Dave Marchi, Sanrio\u2019s vice president for brand management and marketing, told me. \u201cWe create characters and put them on products or experiences or jet planes. Anything you can imagine.\u201dHello Kitty\u2019s catchphrase is \u201cYou can never have too many friends,\u201d and her goal is total saturation of the global marketplace. In her book, \u201cPink Globalization: Hello Kitty\u2019s Trek Across the Pacific,\u201d the anthropologist Christine R.

{"Headline": "Venus Williams Lawfully Entered Intersection Before Crash, Police Say", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authorities investigating a fatal car crash involving the tennis star Venus Williams said on Friday that new evidence showed that she had legally entered the Florida intersection where the collision occurred.According to that report, witnesses told investigators that Williams had run a red light in a Toyota Sequoia S.U.V. just as a vehicle driven by Linda Barson, 67, entered the intersection on a green light. Jerome Barson, 78, was a passenger in his wife\u2019s 2016 Hyundai Accent and died 13 days later after sustaining injuries in the crash.But in a statement distributed on Friday, the police said they had obtained new evidence that shows that \u201cWilliams lawfully entered the intersection on a circular green traffic signal\u201d and was traveling north. In addition to their statement, police released a video of the crash.The statement says \u2014 and the video provided by the police appears to show \u2014 that a Nissan Altima then entered the intersection traveling south. The Altima then made a left turn in front of Williams\u2019s vehicle, \u201ccausing her to stop advancing through the intersection to avoid a collision,\u201d according to the statement.Williams then continued straight through the intersection \u201cin accordance\u201d with the law, the statement said.About the same time, the vehicle driven west by Ms. Barson approached a red traffic signal, the police said. After the signal had turned green, the police said, Ms. Barson entered the intersection.The video provided by the police shows that Ms. Barson\u2019s vehicle slammed into the passenger side of Williams\u2019s S.U.V. as the S.U.V. appeared to be leaving the intersection.Although the information released Friday appeared to help Williams, Maj. Paul Rogers of the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said that \u201cthe investigation is still underway and a final determination of fault has not been made at this time.\u201dIn a statement, Michael Steinger, a lawyer for the Barson family, maintained that Williams was at fault.\u201cThere is nothing that disputes Ms. Williams was in the intersection on a red light, and the witnesses clearly confirm the Barsons had a green light and lawfully entered the intersection,\u201d Steinger said in the statement.In a statement posted on Facebook on June 30, Williams said she was devastated \u201cand heartbroken by this accident. My heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of Jerome Barson and I continue to keep them in my thoughts and prayers.\u201dWilliams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, is the 10th seed at Wimbledon.\u201cThere are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and \u2014 yeah, I\u2019m completely speechless,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 yeah, I mean, I\u2019m just. \u2026\u201dShe began to sob and then said, \u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d before being led out of the news conference.Williams advanced to the round of 16 by winning her match on Friday against the 19-year-old Naomi Osaka, 7-6 (3), 6-4. She is scheduled to face another teenager, Ana Konjuh, 19, on Monday for a spot in the quarterfinals.Malika Andrews, Harvey Araton and Christopher Clarey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Instant Way to Bolster Flavor", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenInventive cooks are always looking to push flavor to the maximum.Here is my advice: When in doubt, add a little miso. It has transformative powers.In addition to offering a host of nutritional and probiotic benefits, miso imbues everything it touches with a sweet, salty, nutty complexity. Whether you choose mild white miso, medium-bodied yellow miso or the more intense reddish-brown miso, it gives foods instant brightness. Even a very small quantity adds dimension and sparkle to salad dressings, soups and stews.Most people wouldn\u2019t eat miso, which is made from fermented soybeans, straight from the jar \u2014 the flavor is too concentrated. Diluted or in combination with other ingredients, though, it imparts a subtle roundness, in the same way other umami-rich condiments, like anchovy paste or fish sauce, meld unobtrusively into the whole. Some chefs mix a little miso into softened butter to make a quick sauce for fish. (Miso butter is also good on toast for a snack, a bit like Marmite or Gentleman\u2019s Relish, or with corn on the cob.)I quite like to use miso in marinades, thinned with a bit of sake or mirin and punched up with ginger. It\u2019s delicious paired with salmon, black cod or mackerel. Miso-coated broiled eggplant is brilliant. Meat and poultry take well to the miso treatment, too: Consider miso pork chops or miso-basted roast chicken or quail.With duck breasts \u2014 or legs, if you\u2019d prefer \u2014 miso does wonders. Leave the meat in the marinade for at least an hour, or for as long as two days. Grill the duck over coals or in cast iron, taking care to keep the meat medium-rare. Even hefty one-pound Muscovy duck breasts emerge tender, juicy and delightfully savory. I used moulard breasts, which weigh eight ounces each, but any size will work.Though miso duck is wonderful in any season, it is pretty spectacular as the star element in a summery main course salad. I added orange zest and orange juice to the marinade, which came through beautifully. It\u2019s best to let the grilled duck cool to room temperature before carving.Tucked into crisp lettuce leaves and topped with tiny green beans, sliced mango and watercress sprigs, this duck will astonish your guests. Miso is the reason.And to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want a Fabulous Wedding? Consider Eloping", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField NotesAs Amy Jones and her fianc\u00e9, Rich, exchanged handwritten vows overlooking their favorite surfing beach in Playa Avellana in Costa Rica, a family of monkeys ran by.No one missed them at the reception; they didn\u2019t have one. The couple had eloped, and it was the happiest experience of their lives.She said it wasn\u2019t so odd for a wedding planner to elope. She\u2019s had too many brides call her in tears over seating arrangements or guest lists to take on that kind of stress for her own exchange of vows. \u201cI wanted the wedding to only be about us,\u201d she said.Gone are the days when elopement almost always meant only that spontaneous trip to City Hall. Many of today\u2019s couples are planning their elopements more closely than ever, some plotting secret ceremonies several months in advance and spending $15,000 or more for their dream weddings \u2014 without a hundred of their closest family and friends.They search for stunning exotic backdrops for their ceremonies, shop in secret for the perfect dress, hire florists to arrange a Pinterest-worthy bouquet, hire photographers, even order specialty cakes. But in lieu of the invitations, friends learn about the wedding afterward in a cheeky Facebook or Instagram post, a photo announcing, \u201cWe Eloped.\u201dStatistics are hard to come by concerning how many couples are forgoing the big wedding to elope. But in the last few years, interest in eloping has created a cottage industry of photographers in romantic locales like Paris, New York and Hawaii that specializes in photographing eloping couples.\u201cWhen you\u2019re planning a wedding, the pressure from families can be overwhelming,\u201d said Ms. MacFarlane, whose planned elopements have included one at Grand Central Terminal, the steps of the New York Public Library and a sandy beach in Brooklyn.\u201cOur couples want something more laid-back, and there\u2019s this very punk-rock feeling about being married like this in New York City.\u201dWhen her husband wed a couple on the Brooklyn Bridge, a crowd gathered, erupting into cheers when the groom kissed the bride.Of course, there\u2019s a downside to eloping. Family members are often stung when they get the news \u2014 parents\u2019 dreams of seeing their son at the altar or their daughter walking down the aisle crushed, since they\u2019ll never share with their child one of life\u2019s greatest traditional rites of passage.Aja Koenig, who works in advertising sales for Playbuzz, found that her mother was not pleased after sharing the news that she and her fianc\u00e9, Chris Koenig, a 32-year-old digital media director for IBM, were going to marry in California wine country rather than have a traditional ceremony.Anticipating her mother\u2019s feelings, Ms. Koenig was quick to sweeten her disappointment with news of a party to celebrate their marriage in Alabama, where her mother lives, the next spring.Ms. Koenig said that while both she and her husband are close to their families, they were sold on the advantages of eloping. They wanted to splurge on their honeymoon, leaving California after the elopement to vacation in Hawaii for two weeks.Koreena Singh, 32, a catering sales manager and certified wedding planner for JW Marriott Parq Vancouver Hotel in British Columbia, was in the thick of organizing a traditional wedding with her husband, Mark Johnson, a 34-year-old working in international trade, when they had a change of heart.They had set a date and booked a loft space in Vancouver for 100 guests, and she had put down a deposit on a big poufy ballroom gown. But the more they planned, the more the couple bickered, about things like whether they should sit at a sweetheart table.\u201cAnd we never typically fight,\u201d she said. Scrolling through photos of other couples\u2019 weddings on social media only added to the stress. What if her flowers weren\u2019t as beautiful? What if the food wasn\u2019t that great? \u201cI started to ignore all of the advice I\u2019d given other brides, which was to take a breath and think about what was important,\u201d Ms. Singh said.After some soul-searching, she and her fianc\u00e9 agreed that what mattered most was a beautiful ceremony, not a reception. She was also a little shy and dreaded standing up before so many people to say her vows. They canceled the loft space, forfeiting part of their deposit; Ms. Singh canceled her poufy dress.Instead, they reserved a date at Haiku Mill, an old sugar plantation on the Hawaiian island of Maui; they rented the entire gardened space for the day to ensure that no other couples would be on the property. In the months leading up to their nuptials, she worked with a designer to create her dream dress, and Mr. Johnson had a suit custom-made. She bought special jewelry, without showing family and friends, and scheduled to have her hair and makeup done on the island. \u201cYou may be eloping, but you still want everything to be beautiful,\u201d she said.They kept their plans private from friends and family, pretending to be vacationing when they took off for Maui in March 2015. Minutes before she was to walk down the aisle, Ms. Singh was alone with her photographer in an old cane house on the Haiku Mill property, her feet in Valentino heels, when she felt the same panicky feeling nearly every bride experiences before she marries. The photographer offered her reassurance. \u201cI suddenly understood the power of bridesmaids,\u201d she joked. It was the only time she wondered if eloping had been the right idea.Still, Ms. Singh would not have done it any differently. She and Mr. Johnson both cried during their vows, captured by a videographer so they could share the moment later with their parents. It was 10 a.m., but they popped a bottle of Champagne anyway and ate slices of chocolate cake with espresso buttercream.The total cost of the elopement, travel and event space costs included, was $15,000, far less than what many couples spend on conventional weddings.Keren Buynak, 33, who works in freelance marketing in Parkland, Fla., and her husband, Ryan Buynak, 34, a creative strategist at a design firm there, knew they would elope in Montreal soon after they were engaged.\u201cIt was a fun secret we kept together,\u201d she said. The couple visited Montreal to request a wedding date a year before they planned to marry. Once their wedding date was set for Oct. 19, 2012, they began planning. Ms. Buynak, who was living in Manhattan at the time, found her dress, a $100 Lauren Ralph Lauren long-sleeved white sheath, at the 59th Street Bloomingdales; her husband selected a gray suit from H&M. They booked a photographer. But a few months before the ceremony, she started to fret about not telling her family and closest friends, so she sat them down. \u201cIt was hard, and they understood,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they wanted to be involved somehow.\u201dTo include them, Ms. Buynak asked her friends and family to write her notes to read aloud on her wedding day. While she and her fianc\u00e9 waited in line at the Montreal Courthouse, she opened a little blue pouch, her \u201csomething blue,\u201d where the notes were stored. Her father sent his love on the back of his business card: \u201cEven if I don\u2019t walk with you down this aisle, I will forever walk with you through the aisle of your life and forever hold your hand. I love you.\u201dThe bride\u2019s \u201csomething borrowed\u201d was her mother\u2019s beaded clutch, and inside, Ms. Buynak found a small vial of her mother\u2019s favorite perfume, so she could smell like her when she wed. \u201cI\u2019m always with you,\u201d her mother wrote.\u201cIt felt like they were there with me, even if they weren\u2019t physically there,\u201d Ms. Buynak said. \u201cIt was almost like they were giving toasts.\u201d Total cost: About $2,000, including their train tickets and hotel stay.Kim Myers-Black, a photo retoucher at Urban Studios, and her husband, Chris Black, a graphic designer, who live in Brooklyn, had set a September 2016 date at a wedding chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., putting down a significant deposit. But as planning evolved, even picking a bridesmaid dress that would please all her friends proved challenging. So Ms. Myers-Black, 30, and Mr. Black did what they had originally wanted to do. In August 2016, they boarded a red-eye to Reykjavik, Iceland, to elope. (Her parents understood; they had married at City Hall themselves.)Eloping in Iceland meant the couple could marry in one of their favorite locales and yet, compared with a regular wedding, save money for, say, a down payment on a house. The total cost of the international elopement was less than $10,000.Proof that an elopement need not be elaborate to be memorable, Ms. Myers-Black picked flowers on the morning of her ceremony to make her own bouquet and flower crown. For the ceremony, they drove three hours to a cliff overlooking two waterfalls, the bride and groom exchanging vows with their hands tied together in a knot to symbolize their union \u2014 an old Scottish tradition. Afterward, with the photographer in tow, they hopped out of the car to snap pictures on a black sand beach in the rain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Gift to America: The New Sleazocracy", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The appearance of a former British tabloid journalist-turned-publicist in the revelations about Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s presidential election may seem like a bizarre twist, but it should come as no surprise.Rob Goldstone is a very recognizable British type. Seen on video playing in a casino money-blowing machine or re-enacting a children\u2019s TV show on the deck of a cruise liner, or posting photos of himself in daffy headwear to Facebook, Mr. Goldstone cuts an almost Falstaffian figure: a cheery man of the people, always up for a laugh.So he might have remained if he hadn\u2019t also been caught on camera in Las Vegas in 2013 with his client, an Azerbaijani dynast and pop singer named Emin Agalarov, chatting with Donald J. Trump. Three years later, as Mr. Trump sealed the Republican Party nomination for president, Mr. Goldstone was writing to Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to claim that he had \u201chigh level and sensitive information\u201d from a Russian government official to \u201cincriminate\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.How did a British tabloid hack turned P.R. guru get caught up in this American scandal, which has left the president\u2019s son struggling to explain why he was willing to seek \u201coppo research\u201d from a hostile power?According to Mr. Goldstone\u2019s account, he moved from local journalism to work for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s best-selling British daily newspaper The Sun and other tabloids before turning to public relations for pop stars. This career path happens to be ideal training in what Russian intelligence agencies call \u201ckompromat,\u201d because smear campaigns based on opposition research are a core business strategy of Britain\u2019s popular press.Our second-best-selling paper, The Daily Mail, specializes in hit jobs on public figures. Last year its front page proclaimed the High Court judges who had ruled that Brexit could be initiated only by Parliament to be \u201cEnemies of the People,\u201d denouncing one of them as \u201copenly gay.\u201dThe Sun is even more expert at brutal sensationalism. In 2014, its former deputy news editor, Ben O\u2019Driscoll, told a court of \u201can enormous safe, about seven feet high,\u201d filled with some 30 years\u2019 worth of \u201ceye-popping\u201d material. The Drudge Report and Breitbart News look like amateurs and na\u00effs in comparison.But it is Mr. Goldstone\u2019s second career, as a pop publicist, that is truly emblematic of the British media\u2019s evolution since the 1990s. It was then that celebrity journalism and a rich secondary market in P.R. took off.Under Mr. Morgan\u2019s editorship, a young Rebekah Brooks rose rapidly. Another friend, Andy Coulson, took over his role with the Bizarre column. Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson later became editors of The News of the World while Mr. Morgan moved to The Daily Mirror. During the trio\u2019s domination of the tabloid press, newspapers would spend millions on \u201cbuy outs\u201d from publicists, particularly \u201ckiss-and-tell\u201d confessions.Like hedge funds that speculate on derivative trades, celebrity journalism is a spread bet on the futures of public figures. Max Clifford, the most famous publicist of his day (until his downfall and disgrace as a convicted sex offender), used kompromat to ruin the reputations of several politicians, while his tabloid contacts helped keep his own clients out of the papers. The public appetite for such material spawned an industry of private investigators adept at the dark arts of bugging, phone hacking and acquiring confidential records.The phone-hacking scandal in 2011 was a comeuppance of sorts. The News of the World closed; Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson both stood trial on charges related to phone hacking. In 2014, Ms. Brooks was acquitted, and a year later she resumed her role as chief executive of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s newspaper group. Mr. Coulson was convicted on a conspiracy charge, but not before he had served as Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s head of communications in Downing Street.Mr. Morgan was by then working in the United States, thanks to another British innovation that had crossed the Atlantic: reality TV, exported in formats developed in Britain like \u201cBig Brother,\u201d \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cPop Idol.\u201dMr. Morgan deftly surfed this new wave, serving as a judge on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d before taking over Larry King\u2019s spot at CNN. And, on the set of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d he met and, as he tells it, befriended Donald Trump. Until recently, Mr. Morgan\u2019s Twitter profile featured a photo of himself with Mr. Trump. In June 2016, just as Mr. Goldstone was setting up the Russian lawyer\u2019s meeting with the Trump campaign, Mr. Morgan was praising his friend\u2019s special talents among those \u201cskillfully manipulating the media to fuel their personal and professional brands.\u201dForget Shakespeare and Dickens, or even the Beatles and David Bowie. Today Britain\u2019s most important cultural export to the United States is the use of tabloid tricks and reality TV techniques for influence and profit. Rob Goldstone may look like a bit player in this story, but he is an avatar of the new power brokers in the age of politics as entertainment. Welcome to your new ruling class.

Peter M. Lenkov, an executive producer of \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d said that CBS \u201cwas extremely generous and proactive in their renegotiation talks.\u201d\u201cSo much so, the actors were getting unprecedented raises, but in the end they chose to move on,\u201d he said in a statement.A swell of criticism of CBS grew on Wednesday after Mr. Kim wrote in a Facebook post that he had made a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to walk out of negotiations and leave the show after seven seasons.Mr. Kim stopped short of saying that unequal pay had been the reason for his departure, but he suggested as much in the post, writing, \u201cThe path to equality is rarely easy.\u201dIn a statement shortly afterward, CBS said that both cast members \u201chave been important and valued members\u201d of the show and said that they had been offered hefty raises.\u201cWe did not want to lose them and tried very hard to keep them with offers for large and significant salary increases,\u201d the network said. \u201cWhile we could not reach an agreement, we part ways with tremendous respect for their talents on screen, as well as their roles as ambassadors for the show off screen, and with hopes to work with them again in the near future.\u201dA representative for Mr. Kim and Ms. Park declined to comment.\u201cUnfortunately, the racial hierarchy established in the original 1968-1980 series remained intact in the 2010 reboot: Two white stars on top, two Asian/Pacific Islander stars on bottom,\u201d said Guy Aoki, the founding president of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans, who also criticized the network for not including more actors of Asian or Pacific Islander descent in the show\u2019s cast.George Takei, an actor of Japanese descent who has made appearances on both the revived \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d and the original series, noted that Hawaii is home to a large Asian-American population and called CBS\u2019s inability to get a deal done with the two actors \u201csad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that CBS couldn\u2019t recognize their value to the show that\u2019s set in Hawaii,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.Other Asian-American performers said that Mr. Kim and Ms. Park\u2019s departures would give visibility to diversity and equal pay issues in Hollywood.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cosmo DiNardo Took a Dark Turn Before Bucks County Killings, Friends Say", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBENSALEM, Pa. \u2014 Women blocked him on social media, saying he aggressively stalked them for dates and sex.After he dropped out of a university, he was banned from the campus by school officials who said he returned to harass others.He bragged to friends about seeing people killed, and in a social media post, he posed, bare-chested and crazy-eyed, aiming a revolver.In his 20 years, Cosmo DiNardo has always loomed large \u2014 an heir to a real estate and construction fortune in suburban Philadelphia. For close friends, he was flashy but giving, offering clothes, shoes and cash to those from poorer families.But the signs of a volatile, bullying personality became steadily more pronounced over time, especially after an ATV accident last year. Many who knew Mr. DiNardo said that his mood became especially dark.Prosecutors said that Mr. DiNardo lured the victims to a remote family farm in central Bucks County over two days, and along with Mr. Kratz shot them, ran one of them over with a backhoe and burned three of the bodies.Chris Hellmuth, who people in Mr. DiNardo\u2019s orbit said was close to him, wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday that the two were best friends since fourth grade, but grew apart because of Mr. DiNardo\u2019s behavior after an ATV accident. Mr. DiNardo was briefly hospitalized for a mental health issue.\u201cThe Cosmo I knew for over 10 years would never be capable of anything like this,\u201d Mr. Hellmuth wrote.During Mr. DiNardo\u2019s confession, according to a person with knowledge of it, he also claimed that, at 15, he killed two people in Philadelphia.Mr. DiNardo grew up in the middle-class suburb of Bensalem, the oldest child of Antonio and Sandra DiNardo. Antonio DiNardo owns a concrete company, Metro Ready Mix and Supply, and inherited a lucrative real estate portfolio after the death of his father, for whom Cosmo DiNardo was named. Sandra DiNardo runs a trucking company, Bella Trucking, and she and her husband built a profitable partnership by selling concrete and delivering it.A neighbor of the DiNardos in Bensalem said Mr. DiNardo\u2019s grandfather and father, who goes by Tony, built all of the stucco homes on their cul-de-sac. \u201cHe\u2019s a workaholic, Tony,\u201d said the neighbor, a physician, who asked to be identified by only his first name, Abid.Sabrina Gramiak, 23, who said she attended St. Charles Borromeo School, a private elementary school in Bensalem, at the same time as Cosmo DiNardo, remembers him as \u201ca normal boy who just got into minor trouble.\u201d She said he was once given the \u201cPeacemaker of the Month\u201d award. By eighth grade, he was bench-pressing 220 pounds and orchestrating well-attended pool parties at his home.But if there was a social side, there was also a scary, dark one, acquaintances said. While he was a teenager, his anger and aggression could not be talked down. At 15, he punched two strangers at a mall when he saw them talking to his girlfriend, according to a friend.\u201cCosmo was crazy,\u201d said Amber Peters, 20, whose boyfriend was once close to Mr. DiNardo. \u201cHe\u2019s been talking about killing people since he was 14.\u201dSeveral states are considering a ban on capital punishment for people with mental illnesses or brain injuries.She said Mr. DiNardo made unwanted and obnoxious overtures to young women on social media. \u201cHe randomly messages girls, saying, \u2018Hey, babe,\u2019 calling them hos and trying to have sex with them.\u201dAfter high school, most of his friends went into the work force and started families. Mr. DiNardo enrolled in August 2015 as a commuter student at Arcadia University in Glenside, Pa., about 20 miles west of Bensalem, and declared an interest in biology.At a concert before the semester began, he invited a group of female students to his house to swim. They declined, but Mr. DiNardo did not leave it at that.\u201cHe texted me every day after that asking me to hang out,\u201d said Sara Dinner, a student from Mechanicsburg, Pa. \u201cI eventually blocked his number because if he didn\u2019t get his way, he would get so upset. I think he had anger management issues, honestly.\u201dMr. DiNardo completed only one semester at Arcadia, but the next fall he began hanging around campus. The campus police received complaints of \u201cverbal incidents\u201d by Mr. DiNardo that \u201cunnerved university community members,\u201d said Laura Baldwin, a university spokeswoman. The school sent him a certified letter stating that if he returned to campus, he would be treated as a trespasser. The school also notified the local police, Ms. Baldwin said.Last week, a woman posted a series of messages exchanged on Facebook in December and January that show Mr. DiNardo aggressively pestering her for a date and more. \u201cLeave me alone please,\u201d the woman replied, to which he answered, \u201cwhy baeb I\u2019m pretty cute and so are you,\u201d and, \u201ci wanna make babies asap.\u201dThe woman confirmed that the exchange was authentic, but like several acquaintances of Mr. DiNardo\u2019s who spoke of his behavior, asked not to be identified by name.After he left Arcadia, Mr. DiNardo worked for his father\u2019s concrete company, but he wrote on Facebook in November that he had moved on to sell \u201cfirewood,\u201d which some friends said was a code for drugs. Friends said he sold guns and marijuana, and one friend said he wanted to move up to selling harder drugs and larger quantities.Friends and acquaintances said Mr. DiNardo changed last year after he crashed a four-wheeler while alone in the woods on the family farm in Solebury Township, about 45 miles north of Philadelphia. According to some accounts, he was stranded for hours, suffering from broken bones, until his father and younger brother found him. Some friends said he suffered a serious head injury.A longtime friend said: \u201cThat incident drove him over the edge. He was a more violent individual.\u201d The friend asked not to be named because of a desire to not offend Mr. DiNardo\u2019s family and an agreement among his friends to stay silent.At an arraignment hearing last week, a Bucks County prosecutor said Mr. DiNardo was once diagnosed with schizophrenia. Members of his family and a lawyer representing Mr. DiNardo declined requests for more information about his mental health. One longtime friend said Mr. DiNardo twice spent time in a mental institution.Mr. DiNardo, according to the authorities, instigated the killings of four men \u2014 Jimi Taro Patrick, 19; Dean Finocchiaro, 19; Thomas Meo, 21; and Mark Sturgis, 22 \u2014 with Mr. Kratz as an accomplice to three of them. They were each charged with multiple counts of homicide.Residents recalled him as the skinny teenager in a black hoodie accused of breaking into homes and stealing jewelry and landscaping tools, the newspaper reported. His former girlfriend\u2019s mother said she had long suspected he stole her Yorkie.Over the past six months, Mr. DiNardo\u2019s volatility had become increasingly public. In February, a neighbor in Bensalem, where Mr. DiNardo still lived with his parents and three younger siblings, called the police after Mr. DiNardo was seen walking down the street, shooting a 20-gauge shotgun in the air. He admitted to an officer that he was not legally allowed to possess firearms because of his prior mental commitment, police records show.On Snapchat, Mr. DiNardo ranted about seeking revenge, appearing bloody in one video after he said he got into a fight at a strip club. In a selfie, the one in which he appeared bare-chested and wild-eyed, he aimed a revolver mounted with a laser at the phone.Over the Independence Day holiday, a few days before the four men went missing, he sent an ominous video warning in a private Snapchat message to a few dozen friends, according to a person who watched it. He threatened to kill people who owed him money and to get away with it, speaking while lying down with guns arrayed behind him.Now friends are trying to make sense of how catastrophically his life went off the rails.On Sunday evening, around 500 people, including some of the victims\u2019 family members, attended a candlelight vigil on the grounds of a memorial for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks near Newtown, Pa. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the community coming together and healing,\u201d said Gloria Cugine, one of the organizers, before the 35-minute ceremony.Mr. Hellmuth, a student at Drexel University, according to his Facebook page, wrote that he was not trying to excuse Mr. DiNardo\u2019s behavior as he tried to process his own shock and pain about it.\u201cHis parents never in a million years thought their son would ever be involved in something like this nor did they raise him in any way that made him do something like this,\u201d he wrote.An article on Monday about Cosmo DiNardo, who has been charged in the murders of four men in Pennsylvania, misidentified the source of a statement by Mr. DiNardo that he had killed two other people when he was 15. A person with knowledge of Mr. DiNardo\u2019s confession \u2014 not the Bucks County prosecutor\u2019s office \u2014 provided the information. The article also described incorrectly Solebury Township, Pa., the location of the farm to which the men were lured. Solebury Township is in central \u2014 not northern \u2014 Bucks County.Trip Gabriel and Jon Hurdle reported from Bensalem, and Matthew Haag from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chef Sean Brock Puts Down the Bourbon and Begins a New Quest", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "Supported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Sean Brock went to rehab.Mr. Brock wasn\u2019t the kind of chef who drank during work, but he was often the last man standing at the end of a night saturated with Budweiser and J\u00e4germeister. In some circles, his name had become a verb. After a long stretch on the line, one cook might look at another and say, \u201cLet\u2019s get Brocked.\u201d\u201cThe second I opened the door I knew exactly what was happening,\u201d he said in a recent interview at a cafe here. \u201cWe sat down and had us an old-fashioned intervention.\u201dBy all accounts, he came back a markedly different man from the angry, isolated star chef who more than one person, including Mr. Brock himself, suspected might die young. He had been coping with an autoimmune disease that threatened his eyesight, but he was falling apart emotionally, too.\u201cI was concerned about killing myself not by my choice, but by being unhealthy and miserable,\u201d he said.Counselors diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, not from a single event but from a pile of them. They told him that the part of his brain that controls behavior and emotion was essentially frozen.\u201cFreeze is the scariest, darkest place you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only emotion I knew was anger. I was miserable and angry at the world.\u201dToday his crazy giggle is back, and he is about 20 pounds lighter. Mr. Brock had never had a lick of personal therapy until he went to the Meadows. Now, he spends a few hours a day in self-care activities like meditation and reiki and is a regular at support groups and therapists\u2019 offices.He has taken up inner healing, boundary-setting and other bedrock emotional acts of recovery with the same intensity that drove him to raise an Ossabaw Island hog so he could deliver a perfect slice, cured and dressed in sorghum syrup and wild red bay laurel, as part of his $115 tasting menu at McCrady\u2019s.And he has a new mission. Forget cooking shrimp and grits, he said, using a much stronger verb. \u201cAnybody can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have this opportunity in front of me. If I can inspire people to take better care of themselves in this industry, that will be my greatest contribution.\u201dIt\u2019s not just about alcohol, he said. It\u2019s about teaching people in the restaurant business how to ask for help.\u201cSuffering is suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are addicted to porn on the internet or you\u2019re codependent or you\u2019re addicted to gambling or if you\u2019re addicted to \u2018The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u2019 You\u2019re suffering, and that\u2019s what gets us into trouble.\u201dThen again, Mr. Brock may be still riding what people in recovery call a pink cloud. Friends worry that talking so publicly about his recovery could jeopardize it, but they support him.\u201cIt\u2019s a way for him to be accountable and to do service,\u201d said his girlfriend, the publicist Adi Noe. \u201cI told him instead of being known for bourbon, you could be known for choosing recovery and choosing health.\u201dThe festival was the first one Mr. Brock had attended sober. He hosted a ham and bourbon seminar with the Kentucky distillers Preston Van Winkle and Drew Kulsveen. Not one of the 60 people who attended asked him why he wasn\u2019t drinking. Later, he went upstairs to the chill space. \u201cIt was the safest I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d he said.Over lunch in Atlanta the next day, Mr. Brock said he hoped the intervention was a final piece of punctuation on years of extreme highs and lows.He grew up in rural Virginia with a father who worked overtime hauling coal and a mother who read Gourmet magazine. He was 11 when his dad died of a heart attack; he watched it happen, something he didn\u2019t even tell Ms. Noe until recently.By age 15, he was working in a restaurant. \u201cI found a place to hide in the shadows,\u201d he said. \u201cI found a place where I was safe, I was secure and surrounded by people just like me. I didn\u2019t leave.\u201dThere is another curveball thrown in Mr. Brock\u2019s story. In January 2014, while holed up in his Nashville apartment nursing a kneecap he had smashed in a fall on the ice, he woke with double vision. His eyelids wouldn\u2019t behave. One would droop while the other would pop open.His vision became so bad that he couldn\u2019t drive, and had to bend over to see the food he was cooking. After a year and a half of tests and several brutal eye surgeries, he was given a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disease that interferes with the way nerves and muscles communicate. At its worst, it can take away the ability to swallow and, eventually, breathe. At best, it might go into remission.Managing the symptoms requires rest and a drug cocktail that includes the steroid prednisone. Mr. Brock didn\u2019t rest much. Feeling more creative than he had in a couple of years, he threw himself into remaking McCrady\u2019s as a dual restaurant, with a high-end American tavern on one side and his boutique experimental dining counter on the other.With Ms. Noe watching over him, he tried to slow down and drink less. He preached the virtues of rest and gluten-free eating. He said he wanted to become an advocate for research into his disease and for a more balanced approach to restaurant work.\u201cHe had lost his ability to see himself,\u201d said Patty Bundy, a marriage and family therapist in Roanoke, Va. whose daughter, Melany Robinson, is Mr. Brock\u2019s publicist and was one of the architects of his intervention. Ms. Noe, an executive director for Ms. Robinson\u2019s public relations company, confided frequently in Dr. Bundy.\u201cThe article made it clear he was springing leaks all over the place,\u201d Dr. Bundy said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that goes well as the ship\u2019s going down.\u201dFights at home became so frequent that neither he nor Ms. Noe could remember what it was like not to be in conflict. She would go to bed and he would rummage around his bourbon collection, drinking and staring at the wall until he could sleep.At work, he was moody and demanding. He punched walls. One day, he went to plate a dish and realized he couldn\u2019t make his hand move properly. \u201cI threw the spoon down and panicked,\u201d he said.\u201cYou get angry, and that anger just builds and builds into rage, and you hurt a lot of people around you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to survive. You\u2019re gasping for air.\u201dWhen it was over, he checked into a Nashville hotel just to be alone. Meanwhile, people who saw him at Blackberry Farm called Ms. Robinson. She and Ms. Noe decided it was finally time to act, and with Dr. Bundy\u2019s help, they planned their intervention.\u201cIn a short period of time, he\u2019s gone from a young guy from a little town in Virginia to a point where he can\u2019t walk down the street in Charleston or New York without someone identifying him,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a blessing and a burden, and requires you to always be on point. With that comes addiction.\u201dMr. Brock\u2019s rebirth, as he calls it, could help change an industry that has always demanded too much.Before he returned to Nashville in March, he made sure that Ms. Noe had moved his precious bourbon collection to the garage. There was so much that she had to spread the work out over a week, being careful not to damage bottles that could command thousands of dollars apiece.Mr. Brock sold them all and used some of the cash to buy a black 1969 Plymouth Road Runner on eBay. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted that car since I was a little kid,\u201d he said. \u201cMy garage used to be full of bourbon. Now there\u2019s my childhood obsession.\u201dNo one around him doubts that there are tests to come even though the double vision is at bay, he is taking less medicine, and his head is clear. Though he has slowed down, the projects are stacking up. In coming months, he and Mr. Howard plan to open Husks in Greenville, S.C., and Savannah, Ga. A major television project is in the works.Mostly he plans to enjoy his freedom.\u201cSurrendering,\u201d he said, \u201cis the greatest feeling on the face of the planet.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

(He noted that the Lower East Side was also a contender, but that prices there were rising.)\u201cPeople who team up with three or four roommates can end up in the city, but it\u2019s a different way of living,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople that are fresh out of college or young that want to live on their own tend to go outside Manhattan.\u201dWhere are prices falling?Williamsburg, thanks in part to the L train shutdown, Mr. Broekhoven said.\u201cPrices are dropping there, and you can get a better deal,\u201d he said. The shutdown is \u201cstill almost two years away, but people are thinking ahead.\u201dWhere are prices not coming down?TriBeCa and SoHo, \u201cstill pretty much the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Broekhoven said.And what\u2019s the next up-and-coming neighborhood?That\u2019s difficult to predict because there are so many influencing factors, but wherever it may be, \u201cthere needs to be transportation,\u201d Mr. Broekhoven said. \u201cTransportation, safety and affordability are the big ones.\u201dHappy hunting.Here\u2019s what else is happening:It should be clear for the morning commute, but watch out for showers later.This evening should be lovely, cooling down to the low 70s.With another clammy day ahead \u2014 and a week that\u2019s only getting stickier \u2014 it might be a delightful time to go for a dip.For those of you who don\u2019t know how to swim or are simply looking to brush up your breaststroke, the city has begun its annual free swimming lessons.

{"Headline": "Search for Eczema Relief Leads to Business Opportunities", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipWhen Elizabeth Scott\u2019s son, Harrison, was only a few months old, he had a red rash all over his body and was scratching himself almost constantly.\u201cOnce, when I got him out of bed, he was bloody,\u201d said Ms. Scott, who lives in Denver. That set her on a search to find out what was wrong and how to fix it. It turned out that her son had eczema, leaving his skin scaly and oozing.The condition, which is also called atopic dermatitis and is often chronic, afflicts millions of children and adults. To ease their discomfort, an expanding number of small companies are offering therapy garments and nonchafing clothing as well as moisturizers and salves.Eczema entrepreneurs are often driven by personal experiences that they or their family members have had with the skin condition. Joe Paulo, for example, created Smiling Panda clothing after he had eczema as a teenager. But he and others, including Ms. Scott, have found that the path to a winning eczema product is not short or easy, in large part because there is no official testing process to get approval.\u201cEveryone\u2019s eczema is different, and not everything works the same way on every patient,\u201d said Julie Block, president and chief executive of the National Eczema Association, which tracks developments in the field but does not endorse products. The association does offer a \u201ccertificate of acceptance\u201d for companies that can show they have clinical safety testing data for their products.Ms. Scott discovered the therapy while searching for a way to help Harrison, who will be 9 in September. As a baby, his eczema was so severe that he got a staph infection from scratching. Dr. Mark A. Ebadi, an allergist at the Colorado Allergy and Asthma Center in Denver who was treating Harrison, recommended wet-wrap therapy.Ms. Scott dressed her son in wet cotton pajamas, and \u2014 at Dr. Ebadi\u2019s suggestion \u2014 taped her husband\u2019s tube socks around her son\u2019s hands for protection. But the wrapping was cumbersome.\u201cIt was off-putting to wrap a child in damp clothing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd cotton pajamas got baggy, and my son would get cold. We needed something for him that was close fitting so it would be next to his skin.\u201dIt took a lot of trial and error, but Ms. Scott, who is an interior designer, gradually developed a full body suit with flat seams \u2014 almost like a long-sleeve onesie \u2014 with covers for her son\u2019s nails. The suit has attached feet, like those found on infant and toddler pajamas, to prevent children from scratching their legs and ankles, where clusters of eczema are often found.\u201cI knew nothing about clothing manufacturing,\u201d Ms. Scott said. Eventually, she found a family-owned company in Michigan that was willing to produce a run of her sample suit. It was made from the artificial fiber Tencel, which retains more water so the material holds its shape and stays closer to the skin.She called the body suit the \u201cWrap-E-Soothe\u201d suit, but customers later began calling it the rescue suit \u2014 a nickname her company quickly adopted. It sells for $109 for children. The product line later was expanded to include tops and pants, which cost $74.50, and sleeves, which cost $34.95, to cover children\u2019s arms and legs.Ms. Scott began selling the garments in 2012, the same year that she teamed up with Anne McVey, an experienced marketer in Davenport, Iowa, whose daughter has eczema. To test reaction from doctors, they took samples to an annual meeting of allergy, asthma and immunology specialists, held in San Antonio in 2013. The garments received good reviews, but Ms. Scott said it was an uphill climb to attract customers online because the product was little known.She did not share specific numbers, but Ms. Scott said sales increased 70 percent last year \u2014 to around 10,000 items \u2014 over 2015. Repeat customers, the eczema association\u2019s certificate of acceptance and a medical product billing insurance code have all helped raise the site\u2019s visibility and attract business, Ms. Scott said.\u201cWe\u2019re aiming for 100,000 pieces annually,\u201d she added, noting that the site is adding garments for adults.Mr. Paulo, 23, has already made some inroads with adults seeking relief with his Smiling Panda brand, which he started after getting eczema on his arms. The eczema appeared after he moved from California to Philadelphia in 2012 to attend college.His eczema, he said, \u201cgot significantly worse\u201d when he had to wear professional clothing during college internships. When even bedsheets began irritating his skin, he started researching the properties of different fibers and how clothing was made. He chose a bamboo-cotton blend for his clothing because bamboo is soft and cotton fibers allow a closer fit, he said. He began cutting and stitching his own shirts, with flat seams and no tags.When he wore his shirts to bed, he said: \u201cI went from having a really tough time falling asleep to having no trouble at all.\u201dMr. Paulo, an engineer for a construction company, sold only about 70 shirts last year at $40 to $50 apiece.But \u201cwe are on track to sell 100 shirts\u201d this year, he said, despite limited advertising, mostly on Facebook. He added that sales were expected to pick up in coming months.Many of the men and women who buy his garments for workout wear, undergarments and sleepwear are repeat buyers and are so committed that, in March, he decided to add children\u2019s sizes.Mr. Paulo said he did not know if the company would ever be profitable. \u201cI like doing it because I feel like our products make a difference in our customers\u2019 lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI know from personal experience how miserable clothing can be when you are itching from eczema.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was 10:17 p.m. in Terminal 2 of the Nice C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur International Airport in southern France.In an instant, the stressed-out travelers seemed to embody the world\u2019s collective frustration with the state of air travel, banding together at the departure gate to voice their anger over still waiting for their flight, which was scheduled to depart for London at 10:35 a.m.\u201cBabies!\u201d another woman interjected.In the background, a man moved toward the attendant at the gate and, while holding a child in his left hand, tried to snap a photo of the attendant with his other hand. The employee swiftly slapped the cellphone to the floor.The man retaliated, shoving his hand into the attendant\u2019s shoulder and then his face. The attendant, regaining his footing, lunged forward and threw a jab into the man\u2019s face. People gasped.It was not clear if the man was hurt, but that moment epitomized how the patience of passengers is tested at every turn, from malfunctioning ticket kiosks to painfully slow lines at security to cramped seats in coach. On Saturday, it was another frustration of air travel \u2014 a delayed flight \u2014 that caused the easyJet passengers to lose it.Arabella Arkwright, a passenger who posted a photo of the employee punching the man, said the passengers were allowed to board the flight but were held on it for two hours because of a mishap during refueling.They were allowed to return to the terminal, she said, but without adequate seating or food. About 12 hours after the plane was supposed to depart, frustrations boiled over, and that is when Ms. Arkwright and her husband, Johnnie, said they saw the man and his wife confront the attendant.\u201cThese airlines treat people so badly,\u201d Ms. Arkwright, who lives in Warwickshire, in central England, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cYou\u2019re this little minnow fighting against this ruddy great shark.\u201dMs. Arkwright wrote an open letter to easyJet\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, in which she asked for answers about what happened.\u201cI request that you \u2014 not some lackey \u2014 write personally to every person on this flight with a full explanation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI should hardly need to tell you that customers should be treated with respect, not disdain.\u201dShe said that she hoped the episode would help improve customer service.The easyJet flight took off from the Nice airport a few minutes before midnight and landed at 1 a.m. in London \u2014 more than 12 hours after its scheduled arrival.Jonah Engel Bromwich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jon Underwood, Founder of Death Cafe Movement, Dies at 44", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Jon Underwood, who as the founder of the Death Cafe here encouraged people around the world to discuss, over tea and cake, life, the finality of life and why we fear it, died on June 27 in London. He was 44.His wife, Donna Molloy, said that the cause was a brain hemorrhage from acute promyelocytic leukemia. His death was sudden, she said; his leukemia had not been diagnosed.As a Buddhist, Mr. Underwood had already contemplated the philosophical questions of dying. Although everyone experiences it, he felt, the topic seemed so taboo that no one wanted to discuss it.He quit his job and decided to bring the movement to London. \u201cHe said that no job would be more meaningful than this,\u201d his wife said.From the basement of his house in Hackney, an artsy borough in London\u2019s East End, Mr. Underwood perpetuated a movement that spread to more than a dozen countries with more than 1,000 gatherings.He came to learn that the meetings, which began in 2011, were more about laughter than tears. People often talked less about how to die than how to live.These were not grief support groups or end-of-life planning sessions, but rather casual forums for people who wanted to bat around philosophical thoughts. What is death like? Why do we fear it? How do our views of death inform the way we live?Each meeting was led by a volunteer facilitator (one of the cafe\u2019s founding principles was \u201cNever do it for cash\u201d). The participants included people of all ages, working and retired, who were drawn by Facebook announcements, storefront fliers, local calendar listings or word of mouth. Women usually outnumbered men.The purpose, Mr. Underwood said, was not to influence attendees or lead them to any sort of conclusion or course of action.Cake and tea, however, was a must.\u201cSome people have a fear that by talking about death, it will attract death and make it more likely to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cEating and drinking are conscious acts of nurturing the body.

{"Headline": "How to Smoke Out Where Broadband Companies Stand on Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtA curious thing happened on Wednesday, a day that many internet companies and public policy groups had christened a \u201cDay of Action\u201d aimed at protesting the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s plan to overturn so-called net neutrality rules. The curiosity was that several broadband companies \u2014 the very same companies that pushed to rewrite the rules that undergird net neutrality \u2014 put out statements suggesting that they, too, supported the aims of the protesters.So what\u2019s going on here? Net neutrality \u2014 rules meant to ensure that broadband companies treat all internet traffic equally and don\u2019t, for instance, block certain services or charge them to get priority access \u2014 has been at the center of a heated tech-policy battle for more than a decade. It\u2019s a fight between internet companies \u2014 the Googles, Facebooks and Netflixes of the world \u2014 and broadband companies that control the pipes coming into your home. The battle is abstruse, but the stakes are high: Both sides say the future of the internet depends on getting these rules right.So why, now, are broadband companies suggesting that they support the aims of the other side?There are two possibilities: A cynic might argue that it\u2019s just puffery, that the broadband industry is simply trying to present a friendly image to an outraged online horde. Or you might take them at their word.When I asked them for comment, representatives for AT&T, Comcast and Verizon pointed to their statements. In those statements, they argue that there is a reasonable middle ground in the neutrality debate \u2014 that if given a chance, both sides could arrive at a set of rules that would make the internet better off. And they say the proper venue for that compromise is Congress, not the F.C.C. Legislation rather than regulation, they said, would create a permanent new legal grounding for network neutrality rules, ending the fight once and for all.So which is it, cynicism or an earnest attempt to move the debate forward? Well, maybe their motivation doesn\u2019t matter. Here\u2019s one idea for longtime proponents of network neutrality: Call the broadband companies\u2019 bluff, if that\u2019s what it is. Maybe it is time to push Congress, rather than the F.C.C., to take up the neutrality fight \u2014 and maybe, finally, end the debate for good.But broadband companies also face enormous consumer pressure to keep their networks functioning well. On the Day of Action, many internet companies showed worst-case scenarios that could come out of the death of net neutrality rules \u2014 trickle-slow load times and an internet marked by paid bundles, like the return of cable TV on your computer. Broadband companies, which are already quite hated by their customers, aren\u2019t likely to be keen on seeing those scenarios come to pass \u2014 and would therefore willingly support legislation that prevents such horrors, said Michael Powell, a former F.C.C. chairman who is now the president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, a broadband trade association.\u201cThere\u2019s a premise out there that we are itching to block, itching to create slow lanes, but we\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with every C.E.O., and it\u2019s not because they\u2019re good people or are philanthropists. They\u2019re as self-interested as Google or anybody else, but they believe they\u2019ve found a good business selling internet access on open, unobstructed pipes. They don\u2019t see how one could create a profitable business model by degrading the experience of their consumers.\u201dHe added: \u201cI guess you could think we just constantly lie, but I\u2019m trying to convince you it\u2019s as sincere as it comes. It\u2019s in their greedy monetary self-interest not to block anyone.\u201dSo if broadband companies are itching for a law, why not get on that bandwagon? Yes, a law would be hard to get; legislation under this Congress has a habit of dying on the launchpad. But it\u2019s not implausible: Internet giants control the world\u2019s most important channels for information, from your Facebook feed to Google results to your phone\u2019s home screen. They are more than capable of applying enormous pressure to members of Congress to push for what they want.And then, if nothing else, we\u2019ll be able to see where the broadband companies really stand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Disrupts WhatsApp Service in Online Clampdown", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The last of Facebook\u2019s major products that still worked in China was disrupted by the government on Tuesday, as Beijing broadly tightened its controls over the internet.The product, WhatsApp, a messaging app used across the globe, was partly blocked by Chinese filters, leaving many unable to send videos and photos and some also unable to send text-based messages.Sites hosting popular foreign television shows have had videos taken down, and tools used to skirt the censors have faced more frequent disruptions. In an article, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s Communist Party scolded the Chinese internet company Tencent over a popular video game, calling it too addictive.To complicate matters, the 19th Party Congress \u2014 where top leadership positions are determined \u2014 is just months away. The government puts an increased emphasis on stability in the run up to the event, which happens every five years, often leading to a tightening of internet controls.WhatsApp, which had generally avoided major disruptions in China despite the full block of Facebook and Instagram, appears to have become a victim of those circumstances.The blocks against WhatsApp originated with the government, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the disruption. Security experts also verified that the partial disruption in WhatsApp started with China\u2019s internet filters.\u201cAccording to the analysis that we ran today on WhatsApp\u2019s infrastructure, it seems that the Great Firewall is imposing censorship that selectively targets WhatsApp functionalities,\u201d said Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a cryptography research start-up.The actions by the Chinese government are another setback for Facebook in a country that has been difficult for the world\u2019s largest social network to crack. Its flagship site was blocked in 2009 after ethnic unrest in western China; Instagram followed in 2014 during protests that fall in Hong Kong.Beginning in late 2014, Facebook began an aggressive campaign to woo the Chinese government and get its main social network back into the country. As part of the courtship, Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, showed off his language chops at a conference and later dined with President Xi Jinping during a state visit to the United States.But Facebook\u2019s efforts have slowed over the past year, and it has little to show for itself. Instead of getting a new product into China, the internet giant now faces the reality that its last app standing is under threat of being pushed outside the walls of Chinese censorship.A spokeswoman for WhatsApp declined to comment.Since taking power almost five years ago, Mr. Xi has presided over a consistent and deepening suppression of internet freedom. He has been vocal in calling for China to establish sovereignty online, and has set up a new internet regulator to consolidate controls over the web.The scale of the recent actions shows the increasing muscle of the Chinese government, which has strengthened this year.In recent months, a number of virtual private networks, tools that allow users in China to access the broader internet around the world, were removed from app stores or shut down. China\u2019s telecom regulator said it would ban unauthorized VPNs starting in February 2018.The new cybersecurity rules, broad and vague, have left Western companies uncertain of how they will be applied and what impact they could have on a difficult operating environment. The government has put strong emphasis on the law, which could serve as a watershed for how the internet is managed and foreign companies are policed.The disruption of encrypted messaging programs like WhatsApp and censorship circumvention tools like VPNs shows a desire to take almost total control over how the internet is used.WhatsApp is hugely popular around much of the globe, but the platform is not widely used in China, where local messaging app WeChat dominates. Even so, WhatsApp provides encrypted messaging, making it a useful tool for many Chinese to communicate or do business outside the country or in Hong Kong.Paul Triolo, the head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group, said that a possible next step would be for China to target other encrypted messaging apps like Signal, pointing out that such apps \u201crepresent a small but growing and potentially important hole in the Great Firewall.\u201d\u201cThe ministries and support organizations that undergird the Great Firewall must constantly prove they can keep abreast of technological change, and encrypted messaging apps are just the latest in a long string of innovations that have drawn the attention of the technical wizards behind the Great Firewall,\u201d Mr. Triolo said.The apparent crackdown is part of the jockeying among Chinese ministries ahead of this autumn\u2019s congress to show that they are doing their job, according to a government tech policy adviser who declined to be named because of possible retribution over speaking to foreign news media. While there is a real push to make it harder to use VPNs, he said the new rules set to take effect next year are unlikely to be so extreme that they entirely prevent individuals from being able to use such tools.Some in the Chinese government are worried that the excess censorship and controls are damaging the country\u2019s ability to access crucial information, like scientific papers and other educational resources. As such, there have been calls for a more surgical way to block specific material, rather than a sledgehammer approach that takes out entire services.In the case of WhatsApp, it is not clear whether the targeted censorship of videos and photos was intentional, or if it was just a prelude to a more complete block. Previous partial blocks have sometimes led to full bans, or they have eventually been removed by the government, and service restored.Beijing\u2019s track record with other American social networking services does not bode well for WhatsApp. Besides Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, Google and Gmail are all blocked in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s like when Gmail first got throttled, the blockage was very uneven,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

But time, a job change and fate conspiring in his favor allowed him to begin anew with Angela LaRocca, a vibrant woman he describes as \u201ca human exclamation point.\u201dAlthough they were both living in Clayton, Mo., a St. Louis suburb, the two met by chance at a neighborhood Starbucks in November 2015. Ms. LaRocca had a networking meeting with an acquaintance, who spotted Mr. Hochman, the new sports columnist for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and introduced the two. Mr. Hochman and Ms. LaRocca exchanged business cards and soon became Facebook friends.Over the next seven months, they chatted when they bumped into each other and occasionally texted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if this thing with Benjamin was more a business relationship or if I was once again caught in the friend zone,\u201d said Ms. LaRocca, an actress, producer and director who is also working as \u201cchief catalyst\u201d for a St. Louis-area business development and branding agency.Ms. LaRocca had moved back to St. Louis, her hometown, in 2010 after several years in Chicago, where she attended Columbia College Chicago, and in Los Angeles, where she acted in short films and commercials and worked in event production at Universal Studios Hollywood and Wolfgang Puck Catering.\u201cI was 30, my biological clock was more or less ticking, and my parents were back living in St. Louis,\u201d said Ms. LaRocca, who is now 37. \u201cI was also shocked to find out how much entertainment business was in St. Louis, which was a huge part of why I wanted to be based here. And I knew I wanted to find a good guy with \u2018Midwestern values\u2019 to settle down with.\u201dFiguring it was \u201ca game of numbers,\u201d she joined Match.com and went on more dates than she cares to remember. \u201cI thought if I put myself out there forcefully, I would land somebody,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it was one disaster after another, but after a few years of one or two dates and then nothing really developing, you kind of ask yourself: \u2018Is it me? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201dWhen Mr. Hochman, 37, met Ms. LaRocca, he was also getting reacclimated to St. Louis, where he had grown up but had been away from for nearly two decades. \u201cI still hadn\u2019t unpacked my boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to sports events and relearning the city.\u201dMr. Hochman had moved back to St. Louis from Denver two months earlier to take the newspaper job he had coveted since he was 12. He wanted to get to know \u201cthat awesome girl,\u201d he said, alluding to Ms. LaRocca, \u201cbut this avalanche of life was coming at me. I had so much going on.\u201dWhat Mr. Hochman and Ms. LaRocca didn\u2019t know was that two regular patrons at the same neighborhood Starbucks where they had first met were actually scheming to get the two together.Lou Cohen and Paul Gallant, both 84, would meet at that Clayton coffee shop most Sunday mornings. And one week, Ms. LaRocca dropped by their table to say hello to Mr. Cohen, who lives in the same high-rise condominium as her parents. Mr. Cohen is the father of Andy Cohen, a host on the TV channel Bravo.Mr. Gallant recalls being taken with \u201chow adorable and bubbly\u201d Ms. LaRocca was. After she walked away, Mr. Cohen mentioned how Ms. LaRocca\u2019s mother, Irene LaRocca, had been asking if he knew of a nice guy for her daughter to meet. \u201cI told Irene anyone I know would be too old and unsuitable,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Mr. Gallant took out his phone and called a good friend to inquire about his son\u2019s dating status. That good friend happened to be Mr. Hochman\u2019s father, Jere Hochman, who until recently served as a deputy secretary of education in New York State for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. \u201cHeck if I have any idea who Benjamin is dating,\u201d the elder Mr. Hochman told him.It wasn\u2019t until June 2016 that Mr. Hochman and Ms. LaRocca\u2019s casual friendship took a more serious turn. He had invited her out to dinner, and on the day of that date, Irene LaRocca called her daughter with an important message: \u201cLou says you have to meet this Benjamin Hochman guy.\u201dHer daughter said, \u201cI was like, \u2018Mom, I\u2019m going on a date with Benjamin in four hours.\u2019\u201dAfter that dinner date, their relationship took off. It wasn\u2019t just realizing that each shared a deep interest in \u201990s pop culture or that they both adored St. Louis, baseball and music by the Beatles and Nelly and the St. Lunatics. They also uncovered that they were born at the same hospital three months apart.\u201cNothing about me or Angela is normal, and I think that is beautiful,\u201d Mr. Hochman said. \u201cShe\u2019s super-pretty but doesn\u2019t carry herself like someone who is super-pretty. She\u2019s down-to-earth, comfortable in her own skin and isn\u2019t afraid to be goofy.\u201cWe bring out the best versions of each other,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019d rather do nothing with Angela than something with most people.\u201d\u201cShe started telling me about this cousin character who thinks he\u2019s cool and a ladies\u2019 man but is pretty much a doofus,\u201d said Mr. Hochman, who performed stand-up comedy during his time in Denver. \u201cSo I began reading the menu as if I were him, mispronouncing stuff. I wasn\u2019t auditioning, just goofing around.\u201d And while Ms. LaRocca was nervous to cast someone she had just started dating, she said he mastered the real audition and got the part.Family and friends remark on how the two match wits at the same level, and complement each other\u2019s playfulness and easy personality. Graham Watson-Ringo says she knew Ms. LaRocca was perfect for Mr. Hochman minutes after meeting her.\u201cThat\u2019s when it hit me,\u201d she continued. \u201cAngela is the female version of Benjamin.\u201dA decade or so earlier, Ms. Watson-Ringo had introduced Mr. Hochman to her childhood friend Erin Meines. Mr. Hochman and Ms. Meines dated and later lived together in Denver. In January 2011, while he was in Cleveland on assignment for The Denver Post, Ms. Meines died unexpectedly at their home. She was 31.An autopsy was done, but no cause of death could be determined. Murder, suicide, substance abuse and all the usual diseases and sicknesses were ruled out. Mr. Hochman was left devastated.\u201cBenjamin pretty much shut down,\u201d Ms. Watson-Ringo said. \u201cIn terms of Ben being Ben, I don\u2019t feel he got back to the person I always knew until a few years ago.\u201dMr. Hochman admits it took a long time for him to feel whole again. He fretted about relating this chapter of his life to Ms. LaRocca, mainly because he didn\u2019t want her to feel as though she were a replacement, or that he didn\u2019t have closure.\u201cWhen he told me about Erin, my first concern was that he was O.K.,\u201d Ms. LaRocca said. \u201cIt just heightened everything and made me love him harder. People deal with loss and grief in different ways, but Benjamin assured me he had healed, a lot of time had elapsed and he loves me completely. And I feel that every day.\u201dOn July 1, the couple were married at a St. Louis residence owned by family friends of Ms. LaRocca\u2019s, whose children she babysat for as a teenager. Her brother, Mark LaRocca Jr., and Mr. Hochman\u2019s sister, Emily Hochman, having been recently ordained by the Universal Life Church, presided over the ceremony.Afterward, 180 guests enjoyed a backyard baseball-themed reception, with John Ulett, the public address announcer at Busch Stadium, introducing the wedding party over a loudspeaker, and the bride and groom entering to Nelly\u2019s \u201cBatter Up.\u201dIn toasting the couple, the best man, Geoff Gloeckler, acknowledged the hardship Mr. Hochman had been through before adding: \u201cWhen Ben told us about this new girl named Angela, the way he talked about her was different. He said, \u2018She\u2019s everything I\u2019m looking for, and she\u2019s even things I didn\u2019t know I was looking for.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Silence in China Sets a Dangerous Precedent", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYet in China over the weekend, when faced with a broad demand by the Chinese internet authority, it was Apple that blinked.Whatever Apple may have done in private to fight the Chinese internet law, the company has not offered a peep of criticism in public. Apple\u2019s only public statement on the VPN ban said that the company had been \u201crequired to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d but noted that the \u201capps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d Despite the pulldown, Apple says there are still hundreds of VPN apps available on its Chinese app store, some of which remain unregistered with the government.Search Apple\u2019s website for a letter from Mr. Cook issuing a public rebuke of China\u2019s intrusion into his customers\u2019 privacy and freedom of expression \u2014 you won\u2019t find it. The company has not fully tested its political and economic leverage in China. It hasn\u2019t tested the public\u2019s immense love of its products. It hasn\u2019t publicly threatened any long-term consequences \u2014 like looking to other parts of the world to manufacture its products.The company\u2019s silence may be tactical; the Chinese government, the conventional thinking goes, does not take well to public rebuke. Yet Apple\u2019s quiet capitulation to tightening censorship in one of its largest markets is still a dangerous precedent.\u201cApple\u2019s response is tremendously disappointing,\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that Apple is playing a bigger role behind the scenes here. But the problem with that is, from the outside it looks exactly like doing nothing.\u201dIt may be na\u00efve to expect Apple to publicly take on the Chinese government. Sure, it may be the world\u2019s most valuable company, with extensive investments and operations in China. But Apple is also just a foreign company \u2014 it must obey local laws, and it must watch for its bottom line. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Apple\u2019s sales, and many analysts see the region as a key growth area for the company. So what was Apple supposed to do? Jeopardize its operations over a few apps?There is also a moral defense of Apple\u2019s decision to give in without a public fight: Despite the VPN ban, Chinese internet users might still be better off with Apple in China than with it outside. Its app store still provides people access to millions of apps that they might not find elsewhere in China. And Apple\u2019s own communications apps in China remain free of government censorship. For instance, Messages, Apple\u2019s texting app, and FaceTime, its video and phone-calling app, are protected by end-to-end encryption, allowing Chinese users to communicate freely.But that may be of limited utility.\u201cIt will only get worse,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a Chinese human rights activist and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. Mr. Xiao sees the latest crackdowns as the beginning of a new wave of internet censorship in China. And he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that saying something publicly would have backfired for Apple.\u201cThey should say something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a U.S. company, after all. And they\u2019re a global company, upholding standards of privacy and speech in many, many markets outside China. So if they have to do things differently in China, they should have some public explanation for why \u2014 because that attitude could matter globally, including in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Opening Data Center in China to Comply With Cybersecurity Law", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Apple said Wednesday that it would open its first data center in China, joining a parade of technology companies responding to growing global demands to build facilities that store online data closer to customers.The move is a response to a strict new law in China that requires companies to store users\u2019 data in the country. The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.As is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how. Already, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have formed partnerships with Chinese companies to offer cloud computing services based in China. Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.Apple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place.\u201d The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple\u2019s encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.\u201cThe addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,\u201d Apple said.China\u2019s rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.The iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple\u2019s business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s global sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.But the iPhone has also become emblematic of China\u2019s long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.Apple already stores some of the data of China\u2019s residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.In 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.Careful not to offend, Apple said it \u201cappreciated\u201d that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users\u2019 locations.The opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple\u2019s iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple\u2019s Chinese partner.Apple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple\u2019s permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.Other American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.Even though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple\u2019s smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Self-Immolation, Catalyst of the Arab Spring, Is Now a Grim Trend", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Dridi, 31, is also a fruit seller, and, like Mr. Bouazizi, he snapped after the police spilled his apricots, bananas and strawberries on the ground in front of the city hall here in his hometown.\u201cI wanted to burn myself because I was burning inside,\u201d Mr. Dridi said in an interview while lying on a mattress in his family\u2019s home, where he was still recovering, his neck and chest scarred by burns. \u201cI wanted to die this way.\u201dSeven years after Mr. Bouazizi\u2019s desperate and dramatic protest helped start revolutions across the region, frustration at the failed promise of the Arab Spring is widespread. Authoritarian rule has returned to Egypt. Libya is a caldron of chaos. Syria and Iraq are torn by civil wars. The gulf monarchies are essentially unchanged. Neighboring Algeria is paralyzed.Yet it is a paramount irony that in Tunisia \u2014 cradle of the Arab Spring and the one country that has the best hope of realizing its aspirations for democracy and prosperity \u2014 Mr. Bouazizi\u2019s once-extraordinary act has become commonplace, whether compelled by anger, depression or bitter disappointment, or to publicly challenge the authorities.Tunisia has advanced more than any other country in the region toward freedom and democratic governance, yet it has been largely unable to provide hope and opportunity for a better life. Thousands of young people have abandoned the country to work abroad or to join the Islamic State.The frustration at that failure has no more gruesome expression than Tunisia\u2019s tide of self-immolations.The hospital had seen an average of more than 80 cases a year since 2011, the surgeon in charge of the burn ward, Dr. Amen Allah Messadine, said. The public protest is now the second-most-common form of suicide in this country of 11 million people.\u201cThe problem is that it does not decrease,\u201d said Dr. Messadine, who has been at the front line of the trend.For public health officials, the phenomenon is as perplexing as it is disturbing. But it is also regarded as a profound measure of the unsettling change, economic hardship and lingering sense of injustice that define life in Tunisia, even since its democratic revolution.\u201cThis kind of suicide stands more as a dissenting attitude toward the post-revolution society, which deeply changed,\u201d said Dr. Mehdi Ben Khelil, the forensic pathologist who conducted the study showing how the number of self-immolations had increased.Mr. Dridi, the only breadwinner for his mother and family since the age of 14, said he had wanted to do \u201clike Bouazizi\u201d on the morning of May 10, when police officers ordered him to leave, saying he had not paid for his vending spot.\u201cThe police knocked over my stall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it got worse. They spilled my fruit and they took me to their car. Inside, they started beating me hard. I managed to escape and when I saw the gas station in front of me. I did not think twice.\u201dHe splashed gasoline on himself directly from the pump and put a lighter to his neck. He was saved by a bus driver who put out the flames with a fire extinguisher.Whereas most suicides before the revolution were for reasons of mental health, those since have been driven largely by economic hardship and a desire to challenge the authorities. They are often carried out in front of administration buildings.Mr. Dridi had previously tried to burn himself in public in 2012, but was stopped by onlookers.He said he had earned about $400 a month before the revolution, which is twice the minimum wage in Tunisia. Now, he said, he never knows how much he will sell, or how many times the police will harass him.Cases like his are a sign of social despair and resentment toward officialdom, medical personnel say.\u201cMost of those who survived told us they just could not take it anymore,\u201d said Nadia Ben Slama, a psychologist at the Ben Arous hospital. \u201cThey frequently used two words in Arabic: el kahra, which means helplessness or the feeling of being oppressed, and the word hogra, which means scorn or contempt from others.\u201d\u201cThere is a symbolism in the public gesture of self-immolation,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is usually to denounce injustice or an oppressor, but also to make the other one feel guilty, the one who witnessed the injustice and who did not act on it. That one is society in general.\u201dSometimes self-immolation is threatened to force the hand of the authorities. That is what Imed Ghanmi, 43, an unemployed teacher, did when the police confiscated smuggled merchandise he was selling on the street to support his family.\u201cImed used to pour gas on himself as a way to blackmail the police so they would give him back his merchandise,\u201d his brother Ahmed Ghanmi said. \u201cHe had already done that as a last resort two or three times before and he told me it worked.\u201dThe last time Mr. Ghanmi tried, in a police station, he set himself on fire and died. His family is still investigating whether it was a suicide or an accident and why the police did not help him.The trend is touching a new, younger generation that has come of age since the revolution.Ramzi Messaoudi set himself afire on Feb. 15 in the courtyard of his high school, while everyone was studying in class, in Bou Hajla, a small town in central Tunisia. He died three days later from his burns.He had had disagreements with his English teacher, who repeatedly expelled him from class, his father and his friends said.But his family is bewildered. His sister Rimeh, 20, who shared a bedroom with him, mourns over his school books. His father, Nourredine Messaoudi, a minibus driver, still holds on to his son\u2019s burned bus card, neatly folded in his wallet.He knew about his son\u2019s problems at school and had tried to reason with him several times. \u201cI told him he should call me if he had any more problems,\u201d he said.\u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d he added. \u201cHe was a good boy. He loved martial arts and soccer, he had many friends on Facebook and he wanted to be a military man.\u201d\u201cHe just could not take it anymore,\u201d said Wissem Hadidi, 19, a childhood friend. \u201cWhen he arrived at the hospital, he was still conscious and he was smiling and kept on repeating the word \u2018injustice.\u2019\u201dRamzi Messaoudi\u2019s act had a tragic aftermath. \u201cI locked myself in my house for a week,\u201d Mr. Hadidi said. \u201cI could not go back to high school. You see, I literally saw him burning and I can still remember the smell.\u201dA week later, another pupil in the town, who was just 13, also tried to burn himself alive, but survived after a friend snuffed out the fire with his jacket.There has been a general increase of depression and suicide rates among teenagers since the revolution, said Fatma Charfi, who leads a Ministry of Health committee combating suicide.\u201cWith the dictatorship, the state was ubiquitous; we were under a police rule and deviation was less possible,\u201d Ms. Charfi said. \u201cThere were already suicides with self-immolation or hanging, but it was in the privacy of the home, not in the public sphere like today, and the youth is very exposed to this new phenomenon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Finland\u2019s Basic Income Experiment Isn\u2019t Working", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn reality, the Finnish trial was poorly designed, and is little more than a publicity stunt.The trial size was cut to one-fifth of what had originally been proposed, and is now too small to be scientifically viable. Instead of giving free money to everyone, the experiment is handing out, in effect, a form of unconditional unemployment benefits. In other words, there is nothing universal about this version of universal basic income.And so even when the experiment\u2019s official results are known, in 2019, they will reveal little \u2014 and far less than they could have \u2014 about the effects that universal cash payments could have on income inequality or people\u2019s attitudes toward work and their quality of life.Starting in the 1980s, Finnish progressives began discussing how distributing unconditional income might be a way to combat poverty and inequality resulting from declining employment in the industrial sector. The theory was that receiving a guaranteed income could free all citizens and allow groups like the jobless, students, stay-at-home parents and the elderly to meaningfully contribute to society through, say, caretaking, charity or artistic projects.But by the time Finland actually attempted the experiment, a conservative government committed to economic austerity was in power. How could it spearhead a leftist benefits program in the midst of economic hardship?A second, expanded experiment was supposed to start in early 2018, but there are signs \u2014 like silence \u2014 that the government may renege on that plan. The universal basic income program in Finland is being whittled down before it even properly begins.So what can we learn from all of this so far? How not to conduct a trial of this kind. Universal basic income can only succeed if the effort is sustained and widespread \u2014 and not available only to the unemployed. The program should not be intended to force people into low-paying jobs.The Finnish government has a chance to correct its course. It should expand the trial in early 2018, as originally planned, and steer it back to its original ideals: a bold experiment to collect hard data about how a much-debated idea actually works in practice. Only that would honor Finland\u2019s tradition of experimenting with innovative social policies.Antti Jauhiainen and Joona-Hermanni M\u00e4kinen are co-directors of Parecon Finland, an economic think tank, and the authors of the upcoming book \u201cHyvinvointivaltion vastaisku\u201d (The Welfare State Strikes Back).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Richard Twice: A Musical Life Interrupted", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsThis film recounts the rise, fall and ultimate second coming of the talented psychedelic folk musician Richard Atkins. In 1968, Atkins was building toward success he was certain would approach that of the Byrds or Simon & Garfunkel. He\u2019d won a contract with Mercury Records, and recorded with the Wrecking Crew, a group of Los Angeles session musicians famous for their work with the Beach Boys.But stage fright triggered a disastrous make-or-break performance in a small Hollywood nightclub, and everything abruptly fell apart. Atkins gave up music in the prime, and for 50 years he refused even to listen to a radio, so painful were his memories of a career he was convinced could have been. His story became a narrative of failure, but without the happy ending we generally like to document.In this film, he explains how resilience and talent took him far, but ultimately found their limit. And he shows that the same twists of fate in life that lead us to success can ruin us at any point. In their wake, we are left to romanticize the potential of what could have been.I met Atkins several years ago after my father was impressed by his performance at an open mic night and introduced us; perhaps his bittersweet story, coupled with the mournful tone of his music, could make for a meaningful film. Like most people today, I\u2019d never heard of Atkins\u2019s only album, \u201cRichard Twice\u201d (named for Atkins and his bandmate Richard Manning). But when I heard the songs, all but lost to history, I loved them and felt others would too.So we decided to tell his story, as much about his beautiful music and resilience as it is about acceptance, both of your past and where it took you.

{"Headline": "In Minneapolis, Unusual Police Killing Raises an Old Outcry: Why?", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 There was something bad going on in the alleyway behind the house, she told her fianc\u00e9 on the phone, someone who sounded as if she was in distress, maybe a rape. It was past 11 p.m., and most people on Washburn Avenue were furled in their beds.Except Justine Damond, alone at home with the noises, her anxiety creeping into the loud Las Vegas casino where her fianc\u00e9 had answered the phone.They had met five years ago, when they lived 9,000 miles apart, beginning a courtship at first halting and then headlong. Now the wedding dress was ordered, the suit bought, the invitations sent, the ceremony set for an August weekend in Hawaii. But last Saturday night, they were separated again.Her fianc\u00e9, Don Damond, told her to call 911. They stayed on the phone until she said the police had arrived. Stay put, he told her. Call me back, he told her.\u201cI have played this over in my head over and over,\u201d Mr. Damond said on Friday in his first interview since that night. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I stay on the phone with her?\u201dThe events of the next few minutes will be anatomized and argued over and, maybe, at some point, contested in court. But this much is established: As the squad car she had summoned slid down the alley, Justine Damond went up to the police officers inside, one of whom, for reasons still unknown, fired his gun, hit her in the abdomen and killed her.Even to Americans now used to dissecting police shootings, the circumstances were an odd jolt: a black Somali-American cop, firing at a white Australian woman among the garages and green compost bins of an unremarkable strip of Midwestern concrete.And in interviews this past week in Sydney and Minneapolis, Ms. Damond\u2019s friends and her fianc\u00e9 were trying to fill in the blanks of her final night.A week has passed. A cardboard sign at the end of the alleyway, propped amid the flowers laid there by friends and neighbors, asks the still-unanswered question: Why?She was the luminous Australian in the Fulton neighborhood of Minneapolis, leading meditation sessions, scattering her communications with rainbow emojis and greeting people with, \u201cHello, beautiful!\u201dAt one of the talks she occasionally gave at the Lake Harriet Spiritual Community, Ms. Damond, again barefoot, told the story: \u201cYou\u2019ve never lived until you\u2019ve had eight ducklings fling themselves into your lap because they\u2019ve realized you\u2019re trying to help,\u201d she said. \u201cSo beautiful!\u201dBorn in pre-revolutionary Iran to an Australian mother and an American father who was teaching English in Tehran, Justine Ruszczyk grew up on Sydney\u2019s North Shore with an affinity for horses, a three-legged dog named Brad and any animal she could rescue and nurse to health in her home. Her mother was a nurse midwife; her father owned a bookstore.She studied to become a veterinarian, but disliked that so much of the job consisted of spaying animals, said Sara Baldwin, her godmother. Then, when she was 22, her mother died of cancer. In pain and confusion, she went to an ashram, emerging from a three-week silent retreat with a determination to practice a different kind of healing.\u201cThere was a time when I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay on the planet,\u201d she wrote on her blog in August 2014. \u201cIt took me 13 years to come to where I am now \u2014 living with a deeply connected understanding of what it means to be a spiritual being in this very physical experience, a clear and grounded understanding of how this reality around me comes into being \u2014 and to be honest it was a pretty long and painful journey at times.\u201d\u201cHey, I just met my future wife,\u201d he told a friend when he returned. \u201cThe only problem is, she lives 9,000 miles away.\u201dThey met in Maui, in Australia, in San Francisco, impatient with happiness. The day he planned to propose, standing in the Marin Headlands with the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance, it was cold, and she kept trying to put her hand in his coat pocket where he had the ring. He had to keep grabbing her hand to stop her from finding it before he was ready to pull it out himself.She said yes.Reluctantly leaving Australia, Ms. Ruszczyk, who through her father was an American citizen, moved to Minneapolis in 2015.\u201cShe had her family there,\u201d Mr. Damond said on Friday. \u201cAll her friends, lifelong relationships, and she moved here for one person.\u201dThough she took his name, they put off marrying, partly because a wedding with families on two sides of the world would be hard to organize, partly because Ms. Damond was so absorbed in a new project, creating training materials for Mr. Dispenza.Someday, she told Ms. Baldwin, she hoped she and Don would return to Sydney.It was not only the weather or her friends or family that drew her back.\u201cShe didn\u2019t like the guns\u201d in the United States, Ms. Baldwin said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like the violence.\u201dWith Mr. Damond in Las Vegas for work, she had been sleeping on his side of the bed \u2014 the left, under a pair of dream catchers \u2014 when she heard a scream for help.She walked over the white shag rug to the windows that overlook the backyard. She peeked past the massive oak tree. The noise was coming from near a neighbor\u2019s garage on the right, she told Mr. Damond.At 11:27, a call came in to 911.\u201cWe\u2019ve already got help on the way,\u201d the operator promised.Nearby, Officer Matthew Harrity, with a year on the force, and Officer Mohamed Noor, with 21 months, got the call.Here, now, he was another officer, less than three hours from the end of a 10-hour shift.They turned their Ford Explorer into the alleyway behind Ms. Damond\u2019s house, driving south along a stretch of concrete and asphalt wide enough only for one car. Their lights were off. Under the street lamps, the detached garages on either side were pale in their vinyl sidings.Officer Noor fired.Past his partner, through the window, the bullet found Ms. Damond\u2019s abdomen. The officers got out of the car, calling back to the dispatch center, as the operator\u2019s computer recorded the first sign that lives were about to change on two continents: \u201cONE DOWN \u2026 STARTING CPR.\u201dIn Las Vegas, Mr. Damond\u2019s texts to his fianc\u00e9e were going unanswered. Maybe she had just gone back to bed, Mr. Damond thought.Around 12:45 a.m., the Minneapolis police called. There had been a shooting. A woman had died.Mr. Damond told himself it must have been the woman being raped.Then he asked who the victim was.\u201cWe can\u2019t give a positive I.D., but we think it\u2019s Justine,\u201d Mr. Damond said he was told.He sat at a slot machine, hyperventilating. Had the rapist killed his fianc\u00e9e? He was already at the airport when the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the shooting, called to say that the person who had pulled the trigger was a police officer.Mr. Damond got a seat on the 7 a.m. flight to Minneapolis. When he landed, a friend, a Delta Air Lines employee, was waiting. Hugging him, Mr. Damond heaved with sobs.\u201cThere\u2019s like a glitch in the matrix,\u201d Mr. Damond recalled thinking. \u201c I just know I\u2019m going to wake up from this nightmare.\u201dOn Monday afternoon in Sydney, news that a local woman had died overseas flowed into the offices of The Daily Telegraph, a tabloid that is part of the Rupert Murdoch news empire.\u201cIt became very clear that it was the best story for us that day,\u201d said the editor, Christopher Dore.\u201cYou know, here\u2019s this Aussie girl who goes over to find love,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd because of the complications of American policing and guns, she\u2019s dead.\u201dThe paper\u2019s editors had a picture that they knew would pull heartstrings: Ms. Damond in a white blouse, smiling widely, her engagement ring sparkling on one hand.At 6 p.m., a couple of hours to deadline, they began brainstorming headlines. They tried \u201cOnly in America,\u201d but on the page, it looked off.Mr. Dore insisted that the headline was not a judgment. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in the world we\u2019re going to lecture the United States about its Constitution or the right,\u201d he said.\u201cIt would have never happened here,\u201d said Michael Timbs, a mourner who showed up at a sunrise vigil at the beach near Ms. Damond\u2019s childhood home on Wednesday.That morning, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull appeared on television to ask, \u201cHow can a woman out in the street in her pajamas seeking assistance from police be shot like that?\u201dWhat led Officer Noor to fire his weapon? The loud noise the other officer said he had heard? Fear of an ambush, as his partner\u2019s lawyer has implied?Officer Noor, whose record included three civilian complaints and a lawsuit over his treatment of a woman while performing a mental health checkup, has declined to speak with investigators.But as in other cases, prosecutors might find it difficult to make a case against Officer Noor if he argues that he believed he was in danger.A 1989 Supreme Court decision, Graham v. Connor, held that officers\u2019 actions had to be judged by whether force was reasonable given what the officer knew at the time.\u201cThere is this huge misunderstanding in this country about the rules surrounding police officers\u2019 use of deadly force,\u201d said Jim Bueermann, a former Redlands, Calif., police chief who is now the president of the Police Foundation, a research group. \u201cPeople just say, if a person was unarmed, why would an officer have shot him or her?\u201dIn fast-moving situations, police protocol often leaves little room for error.Officers usually have a round chambered in their sidearms. And experts say they are generally taught to draw their guns when they feel they or someone else are in imminent danger. Even for many traffic stops, officers keep a hand on the weapon while it is in the holster.Mr. Bueermann said he believed many officers were quicker to pull their guns than they would have been a decade or two ago. \u201cThere is constant messaging to police officers about the dangers of their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really common adage in policing: It\u2019s better to be tried by 12 than carried by six.\u201dHe also questioned whether Officer Noor might have accidentally discharged his weapon \u2014 a far more common event than many realize, he said.What made this shooting particularly bizarre, to veteran police officers, was that Officer Noor fired at close range past his partner. Many officers would be furious or unnerved if a partner shot across them in any situation short of being attacked, said Vernon J. Geberth, a former New York City police commander and the author of \u201cPractical Homicide Investigation,\u201d a widely used textbook.The officer\u2019s partner might well be thinking, \u201cYou could\u2019ve shot my head off,\u201d Mr. Geberth said.Barefoot, on a beach in Kona, Hawaii, exchanging vows under a wooden arch trellised with Tibetan prayer flags onto which their guests would add prayers of their own: That was the plan. The wedding was set for Aug. 17.Mr. Damond would wear a bright blue suit with an open-collar white shirt. Following tradition, he had never seen Ms. Damond\u2019s dress.Now last-minute wedding tasks had given way to the business of death. There was a cremation to arrange, her clothes and engagement ring to pick up from investigators.And Justine\u2019s dress. On Sunday, he said, he was planning to go to the bridal shop, where he would see it for the first time.John Eligon and Matt Furber reported from Minneapolis, and Vivian Yee from New York.

{"Headline": "'I\u2019m at a Loss For Words\u2019: Readers React to Trump Jr.\u2019s Russian Meeting", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHundreds of readers debated about whether the meeting was clear evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and a foreign government, allegations that Donald Trump Jr. has denied.Some expressed support for Donald Trump Jr., saying that he had simply been trying to dig up dirt on an opponent, while others were alarmed about the campaign\u2019s ties to a foreign adversary.Here is a selection of comments, which have been edited for length and clarity.To Trump Jr.\u2019s credit, at least he didn\u2019t decline to release by asserting the emails were about yoga and a wedding. The Pentagon Papers this is not.This is a direct admission of collusion. Trump Jr. was told this is \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201dAt this point anybody defending Trump is doing so in the face of actual written admissions of guilt by those around him. I\u2019m not even sure what remains to be argued anymore \u2014 it\u2019s all here.I\u2019m at a loss for words.This article is another nothing burger. Collusion means a quid pro quo.There is no evidence Trump Jr. received information remotely usable against Hillary, there is no evidence or suggestion that Jr. promised anything to the Russians if such damaging information were forthcoming, and the story makes clear the probable Russian goal for the meeting was discussion of the Magnitsky Act.You can assume otherwise but assumptions alone get you nowhere. So, nope. Still zero evidence of collusion.This is not a Democratic or Republican issue, this is an American issue. No one should be okay with a foreign government interfering in our elections. I don\u2019t understand how the Republican Congress can continue to remain silent on this.So Trump Jr. met with an attorney (who was Russian) to get dirt on Hillary. No dirt was provided. I fail to see why this is newsworthy.Don\u2019t politicians in election campaigns seek dirt on each other all the time? Are we supposed to get all excited because the source of information, or rather the source of no information at all, was Russian?I think Trump is a terrible president, but this whole Russia angle that the press has been harping on forever just gets in the way of the real issues, such as Trump\u2019s catastrophic position on global warming. The emphasis on Russia is grossly disproportionate to its importance, which is nil.Hopefully this new information will serve to hasten the end of the Mueller investigation. I lived through the 60\u2019s protests; Watergate; and the debacle that was the end of the Vietnam War. Somehow the country put itself back together but those wounds were not nearly as deep as the ones being forged today between progressives and conservatives.The paths developed by these traitorous acts needs to be followed and each and every person involved needs to be brought to justice quickly with a firm verdict that will only be disputed by the most loyal Trump fans. The country and the world cannot take much more.There is nothing wrong here. Trump Jr. was baited by a tease: information about wrongful acts by the Clinton camp.If there was such information, Trump Jr. would have been bound to take it to the FBI. There was nothing but a plea to repeal an act of Congress, which is an entirely legal process under the Constitution.Trump Jr. listened and quickly terminated the meeting. The Russians sought to influence U.S. policy. It did not work. Kudos to Trump Jr.What Don Jr. has basically admitted is that he was open to colluding with the Russians to win the election. The fact that he didn\u2019t get anything from this woman is immaterial.The Russians now know that he can be bought or influenced. So much for Trump Senior\u2019s oft-mentioned claim that having billions make you immune to outside pressure and bribery.So, here\u2019s the chain: Some singer, whose father is in real estate, said something to a tabloid reporter/entertainment lawyer; then, the lawyer said something to Mr. Trump; then, there was a meeting in which it became clear that the woman who wanted the meeting was using the fictitious information \u201cdamaging to Hillary\u201d to meet with Trump about a completely different topic; then, Trump cut it short and ... end of story.If absolutely nothing else, this meeting shows that the Trump campaign did grasp at anything that could help them win, with the involvement of a foreign (hostile) government barely registering as even a minor concern.If no further evidence comes to light of collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, it would be a reasonable assumption to think that someone came to their senses and tried to conceal it.This is madness. This whole Russia election conspiracy has been an insane conspiracy theory from the getgo. One brief email exchange from somebody offering opposition research in the middle of a presidential campaign and the left is indulging their sick fetish of accusing the current administration of treason and coming up with melodramatic ultimatums. When does the madness end? Why not cooperate with Russia over certain issues? They\u2019re not the Soviet Union!I find it quite disturbing that the American public doesn\u2019t seem to be too concerned about the Russians meddling in your democratic process and having a president who is clearly vulnerable to Russian influence.We Europeans know Mr. Putin, and we also know how Russia plays the game. When Trump was elected, it was obvious to everyone that Putin would run rings around him. I think most people assumed that once he became president Mr. Trump would be surrounded by an army of experienced officials that would somehow compensate for the lack of political savvy and diplomatic experience. Little did we know.You should be extremely worried that your inexperienced and overconfident joke of a president is isolating your country from old allies and rolling out the red carpet for hostile foreign influence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beer Makers Who Used Other Breweries Are Opening Their Own", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChris Lohring surveyed America\u2019s beer scene in 2010 and decided to play the contrarian. Rather than mimic the popular and potent stouts and India pale ales, he would specialize in low-alcohol, high-taste \u201csession beers,\u201d as he called them.To lenders, though, the business plan held as much appeal as flat beer. So Mr. Lohring kept costs low by using established breweries in Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut to produce and package crisp pilsners and rustic farmhouse ales under his Notch Brewing label.Contract brewing, as it is known, was perfect for a start-up like his, requiring no expensive infrastructure. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing riskier than building a plant before the brand and the beers have been proven,\u201d said Mr. Lohring, who in 1993 helped found Tremont Brewery in Boston.But now, consumers are increasingly seeking beer at the source: Since 2010, sales at breweries and brew pubs have risen more than 500 percent, according to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Beer lovers routinely troop to breweries for releases of cans and bottles, and a sense of belonging to a particular place has become as important as the beer itself.That places contract brewers in a pickle. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a brewery, you\u2019re kind of homeless,\u201d said Mikkel Borg Bjergso, Mikkeller\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to show people.\u201dAs a result, many itinerant beer makers are dropping anchor, opening breweries with tasting rooms for thirsty patrons.And this month, Mr. Bjergso announced that he would create a brewery at Citi Field, home of the New York Mets. Scheduled to open this year, Mikkeller Brewing NYC will brew and can beers like its Say Hey Sally pilsner, served alongside food from Fuku and Pat LaFrieda. \u201cNext year at Citi Field, people will be drinking beer made at the ballpark,\u201d said Jim Raras Jr., Mikkeller NYC\u2019s executive vice president.\u201cSay you\u2019re sitting there as a contract brewer, and you\u2019ve got a million bucks,\u201d Mr. Lohring said. \u201cDo you spend the old-fashioned way with advertising and marketing, or do you spend a million bucks on a facility where you serve beer to consumers? It\u2019s a pretty easy decision.\u201dTaprooms also serve as consumer focus groups. Mr. Lohring uses his to test richly flavored Old World lagers and pale ales featuring new hop varieties. \u201cWe get immediate feedback from customers and sales,\u201d he said, \u201cand that informs us on our next steps.\u201dPreviously, fans passing through Rhode Island could visit only the brand\u2019s headquarters, then in Providence. Now Mr. Hellendrung can meet fans at the brewery, as he did recently with a North Carolina couple who stopped by while driving to Maine. \u201cWe were able to sit down and have a beer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just awesome to have a great conversation.\u201dAll the same, many of these beer companies still outsource much of their brewing.\u201cIt\u2019s great to produce an I.P.A. and serve it to customers within a week or two weeks instead of two months,\u201d Mr. Bjergso said. He can better adapt to fickle consumer tastes by making and selling popular I.P.A.s directly from the brewery. \u201cYou\u2019re able to give the customers a better experience if you\u2019re behind everything, instead of going to a supermarket or some random bar,\u201d Mr. Bjergso said. (Mikkeller and the other brewers still sell most of their beers in bars and stores.)Joe and Lauren Grimm, home brewers in Gowanus, Brooklyn, always wanted to build a hometown brewery. But a state law barred brewers from selling their wares on the premises \u2014 an essential source of revenue for many small brewers faced with high rents. So in 2013, the married couple started traveling as far afield as Massachusetts and Virginia to produce juicy I.P.A.s and hopped sour beers with their Grimm Artisanal Ales label.\u201cHalf the month we\u2019re not in Brooklyn,\u201d Ms. Grimm said.Though Grimm has grown into a popular Brooklyn brand, there is still a stigma attached to beer not brewed under its own roof. \u201cEvery time you drink a beer brewed under a contract basis, there\u2019s an asterisk,\u201d Mr. Grimm said.His wife added, \u201cA lot of people come up to me and say, \u2018Wow, the quality and consistency in your beers is amazing, even though you\u2019re gypsy brewing.\u2019\u201dA 2014 change in the law permitted taproom sales, and the Grimms are building a brewery in a former garage in East Williamsburg that they hope will start producing beer in August and serving it in September. The Grimms will bring most of their brewing in-house, aging sour ales in large oak foudres and fermenting beers with microbes captured in their backyard.Creative freedom like that is possible only when you\u2019re calling the shots. \u201cWith gypsy brewing, I\u2019ve always been working with one hand tied behind my back,\u201d said Brian Strumke, who founded the nomadic Stillwater Artisanal in 2010. \u201cThere are always limitations.\u201dHe is completing plans for a Greenpoint brewery, where he can produce beers banned at outside breweries, including ones fermented with wild yeast, which conventional brewers go to great lengths to keep out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a place that would let me can those beers, so now I\u2019m going to build one,\u201d Mr. Strumke said.\u201cSome people say: \u2018You\u2019re stupid. You have the most perfect business model,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jarnit-Bjergso said of his contract arrangement. \u201cI want to make Evil Twin a real New York brand.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to give something back,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Paradox of Mexico\u2019s Mass Graves", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrug cartels are widely believed to be behind the mass grave. Most of the victims are yet to be identified. A mother living a few blocks from the field said she had no idea it was there. In April, residents filed a complaint that the smell of rotting corpses being unearthed was seeping into their homes.At the same time, Mexico has a trillion-dollar economy and is the eighth-most-visited tourist destination on the planet. The government denies there is an armed conflict going on.How can we understand this paradox and classify this bloodshed? Is it simply a horrendous crime problem, or is it an actual war? The question is not merely academic \u2014 it affects real-life decisions, like those of judges who decide whether people fleeing the violence can be classified as refugees.The truth is that the conflict is neither just crime nor civil war, but a new hybrid type of organized violence. We will never understand its nature until Mexico truly investigates how these mass graves came about. And that investigation includes the role of the state itself.On Monday, the former governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte, was extradited from Guatemala to Mexico to face charges of working with organized crime and embezzling state funds during his tenure from 2010 to 2016, when the mass grave at Colinas de Santa Fe was discovered. Some of his top aides have also been arrested. When the size of the grave was revealed, the new state prosecutor, Jorge Winckler, told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that nobody knew what was going on here, with vehicles coming in and out. If that wasn\u2019t with the complicity of authorities, I don\u2019t know how it was done.\u201dThe site was discovered not by the police but by mothers searching for their disappeared children. One of them, Maria de Lourdes Rosales, was trying to find her son, a 25-year-old customs worker who was abducted by a group of gunmen in 2013. After the police found no trace of him, she joined other family members of the more than 30,000 people who have disappeared across the country to demand justice. \u201cYou live with great pain every day,\u201d Ms. Rosales told me. \u201cYou are missing something in your life, in your heart, in your soul, and your only goal is finding them.\u201dOne day, when a group of mothers were marching in protest, a car drew up and a mysterious man got out to give them a hand-drawn map showing where the mass grave was. The mothers went to the site and began digging. Only after they unearthed clothes and human bones did the state forensics teams take over.In June, the mothers found yet another mass grave in Veracruz State, after somebody sent a map to one of them on Facebook.The cartels make billions smuggling heroin, cocaine and crystal meth to America, as well as from a portfolio of rackets from kidnapping to oil theft. That money is used to bribe police and politicians, who in turn help the cartels to eliminate anyone who stands in their way to making more money. The victims are not only rival cartel operatives but also include customs workers who won\u2019t take bribes, inconvenient journalists and many who simply witnessed the wrong thing at the wrong time \u2014 \u201ccivilians,\u201d all.Yet at the same time, for many Mexicans, life goes on in apparent normality \u2014 with no tank battles or aerial bombardments. This is what separates the conflict from a civil war, even though the death toll is comparable. The pattern of killing is perhaps most similar to that of the death squads of a dictatorship. And in Colinas de Santa Fe, children could play obliviously while at their doorstep was a mass grave akin to those left by the Islamic State.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Search in Pennsylvania for 4 Missing Men Focuses on a Vast Farm", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver a two-day period starting last Wednesday night, four young men in Bucks County, a wealthy Philadelphia suburb where new construction meets large estates, disappeared.The first to vanish, Jimi Taro Patrick, 19, was last seen around 6 p.m. on Wednesday in Newtown Township, Pa., and did not show up for work the next day, the authorities said.On Friday around 6 p.m., Mark Sturgis, 22, told his father he was going to meet up with his longtime best friend, Tom Meo, 21, and that they would be ready for their construction jobs the next morning. They did not show up, and their cellphones went straight to voice mail.Dean Finocchiaro, 18, was last seen about 6:30 p.m. on Friday in Middletown Township.In the hours after the four men disappeared, the police departments and the district attorney\u2019s office in Bucks County \u2014 where violent crime is considered rare \u2014 cast a wide net, searching throughout the county and requesting the public\u2019s help on social media. On Saturday afternoon, the authorities got a break: Mr. Finocchiaro\u2019s cellphone was tracked to a vast farm off a country road in Solebury Township.On Monday, the police arrested the son of the farm\u2019s owners, Cosmo DiNardo, 20, on a prior felony weapons charge, according to court records. They also searched the farm with heavy equipment. Mr. DiNardo, who was being held on $1 million bail in the Bucks County Jail, had the charge initially dismissed in May. The authorities declined to say whether they believed Mr. DiNardo played a role in the disappearance of the four men.Efforts on Monday to reach Mr. DiNardo\u2019s parents or his lawyer by phone were unsuccessful.The officers who followed the cellphone signal on Saturday did not find the young men, but they did discover another clue. An early 1990s champagne-colored Nissan Maxima, which belonged to Mr. Meo, was there, according to Mark Potash, the father of Mr. Sturgis. The county\u2019s district attorney, Matthew Weintraub, immediately redirected the search team, bringing in all-terrain vehicles and heavy equipment for what was now considered a criminal investigation.\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of strong indications that this is where we need to focus our resources,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said at a news conference on Monday afternoon, about a half-mile from the search site. \u201cWe are trying to find needles in a haystack.\u201dWhile the bulk of the investigation has focused on the Solebury Township farm, the authorities have also searched the home of Mr. DiNardo, who lives in Bensalem, about 30 miles from his parents\u2019 property. The police also recovered Mr. Sturgis\u2019s car, a 2004 Nissan Altima, at an outdoor shopping mall, Mr. Potash said.Mr. Weintraub declined to say on Monday whether the men were believed to be alive. \u201cWe are not sure what we are going to find there, but we are pretty confident that the investigation is proceeding in the direction that we believed that it would,\u201d he said.Throughout the day on Monday, the parents of the missing men gathered near a cluster of police cars on the property, as investigators combed the farm for any signs of the men, Mr. Potash said. As helicopters circled overhead, the police used a backhoe to dig up part of the ground, including some concrete.After nearly a day\u2019s work, the police told the families that there were no signs of the men, but that they were confident they were searching in the right area, Mr. Potash said. He added that the authorities were doing a \u201ctremendous job\u201d of helping the families search for their children.\u201cIt\u2019s so horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never experienced anything so devastating in my life. I had to come home to try to get my head together.\u201dMr. Potash said that his son and Mr. Meo, who both work for his construction company, met a decade ago while attending school in Bensalem. He said he did not believe they knew Mr. Patrick, but added that he had overheard his son and Mr. Meo mention Mr. Finocchiaro by name.It is also unclear whether Mr. DiNardo has any connections to them. On Facebook, Mr. DiNardo is friends with Mr. Patrick, who disappeared last Wednesday.Mr. DiNardo was first arrested on a felony weapons charge in February because his history of mental illness prohibits him from possessing a weapon, The Associated Press reported, citing police records.Rich Turchi, a longtime friend, said that Mr. DiNardo worked in a concrete construction business owned by his father, and was a hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Mr. Turchi said of his friend\u2019s arrest on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s all fishy.\u201dAt the news conference on Monday, Mr. Weintraub said he would continue to devote significant resources to the case and stay at the farm until the search was complete. \u201cWe are not going to rest until we get through every inch of that property,\u201d he said.Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

In some cases, it can be career-ending because you never regain speed and side-to-side movement.\u201dMattek-Sands thanked her fans and her fellow players for their support, and she teared up as she discussed two memories from the episode on Thursday. One occurred when her husband, Justin Sands, held her head and reassured her. The other happened when Cirstea knelt over her on the court and told her that everything would be O.K.\u201cI think that\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mattek-Sands said, \u201cbecause we are all competitors on tour, and yet so many of the girls are my friends. And I think in that moment Sorana was there as my friend and it didn\u2019t matter that we were in the middle of a match.\u201dSeveral players, including Safarova and Novak Djokovic, expressed support for Mattek-Sands on social media, and Jack Sock, her mixed doubles partner, wrote her name on his shoes for his match on Friday.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s one that got away from me. I ask myself, \u2018What if I would have gotten to her?\u2019 all the time.\u201dMr. Cramsey, from Zionsville, Pa., was pulled over because of a crack in his truck\u2019s windshield, the police said. But Mr. Cramsey\u2019s lawyer said that his client was stopped because of the truck\u2019s pro-gun decals, which included a large image of cross hairs.\u201cI would never turn down somebody for help,\u201d Mr. Cramsey said. \u201cI would be a little more cautious with what I was taking in a vehicle. That\u2019s all I regret. That\u2019s it.\u201dAs part of the guilty plea, Mr. Cramsey forfeited his weapons, but his vehicle will be returned, said Thomas Zuppa Jr., an assistant prosecutor with the Hudson County prosecutor\u2019s office.The other people in the truck, Dean Smith and Kimberly Arendt, made deals with prosecutors this year to avoid a trial. They were accepted into a pretrial intervention program that could lead to the charges being dropped.Mr. Lisa said he would ask for a noncustodial sentence so Mr. Cramsey could avoid more prison time.\u201cHe\u2019s done what other people wish they had the courage to do,\u201d Mr. Lisa said. \u201cThe fact is that the plea offer was so good that we had to accept it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Newest Intellectual Antihero", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAfter the German historian Rolf Peter Sieferle took his own life last September at age 67, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the country\u2019s progressive paper of record, called his erudition \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d For three decades Mr. Sieferle had applied the old traditions of German social science to new preoccupations, from ecological sustainability to social capital. He was among the pioneers of German environmental history. He wrote on Marx, German conservatism around World War I and the end of Communism. He advised Angela Merkel\u2019s government on climate change.But last month, a posthumous collection of Mr. Sieferle\u2019s observations on Germany\u2019s political culture, \u201cFinis Germania\u201d (the title plays on a phrase meaning \u201cthe end of Germany\u201d), hit No. 9 on the prestigious Nonfiction Book of the Month list \u2014 and a scandal erupted. Certain passages on Germany\u2019s way of dealing with the Holocaust horrified reviewers. Die Zeit called it a book of \u201cbrazen obscenity.\u201d The Berliner Zeitung wrote of Mr. Sieferle\u2019s \u201cintellectual decline.\u201d S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung retracted its earlier praise. The Nonfiction Book of the Month list was suspended until further notice.The book-buying public reacted otherwise. As critical anger rose, so did sales. Soon the book was selling 250 copies an hour, according to its publisher, and ranked No. 1 on Amazon\u2019s German best-seller list, a position it held for almost two weeks, until the publisher ran out of copies.What exactly had Mr. Sieferle said? Was this a betrayal of his intellectual legacy, as critics claimed? A vindication of it, as his sales suggested? Or had he simply gone off the rails at a time when public opinion was doing the same?A socialist in his youth like most German intellectuals of the 1968 generation, Mr. Sieferle was drifting out of sync with that tradition by the 1990s. He came increasingly to aim his sarcasm at na\u00efve idealists. At the height of Germany\u2019s refugee crisis two summers ago, he wrote, \u201cA society that can no longer distinguish between itself and the forces that would dissolve it is living morally beyond its means.\u201d The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described him as \u201cembittered, humorless, ever more isolated.\u201dMr. Sieferle, who had once placed his books with the aristocrats of German publishing (Suhrkamp, Propyl\u00e4en, Fischer, Beck), became an outsider. \u201cFinis Germania\u201d was brought out by a small rightist press in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. Another posthumous book, \u201cDas Migrationsproblem\u201d (\u201cThe Migration Problem\u201d), which asks whether mass migration is compatible with a built-out welfare state, was published in February by a press that works with the contrarian quarterly Tumult. That book, too, is selling like hot cakes, standing around No. 250 on the German Amazon list.It is odd that \u201cFinis Germania\u201d was the book that took off. It is little more than a collection of notes on various subjects in the 1990s, some of the most controversial of which were previously published in more polished form.In \u201cFinis Germania,\u201d Mr. Sieferle rues that his own country is \u201ctragic,\u201d tangled up in history. He doesn\u2019t just rue it, he resents it. \u201cThere are un-tragic peoples,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhom history pearls off of like water from a well-polished boot.\u201d He means the English and Americans, who have always tried to pass off their oligarchies as cradles of democracy.After World War II, the Allied occupiers, as Mr. Sieferle sees it, saddled Germans with a false idea of their own history \u2014 the idea that there was something premodern about Germany, a fundamental difference between it and the West. That may describe Russia, but not Germany, and Germany\u2019s modernity is painful for Westerners to face. \u201cIf Germany belonged to the most progressive, civilized, cultivated countries,\u201d he writes, \u201cthen \u2018Auschwitz\u2019 means that, at any moment, the human \u2018progress\u2019 of modernity can go into reverse.\u201dMr. Sieferle neither denies nor minimizes the Holocaust. He describes it as a \u201cVerbrechen,\u201d or \u201ccrime.\u201d Nor does he traffic in any obvious kind of anti-Semitism. In a letter he wrote three weeks before his death to the blogger-novelist Michael Klonovsky, who is close to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, he warned the party to keep its distance from the anti-Semites (\u201ca delusional, irrational and ignorant ideology\u201d) who would inevitably gravitate to it.In this, Mr. Sieferle sees an \u201caffinity\u201d between Germans now and \u201cthe Jew as he was understood in the Christian past.\u201d Specifically, Jews were cast as either indifferent to or responsible for the crucifixion. In the eyes of today\u2019s world, German identity symbolizes a similar rejection of some kind of revelation. \u201cIn every city Christianity had built cathedrals to its murdered God,\u201d Mr. Sieferle writes. \u201cToday, the Jews, to whom God himself had promised eternity, build memorials throughout the world to their murdered coreligionists. Not only are the victims ascribed a moral superiority, the wrongdoers and their symbols are ascribed an eternal depravity.\u201dMr. Sieferle\u2019s is a complex argument. It is linked to his concern, in \u201cDas Migrationsproblem,\u201d with the challenges of mass migration. He believed that Germany\u2019s self-demonization had left it unable to say anything but yes to a million or so migrants seeking entry to Europe in 2015 and that such a welcome was unsustainable. Whether he was right or wrong, this was a concern shared by many Germans, and not necessarily an idle expression of animus.But wrested from its context, Mr. Sieferle\u2019s argument can sound thoroughly offensive. The magazine Der Spiegel summed it up as \u201cthe Germans are the new Jews.\u201d Critics have mostly denounced rather than engaged Mr. Sieferle\u2019s views. It is worth noting that if the German culture of \u201cVergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung\u201d (or \u201ccoming to terms with the past\u201d) limits open discussion, that is because it is meant to. Many Germans, who are often sincerely frightened of themselves, are grateful it did.Some are not. R\u00fcdiger Safranski, a prominent historian of philosophy, defended Mr. Sieferle\u2019s work as being in the poetic tradition of Heinrich Heine and Edward Young. The Tumult editor Frank B\u00f6ckelmann predicted on his Facebook page that as Mr. Sieferle\u2019s works come back into print, he will be acknowledged as \u201cone of the great thinkers of our time.\u201d That will depend on whether he is taken for a bigot or a courageous blasphemer.Whatever becomes of Mr. Sieferle\u2019s reputation, the scandal around him reveals certain unsuspected problems. When the German literary establishment unanimously denounced Mr. Sieferle\u2019s work as an extremist tract, readers did not nod in agreement. They pulled out their wallets and said, \u201cThat must be the book for me.\u201d This is a sign that distrust of authority in Germany has reached worrisome levels, possibly American ones.Christopher Caldwell, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, is at work on a book about the rise and fall of the post-1960s political order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rural Resilience After a Devastating Flood", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 17______Was this really the same place that had been devastated by flooding a few months ago after Cyclone Debbie?First, I searched for images and video from the flooding just to confirm I was in the right place, and sure enough, there was the central business district, under muddy water. Where I stood, near a truck selling fresh meat pies, had been swimming in sediment just 13 weeks earlier.Crossing a bridge over the now-calm river that had overflowed, I wandered into a mental health agency figuring someone there could give me a sense of the town\u2019s recovery.There a half dozen people (the ones at the top of this newsletter) gathered around a table of food. They told me I\u2019d stumbled upon the first meeting of the Flood Survivors Social Support Group, a new informal drop-in session for people in need of assistance because of the disaster.\u201cThere\u2019s formal support but not very much informal help,\u201d said Sarah McCormick, 41, one of the group\u2019s founders. \u201cThere\u2019s still people who \u2014 even after the cut off dates for aid \u2014 are only now getting their heads around things.\u201dThat morning, for example, a man named Walter had come in asking about the free mattress program set up by the local Catholic Diocese. About 1,500 mattresses had already been given out but Walter still didn\u2019t have a place to sleep, and needed one. Ms. McCormick said she\u2019d be calling on his behalf to work it out.Alongside the mattresses, people donated clothing and money flowed in as well. A team of chaplains are still doing regular house calls to check on families\u2019 spiritual and emotional needs. There was a program to give people new refrigerators and other appliances.Ms. McCormick and the other volunteers made clear that there was also a fair amount of frustration. One insurer seemed to have included a clause in its contracts that allowed it to avoid paying certain claims. Some residential property owners seemed to have received more government help than others, which led to some grumbling. The group also estimated that 15 to 20 percent of businesses were still closed, including some banks.Still, walking through town, eyeing the marks on utility poles showing the high-water mark from previous floods, it was hard not to notice the strength of the recovery. I\u2019ve covered hurricanes in Florida and earthquakes in Haiti and Mexico. Rarely have I seen such a full revival so quickly.At least in Lismore, Australia\u2019s overall wealth and community can-do spirit seem to have created a dynamic of rapid resilience. In the United States and other countries I have worked in, it\u2019s easier to fall from the middle class to destitution, especially in rural areas that struggle with some of the same agricultural churn as Lismore \u2014 where timber has died, dairy is dying and the macadamia industry can only do so much.Even the support group seemed torn between advocating for improvement, and appreciating the capacity to rebuild.\u201cYou do get positives along with the negatives,\u201d said Doug Ribley, 72, a lay minister with the Anglican Church here. \u201cWhen a store reopens, it gets out on social media to go out and support them, and we do. There\u2019s just a lot more interaction in the community.\u201dIs what I saw in Lismore typical?Now here\u2019s my weekly roundup of New York Times stories, and a recommendation from my recent travels \u2014 also drawn from readers, like you!__________________Nestled into a very small town up in the hills about 20 minutes drive out of Byron, it\u2019s an oasis of fine Japanese cooking founded by two Japanese entrepreneurs who just opened a new outpost in Beijing.

{"Headline": "Please Prove You\u2019re Not a Robot", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen science fiction writers first imagined robot invasions, the idea was that bots would become smart and powerful enough to take over the world by force, whether on their own or as directed by some evildoer. In reality, something only slightly less scary is happening. Robots are getting better, every day, at impersonating humans. When directed by opportunists, malefactors and sometimes even nation-states, they pose a particular threat to democratic societies, which are premised on being open to the people.Robots posing as people have become a menace. For popular Broadway shows (need we say \u201cHamilton\u201d?), it is actually bots, not humans, who do much and maybe most of the ticket buying. Shows sell out immediately, and the middlemen (quite literally, evil robot masters) reap millions in ill-gotten gains.Philip Howard, who runs the Computational Propaganda Research Project at Oxford, studied the deployment of propaganda bots during voting on Brexit, and the recent American and French presidential elections. Twitter is particularly distorted by its millions of robot accounts; during the French election, it was principally Twitter robots who were trying to make #MacronLeaks into a scandal. Facebook has admitted it was essentially hacked during the American election in November. In Michigan, Mr. Howard notes, \u201cjunk news was shared just as widely as professional news in the days leading up to the election.\u201dRobots are also being used to attack the democratic features of the administrative state. This spring, the Federal Communications Commission put its proposed revocation of net neutrality up for public comment. In previous years such proceedings attracted millions of (human) commentators. This time, someone with an agenda but no actual public support unleashed robots who impersonated (via stolen identities) hundreds of thousands of people, flooding the system with fake comments against federal net neutrality rules.To be sure, today\u2019s impersonation-bots are different from the robots imagined in science fiction: They aren\u2019t sentient, don\u2019t carry weapons and don\u2019t have physical bodies. Instead, fake humans just have whatever is necessary to make them seem human enough to \u201cpass\u201d: a name, perhaps a virtual appearance, a credit-card number and, if necessary, a profession, birthday and home address. They are brought to life by programs or scripts that give one person the power to imitate thousands.The problem is almost certain to get worse, spreading to even more areas of life as bots are trained to become better at mimicking humans. Given the degree to which product reviews have been swamped by robots (which tend to hand out five stars with abandon), commercial sabotage in the form of negative bot reviews is not hard to predict. In coming years, campaign finance limits will be (and maybe already are) evaded by robot armies posing as \u201csmall\u201d donors. And actual voting is another obvious target \u2014 perhaps the ultimate target.So far, we\u2019ve been content to leave the problem to the tech industry, where the focus has been on building defenses, usually in the form of Captchas (\u201ccompletely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart\u201d), those annoying \u201ctype this\u201d tests to prove you are not a robot. But leaving it all to industry is not a long-term solution. For one thing, the defenses don\u2019t actually deter impersonation bots, but perversely reward whoever can beat them. And perhaps the greatest problem for a democracy is that companies like Facebook and Twitter lack a serious financial incentive to do anything about matters of public concern, like the millions of fake users who are corrupting the democratic process. Twitter estimates at least 27 million probably fake accounts; researchers suggest the real number is closer to 48 million, yet the company does little about the problem.The ideal anti-robot campaign would employ a mixed technological and legal approach. Improved robot detection might help us find the robot masters or potentially help national security unleash counterattacks, which can be necessary when attacks come from overseas. There may be room for deputizing private parties to hunt down bad robots. A simple legal remedy would be a \u201c Blade Runner\u201d law that makes it illegal to deploy any program that hides its real identity to pose as a human. Automated processes should be required to state, \u201cI am a robot.\u201d When dealing with a fake human, it would be nice to know.Using robots to fake support, steal tickets or crash democracy really is the kind of evil that science fiction writers were warning about. The use of robots takes advantage of the fact that political campaigns, elections and even open markets make humanistic assumptions, trusting that there is wisdom or at least legitimacy in crowds and value in public debate. But when support and opinion can be manufactured, bad or unpopular arguments can win not by logic but by a novel, dangerous form of force \u2014 the ultimate threat to every democracy.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thai Dishes, Beloved and Rare, at Playground in Woodside, Queens", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosThe red weaver ant larvae are creamy white, clinging and plump. In the low light, they look as harmless as quinoa. They deflate softly in the mouth, somewhere between a squish and a pop, tasting faintly of the mango leaves their parents once fed on.At Playground, a dark, narrow Thai restaurant in Woodside, Queens, the grubs are imported from the Isan region in Thailand\u2019s northeast, where they\u2019re a traditional source of protein, often priced higher than pork or beef, and can account for nearly a third of a rural household\u2019s income. Farmers shake nests into baskets at the end of bamboo poles \u2014 the longer the better, to avoid bites \u2014 then dump them into buckets of water. The larvae sink while the adults clamber out. (Inevitably the bodies of a few drowned ants get mixed in.)This isn\u2019t a dare. It\u2019s a homey, beloved Isan dish, rarely seen in the restaurants of New York. Here, the larvae are presented raw in a salad with the same ingredients as laab: nam pla (fish sauce), stinging lime, a crackle of roasted rice powder, crumpled mint and cilantro, and enough chiles to paralyze conversation.Although she didn\u2019t feel prepared to carry on the business alone, she persevered, dedicating the basement karaoke area to private parties and, last year, opening an Isan-style hot-pot restaurant on the second floor. Stairs in the back let her run back and forth between kitchens. On a typical day, she comes in at 5 p.m. and stays until the doors close at 4 a.m.The microphones may be stowed away and the Thai pop songs confined to a TV, but Playground still draws a Thai crowd. They come for $3 Singha beers during a happy hour that stretches from opening time until 1 a.m., and for dishes that make no concessions to Western palates.A meal here could be nothing but salads, although that\u2019s too meek a word for the likes of profoundly funky bamboo shoots; broken rice croquettes streaked with red curry paste; and crunchy raw shrimp, shining from fish sauce and lime, adorned with half-cloves of garlic the size of shark teeth and crushed chiles, not a seed left behind. Morning glory, bright green inside crispy shells of tempura flour, is meant to be dunked in a sauce that\u2019s almost a curry unto itself, heavy with squid, shrimp and ground pork.One night, I ordered som tam (papaya salad) with pla raa, a famously pungent pickled fish sauce. The waitress said, \u201cReally?\u201d and smiled. When it arrived, she put it slightly to the side, warning, \u201cThe smell is strong.\u201d It was a step into another dimension, tasting like the ocean boiled down until it gave up the secrets of the depths.More familiar to Westerners is pad kra pao, stir-fried holy basil, which here gains briny contours from jellylike century eggs, the yolks gone black. (The Thai name, khai yiao ma, translates literally as \u201chorse urine egg.\u201d) A thrillingly sour curry is topped by triangles of omelet threaded with fernlike chaom, whose leaves have a sulfurous stench when raw \u2014 according to one Thai botanist, they should never be placed near pet mynah birds, lest the birds die from the fumes \u2014 but turn gentle and nutty in the pan.The servers may ask, as they often do at Thai restaurants around town, \u201cHow spicy?\u201d This is a serious question, with no intent to condescend. When my table voiced a love of heat, our waitress suggested 5 on a scale of 10, which sounded conservative. It was more than enough to make us feel alive.Sadly, ant larvae aren\u2019t always available. \u201cDepends on the season,\u201d Ms. Yingyong said. \u201cIf it rains.\u201d As a consolation, there are silkworms and grasshoppers, deep-fried and accompanied by a sauce oddly reminiscent of the glaze on Buffalo wings.Note that they aren\u2019t dainty. The grasshoppers look as if trapped in the path of Mount Vesuvius, ossified instantly. They taste of little but crunch, although the legs are big enough to tickle as they go down.Advertisement"}

But after working for five years in an Ohio machine shop and experimenting with improvised string instruments in his spare time, he finally found his true calling when he was about 30.Abandoning metal for wood, he began a quest to perfect the kind of fretted musical instrument he had dabbled with since he was 13, in his case a C-1 model Gibson.Self-taught and by then living in Houston, he learned on the job largely by fixing other people\u2019s instruments before venturing to build acoustic guitars on his own in his two-bedroom apartment, making machine parts for them as well.\u201cThe first few guitars I made primarily for the challenge of it,\u201d he recalled, \u201cbut I knew that I was doing what I wanted to do.\u201dBeginning in 1979, Mr. Collings\u2019s company produced some 20,000 guitars for many of the world\u2019s most accomplished rock, country, jazz and folk musicians, including Keith Richards, Pete Townshend, Joni Mitchell, Eddie Van Halen, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, Bill Frisell and Emmylou Harris.His company later branched out into mandolins, electric guitars, concert and tenor ukuleles, and custom guitar cases, becoming a leader in mass-produced musical instruments.Business grew at first mostly by word of mouth. In the late 1980s, Mr. Collings produced two dozen custom guitars for George Gruhn, a vintage collector and retailer in Nashville, under the Gruhn logo. He then began placing his own surname in distinctive script on the headstock of every instrument crafted in his shop.He explained that making a single Collings guitar takes about 20 craftsmen more than 35 days working in a climate-controlled plant in Austin (temperature 72 degrees, humidity 48 percent). The company turns out about six acoustics, three electrics, two mandolins and two ukuleles every day, or more than 3,000 a year.A new Collings guitar ranges in price from about $3,300 to about $13,500.Mr. Collings is survived by his wife, the former Ann Shaughness; his daughter, Sara Thomas; and his sisters, Martha Howell and Laura Putnam.William Ralph Collings was born Aug. 9, 1948, in Midland, Mich., to Wallace Collings and the former Angeline Commora, and was raised in suburban Cleveland.He left the Ohio machine shop for Houston, where he worked for an oil field pipeline company during the day and indulged his passion at night.He made his first guitar, a hybrid composite of a Gibson Dove, a Martin D-28 and a Guild D-25, from Brazilian rosewood on his kitchen table using a hand saw, hammer, chisel and plane.\u201cIt looked like nothing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Mr. Lovett told Premier Guitar. \u201cIt was a Martin 000-shaped cutaway with wood binding, and I thought, \u2018What kind of Martin is that?\u2019\u201dAfter learning that it had been made by Mr. Collings, Mr. Lovett called him to repair the frets on his own Martin D-35.\u201cHis guitars have personality,\u201d Mr. Lovett said in a company video. \u201cThe sound is full of energy, just like Bill Collings is.\u201dAfter building about 50 more guitars, Mr. Collings was heading to California when he stopped in Austin. There he met the luthiers Tom Ellis and Mike Stevens and decided to move into their shop instead of continuing on to the West Coast. He hired his first employee in 1989. The roster eventually grew to nearly 100, but each instrument got personal attention.\u201cIf you have great wood but not a great design or great craftsmanship, you\u2019ll get a dead guitar,\u201d Mr. Collings told Texas Monthly. \u201cIf you have bad wood, your guitar will be O.K. but never great.\u201dCollings guitars are usually fabricated from ebony, Indian rosewood, mahogany and quilted maple, which is sanded repeatedly between 12 coats of nitrocellulose lacquer.\u201cCan you pick the perfect piece of wood? No, but you can get really close,\u201d Mr. Collings said in the company video. \u201cCan you make it the perfect thickness? No, but you can get really close. Can you scientifically do it? No, but you can get close. So we do it all \u2014 buy the best wood, intuitively making a judgment on it, weighing it, banging on it, and roughly coming to the right thickness.\u201dStill, he was never fully satisfied.\u201cSuccess is succession, over and over and over, and it comes from failure,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure, failure, failure \u2014 knowing that if you stop, you\u2019re done.\u201dAn obituary on July 30 about the guitar maker Bill Collings referred incorrectly to the Gibson C-1 guitar. Elvis Presley did not play one on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Thank you!Weeks later, Ms. Tsai revived her moribund Twitter account, posting regularly in English and sometimes in Japanese. Since then, her followers have nearly tripled.Her office says her rekindled interest was spurred by outreach from Twitter itself, not by the Trump episode. But there are certain parallels between Ms. Tsai and President Trump. Where Mr. Trump uses the service to bypass what he considers a biased news establishment and to address the public directly, Ms. Tsai appears to see it as a means to circumvent the diplomatic isolation imposed by China.\u201cFrankly, Taiwan\u2019s future is tenuous, and their international space is increasingly limited at a time when they need their voice to be heard more than ever,\u201d Ms. Cave said.China claims self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory, and its diplomatic relations with other countries are conditional on their agreement not to recognize the island as independent. That has led to Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the United Nations and other international forums.Only 20 countries maintain formal relations with Taiwan, a list that has shrunk by two since Ms. Tsai took office in May 2016. She has resisted demands from Beijing that she endorse the so-called One China principle, which holds that Taiwan and China are part of a single country, although each side has its own views on how that country is defined.Describing the past few months of Twitter diplomacy as \u201cfairly successful,\u201d Mr. Chao said that the number of people who follow the account had risen since January from 36,800 to more than 100,000. They include foreign journalists and others who can communicate Taiwan\u2019s positions.\u201cIt\u2019s followed by journalists from most major publications from around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIncreasingly, we\u2019re seeing interest from politicians in the U.S., Japan and other democracies.\u201dAlex Huang, a spokesman for the Presidential Office, noted, \u201cThe broad role of this is to increase international exposure for the president and Taiwan.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a core group of people working on Twitter that have been with President Tsai for quite a while, and we also have people who provide input from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other government agencies on specific issues,\u201d he said.For her part, Ms. Cave said, \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets are clearly crafted for an international audience.\u201d She added: \u201cMost of her tweets are concerned with foreign affairs, and given how little international media the president has done since she took office, it has become the primary vehicle to keep track of Taiwan\u2019s international priorities and how the president sees cross-strait relations.\u201dAlthough Twitter is blocked in China, some citizens who employ virtual private networks to bypass their country\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d are clearly following Ms. Tsai\u2019s account, and even the state news media is taking note.Mr. Chao said that when Ms. Tsai wrote her Tiananmen anniversary messages, \u201cthere were a lot of Chinese netizens that posted comments saying, \u2018We hope you can help encourage China to become democratic,\u2019\u201d while others were critical. \u201cWe also had Chinese people saying, \u2018This has nothing to do with Taiwan.\u2019\u201dMr. Chao welcomed the new online arena for cross-strait engagement.\u201cIt\u2019s not just Chinese people being angry at President Tsai,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully they see it as an area where they can freely discuss their views on different situations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She wondered if she had come to the right place. Yelp reviewers rated the bar as one of Brooklyn\u2019s best stops for gluten-free beer.\u201cWe have cider?\u201d he suggested.This is the life of a gluten-intolerant person in New York.For night owls who can tolerate gluten, an evening out might include happy hour draft specials, dumplings or a $1 slice, none of which are easy options for those who are allergic to wheat or have celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder, which means consuming gluten can result in damage to the small intestine.Despite these risks, New York is one of the best places to live without gluten, said Jessica Hanson, organizer of the New York City Celiac Disease Meetup group.You just need to know where to look, so we\u2019re here to help.The \u201cFind Me Gluten Free\u201d app can be helpful for preliminary research, but because levels of intolerance can vary and restaurants aren\u2019t always consistent with allergen precautions, consumers should call and verify kitchen standards. For example, ask if bread is cooked in a separate oven or if a gluten-free dish has a designated prep area. These concerns can exist at bars, too.Glasses should go through a dishwasher, or at least get washed twice in a sink, said Leah Moss, a Brooklyn bartender who has celiac disease. Ms. Moss suggested asking bartenders upfront if they can double-wash the glass, and then tipping them extra.Gluten-free drinks usually cost more, but \u201cyou\u2019re paying for the extra safety precaution,\u201d Ms. Hanson said.There are bars \u2014 like Spritzenhaus 33 in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and South in South Slope, Brooklyn \u2014 that serve gluten-free beers at no extra charge.

{"Headline": "Long After Protests, Students Shun the University of Missouri", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBIA, Mo. \u2014 In the fall of 2015, a grassy quadrangle at the center of the University of Missouri became known nationwide as the command center of an escalating protest.It was a moment of triumph for the protesting students. But it has been a disaster for the university.Freshman enrollment at the Columbia campus, the system\u2019s flagship, has fallen by more than 35 percent in the two years since.The university administration acknowledges that the main reason is a backlash from the events of 2015, as the campus has been shunned by students and families put off by, depending on their viewpoint, a culture of racism or one where protesters run amok.Before the protests, the university, fondly known as Mizzou, was experiencing steady growth and building new dormitories. Now, with budget cuts due to lost tuition and a decline in state funding, the university is temporarily closing seven dormitories and cutting more than 400 positions, including those of some nontenured faculty members, through layoffs and by leaving open jobs unfilled.Few areas have been spared: The library is even begging for books.\u201cThe general consensus was that it was because of the aftermath of what happened in November 2015,\u201d said Mun Choi, the new system president, referring to the climax of the demonstrations. \u201cThere were students from both in state and out of state that just did not apply, or those who did apply but decided not to attend.\u201dStudents of all races have shunned Missouri, but the drop in freshman enrollment last fall was strikingly higher among blacks, at 42 percent, than among whites, at 21 percent. (A racial breakdown was not yet available for this fall\u2019s freshman class.)Black students were already a small minority. They made up 10 percent of the freshman class in 2012, a proportion that fell to just 6 percent last fall.Whitney Matewe, a black student from McKinney, Tex., who will be a senior in the fall, said that after the protests, her parents asked if she wanted to transfer, but she decided to stay because she is in Missouri\u2019s prestigious journalism school.But, she said, she understands why black students might not apply to a campus where they are all but invisible. A friend\u2019s boyfriend obliviously told her she looked like Aunt Jemima, and she was dismayed that her friend did not object.\u201cBeing \u2018the other\u2019 in every classroom and every situation is exhausting,\u201d she said.By sheer numbers, the drop in white students has caused the greatest damage, since they make up a majority of those on campus.Tyler Morris, a white student from St. Louis, said he was afraid of being stereotyped as a bigot if he went to Missouri. So he decided to go to Missouri Valley College, \u201cjust down the road\u201d in Marshall.\u201cThe discrimination wasn\u2019t against white people, but I didn\u2019t want to be that person who I guess was stereotyped because I was white,\u201d he said.College counselors said that Missouri might have a hard time recovering from protests because its reputation was largely regional. \u201cWhy would a student from New Jersey go to the University of Missouri instead of Rutgers or Penn State?\u201d said Steven Roy Goodman, an independent college admissions counselor in Washington.Even in-state students for whom Mizzou is a family tradition are choosing to go elsewhere, including public universities in neighboring states, like Illinois and Arkansas, which offer preferential tuition or scholarships to Missouri students.Aly Zuhler\u2019s mother and cousins went to Missouri, and her mother would have liked for her to go there as well, she said. But Ms. Zuhler, who is Jewish and grew up in suburban St. Louis, said she could not stomach going to a place where blacks and Jews might feel unwelcome.A plant sciences professor, Craig Roberts, said that Missouri was suffering not because it was more racist than other places, but because the rage that had been repressed on other campuses burst into the open.\u201cIt was sparked at Mizzou by Ferguson,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.The post went viral and the outcry escalated through what has become known in the protest world as \u201cintersectionality,\u201d grievances that gain potency by being bundled together. There were demonstrations against racism, and to support Planned Parenthood, which was under attack by state lawmakers.Days later a drunken white student jumped onstage during a rehearsal by an African-American group and used a racial slur.This was followed by the failure of the university president, Timothy M. Wolfe, to get out of his car to speak with demonstrators during the homecoming parade in October, drawing accusations of indifference. Then the swastika appeared.A movement, Concerned Student 1950, commemorating the year the first black student was admitted to the university, grew out of the protests and set up a tent city. On Nov. 2, a graduate student, Jonathan Butler, began a hunger strike, spurred by the complaints of racial animosity and official inaction, as well as a cut in graduate student health care funding.In the minds of many, her outburst and the resignations became symbols of a hair-trigger protest culture lacking any adult control.The university, they added, had shown a \u201ccomplete lack of leadership,\u201d and their two younger children had \u201call but eliminated Mizzou from their college list.\u201dThe email was forwarded to Ellen de Graffenreid, vice chancellor for marketing and communications, with a brief note saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure you already know this but you have a P.R. nightmare on your hands.\u201d Ms. de Graffenreid, in turn, forwarded it to other administrators with a note saying, \u201cThis is pretty representative of the middle of the road people we are losing.\u201dWhile freshman enrollment has plummeted, students already at Missouri have not transferred out in large numbers \u2014 a sign, administrators said, that the protests looked worse from the outside. Christian Basi, a spokesman, said the university was formulating a marketing campaign to correct what he called \u201cmisperceptions\u201d about the extent of the unrest.The tent city has been restored to a well-manicured emerald field of grass, but all around campus, signs of the university\u2019s suffering are evident.To soften the financial blow, some vacant dorm rooms \u2014 spartan suites of two rooms of two single beds, sharing a bathroom and with no TV, are being rented for $120 a night for events like homecoming, the fall family visit and the football game against Auburn University, a Southern rival.Some faculty members are still hoping that the situation can be turned around.\u201cI think we squandered a rare opportunity that we had to be a local, regional, national, global leader in terms of showing how a university can deal with its problems, including related to race relations,\u201d Berkley Hudson, a journalism professor, said.The protests could have been turned into an asset \u2014 a chance to celebrate diversity. \u201cWe still can,\u201d he said.videoAdvertisement"}

If the Trump administration has an intellectual godfather, it\u2019s David Horowitz.Blacks as criminals, blacks as role models \u2014 it\u2019s hard to get further apart than this. Yet for a country that seems riven in two, the Horowitzes offer a measure of hope. They email, they talk, they get together for family celebrations. When David went to college campuses to denounce things that Ben believes in, Ben paid for his bodyguard.To understand all might not be to forgive all, but it\u2019s a start. David and Ben both said they have made a major effort to see where the other is coming from. While no one\u2019s politics have changed, they realized they are not quite as far apart as it might seem.\u201cOne thing we mostly see eye-to-eye on is that the most important thing is the ability of an individual to live his life and have an opportunity,\u201d said Ben, 51. \u201cHow he went from \u2018The way to do that is Communism\u2019 to \u2018The way to do that is Trump\u2019 is amazing.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re not aligned.\u201dDavid said he is glad he never foisted his beliefs on Ben or his other children the way Phil and Blanche\u2019s relentless adherence to the Communist doctrine pushed David into the cause long ago. If the revolution has a few less soldiers this way, so be it.\u201cI\u2019ve come to the end of the story,\u201d said David, 78. \u201cI don\u2019t mistake the life I\u2019ve lived for the only life.\u201dIt\u2019s not that simple, of course.\u201cSometimes people try to connect us on Twitter, which is always scary,\u201d said Ben. \u201cSomeone will say, \u2018Hey, aren\u2019t you related to @horowitz39?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s David\u2019s handle on Twitter, where he says things like \u201cObama is an American traitor\u201d and \u201cHillary killed four Americans in Benghazi.\u201d\u201cI never reply,\u201d Ben said.In the horse country northwest of Los Angeles, it\u2019s a glorious day. David Horowitz and his fourth wife, April, live here inside a remote gated community. There are two horses and, making a terrible racket, several dogs. Gardeners are working on the lawn.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me if they\u2019re illegal,\u201d David said with a laugh.The house is only remote physically. The computer in the other room is always calling, bringing forth updates, denunciations, the ongoing political spectacle. \u201cHow can you feel isolated when you\u2019re connected all the time?\u201d David asked.He chronicled his family\u2019s penchant for revolution in his 1997 autobiography, \u201cRadical Son,\u201d one of the most prominent of a long shelf of volumes. His first effort, \u201cStudent,\u201d about the embryonic turmoil on college campuses, appeared when Kennedy was president. In 1968, he became an editor and writer for Ramparts, the radical magazine that nurtured and reflected the era\u2019s unrest.\u201cThe system cannot be revitalized; it must be overthrown. As humanely as possible, but by any means necessary,\u201d Ramparts proclaimed in a 1970 editorial. David says he was the one who insisted on adding the \u201chumanely\u201d part.Ramparts published Che Guevara\u2019s diaries, went after the C.I.A. and offered a tutorial on how not to pay taxes. Its international editor was Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver, who fled to Cuba in 1968 after leading an ambush of Oakland, Calif., police officers. Thanks in a large part to Ramparts, the charismatic and photogenic Panthers soon embodied the notion of revolution for white radicals.David found a political soul mate in Panther leader Huey Newton. He immersed himself in the Panthers\u2019 home base of Oakland, raising money to buy a 35-classroom school that would be a showcase for the cause. Even for that freewheeling era, Ben had an unusual boyhood. It would shape his life, friendships, marriage and work. His best friend, who would later be best man at his wedding, was black. He was one of the few white kids on the Berkeley High football team. Every Sunday, he went to the Son of Man Temple, the Black Panther church in the auditorium of the school.\u201cI know all the songs from there,\u201d Ben said, and as proof, started singing the old gospel hymn adopted by the Panthers, \u201cWe are soldiers in the army \u2026\u201dDavid said: \u201cBen is practically black.\u201dBen laughed when this was repeated to him, something he does frequently when talking about his father. \u201cI hate it when my father talks, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged its broad truth.When the Panthers needed someone to keep their finances, David recommended a white friend named Betty Van Patter. In late 1974, she disappeared. A few weeks later, her body was found in San Francisco Bay. Her head had been bashed. While the murder was never officially solved, David held the Panthers responsible and said Mr. Newton confirmed it years later.The person he really blamed, however, was himself. The Panthers, he concluded, were thugs dressed up as revolutionaries, but the Left was too wrapped up in its dreams to be honest about it. David became unglued. He bought a sporty Datsun 260Z, had an affair, divorced his wife Elissa after nearly two decades of marriage and barely escaped with his life when a train smashed up the car.A photo from this era shows Ben and his two sisters perched with their father on the Datsun. David stares at the camera. Ben looks at the ground, morose.\u201cI was a very sensitive kid, supersensitive,\u201d Ben said. \u201cHe was loud and intense. Which is why I ended up spending so much time with my mom.\u201d (Elissa Horowitz declined to be interviewed for this story.)In 1976, David wrote with his friend Peter Collier his most popular book, a history of the Rockefeller family. Phil Horowitz, a believer to the end, asked his son why he wasn\u2019t writing about the revolution instead.By 1984, he was voting for Ronald Reagan.Like the sons of many prominent fathers, Ben spent a long time trying both to understand and escape his father. He studied computer science, a subject his father had no interest in, at Columbia University and then the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1990, a connection of David\u2019s helped Ben get an interview at SGI, a pioneering computer graphics company.Even the tech world, a place that celebrates straight-talking, found Ben a little too direct. \u201cEvery now and then, I had to help him better understand how to navigate,\u201d said Ken Coleman, his SGI mentor and one of the few black executives in the tech industry. SGI managers actually had a meeting about firing Ben but did not go through with it.After SGI came Netscape, the iconic internet browser company. It was here that Ben first acquired a reputation as a manager.\u201cIn Silicon Valley, people always say that an extroverted engineer is one who stares at your shoes rather than his own,\u201d said Greg Sands, a Netscape colleague. \u201cBen was an engineer, which meant he had a bit of an awkward user interface, but perhaps his life as an outsider generated empathy. He could get people to work together.\u201dAt Netscape, Ben met his future business partner, Marc Andreessen. They went on to start a data storage company called Loudcloud, which had many near-death experiences before it was successfully sold to Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion in 2007.As Ben became more successful, he eclipsed his father.David spent much of his energy attacking universities, which he considered hotbeds of misguided leftist thought. During one campus visit, he did a radio interview where the host made a personal observation about David that he considered untrue; he doesn\u2019t remember what. Lies deserve lies, he figured, and immediately blasted back: \u201cAt least I\u2019m not a child molester like you.\u201dBen heard this story from the bodyguard, who was ferrying David as the phone interview was taking place. \u201cI nearly crashed the car,\u201d he said.David was unrepentant: \u201cYou gotta fight fire with fire.\u201dIn 2009, Ben and Mr. Andreessen formed their venture capital firm, which today has $6 billion under management. By then, Ben had managed to tone himself down.\u201cWith my father, everything was an argument to the death,\u201d he said. \u201cMy bar for \u2018inflammatory\u2019 was so high.\u201dDavid declined to follow suit and moderate his own rhetoric, which meant he was largely ignored by both the right and the left. By 2012, the Jewish magazine Tablet could run a profile with the headline, \u201cDavid Horowitz Is Homeless.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been ghettoized,\u201d he told the magazine.Then came Mr. Trump. When Jeff Sessions was a Republican senator from Alabama, he participated several times in events at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, which describes itself as combating \u201cthe efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Sessions got an award from the center. Stephen Miller, a top White House aide, has been relying on David for advice since he was a student battling the administrators at Santa Monica High School.Last October, Chris Ruddy, a good friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, commissioned David to write a book about how the right could mobilize to defeat President Clinton. It was taken as a given that she would win the election.The plan was to publish the book a few days before her inauguration. David began with a section called \u201cThe Adversary.\u201d Hillary, of course.\u201cI can do that almost in my sleep,\u201d he said.When Trump surprised the world by winning, the book was quickly retooled into \u201cBig Agenda: President Trump\u2019s Plan to Save America,\u201d although much of it was still about how Mrs. Clinton and Democrats were the adversaries. \u201cThe strategy,\u201d David wrote, \u201cis to go for the jugular.\u201d The book was on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for 11 weeks.\u201cWhat I like about Trump is he\u2019s not your typical Republican,\u201d David said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter.\u201dA fighter, as it happens, in the style of David Horowitz. In decades of public speaking, David honed an in-your-face approach. He said he picked it up from his former comrades on the left.\u201cIf you\u2019re nuanced and you speak in what I would call an intellectual manner, you get eaten alive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great handicap to be talking like accountants while the opposition are making moral indictments.\u201dHaving politics so deeply part of your identity used to be unusual, said Daniel Oppenheimer, who wrote \u201cExit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century\u201d about David Horowitz, Ronald Reagan and a few others. The core identity of most people was community, family and religion. But as these other parts of society withered, politics filled the void.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which we\u2019re all David Horowitz now,\u201d said Mr. Oppenheimer. \u201cWe\u2019re all amateur political pundits, and we\u2019re all less willing to compromise. That doesn\u2019t bode well for our future.\u201dSand Hill Road is the short, architecturally undistinguished strip just west of Palo Alto, Calif., where the venture capitalists hang out. As an incubator of revolutions, Sand Hill has had a longer and more successful run than Berkeley ever did in the 1960s. Companies from Amazon to Google were funded here.Mr. Andreessen, as it happened, did not want Ben to articulate a case for his Trump-supporting father. \u201cMarc said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Ben recalled.But his father asked him, and so there was Ben on a couch in his Sand Hill office, mulling the unexpected confluence of race, politics and technology that is the Horowitz family. In case of trouble, an aide recorded the conversation.\u201cMarx said, sharpen the contradictions. He was talking about the contradictions between labor and capital. Make it stark,\u201d Ben said. \u201cMy father, from a rhetorical, propaganda kind of messaging school, is all Marx and Lenin, still.\u201dIn other words, he goes to extremes.Father and son usually avoid politics, discuss it when they must, and find common ground to the extent they can. They live with each other\u2019s extremes, especially with regard to race.\u201cWe trust each other\u2019s intentions,\u201d Ben said.For more than 25 years, Ben has been married to Felicia Wiley, who is black and grew up in a working class family in Los Angeles. She is a frequent volunteer at Glide Memorial Church, the longtime countercultural rallying point in San Francisco that talks on its website about how it offered \u201ca safe space\u201d to the Black Panthers. Last summer, Glide gave Felicia a major award.Ben and Felicia have three grown children. In David\u2019s 2016 essay collection \u201cProgressive Racism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI have three black granddaughters for whom I want the absolute best that this life and this society have to offer.\u201d But his positions on racial issues are not exactly mainstream in liberal Silicon Valley. In \u201cBig Agenda,\u201d he called Black Lives Matter a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201criot-fomenting\u201d organization.And in lines that emphasize how far he had come from the idealism of the 1960s, he wrote in \u201cProgressive Racism\u201d that \u201cthere will always be racists and bigots. Only utopians will fail to understand this and seek to deploy the coercive powers of the state to make everyone believe as they do.\u201dBen looks at his father\u2019s racial statements in this light: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to help black people. Really, genuinely. Nobody else is going to take it that way because of how he says it.\u201dHe noted that his father broke with right-wing orthodoxy and condemned George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin. \u201cA young man who was unarmed and guiltless of any crime is dead,\u201d David wrote in 2013. \u201cAnd shouldn\u2019t there be some penalty to pay for that?\u201d\u201cThose are the people I\u2019m comfortable around,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird my father was the origin of it, given who he is now.\u201dGrowing up in black culture, Ben developed a love for hip-hop music and used its lyrics as epigraphs for his blog posts on management. An article documenting his affection for the music came to the attention of Divine, a rapper who spent a decade in prison for selling drugs.\u201cI was skeptical,\u201d said Divine, who was born Victor D. Lombard. \u201cI thought it was a publicity stunt. I couldn\u2019t tie together an older white gentleman who was a venture capitalist and a billionaire to hip-hop, which comes from poverty, from struggle, from pain.\u201d He reached out to Ben via Twitter, realized his sincerity, and the two became friends.Divine has met David at Ben\u2019s parties and has pondered what separates and joins the two.\u201cIt\u2019s like Ben is the antidote to David Horowitz,\u201d he said. \u201cHe balances his father out. And what\u2019s so crazy is that Ben came from David Horowitz.\u201dIn the same way a Mafia don is happy if his kids never whack anyone, David appreciates how his offspring stayed clear of the family business. He doesn\u2019t even mind the way they rejected his politics as well.\u201cThe victory of not indoctrinating your kids and yet having them be successful anyway \u2014 that\u2019s the ultimate for him,\u201d Ben said.Because really, who in their right mind would choose to be involved in politics now?\u201cI liked it when there were fringes on the left and the right and a somewhat rational center,\u201d David said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the center. Normal people are wary of politics, with good reason. It\u2019s a very dirty business.\u201dIf David himself were to renounce that business, declaring that his benevolent attitude toward his family would now be extended to strangers as well, this would be a tidier and more hopeful story.The odds are higher that Hillary Clinton will get an award from the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Despite his distaste for politics, David can\u2019t afford to retire and wouldn\u2019t want to anyway.\u201cIt would be like dying,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t betray my cause.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How BuzzFeed\u2019s Tasty Conquered Online Food", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWe need to talk about overhead instructional videos of people making food. You know the ones I mean. Open up Facebook or Instagram and you\u2019ll bump into one or two or a billion of them.These numbers aren\u2019t a fluke. Other than music videos and actual pornography, P.O.V.-style instructional food porn has lately become just about the most popular thing on the internet.The cooktop and book sketch an emerging road map for the social-fueled media company: Tasty \u2014 and, in a larger sense, BuzzFeed \u2014 is trying to become something like the Disney of the digital age, an all-encompassing lifestyle brand that creates content, experiences and products for an audience hooked on phones.\u201cAfter the cookbook, I realized that Tasty was neither an experiment nor just a really popular Facebook page with lots of ad revenue,\u201d said Ashley McCollum, Tasty\u2019s general manager. \u201cReally what we\u2019re seeing is how to make a business out of massive intellectual property that was built digital-first. It\u2019s the same model as old-media networks \u2014 you make a movie that people love, and then you build a theme park and extend that to products and everything else.\u201dAt BuzzFeed, the overhead video format originated with a team led by Emily Fleischaker, a former food editor at BuzzFeed\u2019s New York office; a team of BuzzFeed producers in Los Angeles then began turning the idea into a blockbuster. So last week, I visited Tasty\u2019s headquarters in Los Angeles.The ostensible purpose was to see a demo of the cooktop and to get a preview of Tasty\u2019s new app, which is also being released this week. The app is meant to address one of Tasty\u2019s most obvious shortcomings: Because the videos are so short (usually no more than 90 seconds), it can be a bit of a pain to actually make something from a Tasty clip. The app handily streamlines the process; click on a step in a written recipe and it plays just that step in the video.My review: The One Top seems to work really well. (This is a tough job.)The highlight of the visit, though, was a walk through Tasty\u2019s studio. Picture a long, darkened hallway with a half-dozen workstations, each outfitted with cameras and a sophisticated lighting rig. There are people everywhere \u2014 executives, interns and employees\u2019 kids, who often take part in the Tasty Junior videos \u2014 but at Tasty there\u2019s one group that matters above all else: the producers.Tasty\u2019s producers work according to what they call a \u201cfull-stack\u201d production model. This means that every producer is tasked with creating every part of a video, from recipe conception to shooting to editing. A typical producer will work on one or two 90-second videos a week. Their videos are inspired by many sources: recipes they find trending elsewhere online, viewer requests and comments, and data about what has performed well before.BuzzFeed is obsessive about learning from past successes, and once it finds a theme or format that hits, it tends to repeat it until it\u2019s dead. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see a lot of videos featuring cheese, steak, bacon and pasta, some of the most popular ingredients. And it\u2019s why Tasty videos always feature a money shot.\u201cCheese pulls and gooey chocolate are so satisfying to watch, and those frames almost make you gasp out loud because they look so good,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cWe try to create those moments in every video, whether it\u2019s an indulgent ingredient like cheese, or a fun way to use up leftovers, or cooking food in a way you haven\u2019t seen.\u201dBut what\u2019s fascinating about Tasty is that it is far less formulaic than it appears at first glance. Producers always lean on past successes, but in each video, they add in one or two different tests to see if something else might work better. Consider \u201cAquarium Cookies,\u201d a video created by the producer Rie Tange McClenny in May, which has been viewed about 16 million times.Its popularity might be a result of the simplicity of the recipe; Ms. McClenny found several recipes for aquarium cookies online, but hers cuts out several steps.Her other breakthrough was visual. Usually, Tasty videos are chronological \u2014 if you\u2019re making cookies, you start by showing the dough. But Ms. McClenny is an aesthete \u2014 \u201cI like to make pretty food,\u201d she told me \u2014 and she wondered what would happen if she started her video with the \u201cbeauty shot,\u201d a picture of the prepared cookies, rather than just the ingredients for dough.\u201cAnd we found that it works really well,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now that has become one of our things to do.\u201dSo Tasty operates like a mix between an R&D lab and a hyperefficient widget factory. It produces content according to a loose formula, but it\u2019s willing to break the formula to try something new, and to expand the formula when it finds something that hits. Then it turns up the gas: It exports the formula to its brand clients, or turns it into books and appliances that sell for real money.It could be unstoppable, really.Advertisement"}

The company says it is just giving customers what they want.Although its dispute with Google is part of a separate investigation, Yelp cheered the European Union fine, which was related to its shopping services.And although Ms. Vestager said that other cases should be considered on their individual merits, she did note a shift in investigations: \u201cThe one thing that has sort of changed from yesterday, before the decision was taken, was that now we will consider Google as a dominant company.\u201dNow, more women are speaking out about sexual harassment in the start-up industry.\u2022 Susan Wu said that Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital had touched her face without her consent. He said he disputed her account. Ms. Wu said she was also propositioned by Mr. Caldbeck while fund-raising.\u2022 Sarah Kunst said that during the recruiting process at 500 Start-ups, an incubator in San Francisco, the venture capitalist Dave McClure had sent her a Facebook message: \u201cI was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.\u201d When she discussed the message with one of Mr. McClure\u2019s colleagues, 500 Start-ups ended its conversations with her, she said.Changes are already evident. In a statement, 500 Start-ups said that Mr. McClure had been removed from day-to-day-operations after an internal investigation.Both Mr. McClure and Mr. Sacca have written about the topic:The bids by TPG Capital and Hellman & Friedman had been worth as much as $2.2 billion, but both firms withdrew after having made buyout approaches in May.\u201cIt appeared that the complication of our business was such that they didn\u2019t want to bid for the whole business,\u201d Nick Falloon, Fairfax\u2019s chairman, said during an analyst briefing on Monday morning, Reuters reported.The news sent Fairfax shares plummeting.The DealBook newsletter will be taking a break for July 4.

{"Headline": "How to Find the Right Therapist", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySearching for the right therapist is sort of like dating.To find The One, you need to date around, \u201cswipe\u201d your way through options and get a feel for who\u2019s out there. In my own hunt, I first searched for therapists online, which led me to feel even more confused than when I began.Lost and without any leads, I asked my best friend for a recommendation. It felt safe to seek help from a professional who came with character references \u2014 the same way I\u2019d scan mutual friends on Facebook before agreeing to a date.Sadly, it was yet another match not meant to be.But after three years of on and off \u201cdating\u201d around, I finally found The One, and as with any successful relationship, she was worth the wait. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned on my journey.If you\u2019re suffering from ailments like panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, look for a clinical psychologist or social worker rather than a psychiatrist, said Dr. David D. Burns, adjunct clinical professor emeritus at the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine.I learned the hard \u2014 and expensive \u2014 way that I needed a strong therapeutic alliance with my therapist. I needed someone who was warm, reliable and within my price range, and the people I had seen up to that point were none of those things. Finally, I broke up with my psychologist by text message, and ghosted my eating disorder counselor.Then, after a nerve-racking phone call, an intake worker at the Montreal Center for Anxiety and Depression played matchmaker based on my needs, and placed me with a clinical social worker.It\u2019s promising if comments are detailed, said Michelle Katz, a nurse, health care advocate and author of \u201cHealthcare for Less.\u201d So rather than, \u201cGood therapist,\u201d a far more telling review would be: \u201cI had Blue Cross and this therapist really spent the time with me and worked with my insurance. Even when it ran out, they still filled out the rebuttal form and worked with me to ensure insurance covered it for X amount of sessions.\u201d Bonus points if a quick search leads you to any research papers, discoveries in the field, recent workshops or accolades.Take negative reviews with a grain of salt, Ms. Katz said. Look at the patterns of the person writing the review. It\u2019s a red flag if they\u2019ve written only complaints. Generally, therapists who take the time to respond to comments care about their practice and reputation, Ms. Katz said.\u201cTreat it like a date. You know the difference between nerves and \u2018Oh, this is not good,\u2019\u201d Ms. Katz said.First, verify what types of accreditation your insurance accepts, what the diagnoses need to be, what kind of documentation you need, and how many sessions it covers. Ms. Katz suggested asking your therapist for a cash rate, because deductibles and other costs can, surprisingly, make insurance more expensive.\u201cSee how close they come to what your insurance will pay, and you might find that paying cash is cheaper,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, if you pay a cash rate, you may not be able to use that against the deductible.\u201dOn top of that, negotiating with your insurance provider can be complicated even in the best case, so get creative. Look toward nonprofits, which offer many passionate and licensed professionals for less. Colleges and universities often have health centers with student therapists at more competitive rates, as do state or county mental health offices.Counselors in training often have to put in a minimum of 1,500 hours before getting their license, which means they sometimes offer sessions at a discount while being overseen by a licensed therapist. The same goes for students (supervised by a clinician) at the master\u2019s and Ph.D. level, and after becoming licensed some will even keep their clients at a discounted rate as a form of loyalty.\u201cThey become family to you, so you can ask them to work on a payment plan,\u201d Ms. Katz said.\u201cAnything is negotiable, and if a therapist is not willing to negotiate with you, especially after you\u2019ve been with them for a while, it\u2019s probably not a good match for you,\u201d Ms. Katz said.Seeing a therapist for a while does not necessarily mean it\u2019s a match made in therapeutic heaven. Your relationship or needs may change over time, or the therapist\u2019s career may go in a different direction. Similarly, for some the goal is not to pay for lifelong sessions, but to help you recover from or learn to cope better with the issues that led you to a therapist in the first place, Dr. Burns said. When he used to practice, he tracked feelings of anger, anxiety and satisfaction by issuing a test to patients before and after the session. In doing so, he saw improvements in as little as a couple of hours.\u201cIf my son or daughter were depressed, I\u2019d want them to go to a therapist who can get them dramatic improvements in just a few sessions, not just have them pondering their life for months or years without change,\u201d he said. For others, however, progress is slow and deliberate, and having someone to help over the long term is better. Like everything else, the best timeline for you is the one you discuss with the therapist you choose.Advertisement"}

Facing the severe postwar housing shortage, they feverishly advocated a near-monopoly for private-sector construction of single-family detached units. In so doing McCarthy sought to block a bipartisan legislative housing package championed by President Harry S. Truman.Co-sponsored by Robert A. Taft, Allen J. Ellender and Robert F. Wagner, this bill proposed a mixed-market formula, bridging ideological divisions. President Truman actively promoted it during his 1948 campaign.Upon signing the American Housing Act of 1949, Truman cited it as among the pillars of his Fair Deal along with expanding Social Security and raising the minimum wage.The writer is a professor emeritus of American history at Lake Forest College.\u2666To the Editor:I was surprised to read, in David Oshinsky\u2019s review of \u201cThe Color of Law,\u201d that Richard Rothstein \u201crejects the phrase \u2018people of color,\u2019 because it lumps African-Americans with groups that didn\u2019t suffer as systematically at government hands \u2014 like Asians and Hispanics.\u201d Oshinsky did not challenge or comment on this assertion.Sadly, it appears that the history of racial segregation and systematic discrimination against Asians in the United States has been largely forgotten or minimized.Chinese immigrants, beginning in the mid-19th century, suffered economic exploitation and harassment, including segregation and lynchings, culminating in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This marked the first time a specific group of people were forbidden to enter the United States. The act was not repealed until 1943. Even then, there was a strict quota for Chinese immigrants, which was not relaxed until 1965.Surely this counts as systematic discrimination at government hands.\u2666To the Editor:As someone who\u2019s spent years as both a reviewer and a critic, I was disappointed to see Adam Kirsch conflating the two roles in \u201cThe Hardest Lesson of a Liberal Democracy?

Kirsch\u2019s essay promulgates the assumption that the sole business of critics is to praise or condemn new music, artworks, books and performances \u2014 a reductive view of criticism that\u2019s further supported by the illustration of Rick Harney\u2019s statue of Roger Ebert giving a thumbs up, presumably exercising exactly 50 percent of a critic\u2019s possible functions.The primary task of reviewers, of course, is to turn thumbs up or thumbs down or maybe signal a reaction somewhere in the middle. But critics, whether or not they\u2019re reviewers, can ask lots of questions besides whether or not a work of art, or by extension a government policy or institution, is any good. How does it work? What are its roots? What other works does it most closely resemble, and how does it stand apart from them? To whom is it likely to appeal? What does it say about the person who created it, the audience for whom it was created, and the culture it reflects? What sorts of questions does it raise and suppress? What does it invite us to think or say or do?It\u2019s a shame that President Trump is either unaware or dismissive of these functions.

But those very same generals, represented by the secretary of defense, James Mattis, said last month that they would need six more months to study the idea of allowing transgender people to enlist.Trump\u2019s tweeted reasons for reversing the policy are transparently ridiculous. \u201cOur military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail,\u201d Trump said in his series of tweets, which he closed with a peculiar \u201cThank you.\u201dThere is no evidence that allowing transgender people to serve openly in uniform would interfere with the \u201cdecisive and overwhelming victory\u201d that Trump fantasizes about. Estimates of the number of transgender service members range from about 2,500 to about 15,500, most of whom have not revealed their gender identity. There are far more gay men and women in uniform and their presence did not in any way disrupt American military power before or after the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy was repealed.Were all of the military leaders and experts involved in that process replaced by new ones who told Trump to reverse the decision?

In between threatening the job of his attorney general for refusing to block the Russia investigation, sucking up to Vladimir Putin and swanning around his golf clubs?Or did he just call in Steve Bannon and his new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, and ask them for a way to throw some red meat to his most intolerant supporters while the health care bill flounders on Capitol Hill and new revelations come out almost daily about his campaign\u2019s strange dealings with the Kremlin?Advertisement"}

If only the industry could decrypt the elusive formula, it would bottle it and sell it to us American plebeians. Alas, the insouciant Gallic charm will most likely remain as mysterious as it is clich\u00e9, but in recognition of Bastille Day on Friday, we have an excuse to renew our efforts to master it. Emerging and established designers offer a few leads, and Jane Birkin, fashion\u2019s perennial muse, is fertile ground for inspiration. In the end, though, some things are better left unsolved, and some clich\u00e9s deserve to be indulged. Alors, do your best French girl impression. You know you want to.Besides Bastille Day, this week marks another milestone in France\u2019s history \u2014 when it comes to fashion, anyway. Thirty years ago, Jean Touitou introduced a line of basics that would come to be known as A.P.C. Originally Mr. Touitou wanted the project to go unnamed, with each collection titled only by season, which is why his first designs bore the label Hiver 87. In tribute to that debut, A.P.C. is releasing a capsule, out on Thursday, of new and reissued items bearing the original label. Elsewhere, the collection has sentimental touches like the letters embroidered on a shirt representing the initials of people who have influenced Mr. Touitou over the years, from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to Bo Diddley.It is a great contradiction that the avatar for Parisian chic isn\u2019t even French. Though Jane Birkin was born and raised in England, it was her years in Paris alongside Serge Gainsbourg that left an indelible mark on fashion. For proof, look no further than the proliferation of goods that are explicitly inspired by her. Some are even named for her.Goyard, established in Paris in 1853, makes leather accessories that are as classically French as they come. While its distinct logo bags can be seen on the streets of Paris year-round, its Belharra Biarritz tote seems destined for St.-Tropez. The tote is completely reversible, with water-resistant canvas on one side and supple leather on the other, perfect for stashing wet suits and towels after a long day in the sun.Goyard leather and canvas bag, $1,750 at Linda\u2019s at Bergdorf Goodman.Meet Instagram\u2019s new girl crushes: Jeanne Damas and Nathalie Dumeix, Parisian friends whose dreamy lifestyle, captured in 2-by-2-inch form, has gained millions of likes. Luckily, we can buy a bit of the magic thanks to their respective lines. Ms. Dumeix\u2019s namesake label specializes in the kind of understated trousers and jumpsuits that will earn their keep for years, while Ms. Damas\u2019s direct-to-consumer label Rouje stocks feminine dresses and tops that wouldn\u2019t look out of place on Brigitte Bardot in her heyday.Advertisement"}

Good for them. Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity. I wonder, who are their agents? If they\u2019re the same ones that negotiated the pay for the women on the lower scales, then maybe the latter have found their true value in their marketplace.\u201dElsewhere he wrote:\u201cOnly one woman is among the top 10 best-paid BBC presenters. Now, why is this? Is it because men are more charismatic performers? Because they work harder? Because they are more driven? Possibly a bit of each. The human resources department \u2014 what used to be called \u201cpersonnel\u201d until people come to be considered as a metabolising, respiring form of mineral ore \u2014 will probably tell you that men usually work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant.\u201dThe column, which had been commissioned for the print version of the outlet\u2019s Irish edition, also attacked \u201cthe PC traitors who run BBC News and current affairs, which have stifled and corrupted all useful debate on national identity, immigration and race, thereby doing irreversible damage to British society.\u201dLionel Barber, the editor of The Financial Times, also denounced the article on Twitter.By midmorning local time, the article had been removed from the website, which The Sunday Times shares with The Times of London, both part of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation.\u201cThe comments in a column by Kevin Myers in today\u2019s Irish edition of The Sunday Times were unacceptable and should not have been published. It has been taken down, and we sincerely apologize both for the remarks and the error of judgment that led to publication.\u201dA separate statement from Frank Fitzgibbon, the editor of the paper\u2019s Irish edition in Dublin, said in part:\u201cAs the editor of the Ireland edition I take full responsibility for this error of judgment. This newspaper abhors anti-Semitism and did not intend to cause offense to Jewish people.\u201dThat statement, however, was criticized for not addressing what many saw as Mr. Myers\u2019s misogyny.Calls to Mr. Myers\u2019s cellphone and home numbers went unanswered on Sunday. He also did not immediately respond to a voice mail message and email.On Sunday afternoon, the paper confirmed that Mr. Myers was let go. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that Kevin Myers will not write again for The Sunday Times Ireland. A printed apology will appear in next week\u2019s paper.\u201cThe Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens has also apologized personally to Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz for these unacceptable comments both to Jewish people and to women in the workplace.\u201dA party member, Naseem Shah, was suspended for endorsing anti-Israel posts on social media in 2014, before becoming a member of Parliament. Ms. Shah had endorsed a Facebook post showing a graphic of Israel\u2019s outline superimposed on a map of the United States under the headline \u201cSolution for Israel-Palestine conflict \u2014 relocate Israel into United States.\u201dSome asked if anyone would have questioned her taste in fashion or the hefty cost of her trousers if she were a man.Born in England to Irish parents, Mr. Myers has long been a strident and at times deeply controversial voice in the Irish news media, first as a columnist for The Irish Times (which is not connected to The Sunday Times of London), and then later The Irish Independent group.In 2009, he wrote a column for The Belfast Telegraph, part of the Irish Independent group, which said, \u201cThere was no Holocaust, and six million Jews were not murdered by the Third Reich.\u201d The article accepted that there had been a deliberate mass genocide against the Jews of Europe, but said that the term \u201cholocaust\u201d was inaccurate and that the exact number of dead could not be known.According to the Irish Independent group\u2019s website, that article was also taken down from archives on Sunday.In 2005, Mr. Myers was widely criticized for a column in The Irish Times in which he referred to the children of single parents as \u201cbastards.\u201d Writing about foreign aid to Africa in The Irish Independent in 2008, he said that in contrast, \u201cAfrica, with its vast savannahs and its lush pastures, is giving almost nothing to anyone, apart from AIDS.\u201dDan Bilefsky contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Velvet Ropes of Facebook\u2019s Private Groups", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIn recent days, I\u2019ve gotten to know beekeepers in Rhode Island, dental hygienists in New Jersey and Wiccans in Tennessee. I\u2019ve seen gardeners swapping fertilizer advice, flight attendants complaining about annoying passengers and fishermen arguing about which lures are best for catching muskies. I now know that there are hundreds of people who love creating memes about \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d and thousands who believe, with total conviction, that the Earth is flat.All of this has been revealed to me because, for the better part of a month, I have immersed myself in the fascinating, enlightening and sometimes scary world of private Facebook groups. I\u2019ve gotten access to scores of private groups \u2014 more than 100 in all \u2014 ranging in size from a handful of members to millions. I\u2019ve joined Facebook groups that represent my real-life interests (Home Cooks, Pitbull Fans) and groups that have nothing to do with me (Lyme Disease Group, Quilting for Beginners, Cannabis Growers Helping Cannabis Growers). For weeks, I lurked silently in these forums and, when possible, tried to interview their moderators and members.This wasn\u2019t just a stunt. Facebook recently changed its corporate mission to emphasize the role of private groups, and I wanted to see what diving headfirst into the new Facebook could tell me about the company\u2019s future. After all, if Facebook is our global town square, then groups are its gated subdivisions, the private spaces where people gather to share information they might not be willing to broadcast publicly, or behave in ways they might not want their friends to know about. What happens, I wondered, in the V.I.P. rooms of the world\u2019s biggest club?Mr. Zuckerberg, who sits atop a $450 billion for-profit enterprise, clearly sees a business opportunity as well as a community-building exercise. According to the company, which is one of the nation\u2019s top 10 public companies by market capitalization, only 100 million or so of Facebook\u2019s two billion users around the world currently belong to what it calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d groups, the kind that become significant parts of their members\u2019 lives. That leaves 1.9 billion users who could be brought closer together on Facebook (and who, presumably, would spend more time on the platform as a result).Libby Chamberlain, the founder of Pantsuit Nation, started the group before last year\u2019s election and now oversees a team of 30 moderators who wade through thousands of submitted posts every week, removing comments that are hostile or disparaging.\u201cFor a lot of people, this is a group that has a lot of people who identify as liberals within conservative spaces, or people who might not want their Facebook friends to know their political leanings,\u201d Ms. Chamberlain told me in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t call it a safe space \u2014 it\u2019s a platform for like-minded progressives to share stories, resources and calls to action.\u201dPantsuit Nation is a secret group, meaning that users need an invitation from a current member to join. But for other types of Facebook enclaves, known as \u201cclosed\u201d groups, joining is as simple as clicking a button and waiting for a moderator to approve the request. Despite knowing that I was a journalist, most closed groups let me in with few questions asked. (One notable exception was the group for owners of Ford F100 pickup trucks, which invited me in, then booted me after concluding that my employer was \u201cfake news.\u201d)Facebook\u2019s gargantuan size means that there\u2019s a group for nearly any conceivable interest, no matter how niche. Want to talk shop with other equine veterinarians? Just join Horse Vet Corner (7,865 members). Want to trade tips with fellow model train buffs? Come on over to N Scale Model Trains (6,212 members).Some of the groups I joined were reminiscent of the message boards and fan forums that populated the early internet. A group called Wine Memes for Wine Moms (6,846 members) offered funny graphics and jokes about the lives of maternal oenophiles. Frugal Full-Time R.V.ers (12,899 members) offered tips on finding cheap pit stops along major roadways, and What\u2019s Wrong With My Plant? (20,385 members) featured amateur gardeners sharing photos of their ailing shrubs with fellow green thumbs.Other groups contained more intimate content. Like the Infidelity Support Group (12,948 members), in which partners of unfaithful spouses traded stories and messages of sympathy. Or Warrior Village (2,554 members), a support group for military veterans with behavioral health issues. For people going through tough times, finding kindred spirits inside private Facebook groups can make the social network feel less lonely.Private groups can also provide a refuge from Facebook\u2019s less savory elements. Matt Prestbury, a Baltimore-based preschool teacher and father of four, started a group called Black Fathers in 2009, out of frustration with negative portrayals of African-American parents in the media. He wanted to create a space on Facebook where black fathers could talk openly without fear of racists or trolls butting in. The group, now with more than 27,000 members, is a hyper-earnest, incredibly positive place where fathers use hashtags like #BlackLove and brag about their children\u2019s accomplishments.\u201cI wanted to create a real collective as fathers, where we could connect and be resources to each other,\u201d Mr. Prestbury told me.Of course, like all social media platforms, Facebook can be abused. I also saw private groups that spread misinformation, harassed people and encouraged harmful behavior. In Flat Earth \u2014 No Trolls (22,538 members), members shared unscientific evidence that the world was indeed flat and mocked \u201cglobers\u201d who claimed otherwise. In a political group called Pinochet\u2019s Anti-SJW Beach Resort (36,059 members), members cruelly evaluated the physical appearance of women and made racist and anti-Semitic jokes.Arguably, by encouraging a shift to private groups, Facebook is risking becoming a haven for these kinds of bad actors, a fate that has befallen other internet forums, such as Reddit. Content within groups can still be reported for violations of Facebook\u2019s community standards, and Facebook recently gave moderators more tools to combat harassment and abuse. Still, I joined several seemingly lawless groups where shocking and offensive content was everywhere.Another worrisome possibility is that by promoting private groups, Facebook may be amplifying the much-discussed \u201cfilter bubble\u201d effect, sorting like-minded people into closed echo chambers and sheltering them from divergent views.As I joined groups, I noticed that my Facebook feed showed more updates from those groups, and fewer posts from my friends and the news pages I follow, a hint that Facebook may be privileging group-based content in the newsfeed algorithm that determines what users see. That\u2019s fine, if the goal of Facebook is to build strong micro-communities. It\u2019s not so great if the goal is to expose users to a wide range of views and experiences outside their core interests. (It\u2019s also worrisome if you\u2019re a digital publisher who depends on Facebook\u2019s algorithm for traffic, but that\u2019s a different column.)Facebook\u2019s product manager for groups, Alex Deve, told me that he believed private groups could still produce a diverse spectrum of opinions. \u201cIn groups, people have one thing in common,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always mean they have everything in common.\u201d Mr. Deve said that the company\u2019s testing had revealed that users who belonged to meaningful groups, whether they were partisan or not, were much more enthusiastic about Facebook than users who belonged to none.\u201cPeople need safe spaces to share things that are private to them,\u201d he said.During my weeks of Facebook group immersion, I was reminded of how much early 2000s message-board chatter was banal, off-topic or argumentative.

Because of this, firefighters are at increased risk of dehydration, heat exhaustion and, in extreme cases, heat stroke.We visited Engine Company 54 in Manhattan to find out how the New York Fire Department keeps its firefighters safe during the summer.\u201cYou sweat profusely and immediately as soon as you put everything on,\u201d said Colin Maxwell, a firefighter, over a glass of water.The department encourages firefighters to drink more fluids than usual and to eat a light diet when it\u2019s hot, said John Hodgens, a deputy assistant chief.The Fire Department also takes precautions in the field:Injuries are most common during consecutive days of high temperatures, said James Long, the director of public information for the Fire Department.Firefighter Maxwell recalled experiencing dizziness caused by heat a couple of months into the job in 2015. He was fighting a fire on the fourth floor of a building on 10th Avenue when he started seeing white spots.\u201cI started to get dizzy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I recognized it because, you know, I was a new guy and wanted to prove that I was tough, but my officer and the guy next to me noticed me panting.\u201dHe recovered quickly with a respiratory mask, but he wondered if it would have happened had he been properly hydrated.Here\u2019s what else is happening:A beautiful week ahead.There\u2019s a slight chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon, so grab an umbrella on your way out the door.Another thing that comes out in New York City in the heat: feet.As footwear changes with the hot weather, so do our comfort levels with toes and toenails in the workplace \u2014 whether that means our willingness to expose more skin to those around us, or our tolerance of the sight of co-workers\u2019 feet.So on sticky summer days, where do style and office etiquette meet when it comes to feet?

{"Headline": "Do Egg Donors Face Long-Term Risks?", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthWhen patients consider a medical procedure, they may be told \u201cthere are no known long-term effects.\u201d But unless such effects have been systematically studied, that does not mean there are no long-term effects.That\u2019s a major concern for Dr. Jennifer Schneider, mother of a three-time egg donor, Jessica Grace Wing. Ms. Wing was a tall, lean, attractive, athletic and musically talented Stanford University student when she decided to donate her eggs to help pay for her education. Through her multiple donations, five healthy children were born to three formerly childless families.When her mother asked if egg donation was safe, Ms. Wing said she was told it was. What she did not know at the time was that no one had ever looked beyond the short-term effects of the many hormone injections needed to stimulate the release of multiple eggs at one time.Ms. Wing\u2019s cancer may have been totally unrelated to her egg donations. But given that Ms. Wing had been a health-conscious young woman with no family history of colon cancer or genes associated with this disease, Dr. Schneider wondered if the extensive hormone treatments her daughter had undergone might have stimulated growth of the cancer and if other egg donors might also be at risk.Alas, she soon discovered, it was impossible to know because no one was keeping track of the medical or psychological fate of egg donors. Once donors walk out the door, they are essentially lost to medical history.But 14 years after her daughter\u2019s death, there is still no one tracking the fate of egg donors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects information on in vitro fertilization, but not on those who donate their eggs either anonymously or to family members or friends unable to get pregnant with their own eggs.Donor eggs are typically used for women seeking pregnancy who may have undergone early menopause, have poor egg quality, a history of genetic disease, a hormonal imbalance, ovaries that fail to respond to stimulation, or are over the age of 40.\u201cEgg donors are just not on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d Dr. Schneider, who lives in Tucson and is certified in internal medicine, addiction medicine and pain management, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sperm donation, which doesn\u2019t involve hormone injections or any invasive treatments. In my opinion, egg donors need to be treated like all other organ donors \u2014 their health should be monitored.\u201dThe London doctors, K.K. Ahuja and E.G. Simons of Cromwell Hospital, called upon the British Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority \u201cto confirm that ovarian stimulation in volunteer egg donors does not increase the risk of cancer over and above the background rate.\u201d But this has yet to be done.Similar risks might also exist for women who are able to supply their own eggs for in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F. They undergo the same hormone treatments as egg donors. However, these women, who are typically older and may have endocrine or other abnormalities, are not a reliable group for determining long-term risks for young, healthy egg donors.Dr. Schneider and co-authors expressed concern as well about another group of women: those whose eggs are harvested and preserved for their own future use. They undergo the same hormone treatments, perhaps more than once if not enough healthy eggs are obtained on a first attempt. If successful, egg freezing can enable women to delay pregnancy and remain in the work force until well beyond normal childbearing years.But until more is known, Dr. Schneider has written, \u201cAll women who undergo ovarian stimulation, especially more than once, should be told that their long-term health risks are unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those dark places online must be illuminated by the law.\u201dHere\u2019s a response from Elaine Pearson, Australia director for the Human Rights Watch:\u201cEncrypted apps are not just for criminals, they are a lifeline for activists and journalists in many countries to do their work safely and without government interference. The government needs to accept that it won\u2019t know what everybody is doing all of the time.\u201d\u201cWe appreciate the important work law enforcement does, and we understand their need to carry out investigations. That\u2019s why we already have a protocol in place to respond to requests where we can. At the same time, weakening encrypted systems for them would mean weakening it for everyone.\u201dTranslation: Sorry, Mr. Turnbull, there\u2019s just no way we\u2019re decrypting.But numbers don\u2019t quite show how insidious some incidents have been. This week, oil slicks were found on the Capital City Trail in Melbourne, a celebrated cyclist route that isn\u2019t shared by cars but is popular among pedestrians. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade cleaned up puddles of oil twice in one day.On Yarra Boulevard in Kew, another popular biking route, a local council has spent tens of thousands of dollars to sweep up large tacks with magnets. The tacks have been dumped on the road regularly for two years, with the apparent aim of injuring cyclists.Behind the animosity\u201cIf you look at some of the ways that the media used to portray cycling, it\u2019s very much the whole idea of the cars versus bike thing, which is a stupid idea,\u201d he said.Mr. Hore says that media coverage had played a major role in creating animosity between drivers and riders.\u201cOur biggest claim to fame was \u2018Family Feud\u2019: \u2018What Are 10 Things That Make You Angry About Bike Riders?\u2019 The No. 1 answer was, \u2018Everything.\u2019 Those things give people the idea that they\u2019re allowed to hate on cyclists. Now, you\u2019re not allowed to hate on religion, on sexual orientation, on race \u2014 but it\u2019s quite acceptable to hate on cyclists.\u201dIan Walker, associate dean in social sciences at the University of Bath in England, has spent years researching the psychology behind the hostility. His work leads him to blame an older foible: human bias.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole series of social psychology research going back quite a few years, now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows, clearly, that people are very horrible. The least sign of difference is enough for people to start showing prejudice to each other.\u201dDr. Walker explained that the tendency showed itself, scientifically, even in arbitrary contexts.\u201cIf you get a bunch of people in a room and toss a coin and separate them into groups of \u2018heads\u2019 and \u2018tails,\u2019 within a few minutes, they\u2019ll start discriminating against each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very deeply rooted in us.\u201dCyclists, though, may have a clearer group of traits that lead drivers to designate them as \u201cothers.\u201d\u201cThe analogy that always comes to mind is vegetarians. If you think about it, there\u2019s a lot in common between those two groups,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth slightly outside mainstream culture. Both potentially have a sustainability side to what they do. They both represent a challenge to mainstream culture.\u201dBut, Dr. Walker said, another intrinsic human drive may also be involved: the demand for resources. Or, road space.\u201cIf cyclists only ever did mountain biking, I can\u2019t imagine this issue would arise,\u201d he said.In his research, Dr. Walker found precious few ways for cyclists to lessen aggression toward them on roads, but gender may play a role. For example, drivers generally leave more space when passing women than men \u2014 a finding that has been repeated in studies around the world.Another deterrent? The threat of consequences. For one study, Dr. Walker dressed cyclists in various outfits and observed driver behavior. One ensemble displayed the words, \u201cNovice cyclist: Please pass slowly.\u201d\u201cThe only outfit that made any difference was one that, written on the back, said that it was videoing the journey,\u201d he said. \u201cDepressingly, it\u2019s only the fear of being caught that had any effect on drivers\u2019 behavior.\u201d[5:02 a.m.]Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hangman\u2019s Noose, Symbol of Racial Animus, Keeps Cropping Up", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was the beginning of the night shift last Wednesday at the United States Mint in Philadelphia, a secure facility that manufactures money, when a white male coin maker strode across the factory floor to the workstation of an African-American colleague. He was carrying a piece of rope.The episode, which has not previously been reported, was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department with a statement saying that the agency has \u201cabsolutely zero tolerance\u201d for such hateful displays and that authorities were investigating.It is the latest in a series of reports this year involving nooses \u2014 especially in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 that point to the return of the hangman\u2019s rope as a potent expression of racial animus.\u201cTo me, a noose is lynching,\u201d said Taylor Dumpson, the woman who became the university\u2019s student government president. \u201cThat\u2019s immediately what comes to my mind, that someone is going to hang you, that someone is going to die. That\u2019s a very chilling thing.\u201dThe noose at the Mint was particularly shocking, Ms. Sapp said, because the Mint is under heavy surveillance given its security concerns; employees know they are being recorded as they work. After a daylong investigation, during which the creator of the noose was kept off the factory floor to protect him from physical retaliation, she said he was placed on administrative leave last Thursday and escorted out of the building.But Ms. Sapp said that Treasury officials had not done enough to address the roots of persistent racial discord within the factory, adding, \u201cThey sweep a lot under the rug.\u201dThe Treasury spokeswoman said only that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had \u201cdirected that this matter be handled swiftly and seriously.\u201dAdvocacy groups that track hate crimes say the rash of noose cases is part of an uptick in such crimes, fueled by the coarsening of public conversation that began during last year\u2019s presidential campaign and that has continued amid bitter divisions over the election outcome.\u201cWe are in a moment right now where we certainly have not only heightened awareness, but a greater frequency of hate incidents,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. He called the surge in noose episodes \u201creally alarming.\u201dThe hangman\u2019s rope has been used for centuries to execute people, but became a particular object of racial terror in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when 4,700 people \u2014 mostly men but also women and children \u2014 were hanged from trees, telephone poles and bridges across the nation, according to Jack Shuler, the author of \u201cThe Thirteenth Turn: A History of the Noose.\u201d Roughly three-quarters were African-American.As to why nooses are appearing with increasing frequency today, Mr. Shuler said: \u201cThat\u2019s the $64,000 question. I think we\u2019re in a historical moment where people feel like they have permission to be hateful.\u201dCurrent data on nooses, though, is difficult to come by. The F.B.I. \u2014 which is investigating the American University case as a potential hate crime \u2014 keeps figures on such crimes; its latest report, released in November, showed a 6.7 percent rise in reported hate crimes in 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available.A study of law enforcement and government agencies\u2019 data in 25 metropolitan areas, conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, showed the number of hate crimes jumped to 1,988 last year from 1,886 the year before \u2014 an increase of 5.4 percent.One of the most troubling instances involved a noose at a display about segregation in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which has become a popular tourist destination in Washington since its opening last fall.The rope was found in late May, in an exhibit chronicling America\u2019s evolution from the era of segregationist Jim Crow laws through the civil rights movement.At American University here, the bananas hanging from nooses seemed clearly aimed at Ms. Dumpson, 21. Some of the bananas were painted in black with the words \u201cHarambe Bait,\u201d a reference to the gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo that was killed after a child fell into its enclosure in 2016. Others said \u201cAKA Free,\u201d an apparent reference to Alpha Kappa Alpha, a black sorority to which Ms. Dumpson belongs.She was on the subway, traveling to school, on May 1 when she got a Facebook message from a friend showing her pictures of the nooses on campus.\u201cMy stomach just dropped,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew what a noose was, I knew the history, just as much as I knew the history of the Confederate flag. Those were things I was taught to recognize.\u201dFollow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Became a Hate Crime Victim. She Became a Widow.", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "Srinivas Kuchibhotla\u2019s death in an anti-immigrant attack at a Kansas bar made headlines the world over. Now his wife, Sunayana Dumala, tells her story.Supported byOLATHE, Kan. \u2014 Sunayana Dumala tried once again to enter the worship room she and her husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, had created in their home for daily prayers. Mr. Kuchibhotla had built an intricate wooden shrine by hand two years ago, a small sacred edifice where they would kneel each morning. Months after his death, it became a place where she would honor him.On a Wednesday night in February, a man with a semiautomatic pistol and a distorted notion of American pride turned ordinary people into shooting victims and survivors \u2014 and he turned Ms. Dumala into a widow.Mr. Kuchibhotla, an Indian-born engineer, was confronted about his immigration status at a bar, then fatally shot. By the time the police arrived, Mr. Kuchibhotla was dying, and his close friend Alok Madasani was wounded. Another patron who tried to stop the attack was also struck by gunfire.Three months to the day after her husband\u2019s murder, Ms. Dumala stood at the entrance of the prayer room alone, looking toward a window that framed storm clouds. She turned away.\u201cEverything about this room, everything about this house,\u201d she said later, \u201creminds me of my Srinu,\u201d the nickname she gave him during their courtship.It was in the quiet of the next morning that Ms. Dumala, 32, decided that would be the day she would step inside the worship room. What had been unbearable just the previous day seemed surmountable, if only because it was the next painful step.So she willed herself up the stairs, inching past the framed collage of wedding photos, and into the room. She cleaned each of the deity figurines with warm water. Then she prayed for peace in a whisper just above the sound of children\u2019s play at the elementary school next door.In some ways, what one man shouted in anger and one woman uttered in grief capture one of America\u2019s most troubling intersections.\u201cGet out of my country!\u201d the gunman would yell, before opening fire on the two Indian men he later said he believed were from Iran.\u201cDo we belong here?\u201d the widow would ask in a Facebook post six days after the shooting.The episode happened at dinnertime in a neighborhood bar, part of a spasm of hatred that seems to be uncoiling in small towns and big cities across the nation \u2014 and in rising numbers.\u201cWe\u2019ve read many times in newspapers of some kind of shooting happening,\u201d Ms. Dumala said at a news conference in February at the headquarters of Garmin, where Mr. Kuchibhotla worked as a senior aviation systems engineer.\u201cAnd we always wondered, how safe?\u201dMs. Dumala had wondered how the couple fit into this new narrative, if they should move to a different country, and once even asked her husband, \u201cAre we doing the right thing of staying in the United States of America?\u201dMs. Dumala shared what is now the most dreadful chapter of her life seated at the foot of the king-size bed where they once slept. Much of their story was typical, abundant with promise: They were Indian immigrants who moved to the United States from Hyderabad for postgraduate degrees and jobs, a young couple in love, planning a family, making Kansas home.Her night stand, closest to the window, offered unintended markers on that life: a 2007 college graduation photo of Mr. Kuchibhotla taken not long after they met, and a small box of Russell Stover assorted chocolates he gave her for Valentine\u2019s Day, eight days before he was shot.The realization that her husband was killed because of intolerance, because he was not born in America, is what forced her to emerge from this personal, private hell. She thought that if people were to know the aftermath of a hate crime, the crater-sized void and endless questions left behind, if the victims were rendered as three-dimensional, maybe there would be less fear, less hate.\u201cMy story needs to be spread,\u201d she said plainly. \u201cSrinu\u2019s story needs to be known. We have to do something to reduce the hate crimes. Even if we can save one other person, I think that would give peace to Srinu and give me the satisfaction that his sacrifice did not go in vain.\u201dOn the morning of his death, Mr. Kuchibhotla left for work before his wife. \u201cBye,\u201d he said, hurrying past her, a casual farewell that would come to haunt Ms. Dumala for its brevity and finality.Just before 6 p.m., Ms. Dumala texted and called Mr. Kuchibhotla to plan for the evening. His cellphone was off, which was not unusual, because of his habit of watching videos, draining the battery.She had hoped they could spend time that evening in their backyard, sipping tea and watching the sun lower into the horizon. The view, a wide-open stretch with houses dotted in the distance, was one of the charms of their deep blue two-story house in Olathe, an orderly Kansas City suburb in Johnson County, Kan.Ms. Dumala picked at her roti in between calls to their friends looking for her husband. Maybe he had gone to have drinks at Austins Bar & Grill, his favorite after-work spot, with Mr. Madasani, one of his best friends from work. But Mr. Madasani\u2019s phone was off, too.She began to scroll through Facebook. A news story popped into her feed: three people shot at Austins.\u201cI was getting scared, some kind of feeling was going through me. I was all alone,\u201d she said, pausing to catch her breath, her face dampened by tears. \u201cThis is not my usual Srinu, I am saying to myself. He would have reached out to me somehow to let me know he is safe.\u201dMs. Dumala\u2019s instincts were right. The best friends, more like brothers, were at Austins. Typically the two went with another close friend from the office, Manju Nag, but he had been out of town on business. That night, it was just Mr. Kuchibhotla and Mr. Madasani at their regular table on the patio, the one closest to the door, discussing Bollywood movies and drinking a pair of Miller Lites.The assailant approached the friends. Witnesses recall him wearing a white T-shirt with military-style pins, his head wrapped in a white scarf. He was intent on finding out one thing: Did the men at the table belong in the country?Adam W. Purinton, a white Navy veteran, turned to the two brown-complexioned men, both living in the United States for years, and demanded to know their immigration status.\u201cOut of the blue comes this weird-looking gentleman, I say weird-looking because he had anger on his face,\u201d said Mr. Madasani, 32, an aviation systems engineer at Garmin. \u201cI did not hear what he was saying instantly, but I saw the look on Srinivas\u2019s face change drastically. I looked at Adam and he walked towards me, he came to me and said, \u2018Are you here legally?\u2019\u201dPeppered with more questions and ethnic slurs, Mr. Madasani did not respond. Instead, he went inside to get the manager. Ian Grillot, 24, and another patron asked Mr. Purinton to leave and escorted him from the patio. As Mr. Madasani returned to the patio area, he said he heard more of the rant. \u201cOh, here comes the Arab,\u201d Mr. Purinton said.But he didn\u2019t go far, pacing outside in the parking lot. Mr. Madasani said he and Mr. Kuchibhotla had decided to leave, but were stopped as other patrons apologized and assured them they were welcome. One guy paid their tab; the bar manager gave them another round of beer and fried pickles, a favorite of Mr. Kuchibhotla. \u201cEverybody kept coming up to us saying this is not what we represent, you guys belong here,\u201d he said.Not long after, according to the authorities, Mr. Purinton returned to the bar with a handgun. He stood in the patio door, pointed his gun toward the two men, and fired.They had met online in 2006 after a mutual friend gave her a list of names of Indian students attending the University of Texas at El Paso. She was considering a master\u2019s program there and wanted to get a feel for what to expect as an immigrant student. She sent a note to the first name on the list: Mr. Kuchibhotla.They were both from Hyderabad, the riverside capital of Telangana State in southern India. He grew up the middle of three sons and loved cricket as a boy, playing on the rooftop of his family home. His father was a quality assurance officer for a pharmaceutical company and his mother was a teacher.\u201cHe was the tallest of all of us brothers and cousins,\u201d said Sai Kota, a cousin who grew up with Mr. Kuchibhotla and now lives in Edison, N.J. \u201cWe used to volunteer him to get the ball when it would go onto another rooftop. He could jump to the other rooftop. He was a brother and mentor to me.\u201dMs. Dumala was immediately drawn to Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s sharp focus, sense of humor and patience \u2014 she still likes to tell the story of the many weekends he took her to empty parking lots to teach her to drive. He liked the sound of her voice, melodic and sweet, and her caring nature \u2014 almost every day, she checked to make sure he had eaten breakfast.Their casual phone conversations blossomed into the beginnings of a six-year courtship. After three months, Ms. Dumala proposed to him one night. No matter that she had never seen him in person.They finally met months later at a temple when he went home to Hyderabad. \u201cI did not know that he was going to be 6\u20192\u201d, with me being 5 feet,\u201d she said, chuckling.She ended up attending St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where she studied engineering management and graduated in 2010. After Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s graduation in 2007, he accepted a job at Rockwell Collins, an avionics and information technology company in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he worked as a systems engineer in the flight control department. He loved everything about aviation, particularly the very idea that something so heavy could fly.At Rockwell, he met Mr. Madasani, who would become one of his best friends and a roommate. Mr. Madasani moved to Kansas in 2014, joining his friend Mr. Kuchibhotla at Garmin.Mr. Kuchibhotla persuaded his parents and his wife\u2019s to bless their marriage, built upon love, rather than arranged. The couple married in 2012, in a ceremony in Hyderabad attended by more than 1,000 people.In 2014, they moved to the Kansas City area, mostly to find opportunities for Ms. Dumala. She had stayed home much of their time in Iowa, unable to work with an H-4, for spouses of specialty workers who hold H-1B visas.They found a home in Olathe, population 135,000, a city 20 minutes outside Kansas City and one of the fastest-growing in the nation.Mr. Kuchibhotla continued his work as an engineer at Garmin. He helped companies that build airplanes and helicopters integrate Garmin technology and software into their aircraft. He was so well regarded that his boss routinely asked if the human resources division could \u201cfind more Srinivases.\u201d\u201cThis is not hyperbolic when I tell you he was almost the perfect employee,\u201d said Dave Wysong, his supervisor. \u201cHe was a great engineer. Technically, very, very good. He was quiet and very, very friendly.\u201dMs. Dumala started work as a database developer at a pharmaceutical marketing agency in May 2016. The couple became part of a circle of Indian friends who spent most every weekend together at dinner parties. The men played on a cricket team, where Mr. Kuchibhotla was the bowler, the pitcher\u2019s position. Two years ago, they moved into a subdivision near Garmin. And last year, they began planning a family.It was 7:15 p.m. The work day had ended, and most people were home, headed there or winding down.On this particular Wednesday, the winter sun had already set, but it was unseasonably warm, in the high 70s. It was just after halftime of the University of Kansas basketball game against Texas Christian University. Kansas was up a point and a win meant the team would clinch the Big 12 conference title for the 13th year in a row, which also meant Austins was packed with Jayhawks fans besides its usual cast of regulars, among them Mr. Kuchibhotla, Mr. Madasani and Mr. Grillot.Ms. Dumala was at her Olathe home, three miles away, eating dinner and scrolling through Facebook.Mr. Kuchibhotla and Mr. Madasani were back at their table talking. The crowd on the patio had thinned out during the halftime break, but the televisions were still blaring.Suddenly, the sound of gunfire. \u201cPop, pause, then pop, pop, pop,\u201d said Tim Hibbard, the owner of a software company who was sitting at the bar sipping a Blue Moon beer. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like the movies where the gunfire is large and demanding of attention. The sound was subdued, almost underwhelming. Low fidelity is how I would describe it.\u201dMr. Kuchibhotla was hit first. Mr. Madasani, who had been sitting on the other side of the table, hit the ground, forced by a bullet, instinct or both. He crawled on his belly toward the opposite door. He thought the bullets were close by because the floor shook with each gunshot. \u201cAll I was thinking about at the time was about my baby, all I was thinking of was my wife\u2019s belly,\u201d said Mr. Madasani, whose wife was pregnant with their first child, a boy due in July. \u201cIn flashes, I was thinking, \u2018I have to live.\u2019\u201dOnce outside, he realized he was shot in the left leg. \u201cI saw Srivinas on the floor, not moving. I kept on yelling to everyone, \u2018Leave me, go and attend to him.\u2019\u201dMr. Grillot, the bar patron who had intervened earlier, chased Mr. Purinton into the parking lot. Mr. Purinton turned and shot him in the chest and hand.As people scattered, Vincent Baird, who was headed to the gas station across the street, ran toward the chaos to help. With four years of experience as an Army medic, he went straight to Mr. Kuchibhotla, whose breathing was shallow and labored.Once on his knees, Mr. Baird could see a gunshot wound in his chest. With the help of two others, Mr. Baird said, he cut a four-inch square from an unused garbage bag and taped it over the wound. He then checked for other wounds and, seeing none, he turned him on his side.Mr. Kuchibhotla stopped breathing at a couple of points, Mr. Baird said. Each time, he performed chest compressions until Mr. Kuchibhotla started breathing again and an ambulance arrived. He was pronounced dead at the University of Kansas Hospital.Mr. Purinton had fled amid the chaos. He ended up 80 miles away at a bar in Clinton, Mo., where he told a bartender that he had shot \u201ctwo Iranians.\u201dHours after the shooting, Ms. Dumala was an emotional wreck. Finally, she found the courage to search for more details on the shooting at Austins. The reports had not identified the victims, but included the name of the hospital in downtown Kansas City where they had been taken. What she didn\u2019t know was that her husband of four years was already dead.A car pulled into the driveway.It was one of their friends, Shashi Bolaram. Ms. Dumala opened the door. Voice quivering, she asked him, \u201cHe was there, wasn\u2019t he?\u201dMr. Bolaram nodded.Before Ms. Dumala could fully process what that might mean, there was a second knock at the door. She sat on the second stair as two Olathe police officers confirmed Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s death.On the half-hour ride to the hospital, Ms. Dumala sat in the back seat of a friend\u2019s car, her mind cluttered and spinning. It came to rest on this incomprehensible notion of sudden loss: Her beloved Srinu was dead. She remembers hearing her own hollowed voice pose an endless loop of questions to herself, each more desperate than the last: \u201cWhat should I do? What is this life? Is it true that I cannot see Srinu? Is it true that I can\u2019t hear his voice? Is it true I lost the person who loves me the most?\u201dThe next day, Ms. Dumala learned the horrific details of her husband\u2019s murder. An Olathe police officer and an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation told her who had killed him and why.The police officer \u2014 who was stopped by Ms. Dumala from uttering Mr. Purinton\u2019s name \u2014 also said that it appeared the shooting was premeditated.\u201cHold on,\u201d she said, stunned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cSomething planned,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen? At that moment? In that night?\u201d she pressed, the questions crashing into one another.The reality of what had happened to her husband began to wash over her.\u201cAt least until then, I was of the opinion that this was some random guy who came in and just shot three people, and my husband was unfortunate to be there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a lot harder for me to hear.\u201dThe term \u201chate crime\u201d was being used over and over and by the police, journalists and politicians to describe the death of her husband. All of a sudden, Mr. Kuchibhotla was a hate crime statistic, an example to bolster anti-hate legislation and now linked, fairly or not, to President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Days after Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s death, the president issued a statement condemning the shooting.Ms. Dumala was aghast, baffled by the man who took her husband from her. \u201cThat guy, I think he was hurt, I don\u2019t know what hurt him,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is he doing by taking away this life? Did he serve his purpose? Did he lessen his anger? Even I have anger now, but that does not give me the right to go and take away his life.\u201dThe funeral home made arrangements for Mr. Kuchibhotla to spend a final night in his Olathe home \u2014 a first for the company. His body was transported to the house in a discreet white van.\u201cWe did everything to accommodate their requests. We also wanted to be culturally sensitive and show the family that our community was behind them,\u201d said Christopher Holland, the funeral director. \u201cWe wanted them to heal from this tragedy.\u201dMr. Kuchibhotla was in repose on a cot in an empty dining room that he had painted an elegant burgundy where family and friends paid their final respects. He remained with Ms. Dumala and her family until early that Saturday, when he was returned to the funeral home to be prepared for the trip to his homeland.Ms. Dumala returned to Kansas with her parents in April, staying with a friend until she could summon the strength to return to her home without Srinu. She spent her first few weeks back in Kansas trying to figure out the next chapter, difficult to define because her visa status is now in limbo. She is also looking for the best way to help reduce hate crimes.Before her husband\u2019s death, Ms. Dumala shopped at KC India Mart in Overland Park, where she could find foods imported from home. Over the years, she and her husband had become friendly with the owners, and when Mr. Kuchibhotla died, the store\u2019s employees brought meals every day to friends and family gathered at the house.One May evening, Ms. Dumala and her parents went to the grocery store to pick up ingredients for a traditional chickpea dish. Ms. Dumala pushed an empty cart down the first aisle toward the produce, unprepared for what would happen next. She stopped, almost involuntarily, in front of a crate of miniature eggplants. The sigh was audible, the sadness palpable.\u201cThis was his favorite food,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how you cooked them, he loved any recipe made with eggplant.\u201dMs. Dumala lingered, lost in the memory of the simple act of baking her late husband\u2019s favorite dish.John Eligon contributed reporting.Follow Audra Burch on Twitter @abscribe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Exciting Life and Lonely Death of a Basketball Vagabond", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting on a park bench overlooking Lake Ontario in Toronto on a brilliant summer day in 2015, I was approached by a woman looking for directions.The woman mentioned that she had emigrated from Iran a couple of months before, and I replied that I knew of only one person who had recently lived in Iran, an American who had played basketball there.By coincidence, she also knew a basketball player in Iran. He had circulated in her social group, and they had been at many of the same parties.\u201cYou know, the one who died,\u201d she said.But I did not know whom she meant, and she was embarrassed that she could not pronounce his name. She pulled a phone from her bag, typed in some characters and slowly handed it to me. I could feel her watching my face as I read.It became clear that the only American I knew in Iran was the same one she knew: a charismatic 6-foot-10, real-life globetrotter named Jackson Vroman. But according to the words on her phone, Vroman was dead at age 34, discovered a month earlier at the bottom of a friend\u2019s swimming pool in Hollywood.I must have stared at the phone for a while because I eventually realized she was gently asking if I was O.K.Six years earlier, I had planned to write about Vroman. In October 2009, when he was heading to Tehran from Beirut, Lebanon, I spoke to him by telephone for about an hour during his layover in Amman, Jordan. He told me of his adventures playing ball internationally \u2014 of his two passports smeared with the ink of dozens of countries, of passionate basketball fans in Lithuania, of wild nights avoiding the police in Iran and of a Lebanese night life that never shut down.It would make a great story, I told him, and we decided to reconvene after the Iranian domestic league ended. But we never spoke again. He could never sit still very long, and I was focused on other work. We had one additional exchange on Facebook, when I passed along a greeting from Mike D\u2019Antoni, who had coached him when he briefly played for the Phoenix Suns in the N.B.A. \u201cTell Mike I said, Hi,\u201d Vroman replied. And then nothing.But the chance meeting with the woman in Toronto would inevitably turn my attention back to an athlete who might have become a sensation in the N.B.A. had he made his career here and not overseas. Imagine what the American media would have done with a player who dressed in costumes in his spare time, hung out at art festivals, essentially worshiped a tiny white dog, partied relentlessly and \u2014 it should be noted \u2014 was a relentless rebounder.The Toronto encounter would also lead me to to Jackson\u2019s father, Brett, a former center at U.C.L.A. and the one person whose life, in some ways, was just like his son\u2019s. And I would also get to know Brett\u2019s second wife, Pari Habashi, a therapist who loved, nurtured and fretted over Jackson until the day he died.In April 2015, the three of them attended the 40th anniversary of John Wooden\u2019s last championship team at U.C.L.A., one that Brett played on. Jackson was gaunt, not in playing shape and seemingly overcome with emotions and a growing spirituality. He went to where his stepmom sat, got down on his knees and hugged her.\u201cI remember he was just tired,\u201d Habashi said. \u201cI knew there was something different then. But he was so loving. He was hanging on Brett and hanging on me and saying, \u2018I love you so much.\u2019\u201dThe next month, Jackson called his stepmother to wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day, and again told her he loved her.\u201cIt was the last time we spoke,\u201d she said.Brett Vroman is now 61, a gentle bear of a man with silvery hair that he let grow past his shoulders for several months after his son\u2019s death, one of the many ways he has spent the last two years trying to cope with the pain. He walks with a slight hitch from years of playing basketball around the world on gimpy feet and from folding his seven-foot frame into cramped airplane seats and hotel beds.Over 40 years ago, he was a lithe basketball prospect out of Provo High School in Utah. He stood 6-10 in eighth grade, jumped out of the gym, and was eventually recruited to U.C.L.A. by Wooden and handed the impossible task of being the next Bill Walton.There were definite similarities with Walton. He, too, was a gifted big man with a shaggy blond mane and a rebellious streak.\u201cI prefer to say I was a free spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cJackson was the same way.\u201dAs a skinny freshman at U.C.L.A., Brett Vroman contributed to that 1975 national title. But he clashed with the Bruins\u2019 next head coach, Gene Bartow, and transferred to U.N.L.V. Today, he claims the distinction of being the only person to play for both the revered Wooden and the provocative Jerry Tarkanian.While Brett was at U.N.L.V., he married a young woman named Lesle Davis. He was then drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers, but did not stick. He played 11 games for the Utah Jazz in 1980 and then crossed the Atlantic to carve out a career in Europe, taking along his wife and young children: Jackson and his older sister, Lauren.For a while, it was an idyllic life. The kids went to school in Spain and vacationed in the Greek Isles. In Italy, they lived next to Harvey Catchings, another basketball big man making a living in Europe.The Vromans and the Catchingses car-pooled their kids to school; the group included a little girl named Tamika Catchings, a future star in the W.N.B.A.In Italy, the Vromans met Joe Bryant, another expat basketball player, who was known as Jelly Bean. He introduced his 7-year-old son to the Vromans, calling him \u201cKobe Bean.\u201dAs adventurous as the European lifestyle could be, things deteriorated when Brett Vroman\u2019s playing days ended. By the late 1980s the family had settled back in Utah, but Brett struggled to adjust as he studied to become a mental health worker, the same job he holds today. After 13 years of marriage, he and Lesle Davis split up when Jackson was in the first grade.Davis, who declined to be interviewed for this article, took the children to live in Alaska but eventually sent both of them back to Utah to live with their father.For Jackson, the estrangement from his mother lasted over a decade and ended only when he visited her and his half brother, Robin Anselme, at his mother\u2019s Florida home a few years ago. He described the meeting in 17 words on his Instagram account: \u201cEmotional day reuniting with my brother and mom I haven\u2019t had contact with in over 15 yrs.\u201dBut the true impact of that long separation was left unsaid.Jackson\u2019s adolescent years in Salt Lake City were turbulent, and at one point he and his sister were sent to live with their aunt, Shelley Vroman. Jackson clashed with his father at times, and basketball could be the most contentious subject of all.Still, with the help of his stepmother Jackson managed to get admitted to Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, where he played for a coach named Curtis Condie. And after two years there, Condie recommended him to Iowa State\u2019s coach, Larry Eustachy, thinking Eustachy would appreciate Jackson.Sure enough, Eustachy fell instantly for him. Tough, emotionally vulnerable, loyal and rebellious all at once, Jackson Vroman reminded Eustachy of himself.On a recruiting visit to Utah in September 2001, Eustachy watched Jackson do battle in a tournament in Salt Lake City.\u201cHe got in a fight and decked some gang member,\u201d Eustachy recalled. \u201cBrett was worried and asked me if I was still interested in Jackson. I said: \u201cInterested? I love him.\u2019\u201dJackson\u2019s college career had its mishaps, but he blossomed into a star. In June 2004 he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls at the beginning of the second round and immediately traded to the Phoenix Suns for Luol Deng.Jackson proceeded to play a half-season for the Suns and D\u2019Antoni before he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets in January 2006. Brett proudly recalls his son dominating Tracy McGrady in one game, and playing even better against Tim Duncan.But in February 2006, Brett was watching on TV in Salt Lake City when Jackson took a pass from Chris Paul in a game against Brett\u2019s old team, the Jazz. While attempting a dunk, Jackson shattered his wrist. By the time it healed, the course of his life had changed. He was about to dip his size 15 basketball shoes into his father\u2019s footsteps. He was headed overseas.Basketball abroad was a wild and sometimes dangerous experience for Jackson Vroman. In 2008, while playing in Lithuania for BC Lietuvos Rytas, he took a knee to the chest in a scramble for a loose ball. On the team bus afterward, he struggled to keep from passing out.Eventually the bus was rerouted to a hospital in Vilnius, where it was discovered that his chest cavity was filling with blood. He ended up with a 12-inch incision in his side and a pair of half-inch hoses sticking out of his torso to drain the fluid.His father offered to catch the next plane to Lithuania, but Jackson said it was not necessary. In our 2009 conversation, he told me he paid cash to the hospital\u2019s staff to get morphine for the pain. But he said he also sent a friend, with $10,000 of his money, to Amsterdam to get hashish and marijuana. It was not the last time he would seek to self-medicate.After he healed, Vroman signed a $700,000 deal with Saba Mehr, a team in the Iranian professional league. Relations between the governments of the United States and Iran were openly hostile at that time, and Jackson even posted an irreverent photo of himself next to a sign that read, \u201cDown with U.S.A.\u201dBut as usual, he had no trouble finding the party. He discovered a group of young, westernized residents of Tehran and joined their inner circle.One of them was the Iranian woman from the park in Toronto, who asked not to be identified for fear of government reprisals. She said that Vroman was always gracious and friendly and that people flocked to him. One, a 34-year-old construction worker named Borzoo, agreed to a telephone interview.\u201cWe had a group of friends and we liked to party on the weekends,\u201d Borzoo said. \u201cWhen Jackson came on the scene, it just exploded.\u201d\u201cOne night I was having four or five guys over,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen word got out that Jackson was coming, 60 women showed up. He could always break the language barrier.\u201dIt was around that time that Vroman was recruited to play for the national team of Lebanon, a familiar practice in international basketball. He accepted an offer of about $300,000 and, without fanfare, became a naturalized Lebanese citizen.Most of the other members of the Lebanese team, including Matt Freije, a former Vanderbilt forward, stayed in a decent downtown hotel in Beirut.But Jackson had a contractual arrangement that allowed him to stay in a more opulent setting. The Phoenicia Hotel sits across the street from the carcass of an abandoned building that still bears the pockmarks of a more violent time in Lebanese history. But it is close to the Mediterranean beachfront and, most important for Jackson, that famed Beirut night life.\u201cHe literally came right from being out all night in the nightclubs to practice, and he would play harder and better than anyone else in the gym,\u201d Freije said of Vroman. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he did it. For him, it was nothing.\u201dAt one point, Jackson paid for his father to fly to Turkey to see him play in the world championships. And back in Utah later that summer, Jackson invited his father along to a snazzy weekend party in Park City. As they shared a chairlift ride up the mountain, Jackson spoke of the similar routes their lives had taken.And yet there were telling differences between father and son. Jackson was now 28, but he had stayed untethered \u2014 there were many women, but no wife, or children, or overarching responsibilities. He was not, in some ways, like his father at all.Following two seasons in Iran and two summers in Lebanon, Jackson moved on to China, where, beginning in 2011, he played for an assortment of teams \u2014 the Shenzhen Leopards, the Jiangsu Dragons and Shandong \u2014 for lucrative sums. But he did not like China and, among other things, he missed his beloved dog, Hugo Bauce.Still, Jackson kept playing, and making good money. Which meant he could still do the things he wanted to do, such as partying in Las Vegas or inviting the Vroman clan for a weeklong vacation in Lake Tahoe, Calif., in the summer of 2013. He could be remarkably generous, and he paid for everything on that trip, including a chef.At one point during that stay, he found an old set of horseshoes. But before his family could play, Jackson dragged his cousin Ben (a former kicker for the University of Utah football team) to a hardware store. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just play,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe had to paint them first. That was Jackson.\u201dBut eventually, after eight years overseas in six countries, Jackson Vroman\u2019s career began to wind down. He was feeling it emotionally. Uncertain what to do, he told his father he was thinking of asking Eustachy for an assistant\u2019s job at Colorado State. But he never did.Instead, he moved into the homes of wealthy friends in Los Angeles, and worked out less frequently. He also told his father he was occasionally feeling faint, sometimes even passing out when he stood up. Years before, Brett had been found to have atrial fibrillation, a heart condition he controls with medication. He wanted his son to consult with the same doctor who had treated him.But that never happened, either. Jackson was too busy planning beach trips to the south of France and emerging as a fixture at the annual Burning Man festival, where his giant costumed frame stood out in the swirling Nevada desert.And his drug use mushroomed. He told Brett that he had participated in an indigenous ayahuasca ceremony, involving a strong hallucinogenic brew.Then, two months before he died, Jackson overdosed on a combination of GHB, a depressant; ketamine, an anesthetic; and cocaine, and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Brett never learned of the overdose until someone told him at his son\u2019s memorial service.\u201cOf course, I would have liked to have known,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand there may be a code that you don\u2019t go running to someone\u2019s parents. Jackson was an adult. I can\u2019t put the blame on someone else. But you want to know.\u201dInstinctively, though, Brett Vroman, a therapist with experience in substance abuse, sensed something was wrong.With his concerns increasing, Brett fashioned a note to his son suggesting he come home to Utah to settle down and get control of his life. But he thought it would fall on deaf ears.What he did not know was that in the days leading up to his son\u2019s death, Jackson was telling friends that he loved them, the same thing he had told his parents at the U.C.L.A. celebration.\u201cHe went to all of our friends and said, \u2018I love him for this, and I love her for that,\u2019\u201d said one of those friends, Monica Mejia. She added that Jackson also provided instructions about where his little dog would go should anything happen to him.On the night he died, Jackson was staying with a friend in Hollywood. In the early hours of June 29, 2015, according to home surveillance video viewed by the Los Angeles Police Department, he went outside with his dog, sat by the pool and smoked a cigarette.At about 3:25 a.m., he staggered to his feet, lost his balance and fell face first into the water. His body floated for several minutes and then sank. On so many other nights he would have been surrounded by adoring friends. But the video surveillance from the pool showed that no one else was present, except his frantic dog.\u201cThat is why it was ruled an accident,\u201d Detective Lt. John Radtke of the police department said. Jackson Vroman was pronounced dead by Los Angeles County Fire and Rescue at 10:11 a.m.At first there was speculation that he had tripped and hit his head. But months later the autopsy and toxicology reports revealed the presence of that same perilous cocktail of ketamine, GHB and cocaine. Their effects likely exacerbated an enlarged heart (different from his father\u2019s) that was not diagnosed until after his death. It is the same ailment that, along with drugs, killed the basketball star Len Bias in 1986.In the days following Jackson\u2019s death, two lavish memorials were held in Los Angeles.A few of Jackson\u2019s closest friends spread some of his ashes at Burning Man. The rest were taken back to Utah by his father and Pari and buried on a hill next to Brett\u2019s mother, a writing teacher whom Jackson adored.Brett had so badly wanted for his son to come home to Utah, but never this way.\u201cI don\u2019t know if laying the tombstone had some kind of subconscious impact on me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been struggling so much with missing him lately.\u201dBrett and Pari originally commissioned an artist friend of Jackson\u2019s to fashion a headstone depicting Jackson with his arms spread out like the wings of Icarus, the mythological figure who flew too close to the sun and crashed back to earth. They then opted for a simpler headstone, but last month Brett had the image tattooed onto his forearm.He sometimes wears his son\u2019s silver sneakers and can still roar with laughter and tremble in tears at thoughts of his son. To deal with his grief, he sought therapy and the counsel of a Native American shaman, something Jackson would surely have appreciated.And basketball, with all its familial meaning to the Vromans, remains a comfort. Brett watched the recent N.B.A. playoffs closely and called it \u201cthe best entertainment there is.\u201dBack in January, he also gave private coaching lessons to an 8-year-old boy, the son of a friend. I asked him if he had done the same with Jackson. But he said by the time Jackson became serious about the sport, he was already much older than this boy.He did, however, recall a story from when his son was about the same age.Brett had kept all of his own trophies and medals in a box and Jackson loved to admire them. One day Brett came home to find his buddies at the house, waiting to pick him up for a fishing trip.And there was Jackson holding court in the living room, displaying the trophies and regaling everyone with stories of his dad\u2019s past athletic glory.\u201cHe was so proud,\u201d Brett said. \u201cHe wanted to be like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tate Modern and the Battle for London\u2019s Soul", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "Cultured TravelerAs luxury condos proliferate across London, the evolving Tate Modern provides a model for the city\u2019s public spaces.Supported byI recently found myself staring into a stranger\u2019s living room, waiting for something beautiful to happen.Was the view of abandoned luxury also part of the museum? Did my strange mixture of emotions \u2014 the simultaneous curiosity and self-reproach of the voyeur \u2014 have a number on the audio tour? Guiltily, I leaned out over the terrace, staring at those slippers. I waited for some kind of performance to begin. I wanted to witness a murder, an affair, a revelation.This visual standoff offered a perfect distillation of the current battle for London\u2019s soul. As more of these luxury towers spring up across the city, transforming neighborhoods into affluent ghost towns, Londoners are facing difficult questions: What kind of city do we want to live in? What do we want our streets to look like? What kind of public spaces are valuable to us? Part of the answer to these questions may lie in the entangled story of the Tate Modern and the Bankside neighborhood it helped spawn.The museum may be the among the best-known examples of the now fashionable transformation of derelict factories into dynamic cultural space. Since its inception, the Tate Modern has never rested on its laurels, continuing to redefine itself as an institution of outreach, self-reflection and learning. The museum\u2019s evolution over time provides a potential blueprint for how London, and indeed any city, can provide spaces that encourage its inhabitants to be collectively present. You cannot experience the Tate Modern through Facebook or a tweet; you must show up, with an open mind, surrounded by your fellow visitors.London is perhaps the most international city in the world, but at its heart it has always been a local city, a series of low-slung villages. The expanded Tate Modern embraces this human scale even if its aspirations are more global than ever.Given the real estate mania that has engulfed Bankside and the surrounding Borough of Southwark, it\u2019s easy to forget what a bold decision it was to shift the center of London\u2019s contemporary art world 17 years ago to a hulking abandoned power station south of the river. Ask any Londoner about wandering amid the postindustrial squalor of Southwark in the late 1980s and you will be regaled by stories of taking life into your own hands.During the Industrial Revolution, Southwark became a nucleus of manufacturing because of its ample water, cheap land and cheap labor. Textile plants, breweries, a gasworks and coal and timber yards all led to astonishing levels of pollution. The Bankside Power Station, a giant brick sarcophagus bisected by an ominous chimney-spire, was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and began operations in 1952. The power station, across the Thames from St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral like a shadow basilica of industrial consumption, chugged away, converting the oil in its great underground tanks into London\u2019s electricity until 1981.Perhaps even more unusual than the Tate Modern\u2019s choice of an abandoned power station for a home was its approach to the building itself. In an architectural competition filled with overwrought interventions, Herzog & de Meuron\u2019s winning design was most notable for its restraint: The plan left Scott\u2019s brick shell largely untouched and drew out its industrial features rather than mask them. The architects have said that the smartest move of their careers was to make the great void of Turbine Hall, the former engine house, even bigger by dropping its floor to the basement level and allowing the visitor to enter down a long ramp.My first encounter with Turbine Hall came in 2002, when I was living in London for the year, suffering from that very specific condition that often afflicts Americans if they spend any extended length of time in Britain, whereby everything feels both too familiar and too foreign. I remember the feeling of opening the door to the museum and drifting down that slope, confronted with the yawning mouth of a 10-story-high, red-rubber-Venus-fly-trap-cum-Victrola-horn. This maroon colossus, by the sculptor Anish Kapoor, dwarfed visitors and yet also managed to bring us together in mutual and gleeful bewilderment.Confronted with the unusual size and shape of Turbine Hall \u2014 it is taller than it is wide \u2014 I suddenly became aware of the possibilities of space. Space in all directions. People, unsure of how to react to such aesthetic sublimity, simply lay on the floor. I was witnessing firsthand how the monumental scale of Turbine Hall disrupted the quiet triangulation between the viewer\u2019s body, the artwork and the gallery. It soon became clear that the normal rules of decorum for how one should act in a museum should not, could not, apply here.Achim Borchardt-Hume, the director of exhibitions at the Tate Modern, describes Turbine Hall as a cross between \u201ca covered street and a public park.\u201d The \u201cpublic\u201d part of this equation is vital, for the museum is largely financed by the government and \u2014 crucially \u2014 does not charge admission. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s collection,\u201d Mr. Borchardt-Hume said.I had a strange emotional reaction to the exhibition: I began to weep. I remember being embarrassed about it, but looking over and seeing the person beside me weeping as well. Maybe it was just allergies. To describe the work is wholly inadequate as the materials themselves were unimpressive, some lights, some mirrors, some mist.Yet to experience the transformation of that space alongside another human, to witness our shared wonder, was profound. Here was our entire experience rendered inside a box. A moment frozen in time and yet a moment that was deeply ephemeral. Visitors knew they could not take the experience with them and so they stayed, they picnicked beneath a fake sun, they fell asleep, they dreamed, they wrote, cried, laughed, sang, danced. In short, they were present. Together.In retrospect, perhaps the reason we all felt so alive in there was because the iPhone had not yet been invented. The Turbine Hall experience has developed and morphed over the years alongside our increasingly reiterative culture where, for many young people, an experience can no longer be processed \u2014 it must be captured, commented on and retweeted by a virtual chorus to gain any sort of existential traction. Solitude no longer exists.At first glance, the agora of Turbine Hall cuts against the grain of such digital collectivism. It is inherently local, temporary and not easily reduced to an Instagram post or 140 characters. The Turbine Hall commission is not an object \u2014 it is a feeling, an experience, an encounter. You have to be there. And yet such ephemeral, circumscribed cultural events represent, in some ways, the epitome of our FOMO (fear of missing out) times: \u201cDid you see the new Turbine Hall? #lifechanging\u201d A show across an ocean that resists all descriptors becomes the ultimate get.Back out in the hall I noticed that even though the exhibition was down, people were still using the space, lounging on the carpets, pondering the ceiling, tweeting, sleeping. Nearby, a French school group collapsed into a scrum on the floor and began ululating nursery rhymes. Experience cannot be canceled.\u201cIt\u2019s funny to say, but one of the most important parts of \u2018Anywhen\u2019 is the carpet,\u201d said Andrea Lissoni, a senior curator who worked on the show. \u201cThis thin little material offers a certain kind of permission.\u201dI think Jacobs would be worried but perhaps also mildly optimistic about the current state of Bankside. Like much of London, the neighborhood seems poised on a knife edge, balanced precariously between hyper-development and thoughtful urban planning. Indeed, the Tate Modern was forced to accelerate its expansion plans when the neighborhood it helped jump-start threatened to overwhelm its footprint. The area surrounding the museum is occupied by a ring of new commercial buildings; their ground floors feature the potpourri of corporate-cool restaurants common throughout London. There are the homemade ramen chain, the cold-pressed juice chain, the authentic Californian burrito chain. This kind of cloned proliferation represents a new form of urban blight of which Jacobs would not approve.Here, tourists and locals rub shoulders as they settle down to a smorgasbord of pop-up street food including Ethiopian Flavours\u2019s vegetable misir and injera crepes, or Kappacasein\u2019s local Ogleshield cheese raclette. The market, in existence for over 1,000 years, has only recently become an everyday phenomenon, and its popularity has had a profound effect on this part of the city. I listened as a butcher described the history of meatpacking in the area to two Italian tourists. A resident walking his dog chimed in. The world expanded.The plan is to create vibrant pedestrian zones that use the arched spaces beneath the rail lines, said Donald Hyslop, the chairman of Better Bankside and the director of Regeneration and Community Partnerships at the Tate Modern, as he walked with me along the proposed Low Line route. \u201cDisused, dirty and derelict spaces,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be transformed into an urban park where independent business can thrive and local communities can explore.\u201d\u201cWhere can I sit?\u201d I asked. The waiter sheepishly pointed to a lone chair in the corner. \u201cThere, I think, is O.K.,\u201d he said. Next to me, I could feel the ghost of Jane Jacobs cringing.I returned to London a month later, in March, the day after a terrorist attack in which a man had run down pedestrians with a car before fatally stabbing a police officer outside of Parliament. The mood of the city was defiant; business had not stopped. Regular life became both a form of resistance and mourning. When another attack occurred in June, this time in Southwark itself, at Borough Market, citizens were again unyielding in their adherence to life: Even fleeing from the scene, at least one Londoner insisted on carrying his overpriced pint with him.Most of the performances took place in the stunning underground Tanks beneath the Tate Modern\u2019s new wing, formerly the Switch House and now christened the Blavatnik Building, after Sir Leonard Blavatnik, the recently knighted Ukrainian-born, Anglo-American billionaire. The museum smartly rehired Herzog & de Meuron to also design the expansion. Though constructing a tower was much different from the original renovation, the architects again used a light hand when it came to the Tanks, leaving the concrete caverns largely untouched from their original form, when they were filled with the oil that once powered the city.\u201cThese plants are a little too oversized,\u201d Ms. Lewis later told me. \u201cMaybe aggressive. They have their own agency. But it\u2019s still this gesture of welcome.\u201d Occasionally people chanted, sang, gathered, dispersed. At times, it was unclear who was part of the work and who was a visitor. I\u2019m not sure the distinction mattered. This was sidewalk contact as performance art, an avant-garde rendition of \u201cJane Jacobs: The Musical!\u201d\u201cMany from this new generation of artists are inspired by Fujiko\u2019s deep history of blending the technical and the organic,\u201d said Catherine Wood, a curator of \u201cTen Days Six Nights.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s this grande dame of the atmospheric installation scene.\u201dFor being a grande dame, Ms. Nakaya is a quiet, modest woman with twinkling eyes. She has seen the winds come and go. When I talked with her on the terrace, surrounded by her creation, we got into a long conversation about the mechanics of her custom fog nozzles, about the weight of water, about purity, form, grandchildren. We grew damp from the condensation as delighted children ran through the billowing clouds, unaware they were experiencing art.\u201cThis is third-generation London fog,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst was the fog of the Romantic poets and Turner\u2019s landscapes, and then the smog of the industrial age, and now this.\u201dAround us, the fog was changing with the breeze. It rose up and twisted, obscuring the world beyond. For a moment we were trapped in a cocoon, completely transported, and then the mist broke and she and I were standing next to a museum inside a great and beautiful city.Reif Larsen is the author of the novels \u201cI Am Radar\u201d and \u201cThe Selected Works of T.

{"Headline": "Keeping Up, on Camera, Is No Longer Just for the Kardashians", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotedThis spring, John Henry, a 24-year-old entrepreneur and the founder of a Harlem-based nonprofit, had a very strange first date. The woman he had taken to a SoHo restaurant seemed to know a suspicious amount about the places he\u2019d been in recent weeks and the conversations he\u2019d had. This, Mr. Henry slowly realized, was a byproduct of his recent decision to have a videographer film large swaths of his daily life: his work, travels, lunches and even subway commutes, which Mr. Henry had then posted on Facebook and Instagram.\u201cIt removed so much of the humanity of the conversation, because my life is just a big piece of content now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was literally no element of surprise.\u201dBut people are watching, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands. \u201cThe reach is incredible,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing to me that a regular person can reach a quarter of a million people a month if they put the work in.\u201dDespite the self-promotional nature of this phenomenon, most of these workaday video protagonists claim altruistic reasons for putting their lives under the microscope.\u201cI wanted to step up as a role model,\u201d said Gerard Adams, 32, a founder of the website Elite Daily who calls himself the \u201cMillennial Mentor,\u201d a title he has trademarked. \u201cI had to overcome a lot of failure and challenges.\u201d Three videographers take turns filming Mr. Adams at his New Jersey-based business incubator, at the gym, and with his family and friends.Patrick Bet-David, 38, the chief executive of an insurance company, said he wanted \u201cpeople to see that you can have a wife and kids, and work out, and stay healthy and manage a business. You can pull it off.\u201d\u201cYou never know when you could be having a conversation that naturally leads to something that brings value to somebody watching,\u201d Mr. Bet-David said. \u201cYou try to catch all the moments.\u201d\u201cIf people are distracted at work on their phones, I want to be their distraction,\u201d Ms. Wakeman said.Ms. Wakeman said that her company had received significantly more business since a video team began following her in February, and that there had been a bump in preorders for her coming book, \u201cNo Ego: How Leaders Can Cut the Cost of Workplace Drama, End Entitlement, and Drive Big Results.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about promoting their company,\u201d said Karen North, director of digital social media and clinical professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s about promoting themselves as the star of their company.\u201dDr. North said the psychological strategy was quite clever. \u201cThe real sea change of digital is that it makes everything personal,\u201d she said, adding that individuals like Ms. Wakeman could \u201ctalk to you through Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and you feel as if they\u2019re talking to you personally.\u201d And if they engage with even a few people in the comments or retweet what their followers say, Dr. North said that \u201cevery individual feels validated.\u201dMs. Wakeman\u2019s most recent videos are filmed and produced by VaynerTalent, a division of the company VaynerMedia, whose chief executive, Gary Vaynerchuk, is largely credited for starting the full-time videographer trend. Since 2015, a videographer has followed Mr. Vaynerchuk everywhere, at least five days a week, for a docuseries called DailyVee. He receives roughly 40 million views a month across his social channels.Hiring a full-time \u2014 or even part-time \u2014 camera and production crew isn\u2019t cheap. Adam Hamwey, who shoots and produces content for Mr. Henry, said that daily rates ranged from $300 to $500. Mr. Adams said he pays six figures annually for his three-person team. VaynerTalent offers packages starting at $25,000 a month. They work with clients who want a comprehensive personal brand strategy, which means you\u2019re not simply hiring a videographer and producer but also a growth hacker, media strategist and analytics expert. Ms. Wakeman, for instance, has a team of seven people.Mr. Vaynerchuk, 41, said that within a very short time of having a camera trail him, he had ceased to notice it. \u201cIt makes sense how reality TV could work,\u201d he said, adding that it is now completely natural for him to live his life \u201con the record.\u201dIt\u2019s not always easy to do this, though. Mr. Adams of Elite Daily, said that when he broke up with his girlfriend, viewers reached out to ask why she had suddenly disappeared from his videos. \u201cThat was really tough,\u201d he said. But even this, he believes, is a way to grow his following. \u201cThe more vulnerable you are, the more you will build trust and a real community and people who will take the ride with you,\u201d he said.Ms. Wakeman, who keeps most of her personal life off screen, thinks it\u2019s harder for women to make themselves similarly vulnerable. \u201cI have been shocked at the posts I get that call out that I am fat or who make sexual comments about me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have talked with men, and they simply do not get these comments at all.\u201dMr. Vaynerchuk said he expected some people to consider him self-absorbed. \u201cI deploy ungodly amounts of empathy to people who read and hear about this and what their initial reaction is,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it. But I fundamentally believe it will be a greater norm in half a decade.\u201dHe pointed out that Twitter and Facebook were once considered engines of narcissism. Of course, they can be. But it is also commonplace now to tweet about your breakfast or post endless photos of your dog. Maybe a decade hence, the streets will be crowded with pedestrians and their camera crews.If so, here is a glimpse of what that might look like. In April, the investment firm Charles Schwab filmed a short documentary about Mr. Henry, featuring his rise from a 19-year-old doorman to the chief executive of a successful mobile dry cleaning company. The Schwab team followed Mr. Henry for three days, as Mr. Henry\u2019s videographer, Mr. Hamwey, followed them. And then both camera crews trailed Mr. Henry to Mr. Vaynerchuk\u2019s office, where they met up with his cameraman. \u201cYou walked in with an army!\u201d Mr. Vaynerchuk said.The cameras were arranged with Mr. Vaynerchuk\u2019s and Mr. Henry\u2019s cameramen in the conference room and the Schwab team outside, shooting through the glass walls. \u201cThat\u2019s how we made it work,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cIt was a little silly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vegan Ice Cream Enters a Golden Age", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteTwo summers ago, a friend and I met for coffee and ice cream. She got a scoop of vegan mint chip \u2014 and a whole-milk cappuccino.I just like the vegan version better, she explained, offering me a bite.Whether or not the vegan mint chip was better than its dairy iteration is debatable. But what was clear was that it was absolutely delicious: silky, creamy and very smooth. And totally superior to the chalky, soy-based Tofutti Cuties my lactose-avoiding friends got stuck with at the end of every summer barbecue, for lack of a better option.Happily, this is no longer the case. The past few years have been a glorious time for vegans and others who stay forgo dairy.And as the demand for nondairy explodes, so does the number of products on the market, including a slew of brand-new nondairy ice creams, yogurts and cheeses, along with the various nut and plant milks used to make them. And even better, many of these new products actually taste great, which is a boon whether you strictly avoid dairy at all costs, or just want to expand your creamy horizons.Mr. Van Buskirk sees this trend continuing, keeping in step with the decline in sales of traditional dairy products.\u201cThe growth in nut milks in particular has been exponential compared to regular dairy,\u201d he said, adding that soy milk sales are decreasing as those of nut and other plant milks rise.For home cooks, this is promising territory, a rich if head-spinning new world of ingredients to experiment with.Supermarket shelves are now filled with quarts of plant-based milks. Cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, oat, flax, rice, quinoa and hemp varieties have joined the ranks of coconut, soy and almond milks. On a trip to France this summer, I even sampled chestnut milk, and I am still kicking myself for not buying an extra suitcase to haul home containers of the sweet, gentle elixir.But with so many options, which plant-based milk, or combination of milks, makes the best homemade nondairy ice cream?But even before I began my testing, I had some experience making nondairy ice creams, most of them relying on readily available, relatively inexpensive coconut milk. With its high fat content and creamy texture, coconut milk (or, better still, coconut cream) is a great substitute for dairy. The downside is that the coconut milk has a pronounced coconut flavor, even when it is blended with intense ingredients like chocolate, peanut butter or raspberry.Daniel Goetz, the company\u2019s founder, turned to coconut after rejecting soy milk because of problems finding a reliable organic, fair-trade supply, and concerns about genetically modified soy beans. Finding what he called a \u201cclean and honest\u201d supply of organic, fair-trade coconut milk was easier than doing the same for soy or many nut milks.He makes sure all his creamy nondairy creations work well with coconut, looking to flavors like lime and orange. His hugely popular frozen orange coconut cream pop is as beloved by \u201cpeople who have never even heard of veganism as it is by vegans,\u201d he said.Mr. Goetz advises home cooks looking to make nondairy ice cream out of coconut milk to add vanilla and sea salt.\u201cThey help tame the coconut flavor,\u201d he said.But another technique to mellow the flavor of coconut milk or cream is to combine it with a different nondairy milk. I ended up doing just that in my master recipe for a nondairy base. After testing all the available milk options, I concluded that hemp and cashew milk make the best partners for the coconut. Mildly flavored and very creamy, hemp and cashew milks are relatively easy to find at health food stores and supermarkets. Use either in combination with the coconut milk.I slightly preferred the hemp milk to the cashew milk because it is just a bit richer, and ended up dismissing almond, rice, quinoa, flax and oat milks, which I did not find rich enough, and macadamia, because its flavor was too intense. But play around with the base, and customize it to your taste.\u201cI\u2019ve been chasing vegan ice cream for years,\u201d he said, \u201cand they are really hard to do well.\u201dFor a while, he was making his own Brazil nut milk to use as the base. But when that became prohibitively expensive, he switched to a combination of coconut, hemp and almond milks.\u201cThe hemp milk gets the coconut flavor to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich enough to feel really creamy, but neutral enough not to interfere with any ingredients you want to add.\u201dHe\u2019s used the coconut-hemp-almond mixture as a base for mint chip, coffee and various chocolate nondairy ice creams, and he is constantly coming up with new flavors to meet increasing demand.Using high-fat, plant-based milks is one way to achieve creaminess in a nondairy ice cream. But stirring in a liquid sugar (often in addition to regular cane sugar) improves the texture and helps keep ice crystals at bay.Mr. Morgenstern suggests that home cooks substitute agave syrup or honey for some of the regular sugar in their nondairy ice cream bases. But, he advises, these bold-tasting sweeteners should match the flavors they\u2019re churning. (For example, he makes a banana-agave.)His tip: Simmer honey until it caramelizes, then add that to the base. \u201cCaramelizing the honey condenses its richness, and makes the ice cream even silkier,\u201d he said.One thing he\u2019s noticed in terms of his nondairy offerings is that they are just as popular with those who love dairy as they are with those who avoid it at all costs. This is a complete turnaround from a few years ago, when dairy eaters routinely eschewed vegan offerings, assuming they couldn\u2019t possibly taste as good as regular, butterfat-rich ice cream.\u201cThese days, people don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s vegan or not,\u201d Mr. Morgenstern said. \u201cThey are attracted to the flavor profile. Then when they taste it, they see that it can be just as good, or maybe even better than regular ice cream.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tour de France Analysis From Its Most Infamous Rider: Lance Armstrong", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesThe host is Lance Armstrong.In 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour titles for doping and was barred for life from competing in Olympic sports. He admitted doping and lost his sponsors and his livelihood. But this summer, at 45, he took a giant step back into the public eye \u2014 and into his sport \u2014 by starting a podcast about this year\u2019s Tour and agreeing to write an accompanying blog for Outside magazine.In some ways, though, it\u2019s the same old Armstrong: He has not arrived on his knees, begging for acceptance or forgiveness from a sport he sent into turmoil, especially here in the United States, where he brought cycling into the mainstream. He curses and criticizes and challenges old enemies, like the longtime Tour director Christian Prudhomme, and he isn\u2019t afraid to say things that other commentators might be too timid to say.While it can make for interesting listening, not everyone is celebrating his return.As soon as the podcast appeared online, I received a text from one of his former teammates with a link to \u201cStages,\u201d with the words: \u201cLess of this.\u201d Some people in cycling just don\u2019t want to talk about Armstrong, or even to see his face anymore. And I agree that it is too soon for Armstrong to march back into the sport as if he and his lies didn\u2019t nearly strangle it.It\u2019s hard to say, though, what the majority of cycling fans think about Armstrong\u2019s podcast and blog. Commenters on Outside\u2019s Facebook page are overwhelmingly anti-Armstrong, saying they are disappointed that the magazine gave Armstrong a platform. More than a few people said they were canceling their subscriptions. Still, lots of people gave the podcast post a Facebook thumbs-up.\u201cTo be honest with you, we just fundamentally believed that he would have some really great insights about the Tour just based on his own experiences,\u201d Keyes said, explaining that this wasn\u2019t the first time a disgraced figure returned to the spotlight to speak publicly about an area of expertise.\u201cEven Nixon became a valuable talking head on NBC talking about foreign policy,\u201d Keyes said.In sports, though, forgiveness seems to come especially easy these days. Fallen heroes like Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire are back in the embrace of the major leagues. The luckiest of the bunch, inexplicably, are rewarded for their insolence with high-profile TV jobs.So Armstrong fits right in. And some people love that.By then, though, Armstrong may need to ask for a paycheck.Now this is a different Armstrong. He was once so visibly angry that his eyes seemed to sear right through you at even the suggestion that he might be doping. These days, it appears that he can laugh at himself, and that\u2019s hard to believe. In one podcast, he showed one of his Tour de France trophies and said: \u201cNobody\u2019s come to pick it up yet. It\u2019s really weird.\u201dIf nothing else, Armstrong seems to be trying very hard to reconnect with the public.

Half my Twitter feed was filled with people lauding it, so I decided to sign up for Tidal, the streaming music service owned by Jay Z, to listen to the album. Right now, Tidal has an exclusive on the album, which is a smart way for Jay Z to get more people to sign up for his service, which is far less popular than Spotify or Apple Music.It made me so mad I immediately canceled my subscription. Why is the music industry so broken, man? I can\u2019t deal with it.The only reason this business works at all is because investors keep pouring billions of dollars into it, in hopes these companies will eventually make money and pay them back. So basically, we have venture capitalists to thank for our infinite supply of Justin Bieber covers.Most people think cyberattacks just target people\u2019s personal computers, but now that everything is networked, much bigger systems are vulnerable to malware, ransomware and other forms of cyberattack. Air traffic control systems? Hackable. Bridges and dams? Hackable. Nuclear power plants? Also hackable. In fact, one victim of this most recent cyberattack was the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, where the computers that monitor radiation were taken offline by the attack, forcing employees to inspect radiation levels by hand. A lot of these systems are decades old and haven\u2019t been updated or patched to guard against current threats.I guess what I\u2019m asking is, does that cave have room for two?Is this a true turning point to the industry? Is it possible women may feel more empowered now to speak out against bad actors? Or do you think things will go back to gross business as usual in Silicon Valley after this news cycle passes?But I do think something is changing in the business world broadly, and Silicon Valley is the latest expression of that shift. I\u2019m very glad that women who have been wronged are speaking out in greater numbers and that their complaints are being taken seriously.But I\u2019m cynical that these companies\u2019 responses have anything to do with an ethical awakening. It\u2019s not crazy to suspect that what is driving these firms (and bigger companies like Uber, a ride-sharing start-up you may have heard of) to purge themselves of bad actors isn\u2019t morals, but opportunism. In Uber\u2019s case, the toxic workplace culture became an issue only once it began affecting recruiting and investor sentiment. In the Caldbeck case, can you imagine a venture capital firm successfully soliciting pitches from female founders after an incident like that?I guess what I\u2019m saying is: Show me a tech company that goes public with its bad behavior totally unprompted, with no reporters asking and no damning expos\u00e9s about to hit, and I\u2019ll consider the possibility that maybe this isn\u2019t all about money.Anyway, thanks for stopping by!

Marc and I had both noticed a few news stories about nooses, notably at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and had been thinking of a way to write a broader story.At the same time, I had been following a seeming uptick in the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. Last month, I got a call from an Alabama gay rights activist I know; he sounded rattled as he told me about K.K.K. members who showed up, fully outfitted in white hoods and robes, at a gay pride parade in Florence, a small city known for tolerance. And I was aware that the K.K.K. is planning a rally in Charlottesville, Va., this weekend.Often, tips don\u2019t pan out. But this one, which was clear and detailed, pushed us into action. \u201cNoose was found in employee work area that is restricted to the general public,\u201d the tipster began. \u201cThe Mint has video footage of the incident, but will not show employees.\u201dThe email ended with a word of caution: \u201cJust know that your contacting Treasury public affairs will make them very nervous and evasive.\u201dIt was Monday, July 3 \u2014 not a good day to track down people in Washington, most of whom had taken the day off to stretch Independence Day into a four-day weekend. The tipster mentioned the Mint workers\u2019 union president, Rhonda Sapp. I reached out to the union, which seemed to be closed for the long holiday. And I called the Treasury Department; despite the tipster\u2019s caution, the spokeswoman confirmed the episode, but would say very little about it.I spent the day trying to find scholars, advocates and people who had been affected by this rash of noose incidents \u2014 Taylor Dumpson, who had been an apparent target of nooses at American University, responded to a Facebook message I sent \u2014 and then went home. I planned to write the piece Tuesday morning before 10 a.m., when I was due at our neighborhood pool to set up for the annual Fourth of July cookout.The first draft left Marc, my editor, yearning for a little more detail about what happened inside the Mint. So while I went to the pool (lugging my laptop) for cookout duty, our ace researcher Kitty Bennett managed to find a cellphone number for Ms. Sapp, the president of the workers\u2019 union. My colleague Caitlin Dickerson, on duty for the holiday, called her. She provided the vivid details \u2014 a white coin maker had marched across the factory floor carrying a rope, which he fashioned into a noose and dropped on an African-American colleague\u2019s workstation \u2014 that made the story all the more disturbing.The reporting involved in getting the story wasn\u2019t difficult, but it was deeply troubling. The most upsetting moment came during my interview with Ms. Dumpson, who is 21 and the first black woman to become president of the American University Student Government Association: Nooses with bananas dangling from them, apparently aimed at her, were strung up on her first day in office; Ms. Dumpson told me she was so busy doing interviews and responding to concerns of other students that she didn\u2019t process what happened until days later.\u201cI went into a panic mode,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a hurricane or a tornado they always tell you to get in a hallway between two walls, crouch down, turn the lights off \u2014 that was my immediate reaction. I was concerned for my safety. I closed all the blinds, closed the doors, everything was dark, and I just sat in the hallway crying.\u201dThose words were not included in my published story.

Others said they appreciated not having to pay for a friend\u2019s appetizer or lobster dinner when they ordered ice water and a salad.Here is a selection of responses that have been edited for length and clarity.\u201cI tend to go for the even split, unless someone ordered a lot of drinks. I figure it\u2019s easier for mathematical purposes and it all equals out in the end. Sometimes you might pay a little more, sometimes your friends might. The good company of friends is worth it.\u201d\u201cThis seems to be a generational and geographical gap. Speaking parochially among relatively well-off 40-ish Australians, acting like this would mark you as some kind of cheapskate space alien.\u201cI remember being similarly surprised at the \u2018down to the last penny\u2019 bill-splitting when I first got to the U.S.I\u2019m sure that there are good reasons people act this way, but the impression that I have to fight down when someone acts like this is that you\u2019re either cheap, broke or paranoid about being taken advantage of.\u201d\u201cI grew up poor. When I was college-aged going out with friends was complicated. If we all handled our own bills it was one thing, but when I\u2019m not drinking and only eating cheap food to save money, splitting the check would literally mean I\u2019m subsidizing other people and could be the difference between being able to afford to go out or not.Apps like this level the playing field and make it a lot easier for people of different incomes to socialize together with less awkwardness.\u201d\u201cYou know who is cheap? The person who orders 3 drinks, an appetizer and the lobster and then wants to split it after you had salad and an ice water.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand this \u2014 why is it wrong to get separate checks? I don\u2019t drink alcohol, I don\u2019t want to help pay for someone\u2019s $10 cocktail. If a vegetarian doesn\u2019t eat meat, don\u2019t have them pay for part of another person\u2019s $40 steak. It\u2019s not about cheapness, it\u2019s about fairness.\u201d\u201cI went to a BBQ on the Fourth of July, brought $40 worth of meat and beer etc. to contribute, and was Venmo charged by a guest the following day for splitting her large grocery bill.The Venmo charge phenomenon is ridiculous. I recently moved to San Francisco and have noticed in this city, more than anywhere I\u2019ve lived, how cheap people are. Hey, I understand your rent is high. Mine is too. But either don\u2019t throw a party or only bring what you\u2019re willing to give. It\u2019s simple.\u201d\u201cI hate how transactional a lot of my generation behaves, but it is also born out of a need and desire to be frugal and an understanding that our friends are also needing to be frugal.\u201cIn other words, we are poor. But we also want to have fun. This is my generation\u2019s way of managing both money and time in a way that isn\u2019t offensive or aggressive.\u201cMoney is not as much of a taboo subject for my generation as it has been in the past either.I don\u2019t use it, but I also don\u2019t go out much.\u201d\u201cFor our generation, this pettiness goes the other way, too. I will literally try to buy lunch, coffee, or dinner for someone, and after I\u2019ve gone home, they\u2019ve sent an unsolicited \u2018repayment\u2019 to me by Venmo.And on the other hand, it\u2019s difficult to \u2018split your case of beer\u2019 with someone \u2014 people are afraid to partake because they\u2019re worried you\u2019ll bill them afterwards and they can\u2019t afford the $3 in this month\u2019s budget.\u201d\u201cSo y\u2019all never had that one great-uncle who would write out what everyone ordered and calculate the tax and gratuity and tell everyone how much they owe later?

As has happened many times around the wine-producing world, a small group of growers and producers, dedicated to godello, revived the grape in Spain and demonstrated what could be achieved with conscientious farming and careful winemaking.For the next month, we will drink godello from Spain, where it is largely grown in the northwestern regions of Valdeorras, Ribeira Sacra, Bierzo and Monterrei.Some readers have occasionally expressed discontent with our focus on little-known wines. I would urge you to reconsider any objections. The goal of Wine School is to explore and to discover. This is not only part of the pleasure of wine, it is also a wise strategy for consumers in search of good values.Highly esteemed wines from high-status areas are almost always going to cost more. The great values tend to be in wines that have not received widespread approval in mass publications. These are the sorts of surprises and discoveries that will delight open-minded consumers.But the results are not guaranteed. Here\u2019s a chance to see for yourself.The three wines I recommend are:As is frequently the case, these wines will not be found everywhere. Don\u2019t hesitate to try other vintages of these bottles, or godellos from other producers, including Ronsel do Sil, Godelia, Avancia, Triay and Godeval.What to eat? Seafood is an obvious match, especially heartier choices like lobster, scallops, crab and halibut. But shrimp, prawns and pretty much any but the most delicate preparations will do, as well as salads, vegetables and lighter chicken dishes.As always with white wines, drink lightly chilled but not icy cold.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s also frequently found as perfectly fried calamari, served with a lemon wedge.Throughout Asia, fresh squid features in dishes of every sort. On my first trip to Thailand, I encountered air-dried squid as a favorite street-food snack. The vendor first toasts the squid over charcoal, then rolls it paper-thin with a hand-cranked machine. A large sheet of flattened squid emerges as crisp as a potato chip, ready to dip in a sweet-and-spicy sauce. In Japan, raw squid (or its cousin, cuttlefish) is a popular choice at sushi bars \u2014 beautiful white translucent slices draped over the sweet rice.In Spain, the squid is extraordinary, especially the tiny chipirones, which are fried whole. On tapas bar menus, squid is often prepared \u00e0 la plancha: sizzled on a hot griddle with garlic and parsley. And there are amazing canned specialties.Here in the United States, most fish markets have cleaned squid among their offerings, either fresh or frozen. My fishmonger always has fresh-caught, which I prefer. You can choose between tubes (bodies) or tentacles \u2014 both are delicious \u2014 but I like a mixture of both.While everyone loves crisp, deep-fried calamari, it\u2019s worth discovering other ways to cook squid. It\u2019s marvelous grilled, and, with grilling season in full swing, now is the perfect time to give it a try.It\u2019s a simple matter of coating the bodies and tentacles lightly with oil and laying them on the grill over a brisk bed of coals. If your grill rack has widely spaced bars, skewer the tentacles to keep them from falling through. The bodies can simply be turned with tongs.Depending on the size of the squid, you\u2019ll need to cook them for about four minutes per side. Any size can be prepared this way, but meaty larger pieces work best. They are done once they puff up and are firm to the touch, but leave them on the heat long enough to brown nicely, even to char a bit. Do the same with the tentacles.You can serve grilled squid as is, with a knife and fork. But let the farmer\u2019s market help decide. The other day, I found first-of-the-season Romano beans, hot chiles and cilantro, so the result was a spicy salad marrying beans and squid, perfect for sultry weather.cookingAdvertisement"}

Born to Australian parents in Canada, Ms. Waters said that she had sought legal advice after the resignation last week of Scott Ludlam, the other deputy co-leader, which sent the political world spinning. Mr. Ludlam had discovered that he held New Zealand citizenship after a legal expert contacted him about the constitutional conflict.The resignations of two of the Green Party\u2019s most popular and senior politicians was a double whammy for supporters, many of whom said they were heartbroken by the revelations.Others were exasperated by what seemed to be yet another vetting oversight that should have been caught early in the campaign process.Richard Di Natale, the leader of the Greens, said that the party had \u201ccommitted to an urgent root-and-branch review of our processes.\u201dMs. Waters said that she would continue to work with politicians to advance environmental causes.\u201cI still have unshakable hope for our common future on this planet,\u201d she said, finishing her statement on an optimistic note. \u201cOur movement is so much bigger than any one person, and we will win in the end.\u201dAnd for some supporters, who implored Ms. Waters to renounce her Canadian citizenship and run again in the next election, the door remains open for a future run.The rhetoric from a national security announcement by Australia\u2019s prime minister on Monday was nothing out of the ordinary.\u201cWe have to stay ahead of the threat of terrorism,\u201d Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull declared, as he has many times this year, during the announcement giving the country\u2019s defense force more powers to combat domestic terrorism. \u201cWe have to constantly act to improve our ability to keep Australians safe.\u201dWhat was unusual was the backdrop against which Mr. Turnbull made the remarks.\u201cOur enemies are agile and innovative,\u201d he said while surrounded by Special Operations soldiers wearing gas masks and full camouflage gear and holding machine guns at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney.Mr. Turnbull\u2019s message was somewhat lost in the chatter on social media afterward as people, including members of the opposition Labor Party, questioned whether the staging had been taken too far.\u201cI think the Australian people can well see a prop when it is presented,\u201d Mr. Marles said. \u201cThey can sniff it from a mile away, and they will judge people accordingly.\u201dGovernment unveils new national security planThe day after Mr. Turnbull announced the new measures \u201cto keep Australians safe,\u201d the federal government unveiled its new super ministry, modeled on Britain\u2019s Home Office but quite different from the United States\u2019 Department of Homeland Security.Mr. Turnbull described the move as the most significant change to Australia\u2019s national security agencies in 40 years and said it reflected the complex security environment countries now find themselves in.The new Home Affairs portfolio \u2014 a centralized office of national intelligence \u2014 will be led by the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, and include immigration, border protection, domestic security and law enforcement agencies.Mr. Turnbull said the new portfolio would enable Mr. Dutton, who is expected to be appointed minister for home affairs next year, to have responsibility for crucial agencies.\u201cWe need these reforms not because the system is broken but because our security environment is evolving quickly, it is becoming more complex, it is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. He added that the shake-up was aimed at staying ahead of a rapidly evolving threat.Meeting the prime minister might require some finagling, but one man is walking across Australia to try to do so. Clinton Pryor of Perth is walking toward Sydney on his way to Parliament in Canberra to champion rights for Indigenous Australians.Mr. Pryor, worried that government interference will lead to the defunding of services for Indigenous Australian communities, wants to ask Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to \u201cgive us a treaty and let us live our life how we always have done.\u201dThe body would allow \u201cthe First Peoples of Australia to speak to the Parliament and to the nation about the laws and policies that concern them,\u201d the panel said.Northern Territory, December South Australia, JanuarySouth Australian coast, AprilVictoria, JuneNew South Wales, July[5:05 a.m.]Sometimes you do the right thing and are punished for it.In a bashful Facebook post, Foxtel apologized to its digital customers, blaming \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d for its services going down.\u201cWe are devastated that some customers experienced technical issues tonight,\u201d said Bruce Meagher, a Foxtel spokesman.Foxtel has aggressively pursued several Federal Court cases to try to block piracy-streaming websites in Australia.

She has tried to keep her daily railroad commute to the usual four-hour round trip this summer and has largely been successful.During her train journeys, Ms. Suendermann-Warner exchanges messages over Facebook with friends and family members in Britain and Israel on the morning ride, and with others in Argentina, Uruguay and Panama at night. She also plays Candy Crush to pass the time and is on a \u201creally, really high\u201d level, she said.Christina Rendon, 47, a payroll manager who also lives on Long Island and works in New Jersey, has managed to keep her four-hour daily commute largely intact.

Weintraub, the Bucks County district attorney, had no immediate comment but scheduled a news conference for Friday morning.As Mr. DiNardo was being led by the authorities into a police van on Thursday evening, reporters asked him whether he had any sympathy for the victims\u2019 families. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Mr. Weintraub said the remains of one of the missing men, Dean Finocchiaro, 19, had been found in a 12.5-foot-deep \u201ccommon grave\u201d on the sprawling farm in Solebury, Pa., owned by Mr. DiNardo\u2019s parents. Officials have not said whether they have identified \u2014 there, or elsewhere \u2014 the remains of the other men, Mark Sturgis, 22; Thomas Meo, 21; and Jimi Taro Patrick, 19.Mr. DiNardo has had 30 \u201ccontacts\u201d with the Bensalem Police Department over the last six years, the department\u2019s director, Frederick Harran, said in a telephone interview. He declined to elaborate on what they involved but said the suspect was well known to the police.Mr. Harran said Mr. DiNardo had been sent involuntarily to a mental hospital last summer, at the request of a family member, but said he did not know the details, or how long he was held there. This week, a prosecutor described him as mentally ill and schizophrenic.On Feb. 9, police responded to a report of gunfire in Mr. DiNardo\u2019s neighborhood and found him in his car with a shotgun, and he told the officers that he had been involuntarily committed, Mr. Harran said. He was arrested on a gun charge, which was later dropped. He was legally prohibited from owning a firearm because he had been involuntarily committed.On Thursday, Mr. Beitz, 20, confirmed to The New York Times that what The Inquirer had reported was correct but said he would not say more, at the request of the police and the victims\u2019 families.Mr. Patrick and Mr. DiNardo went to the same small, private high school, Holy Ghost Preparatory in Bensalem, graduating one year apart.Mr. Meo and Mr. Sturgis were best friends who both graduated from Bensalem High School, and Mr. Sturgis\u2019s father said he had heard the young men mention Mr. Finocchiaro.The four missing men were last seen from Wednesday to Friday of last week, and the search for them has been one of the biggest law enforcement operations ever mounted in Bucks County, a fast-growing region of suburban subdivisions, farms and country estates north of Philadelphia.A clue that emerged on Saturday afternoon focused the hunt on the DiNardo farm nearly 20 miles north of Bensalem: Mr. Finocchiaro\u2019s cellphone was traced to that location.Investigators searching another property nearby, also owned by the DiNardos, found Mr. Meo\u2019s car in the garage, and Mr. Sturgis\u2019s car was found in a parking lot a few miles away. Mr. Weintraub has said that Mr. DiNardo tried to sell Mr. Meo\u2019s car for $500 to another person, who called the police.The dogs led detectives to the grave, Mr. Weintraub said. The body of Mr. Finocchiaro, who vanished around 6:30 p.m. on Friday in Middletown Township, was identified on Wednesday.On Monday, Mr. DiNardo was rearrested on the gun charge from earlier this year. Prosecutors had asked the police in June to rearrest him.Mr. DiNardo\u2019s father posted bail on Tuesday night, but prosecutors charged him the next day with stealing Mr. Meo\u2019s car, and had him arrested again. The second time, a judge set bail at $5 million, and he stayed in jail.The first of the victims to disappear, Mr. Patrick, was last seen around 6 p.m. on July 5 in Newtown Township, Pa., and did not show up for work the next day, the authorities said. According to a statement released by his family, he lived with his grandparents in Newtown, Pa., had just finished his first year at Loyola University in Baltimore, and worked at a restaurant in Buckingham, Pa.Last Friday around 6 p.m., Mr. Sturgis told his father, Mark Potash, that he was going to meet Mr. Meo. Both young men worked for Mr. Potash\u2019s construction business, but on Saturday morning, they did not report for work.Growing more concerned, Mr. Potash dialed his son\u2019s cellphone, but it went straight to his voice mail. He dialed it again and again, but it never rang.Even then, Mr. Potash said, he figured their cellphone batteries had died. Later on Saturday, Mr. Potash said, he called Mr. Meo\u2019s parents, leading to a chain of calls among friends and family members. The two young men were inseparable, and no one had heard from either of them.\u201cI was hopeful that they just had a wild night,\u201d Mr. Potash said. \u201cMy whole way to work, I thought these guys will be at work and will explain themselves.\u201dJon Hurdle reported from Doylestown, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Matthew Haag from New York.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

And yes, much is new and weird and shocking about Trump. I noted in the piece that he may be pathbreaking in retreating from even the rhetoric of promoting democracy and human rights.Now, whatever is going on in Trump\u2019s mind is somewhat beside the point here. Whether we like it or not, he\u2019s the president. He\u2019s making policy. Regardless of whether he personally cared about what he read off the teleprompter during his speech in Warsaw earlier this month, it\u2019s still an official statement that reveals, at the least, how the administration has decided to pitch its foreign policy.But in any case, whatever his personal role in it, there is a Trump administration.

{"Headline": "Partisan Conflict Is High, but the Market Doesn\u2019t Care", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe United States is so sharply divided that political consensus appears to fray almost daily. Yet two truths about politics can be demonstrated with hard numbers.The first is that partisan conflict doesn\u2019t just seem to have become more intense this year: It has actually reached new levels of nastiness.The second is that the stock market simply doesn\u2019t care. In fact, the rising acrimony has been a fine environment for stocks, though possibly detrimental to the economy itself.Nearly everything is quantified these days: how much we eat, how frequently we exercise, how much time we spend glancing at a Facebook post or reading an article. In the age of Big Data, why not measure trends in political vituperation?\u201cThe long-term trend is pretty impressive,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s safe to say that this year, partisan conflict in the United States has reached an all-time high.\u201dDespite periodic spikes around elections and specific political battles, conflict generally declined from 1891 until the early 1920s, remained fairly stable until 1965 \u2014 the year that the landmark Voting Rights Act was signed into law \u2014 and then began a long climb to its current stratospheric levels, she has found. One striking discovery is a clear \u201crally \u2019round the flag\u201d effect: Conflict ebbed in the early crisis of the Great Depression, in World War I and World War II.But contentiousness increased in the 1960s, accelerated during the Great Recession and leapt during the debt ceiling crises and health care battles of the Obama administration. It catapulted to previously unexplored levels with the election of President Trump and kept moving higher, the monthly Philadelphia Fed index shows.\u201cYou might not have expected that, with both branches of Congress and the presidency controlled by the same party,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. But the kinds of conflict measured by her indexes require three basic ingredients: disparate political preferences or views; the power to block or obstruct; and constraints, usually fiscal, that cause political eruptions. All of those are abundant now, she said.The widespread shock among many Democrats when Mr. Trump won the election in November appeared as a spike in the monthly index. \u201cI thought the index would go down after the election, but that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d she said.Instead, the index rose further after Mr. Trump issued widely contested executive orders on travel and on undocumented immigrants, she said, and the continuing emotional battles over the Affordable Care Act have intensified conflict.What\u2019s more, she said, fiscal constraints mean that even if the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress pivot toward the relatively popular goal of tax reform, the partisan conflict thermometer is likely to stay elevated.\u201cThe index picks up conflict over fiscal issues, and since the Great Recession, with debt levels so high, it\u2019s not easy to just cut taxes,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. \u201cA tax cut, even a simple one, raises questions about expenditures. What spending are you going to cut? Medicaid? Not without a lot of conflict.\u201dYou don\u2019t need a fancy index to know that people are angry and divided. But converting the shouting into numbers makes it possible to conduct comparative quantitative analysis. What scholars have found are negative correlations between partisan conflict and a variety of economic factors.And Professor Azzimonti has found negative correlations between conflict and foreign direct investment. \u201cIt makes sense that foreigners will be reluctant to invest in the United States when they don\u2019t know what Congress or the president are going to do, or what specific policies are going to be enacted,\u201d she said.Her econometric models suggest that increased conflict is associated with slower economic growth, perhaps because partisan conflict leads economic decision makers to defer productive risk-taking. But she can\u2019t prove cause and effect. \u201cCorrelations, yes, we see them, but causation is difficult to pin down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that others will pursue that.\u201dOne thing is clear, though: The stock market has gone on one of the greatest bull runs in history despite rising levels of partisan conflict. Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist with Ned Davis Research Group, and Alex Sun, a market analyst with that firm, pointed out in a recent note to clients that stocks tend to rise more rapidly when the Partisan Conflict Index soars. The title of their note was: \u201cStock Market to Politicians: Keep Arguing.\u201dProfessor Azzimonti says she can\u2019t explain it. \u201cWe economists don\u2019t really understand the stock market,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t. I\u2019m the worst trader in the world.\u201dEven in the era of Big Data, some mysteries have not been unraveled with numbers. Right now, the sublime indifference of the stock market is one of them.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

A group of teenagers laughed and watched as a man struggled in the water of a pond. The man drowned, and his body was not found for days.The five teenagers did nothing to help him, not even call 911, but after examining the video, the authorities said this week that they did not break the law.\u201cIn the state of Florida, there is no law in place that requires a person to render aid or call to render aid to a victim in distress,\u201d Yvonne Martinez, a spokeswoman for the Cocoa Police Department, said on Friday.The man, Jamel Dunn, 31, drowned July 9, and his body was found five days later when the police received a report that it was floating near the edge of the pond in a park in Cocoa, a town with 18,000 people near Orlando.As detectives investigated the death over the weekend, a family member of Mr. Dunn\u2019s alerted them to the video, which the teenagers had begun sharing with friends.The police asked the office of Phil Archer, the state attorney for Brevard and Seminole Counties, to review the footage. But the prosecutor\u2019s office said it did not contain the evidence needed for a criminal prosecution.In the statement, the prosecutor\u2019s office said it was nonetheless \u201cdeeply saddened and shocked\u201d by how Mr. Dunn died and the failure of the teenagers to help him in any way.One of the them, using an expletive, calls Mr. Dunn a junkie.

You shouldn\u2019t have got in there,\u201d he says.About a minute into the video, the man appears to let out a whimper before submerging, fully, underwater. \u201cHe just died!\u201d a voice can be heard saying, as the others begin to laugh.Later, one of the teenagers appears to suggest that they call the police, only to be rejected by another.The police identified and met with all five, who ranged in age from 14 to 18, Ms. Martinez said. None appeared to show much emotion. \u201cWhat I saw was not remorseful,\u201d she said.A Facebook user named Simone Scott, who identified herself online as Mr. Dunn\u2019s sister, expressed frustration with the investigation and said that \u201csomething should be done\u201d in a video live-streamed on the social network on Thursday. A funeral service will be held a week from Saturday, Ms. Scott said on Facebook. She did not respond to a request for an interview.\u201cIf they can sit there and watch somebody die in front of their eyes, imagine what they\u2019re going to do when they get older?\u201d she said about the teenagers.She expressed frustration with the investigation and said she wondered how Mr. Dunn, who she said was disabled and walked with a cane, ended up in the middle of the pond.Surveillance footage obtained Thursday from a neighbor showed that Mr. Dunn entered the pond on his own and did not appear to be coerced or forced to go in, Ms. Martinez said.Although the teenagers cannot be charged for failing to help Mr. Dunn, town officials said later Friday that they would ask the prosecutor to consider charges under the law requiring that a death be reported.\u201cWhile this in no way will bring justice for what occurred, it is a start,\u201d Henry Parrish III, the mayor of Cocoa, said in a statement. \u201cI know that everyone working on this investigation has been tireless in their efforts to find answers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charlie Gard Dies, Leaving a Legacy of Thorny Ethics Questions", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Charlie Gard, the incurably ill British infant who died on Friday, could not hear, see or even cry. But his case captured the attention of the pope and the United States president, and raised difficult ethical issues that reverberated around the world.In an emotional statement before the court this week, Charlie\u2019s mother, Connie Yates, noted that her son had \u201chad a greater impact on and touched more people in this world in his 11 months than many people do in a lifetime.\u201dThe infant had a rare and debilitating genetic condition known as mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Charlie, who would have turned a year old on Aug. 4, was not able to peer at his parents\u2019 faces. He also could not swallow.The child\u2019s final moments were not as his parents had hoped. They fought a long and often tense battle in court to control his fate, to take him to the United States for experimental treatment and, finally, to move him to their home in West London to die.They lost their fight. On Thursday, Ms. Yates, who works as a caregiver, said in statement that the hospital had \u201cdenied us our final wish.\u201d\u201cMost people won\u2019t ever have to go through what we have been through,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no control over our son\u2019s life and no control over our son\u2019s death.\u201dBut the doctors treating Charlie at Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London countered that the \u201crisk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie\u2019s life\u201d at home was \u201cunthinkable.\u201d For months, the hospital had argued that he had irreversible brain damage, that the life support should be removed and that he should be allowed the right to die with dignity.\u201cWe deeply regret that profound and heartfelt differences between Charlie\u2019s doctors and his parents have played out in court over such a protracted period,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. \u201cWe will never do anything that could cause our patients unnecessary and prolonged suffering.\u201dThe case laid bare several issues, among them: Should parents or doctors or the courts have the final say in irreconcilable disputes over the treatment of sick children? And at what point should the limits of medicine be recognized and the parents of an infant be compelled to let go?Biomedical ethicists said the case offered a cautionary tale of how a legal battle, scrutiny by the global news media and intractable differences between parents and doctors can spiral out of control in the social media age. Both the hospital and the parents in the Gard case dug in, their arguments playing out on Facebook and Twitter and capturing the attention of world figures including President Trump and Pope Francis.He added: \u201cThey were the victims, not the cause, of this tragic situation.\u201dThe parents\u2019 raw emotions played out in the courtroom, where Ms. Yates broke down in tears of frustration, at one point shouting, \u201cWhat if it was your child?\u201d before fleeing the room. At another moment, Mr. Gard, a mailroom worker, cried out, \u201cEvil\u201d after a hospital lawyer spoke.On several occasions, both parents stormed out of the courtroom. Some of the lawyers and journalists covering the case were reduced to tears.In most cases, medical experts say, doctors decide when to remove life support from an incurably ill child, in consultation with parents, and these cases rarely wind up in court. But in Britain, the courts are the final arbiter when irreconcilable disputes arise.The case also spurred questions about the wisdom of offering parents the hope of experimental treatment when faced with an incurable disease. That debate took center stage after Dr. Michio Hirano, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, offered Charlie\u2019s parents a ray of hope that an experimental treatment known as nucleoside therapy could improve Charlie\u2019s condition.The treatment had been tested on mice and on 18 people with a mutation in a gene known as TK2. But it had never been tried on someone with Charlie\u2019s particularly debilitating form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, which is caused by a different genetic mutation.During an often-acrimonious and emotional High Court hearing this month, Charlie\u2019s parents argued that he should be allowed to receive the experimental treatment. But lawyers for Great Ormond Street Hospital countered that Dr. Hirano had held out hope without even examining the child or reviewing his full medical charts.(Dr. Hirano said in a statement he had been contacted by the parents and agreed to speak with Charlie\u2019s doctors to determine whether the experimental therapy he was developing could help improve the child\u2019s condition).When Dr. Hirano traveled to London this month to examine Charlie, about six months after he had first been invited, a series of scans showed that the boy had suffered muscular atrophy, that the damage was irreversible and that treatment would be futile.Ms. Yates criticized the hospital, saying it had dragged its feet about the treatment until it was too late.The hospital consistently stood by its contention that treatment would have been useless and that Charlie had irreversible brain damage.\u201cIf Charlie has had a relationship with the world around him since his best interests were determined, it has been one of suffering,\u201d it said in a statement.\u201cTo let a child go is incredibly difficult, but it is also incredibly important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is heartbreaking, but we have to know when to say enough is enough.\u201dDr. Truog of Harvard Medical School said the parents\u2019 legal battle had tapped into the health care debate in the United States, and was being seized upon by some to affirm a money-driven system in which patients who have the means can pursue experimental treatments, even if the chances of success are slim. But he said experimental treatments must be weighed against the benefits for society as a whole.\u201cIt would be extremely rare for a hospital in the United States to admit patients for the exclusive purpose of receiving homeopathic therapy or unproven stem cell infusions,\u201d he wrote, \u201cregardless of how much the patient paid.\u201dThe parents now face coming to terms with Charlie\u2019s death. Addressing the court this past week, Ms. Yates acknowledged that this would not be easy.\u201cWe are struggling to find any comfort or peace with all this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one thing that does give us the slightest bit of comfort is that we truly believe that Charlie may have been too special for this cruel world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Digital Artists, Anxious About ... Technology", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet the Sotheby\u2019s S2 gallery in New York, normally used for exhibitions of contemporary art, is currently the site of a show featuring mostly young artists who rely on digital technology and who are not exactly household names. Surprisingly, most of the works on view take physical form. More significant, they also betray a broad generational anxiety about the technological future and the role of humans in it.A sleek, black plinth with a black screen in front and a record player perched incongruously on top, it was designed as a prototype for a 21st-century memorial. When David Goodman, the Sotheby\u2019s executive in charge of marketing and digital development, saw it a couple of months ago, its screen was displaying the social media posts of a 25-year-old Miami bicycle enthusiast who had been killed in a roadside hit-and-run. A vinyl record played synthesized chimes, their tone determined by a computer analysis of the emotions those posts expressed \u2014 a major key if they were positive ones, a minor key if negative.\u201cI was pretty blown away by the piece,\u201d Mr. Goodman recalled recently in his office at Sotheby\u2019s headquarters in New York. \u201cIt also made me sad. I can\u2019t \u2014\u2014\u201cLet me put it this way: It struck an emotional chord.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the idea of looking at oneself through the technology of the day,\u201d Mr. Bailey said by phone. An adjacent self-portrait shows him in the guise of the persona he has adopted \u2014 that of an obnoxiously ebullient na\u00eff who proclaims himself a famous new media artist. \u201cHe believes deeply that technology can help, and yet technology consistently lets him down,\u201d Mr. Bailey said of his alter ego. \u201cSo damn it, why doesn\u2019t it deliver?\u201dMs. Zelinskie\u2019s human-digital mash-ups are about \u201chow we\u2019re becoming one with our technology,\u201d she explained in her studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn \u2014 a small, crowded loft with NASA fliers and \u201cStar Trek\u201d posters taped to the walls. In theory, the computer code on the cube\u2019s surface means the cube could be \u201cread\u201d by a computer \u2014 which is why she sometimes says she\u2019s making art for robots as well as humans.In fact, like the label on a can of pet food, the code on Ms. Zelinskie\u2019s sculptures is meant for humans. Aliens, too, perhaps. \u201cI like taking ideas that have been reiterated again and again\u201d \u2014 the human face, geometric forms \u2014 \u201cand putting them in a time capsule made of math,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, this is preserving human culture.\u201d\u201cThat archetypal looking into someone\u2019s eyes \u2014 it\u2019s a very powerful moment,\u201d Mr. Zigelbaum said.But in this case, the other person is disembodied, and the moment you share is mediated by technology \u2014 by video cameras, by digital networks, by Amazon\u2019s \u201cmicrotasking\u201d platform. \u201cYou\u2019re looking into someone\u2019s eye, but you don\u2019t know if they can see you or who they are,\u201d Mr. Zigelbaum said. The technology that makes the Mechanical Turk workers visible also renders them intangible. Communication is enhanced and impeded at the same time.What\u2019s not on view at Sotheby\u2019s is anything by Mr. Barcia-Colombo himself. After seeing his \u201cMonument I,\u201d Mr. Goodman asked if he wanted to bring the Hereafter Institute to Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cAnd I said great,\u201d Mr. Barcia-Colombo recalled, \u201cbut it\u2019s a complicated show, and it\u2019s about death, so your clientele might not like it.\u201d With the show he did mount, he added: \u201cSome people are like, reserve that piece \u2014 I want it! And others are like, this is Sotheby\u2019s?\u201dMr. Barcia-Colombo\u2019s Lacma installation was indeed complicated. For two days last August, museumgoers were offered a free consultation on their digital afterlife. To ensure a fully customized experience, they were asked to sign up in advance and to share access to their Facebook profiles.When they showed up at the museum, they were greeted by actors in white lab coats and given a 3-D body scan that was used to generate a life-size digital avatar. They were shown a memorial virtual-reality film such as the one Mr. Barcia-Colombo made about his grandfather, a Spanish poet who fought against Franco and ended his days an emeritus professor of Spanish literature in Los Angeles.Then they got to attend their own funeral, complete with a eulogy based on their social media posts. As the eulogy concluded, their avatar appeared onscreen, only to turn and walk off into the clouds.As this suggests, Mr. Barcia-Colombo is actually less concerned with death than with memories of life \u2014 with what happens to people\u2019s Facebook pages when they\u2019re gone, for instance. It\u2019s a common concern \u2014 so much so that two years ago Facebook started allowing its users to appoint a \u201clegacy contact\u201d to manage their profiles after they die. But is that enough?\u201cI wanted to design a digital urn \u2014 some kind of object, some kind of memory machine you could step into,\u201d he said at N.Y.U., where he teaches animation and video sculpture. \u201cWhat if Facebook goes down?\u201dAn unlikely prospect at this point \u2014 but were it to ever happen, he pointed out, \u201cthere would be no record\u201d of the many billions of lives and trillions of \u201clikes\u201d that have been so casually, trustingly, innocently recorded on it. \u201cThe whole point is to make that data physical,\u201d he said, \u201cso that a record exists of that person\u2019s life.\u201dGravestone makers and turntable manufacturers, please take note.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Plan a Trip With the New TripAdvisor", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTest RunNot that the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s largest travel site\u201d is hurting for attention, with 390 million average unique monthly visitors and over 500 million reviews for hotels, restaurants and other travel destinations. But standing pat is never an option in the highly competitive travel booking industry.But does new really mean a better experience for prospective travelers?I used the new TripAdvisor to help plan a recent trip to North Adams, Mass., and for the most part, the change was good.On TripAdvisor\u2019s new desktop home page, a cleaner design and simpler layout are instantly noticeable, and once you start searching for travel accommodations, you\u2019ll encounter a new \u201cBest Value\u201d filter, which is a ranking using TripAdvisor-specific data such as its user ratings, prices, popularity, location and your personal user preferences. You can also still sort results based on user reviews, cost and distance alone.Restaurants are now filterable by \u201cCheap Eats,\u201d \u201cFine Dining,\u201d \u201cMid-Range\u201d and a host of other categories. One could quickly find a vegetarian-friendly, family-friendly restaurant that has free Wi-Fi with just a few clicks. You can then reserve that table (if it allows online reservations) without leaving the website, thanks to integration with the restaurant booking service OpenTable.The search experience is replicated on the app, which also offers a host of cool features not found on the desktop version or on many other travel apps (though it would be nice if they were available on both desktop and mobile).One such feature is \u201cMy Trips.\u201d By creating a trip, which requires only a name and the dates, I was able to bookmark places of interest and schedule them on a trip-specific calendar. You can easily share your trip via email or SMS with your traveling partner(s) so they can see what you\u2019re interested in and add their own preferences. This may not seem as necessary for couples, but in a large group, the feature would be a great way to keep everyone on track.Once I was in North Adams, I mainly stuck with the app version of TripAdvisor and appreciated that all of my bookmarked attractions and restaurants were easily accessible and placed on a map within the app. For directions between locations, TripAdvisor used Apple Maps on my iPhone, which is not my preferred maps app, but it was better than nothing.The app\u2019s standout feature, depending on how paranoid you are, is the \u201cTravel Timeline\u201d option, which will allow you to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at places along your trip (similar to features on Swarm and Facebook), but tracks your journey in timeline form. As with most apps that track location, you must give the app permission to do so, and the app promises the timeline is only visible to you (though you can share portions of it with friends via SMS or email).The travel timeline will ask you if you\u2019re at a restaurant or attraction; it will never assume you\u2019re anywhere unless you confirm. If you forget to check your app while at a location, it will give you an opportunity to go back and plot previous stops. Should you be taking photos along the way, it will automatically package those near the times and places on your timeline.While my wife was a bit spooked by the timeline tracking our every move, I liked that it was creating a record of where we were. If you\u2019re like me and tend to forget the name of that one restaurant while you\u2019re attempting to recommend it to a friend, you\u2019ll appreciate the timeline.You can also give your mother one less reason to check your Facebook page by easily, and privately, sharing parts of your timeline via SMS or email, photos included.As promising as I found many of these features, some things could be a bit more intuitive. I drove myself slightly crazy trying to turn off the timeline once my trip was over (waiting for the train on the Monday back to work is not a memory I want to retain). The on/off toggle on the timeline page goes away after you turn it on. To turn it off, you have to go to the app\u2019s settings.And while the ability to download city guides is great in theory \u2014 giving you access to information and maps offline when you lose cellular service or just want to save on data \u2014 I spent several minutes poking around trying to download the North Adams guide, but realized there isn\u2019t one for every city. But it would be nice to be able to download maps regardless of whether there is a city guide.If you\u2019re able to download one of the over 300 city guides that are available, you will have convenient access to them in an appropriately labeled tab within the app.The average user of the new TripAdvisor should be impressed with its intuitive layout and improved search capability, and the app has enough promising functionality that already distinguishes it from other travel-booking apps like Expedia\u2019s and Kayak\u2019s. TripAdvisor says new features like better mapping technology are coming soon, which should only strengthen its case for being a premier all-in-one online travel planner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Rohingya Refugee Camp, Soccer Is a Joyful Escape", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCox\u2019s Bazar JournalCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Mohammed Ismail prickled with adrenaline.With one defender between him and the goal, he surged from the left wing, dodging pockmarks in the yellow-dirt soccer field. He stroked the ball with the outer edge of the shoes his father had bought him and, quick as a whip, unleashed a shot that left the goalkeeper gaping.Mr. Ismail, 24, is a second-generation Rohingya refugee, born in this ramshackle camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar on the southern tip of Bangladesh after his parents fled violence in their native Myanmar. And this was his moment, a joyful escape from painful realities.\u201cWhen I play football the sadness and anger is far away,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut after I finish, it always comes back.\u201dThe soccer field lies on an elevated plain with a sweeping view of the Kutupalong refugee camp: mud-walled hovels and split bamboo structures laced with open sewers. Cockerels and car horns sound from the nearby road.The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group, are not recognized as citizens in their native Myanmar even though they have lived there for hundreds of years. They have endured periodic persecution at the hands of the Myanmar armed forces and the majority Buddhist population, who mostly see them as illegal immigrants who should go home to Bangladesh.Mr. Ismail\u2019s family arrived in 1992 with the first wave of Rohingya refugees, when about 250,000 Rohingya fled abuse at the hands of the Myanmar military. About 33,000 of them remain, living in official United Nations refugee camps in Kutupalong and Nayapara, south of Cox\u2019s Bazar along the Myanmar border.The Bangladeshi government has denied the refugees education and work permits \u201cbecause we want them to return\u201d to Myanmar, said Najnin Sarwar Kaberi, a local official for the governing party, the Bangladesh Awami League. \u201cIf they settle here the size of our population will become unbearable.\u201dSoccer is a prized diversion, helping players and spectators forget about their exile, at least for a few hours.Mohammed Farouque, a refugee who runs a Rohingya soccer club in Malaysia, another destination for the refugees, said that soccer was virtually prohibited to the Rohingya in Myanmar. Most cannot afford the bribe of about $4 required to leave their village, making competitions impossible.In Malaysia and Bangladesh, most Rohingya are stateless, but at least they can hold soccer competitions. \u201cThis is one of the few freedoms we have,\u201d Mr. Farouque said.In Bangladesh, 16 teams \u2014 eight from the unofficial camp and eight from the official camp \u2014 play in an annual World Cup-style competition.Mr. Ismail said that the unofficial camp teams would be stronger this year now that they had more players to choose from but there was a pervasive feeling that the registered refugees were better equipped.The registered teams have been around long enough to collect periodic handouts of athletic equipment from the United Nations or have been able to earn enough money to buy their own. Unregistered players often wear flip-flops or play in bare feet.\u201cIsmail\u2019s team beat us last time because they had boots and we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Ziabur Rohaman, 32, who fled Myanmar with his wife and three children in October and plays for the unregistered camp in Kutupalong. \u201cThey got them from the U.N.H.C.R. but because we arrived recently most of our players didn\u2019t have boots.\u201dThe U.N.H.C.R. says that it provides \u201climited support regardless of whether the refugees are registered or not.\u201d Vivian Tan, the agency\u2019s regional press officer, said the agency had provided balls, trophies, track pants and refreshments.However, the agency is authorized by the Bangladeshi government to provide formal assistance only to registered refugees. That assistance, which includes shelter, cash for food, relief supplies, water, sanitation facilities, basic health care and education up to seventh grade, is prohibited for the unregistered refugees.The winner of the Kutupalong competition plays a team from the Nayapara camp, 50 miles away, to claim the title of best Rohingya team in Bangladesh.Last year, Kutupalong beat Nayapara, 3-0, a proud moment for Mr. Ismail.\u201cI scored one of the goals, and my teammates voted me man of the match,\u201d he said, sitting in a rough wooden tea shop surrounded by admiring teenagers.Like most people at the camp, he has had his share of tragedy and hardship. Last fall, his uncle was killed by the Myanmar Army, he said, forcing his aunt and several cousins to join his family in Bangladesh.Last December, he tried to smuggle himself to Malaysia, where, through family connections, he might have been able to attend a university.But the smuggler who promised to help him escape stole his money, about $3,700, and disappeared. The payment \u201cwas all my savings plus money I borrowed and money my mother gave me after selling her jewelry,\u201d Mr. Ismail said.At the tea shop that afternoon, you wouldn\u2019t think he had any cares. He is one of those people whose face defaults to a smile. But his smile is not always joyful: Half the time it\u2019s a working smile, doing the job of holding it all together.The assembled guys all said their favorite player was Lionel Messi, the Argentine forward, considered by some to be the best player in the world. \u201cI love how he cuts through the defense,\u201d said Mr. Ismail, who is also a forward. \u201cHe\u2019s lethal.\u201dMr. Ismail will most likely never see a pro game in person, but a big excursion for him is playing with the Cox\u2019s Bazar team in the official Bangladesh league. Rohingya teams are not allowed to play in the official league, but their best players, including Mr. Ismail, are sometimes recruited.\u201cWe don\u2019t tell their opponents that I\u2019m Rohingya because they might not agree that I\u2019m eligible to play,\u201d he said.When he kicked the goal later that day, the ball shot through the rusting posts and bounced off the roofs below. Ismail looped back to his team. They clapped his back and laughed.Already several youngsters were in pursuit of the ball, stumbling in the twilight, eager to be the one to return it. The official refugees beat the team from the unofficial camp, 2-0.After the match, he asked me to put my Facebook details into his phone so he could stay in touch.

Then, one night in June, he was summoned to a palace in Mecca, held against his will and pressured for hours to give up his claim to the throne.By dawn, he had given in, and Saudi Arabia woke to the news that it had a new crown prince: the king\u2019s 31-year-old son, Mohammed bin Salman.To strengthen support for the sudden change in the line of succession, some senior princes were told that Mohammed bin Nayef was unfit to be king because of a drug problem, according to an associate of the royal family.The decision to oust Mohammed bin Nayef and some of his closest colleagues has spread concern among counterterrorism officials in the United States who saw their most trusted Saudi contacts disappear and have struggled to build new relationships.And the collection of so much power by one young royal, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has unsettled a royal family long guided by consensus and deference to elders.\u201cYou may have now such a concentration of power within one branch and within one individual who is also younger than so many of the cousins and sons of former kings that it may begin to create a situation where the family is out of whack,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, who studies Persian Gulf politics.In response to questions from The Times, a written statement by a senior Saudi official denied that Mohammed bin Nayef had been pressured and said that the Allegiance Council, a body of senior princes, had approved the change in \u201cthe best interest of the nation.\u201dThe rivalry between the princes began in 2015, when King Salman ascended the throne and bestowed tremendous power on his favorite son.Mohammed bin Salman was named deputy crown prince, or second in line to become king, as well as defense minister; put in charge of a powerful economic council; and given oversight of the state oil monopoly, Saudi Aramco.The prince has risen at the expense of his elder relatives, including Mohammed bin Nayef, 57. As the head of the Saudi Interior Ministry, Mohammed bin Nayef led the dismantling of Al Qaeda in the kingdom after a deadly bombing campaign a decade ago. While he kept a low public profile, even after becoming crown prince in 2015, his work won him allies in the United States and other Western and Arab nations.But while his removal struck many as sudden, it had been planned out.On the night of June 20, a group of senior princes and security officials gathered at the Safa Palace in Mecca after being informed that King Salman wanted to see them, according to United States officials and associates of the royal family.It was near the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, when Saudis were preoccupied with religious duties and many royals had gathered in Mecca before traveling abroad for the Eid al-Fitr holiday. That made it advantageous for a change, analysts said, like a coup on Christmas Eve.Before midnight, Mohammed bin Nayef was told he was going to meet the king and was led into another room, where royal court officials took away his phones and pressured him to give up his posts as crown prince and interior minister, according to United States officials and an associate of the royal family.At first, he refused. But as the night wore on, the prince, a diabetic who suffers from the effects of a 2009 assassination attempt by a suicide bomber, grew tired.Meanwhile, royal court officials called members of the Allegiance Council, a body of princes who are supposed to approve changes to the line of succession. Some were told that Mohammed bin Nayef had a drug problem and was unfit to be king, according to an associate of the royal family.For years, close friends of Mohammed bin Nayef had expressed concern about his health, noting that since the assassination attempt, he had experienced lingering pain and shown signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. His condition led him to take medication that some friends worried he had become addicted to.\u201cThe weight of the evidence I have seen is that he was more injured in the assassination attempt than was admitted and that he then got onto a pain killer routine that was very addictive,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer and director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI think that problem got progressively worse.\u201dOne American official and one adviser to a Saudi royal said Mohammed bin Nayef opposed the embargo on Qatar, a stand that probably accelerated his ouster.\u201cGood luck, God willing,\u201d the older prince replies.Mohammed bin Nayef then returned to his palace in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, and he was barred from leaving it.Also confined to his home was Gen. Abdulaziz al-Huwairini, a colleague of Mohammed bin Nayef who was crucial to the security relationship with the United States, according to current and former United States officials.Days later, C.I.A. officials briefed the White House on their concern that the ouster of Mohammed bin Nayef and the possible removal of General Huwairini and other security officers could hamper intelligence sharing, United States officials said.The senior Saudi official\u2019s statement said General Huwairini was still in his job and had pledged allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman along with senior officers.Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as interior minister by his 33-year-old nephew, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef, who was an adviser to his uncle and who is believed to be close to Mohammed bin Salman.The extent of support for the elevation of Mohammed bin Salman in the family remains unclear. Saudi state news media reported that 31 of the 34 members of the Allegiance Council supported the change, but analysts said many royals are hesitant to vote against the king\u2019s wishes.Some United States officials and well-connected Saudis say there are rumblings of discontent, and analysts have pointed out hints.Neither King Salman nor his son attended the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, even though one of the two men had attended each of the last three meetings. Analysts say that family disputes may have kept the men at home or that they did not want to face criticism for the isolation they and three other Arab states imposed on Qatar.The senior Saudi official said King Salman and his predecessor, King Abdullah, had skipped previous Group of 20 meetings.Saudis shocked by the changes say they have a lot to lose if splits within the family spill into the open and destabilize the kingdom.\u201cIt\u2019s not like people are going to go out on the street and say, \u2018We want M.B.N.,\u2019 \u201d said one associate of the royal family, using Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s initials. \u201cWe want this family. We want to preserve them as best we can.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about infighting among members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia misstated the relationship between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. Mohammed bin Salman is Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s cousin, not his nephew.Ben Hubbard reported from Amman, and Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

Within a month, she has entered into full-blown psychosis, insisting that she\u2019s talking to the Devil, who\u2019s sending her apocalyptic messages. Lukach and his father-in-law have no choice but to pick Giulia up and physically force her into the car to take her to the hospital. When she refuses to enter on her own, Lukach threatens to call the police. After six hours in the emergency room, Giulia is sent home with new medication, but a few days later she\u2019s back in the E.R. and this time admitted to a psychiatric unit in another part of the city. It will be the first of three such hospitalizations over five years, one of which comes shortly after the birth of the couple\u2019s son.At home, Lukach is Giulia\u2019s primary caregiver, one whose heroic rise to the occasion does not preclude moments of frustration and even rage. When the psychosis tapers off, depression takes its place and Lukach not only has to hide Giulia\u2019s medication so that she doesn\u2019t overdose in an attempt to kill herself but also inspect her mouth to make sure she\u2019s swallowed what she\u2019s supposed to. You can hardly blame her for resisting. The medication causes her to gain 60 pounds in two months and makes her sluggish almost to the point of immobility. When lithium is added to the mix in an effort to quell the depression, it leaves her, Lukach writes, \u201cin the most stilted and zombified state yet, her arms frozen stiff at her sides, her fingers spread apart, her lips pursed, drool sometimes lingering at the corners of her mouth.\u201dThis a harsh image for any memoirist to render, let alone a husband writing about his wife. But Lukach\u2019s rare combination of tenderness and ruthlessness is what makes this book more interesting than your typical illness narrative. His love for Giulia is apparent on every page, but he also hates her in moments and is willing to show us why. When depression finally lifts and Giulia is \u201cbetter,\u201d she\u2019s so busy enjoying life again that she can\u2019t be bothered to do anything around the house, nor does she show much appreciation for everything Lukach did for her. You want to shake some gratitude into her, but you also want Lukach to stop coasting on martyr fumes. Fortunately, he\u2019s an honest enough writer to quote the therapist who invites a shift in thinking: \u201cSacrifice is a part of love, Mark. But might there not be more to love than just how much you sacrifice?\u201dOrganized into alternating chapters entitled \u201cBefore\u201d and \u201cAfter,\u201d the memoir is a study in \u201cgaslighting\u201d \u2014 making someone feel that she is crazy or only imagining things. Just three weeks after the birth of the couple\u2019s daughter, Waite stumbles on clues that Marco is involved with another woman. The evidence, much of it in the form of telltale emails, Facebook messages and GPS data, is too glaring to deny, though Marco denies it anyway with methods that range from suggesting his wife has postpartum paranoia to attempting suicide (or pretending to; it\u2019s not quite clear) amid an apparent psychotic breakdown. Along the way, Waite doubts herself \u2014 \u201cmaybe because he\u2019s so overtired and overworked he\u2019s making really bad decisions and doesn\u2019t realize how inappropriate his behavior is\u201d \u2014 until she can no longer ignore the facts: She married a man who may well be a sociopath.Waite has a knack for showing the ways that cognitive dissonance can chart pathways in the mind that cause emotional confusion to obscure rational thought. But once we grasp the scope of Marco\u2019s deceptions, \u201cA Beautiful, Terrible Thing\u201d starts to sound in places like a friend who\u2019s been complaining about her bad relationship for years but does nothing about it. This is due mostly to excessive rehashing on the page, since once Waite makes up her mind to leave Marco she is nothing if not proactive in her efforts to make a life for herself and her daughter on their own. By the end, she has decided to pursue a degree to become a therapist specializing in women recovering from sociopathic relationships. Maybe that\u2019s why the book works best when Waite is sharing what she learns about destructive personality disorders and what makes certain people vulnerable to those that have them. After all, there\u2019s only so much you can hear about a 22-year-old\u2019s Instagram posts or the contents of a cheating spouse\u2019s email.The crystal ball question took me back to Lukach, whose book may be finished but whose uncertain life with Giulia continues. Would the couple have wanted to know their fate from the beginning? If they\u2019d known, would they have married anyway?\u201cWith one word, I had lost my wife and gained a lifelong patient,\u201d Lukach writes of hearing the word \u201cschizophrenia\u201d applied to her for the first time. It sounds ominous, but aren\u2019t all life partners also lifelong patients in a sense? The work of a long-term committed relationship is essentially the work of keeping someone alive in the ways necessary to ensure that you\u2019re kept alive in return. That\u2019s a pretty heavy lift \u2014 and no two couples carry quite the same load \u2014 but it\u2019s still nice work if you can get it.

Any offense is subject to prosecution or possible deportation.\u201dThe posters found at the two universities included logos from the National Union of Students, the Chinese Student and Scholars Association at the University of Melbourne, and the Monash Chinese Student Association.The posters were quickly removed, and organizations at both universities whose logos were used issued a joint statement confirming they did not produce the posters.\u201cOur society has been maliciously slandered by these notices put up around the university campus and it has created a harmful and poisonous atmosphere for all students,\u201d the statement said.Both universities said that they had contacted the police and were starting investigations using closed-circuit television footage to try to determine who put up the posters.\u201cWe are committed to maintaining and strengthening a vibrant, inclusive and respectful campus community in which diversity is recognized, valued and celebrated,\u201d the University of Melbourne said in a statement.

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The Defiant Ones,\u2019 a Revealing Portrait of Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney is nice, fame is dizzying, and professional accolades can be rewarding. But the truest measurement of a life lived well \u2014 or at least strategically \u2014 may be the quality of the biographer you can persuade, or hire, to tell your story.In the case of Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the story is a doozy. Mr. Iovine began as a recording engineer and producer for Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks and others, then became the defining music executive of the 1990s and 2000s via his perch at Interscope Records. Dr. Dre essentially built gangster rap from the ground up, from his days in N.W.A through his solo career, and was crucial to introducing Snoop Dogg, Eminem and 50 Cent to the world. Also, the two men make headphones.\u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d a glossy, rapidly-paced, ambitious and often fun four-part biographical documentary that begins Sunday on HBO, contains a sufficient amount of awe at their history \u2014 which embodies the tremendous potential of American popular music and culture \u2014 but not an overwhelming, suffocating, corporate-endorsement amount. Instead, the mood is intimate, trusting, a little slick, making what could have been hagiography something more invigorating and frank.The director Allen Hughes (\u201cMenace II Society,\u201d \u201cAmerican Pimp\u201d), who worked on this project with the documentarian Doug Pray, balances reverence with wryness, and has a keen ability to tweak his subjects just gently enough to recalibrate carefully sandpapered narratives.This is clear from the beginning of this docu-series, which opens with the 2014 sale of Beats, a headphone and music streaming company founded by Dr. Dre and Mr. Iovine, to Apple, but told through a misstep \u2014 a notorious Facebook video. In the video, Dr. Dre, partying with the singer and actor Tyrese, among others, calls himself the \u201cfirst billionaire in hip-hop,\u201d in effect leaking the news.The deal still goes through \u2014 everyone gets very rich \u2014 but Mr. Hughes uses this moment to foreground some internal trauma in Dr. Dre that will recur throughout the series.Mr. Hughes and his team of exquisite editors are full of tricks like this, tiny gestures that add complexity and intrigue: Dr. Dre playing a favorite Kraftwerk song while relaxing in Musha Cay, in the Bahamas, which then becomes the backdrop to a historical segment about the history of Compton; the story about the naming of N.W.A cutting to a scene of Dr. Dre and Mr. Iovine in a luxury S.U.V., fine-tuning the speakers to their taste; Tom Petty, explaining in his languorous slur of a voice how manic Mr. Iovine was when they worked together, overlaid on top of silent footage of Mr. Iovine speaking and making extreme facial gestures.\u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d feels impressively lush and well-resourced \u2014 superstars like Mr. Springsteen and Eminem show up and tell long stories. Filming has been taking place for the project for at least the past three years. And there is judicious use of vivid period footage: Dr. Dre in purple satin scrubs as part of the World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru, and then later teaching Eazy-E to rap line by line for his debut album; Mr. Iovine talking music with Bono and the Edge of U2 at a Long Island beach house in the 1980s; a photo of a Sunday football gathering at Mr. Iovine\u2019s house in the 1990s that includes Suge Knight and John F. Kennedy Jr.Mr. Hughes injects little moments of skepticism via quick-hit interstitials \u2014 a shivering bowl of soup on a turbulent private jet, a hot tub fallen into filthy disuse. And he complicates the narrative, slightly, by sprinkling antagonists throughout \u2014 mostly rival music executives though not Mr. Knight, Dr. Dre\u2019s greatest albatross. Most pointed is his inclusion of Dee Barnes, the TV host who was assaulted by Dr. Dre in 1991 (an incident that was omitted from the 2015 N.W.A biopic \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d). Ms. Barnes is here, conscripted to both discuss the attack \u2014 \u201cmy feet were off the ground\u201d \u2014 and detail N.W.A\u2019s early years, a move that places her in the thorny dual roles of victim and historian. (Dr. Dre apologizes, explaining that he watched his mother suffer physical abuse, and that \u201cNo woman should ever be treated that way.\u201d)In the way of much great culture, what begins as passionate art eventually becomes passionate business, and \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d devotes roughly half its time to each. (At moments, the fourth installment feels like a commercial for Apple Music, even the scene in which Mr. Iovine implores a group of employees to figure out ways to get people to subscribe.) What\u2019s missing is personal, psychological nuance. There are tantalizing bits throughout about Dr. Dre\u2019s perfectionism and his reluctance to release music, but not much theorizing about it. And while the film implies that the two are close friends, there\u2019s surprisingly little personal testimony from either about the other.Finally, \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d is less warts-and-all revealing than both men warrant. This is by design, of course \u2014 it is the price of intimate access. But Mr. Hughes is savvy enough to insert reminders of stories that remain untold. Occasionally you can hear his voice off-camera gently cajoling a more detailed answer out of someone, most pointedly when covering Dr. Dre\u2019s time at Death Row Records, a place where violence, humiliation and fear were routine.In one scene, Dr. Dre is driving his sports car and speaking about some of the indignities that were part and parcel of life at Death Row. Mr. Hughes pushes him for more \u2014 did he witness these things himself? \u2014 and Dr. Dre shoots him a quick, exasperated look, and snaps, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that on camera, Allen.\u201d Except that, in essence, he just did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Court Rejects Appeal for Elor Azaria, Soldier Who Shot Wounded Assailant", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut others criticized the unnamed soldier, who was home on leave in the settlement, for merely incapacitating the Palestinian intruder, not killing him. They suggested the soldier held off for fear of ending up like Elor Azaria, the former sergeant whose legal case has rocked Israel.The Israeli military, usually the country\u2019s most respected institution, has been battling a tide of popular sympathy for Mr. Azaria. It has also been emphasizing its rules of engagement, which call for soldiers to use no more force than is necessary, amid criticism from rights groups accusing Israeli security forces of being too quick to pull the trigger.The fatal shot fired by Mr. Azaria came 11 minutes after the attacker had stabbed and wounded another soldier in the city of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He had already been shot by forces at the scene.Mr. Azaria and his lawyers argued that the sergeant believed that the assailant, Abed al-Fatah al-Sharif, who was still moving slightly, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But the killing was caught in chilling detail on video, and the court was not convinced.\u201cThe unnecessary or disproportional use of a weapon is forbidden and immoral, is ineffective and even harmful,\u201d the court president, Maj. Gen. Doron Piles, said, according to reporters in the court. \u201cThe I.D.F. is the organized military of a country that operates according to law,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. \u201cSoldiers must not settle accounts with terrorists after the danger from them has passed.\u201dPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at first condemned Mr. Azaria\u2019s conduct. Then, apparently carried by the wave of public sympathy for the sergeant, he phoned his family to express solidarity. Mr. Netanyahu called for Mr. Azaria to be pardoned after the original verdict in January, and on Sunday said he would present his recommendation for a pardon if Mr. Azaria applies for one. Mr. Azaria has not expressed any remorse.Mr. Azaria could try to pursue a further appeal to Israel\u2019s Supreme Court.But Israel\u2019s hard-line defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, urged the Azaria family instead to request a pardon from the chief of staff of the military, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, \u201cin order to bring this episode to an end as quickly as possible for the good of Elor, the family and Israel.\u201dGeneral Eisenkot said Sunday that if Mr. Azaria chose to file a request to lighten his sentence, he would give it \u201ccareful consideration.\u201dHaving spent most of the period since the shooting confined to his army base, Mr. Azaria was released to house arrest this month after completing his term of military service. Barring further delays, he is expected to begin his sentence in a military prison next month.The episode occurred amid a deadly surge of Palestinian stabbing, shooting and car ramming attacks that began in October 2015. In the months that followed, several prominent Israeli politicians declared that Palestinian perpetrators should not emerge alive from such attacks, which liberal critics said amounted to a shoot-to-kill policy.After Mr. Azaria was charged with manslaughter and put on trial, his supporters denounced what they called the \u201cAzaria effect,\u201d accusing the army of making its soldiers too soft and hesitant to act.Those accusations resurfaced after the terrorist attack that killed three members of the Salomon family who had gathered for a festive Sabbath meal in the settlement of Halamish on July 21. The Palestinian assailant, Omar al-Abed, 19, was treated in an Israeli hospital and is now in custody. Rachel Maoz, the mother of the off-duty soldier who shot him through the window, denounced his critics.\u201cThere are all sorts of stupid people who say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you finish him off?\u2019\u201d she told Army Radio. \u201cAt that very moment, running into the house and putting a bullet in his head would have been another incident like Elor Azaria, and we don\u2019t do things like that. We are not murderers. We just defend.\u201dMr. Netanyahu has joined the call of several politicians for perpetrators like Mr. Abed to face the death penalty. The Israeli military courts operating in the West Bank have the death penalty on their books but have not used it. Experts note that it would not be effective as a deterrent, and may only spur more violence, since many Palestinian attackers, like Mr. Abed, set out seeking death as a \u201cshahid,\u201d or martyr, and do not expect to survive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rare Manhattan Find: Great Vietnamese Food, Times Two", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.You\u2019re not allowed to temper the broth with torn basil or a twist of lime, as is the custom at other Vietnamese restaurants in New York. Instead, on the side, there are sheer petals of garlic pickled in rice vinegar \u2014 a small act of mercy lending a delicate, leavening sting.This is pho bac, the noodle soup indigenous to northern Vietnam, darker and funkier than its sweet southern cousin. In Hanoi, it\u2019s made with sa sung, dried marine worms, an ingredient theoretically unavailable here, although this hasn\u2019t stopped John Nguyen, the chef, from occasionally slipping it in.This is pho nam, as it might be made in the Mekong Delta, where the mother of the chef, Jimmy Ly, was born, or on the Gulf of Thailand, once home to his mother-in-law. (He borrowed elements of his recipe from both women.) The flavors, in outline, may recall cheaper bowls in Chinatown. But here the effect is more holistic, rounded. And unlike the stiff cuts favored elsewhere, the meat \u2014 Angus brisket, eye of round simmered into submission and luscious, unorthodox short rib \u2014 yields and melts without hesitation.Great Vietnamese food has always been elusive in Manhattan, beyond rumors of sandwiches sold at the back of pawnshops and isolated dishes on otherwise forgettable menus. The arrival of Hanoi House and Madame Vo, which opened nearly simultaneously in January and share a respectful yet open-minded approach to traditional Vietnamese cooking, is cause for rejoicing.Each pho is beautiful. There is room enough for both.One night at Hanoi House, a diner of Vietnamese descent, whose family had fled the north when the communists came to power, said, \u201cEven I have never tasted pho so strong.\u201dAnother gulped a few spoonfuls, then sat back, dazed and defeated. \u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d Nevertheless, the bowl was soon empty.Mr. Nguyen, 42, who runs the kitchen, was born in Saigon just before the city fell, the son of a northerner and a southerner united in marriage. His family fled a few years later and eventually took refuge in Orange County, Calif., today home to the largest Vietnamese population in the United States. He\u2019s been a wanderer, spending time in high-end kitchens on both coasts, and was overseeing a seafood restaurant in Sichuan Province when the co-owners of Hanoi House, Sara Leveen and Ben Lowell, went searching for a chef.How lucky they found him so that we could eat these impossibly airy, blistered spring rolls, the rice-paper skins made with a touch of tapioca starch; they pull off the trick of being crispy and chewy at once. Or this rugged fold of rice-flour crepe called banh xeo, golden with turmeric and plumped by coconut milk, shattering to reveal asparagus tips and sweet pea pur\u00e9e, fresh and bright.Broken rice, whose rough shards were once disdained and cast aside for the poor, turns into satisfyingly sticky, earthy congee, saturated by white wine, lemongrass and the saline runoff of clams. Bo luc lac, filet mignon slapped with honey, soy and butter, is shining and unimprovable.Best of all, rivaling even the pho bac, is bun cha, pork and betel-wrapped meatballs patched in black from the grill and submerged in a sweet broth that turns to smoke, as if the liquid itself had been charred.The room seems to rest in an eternal dusk, with antique shutters and patterned tile reaching back to French colonial times. Above the kitchen hang propaganda posters that Ms. Leveen and Mr. Lowell picked up as souvenirs in Hanoi.9 PhotosThey brought inspiration for dessert back with them, too: che, served in alleyways in plastic cups with a tumult of ingredients snowed under shaved ice and christened with condensed milk. Here it\u2019s been recreated as an American sundae. Ice cream is littered with crushed peanuts; condensed milk and coconut milk, velvet upon velvet; candied coconut and ginger, for a little fight with the teeth; wobbly aiyu (fig-seed) jelly and black grass jelly, one as sharp as lemon, the other close to medicine; and at the bottom, fleshy and floral, a whole lychee.At Madame Vo, \u201ceverything on the menu is a piece of our families,\u201d said the chef, Mr. Ly. \u201cEverybody contributed.\u201dHis wife, Yen Vo \u2014 Madame Vo to you \u2014 was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and grew up in Long Beach, Miss., on the Gulf Coast. Her after-school snack, half an avocado with condensed milk, is commemorated here in the form of a voluptuous shake. Another drink pairs lychee with house-made aloe vera jelly, in honor of her mother and her aunt, who used to drink the juice straight.Some family traditions were at odds. \u201cThey add coconut milk\u201d to their banh xeo, said Ms. Vo, 32. \u201cWe add beer.\u201d Because Mr. Ly, also 32, is the chef, it\u2019s his version that lands on the table, denser than the one at Hanoi House and mostly a vehicle for prawns and tombstones of pork belly.\u201cShe\u2019s secretive\u201d was all Ms. Vo would say about the avocado sauce that accompanies cua lot rang muoi (fried soft-shell crab), improvised by her mother-in-law long ago. It\u2019s a Southeast Asian take on guacamole, with a bite.As a child, Mr. Ly was dragged to Vietnam, a place he hated until he stumbled on a street vendor selling hu tieu sate. He begged his mother to make it; she had to buy the recipe from the vendor, and it may require a subpoena to pry its details from her now. The mystery is part of the lure: snaking rice noodles and hunks of flank steak turned gloweringly incarnadine by an earthy-sweet sauce, infiltrated by peanuts and as thick as Italian rag\u00f9.For chefs cooking the cuisine of their heritage, it can be most difficult to please the people who know that food best. At both restaurants, I dined with Vietnamese-American friends who happily ate, with the caveat \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as Mom\u2019s.\u201dOne evening at Hanoi House, a special of bun bo Hue, a chile-inflamed beef noodle soup, appeared with blocks of coagulated pig\u2019s blood \u2014 as, one of my companions said approvingly, it should. But the blood had been cooked too long, past all flavor.At Madame Vo, Mr. Ly has banished blood from his bun bo Hue. He and his wife don\u2019t like it. \u201cI always ask my mom to take it out,\u201d she said.Another diner noted the absence, along with that of \u201creal\u201d shrimp paste, profoundly pungent, the kind \u201cthat would be too much for you,\u201d she said, nodding my way.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t put this in front of Grandma,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t accept it.\u201dThen she smiled. \u201cBut it\u2019s good.\u201dWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc a Second Chance", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolThe last few weeks of Wine School have been as much of an education for me as they may have been for anybody else.What could cause a person to shun a particular type of wine? Many things. Perhaps you drank a bottle of Chianti at a disagreeable dinner, and thereafter you have associated the wine with those unpleasant feelings. The connection may be real, but must that Chianti always take the blame for the unpalatable context in which it was served?Or perhaps you really did have a bad bottle. Maybe you would enjoy a bottle from a better producer, or with different food, or with a more interesting television program in the background. Or maybe an obnoxious guy\u2019s favorite wineis Chianti, so you have staked out opposing ground to demonstrate your thorough contempt for him.Your own taste may have evolved over time. Mine did, and most people\u2019s do, especially when they are young and just beginning to explore wine. The more wines you try, the more experiences you are able to file away, giving your brain the information it needs to form that endlessly malleable mystery known as personal taste.Now, regardless of the reason, I know plenty of people who have decided conclusively they will not drink certain wines. That is their right, and I would not bully anybody about the wines they choose to enjoy.But here at Wine School, the aim is to be open-minded and relentlessly curious. Each month when we drink the wines at meals with friends and family, the hope is to give the wines a chance. You can love the wine, or you can hate it. What matters is thinking about why it affects you in that particular way.I was not surprised that many readers said they loved New Zealand sauvignon blanc, one of the most popular styles of wine in the world. Cloudy Bay \u2014 one of the best early examples of the style back in the mid-1980s, when it first gained worldwide attention \u2014 drew particular raves.But given my own lack of enthusiasm about the style, I was also not surprised to see some grumpy reactions.\u201cSimply put, the grape is a dud,\u201d he wrote, \u201cproducing chirpy little wines wholly devoid of complexity and depth, the very qualities that make wine interesting and worth savoring.\u201dI did not concur, though I remain conflicted about the wines.New World sauvignon blancs can be delicious. But they are often treated as afterthoughts, mass-produced wines that produce reliable profits for wine companies but never receive the attention of the chardonnay, pinot noir or cabernet sauvignon that is the producer\u2019s primary passion. That is an issue I had sensed with more than a few New Zealand sauvignon blancs. But one of the three wines I drank changed my mind.The 2016 Huia was fresh and lively. It was bone-dry, with zesty flavors of lime and tropical fruits. It was not herbal in the way that I would expect a Loire wine to be, but it offered a restrained minerality that was lingering and resonant, giving the wine depth, texture and presence. It was, in a word, lovely.By contrast, the 2015 Momo exhibited the more grassy, pungent, vegetal side of sauvignon blanc with aromas of hay, citrus and bell peppers. It was lively but with a narrower bandwidth than the Huia. Perhaps the extra year of age played a role, or maybe the \u201915 vintage emphasized different sorts of flavors than the \u201916, but this was not the sort of wine that draws me in.The 2016 Cloudy Bay was somewhere in the middle, with aromas of herbs and tropical fruits, lively and energetic, but without the intensity of flavor that I ordinarily associate with Cloudy Bay. It didn\u2019t stir the emotions like the Huia, but I found it a pleasant bottle.\u201cI swear I heard it whisper in my ear: \u2018Don\u2019t take me too serious. Let\u2019s have a good time here,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd that we did.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly the sort of open-mindedness Wine School would like to encourage. I hope I have learned that lesson myself. I know I plan to drink the Huia again and will try not to close myself off to other examples.Not that this style depends on my approval. Sauvignon blancs are popular around the world, and readers not only from North America and France but also from Warsaw and Chengbu, China, drank the wines approvingly.I don\u2019t equate popularity with quality or distinctiveness. But it is sometimes worth wondering what all the fuss is about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Somalis in Minneapolis Shocked and Saddened by Police Shooting", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 His hiring by the Minneapolis Police Department was hailed by the mayor as \u201ca wonderful sign.\u201d Hundreds of Somalis attended an event at a local mall welcoming him to the force, lining up to take pictures and shake his hand.But just 14 months after Mohamed Noor became the first Somali police officer to be stationed in his precinct, which has a large immigrant population, he is now under scrutiny for fatally shooting an Australian woman after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home.On Wednesday, more details emerged. In the minutes before being shot on Saturday, Ms. Damond, whose legal name was Justine Ruszczyk, called 911 twice, according to transcripts released by the Minneapolis police.\u201cI can hear someone out the back and I, I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s having sex or being raped,\u201d she told the dispatcher, \u201cbut it\u2019s been going on for a while and I think she tried to say help and it sounds distressed.\u201dThe dispatcher said an officer was on the way. Eight minutes later, with apparently no officers yet on scene, Ms. Damond called again to reiterate her concern for the woman, asking whether the police had the wrong address.The dispatcher assured her that officers were coming, and the call ended. Shortly thereafter, Officer Noor arrived in the alley.Mahamed Yusuf was at Karmel Mall for Officer Noor\u2019s welcome, and said that local Somalis had been heartened to have one of their own on the police force.\u201cWe have a guy between the police and the community,\u201d Mr. Yusuf said. Since the shooting, he said, Somalis have been \u201cburning inside\u201d and grasping for answers.\u201cHe was looking so nice and humble, and he loved his job,\u201d Mr. Yusuf, 63, said. \u201cEverybody in the community is shocked and sad.\u201dMs. Hodges also said that Officer Noor \u201cwon\u2019t be treated differently than any other officer\u201d and that the shooting had happened \u201cunder circumstances we don\u2019t yet comprehend.\u201d\u201cWe cannot compound that tragedy by turning to racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia,\u201d Ms. Hodges said. \u201cIt is unjust and ridiculous to assert that an entire community be held responsible for the actions of one person. That will not be tolerated in Minneapolis.\u201dMinneapolis police records show that Officer Noor has been the subject of three citizen complaints during his short career. Two of those cases remain open, and one was closed without any discipline. Details about those incidents were not released. Court records show that Mr. Noor has a son born in 2010, and that he was involved in 2015 in a custody dispute with the mother, who wanted to move out of state.A day before the shooting, a lawsuit accusing Officer Noor and two of his colleagues of misconduct was filed in federal court. The lawsuit, filed by a woman who said the police had illegally taken her into custody for a mental health checkup in May, said Officer Noor had taken her phone from her hand \u201cand then grabbed her right wrist and upper arm, thereby immobilizing her.\u201dJordan S. Kushner, a lawyer for the woman, said Officer Noor \u201cwas a participant in what we consider a real egregious and dramatic violation of her rights.\u201d He noted that his client had initially called the police for help that day, just as the woman Officer Noor shot on Saturday did.Officer Noor\u2019s lawyer did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Officer Noor has so far declined to speak with state investigators about the shooting. No one answered the door on Wednesday at an apartment tied to him.Abdirizak Bihi, a Somali community leader in Minneapolis, said that the relationship between the local police and Somalis had improved significantly in recent years and that the community celebrates when one of its members becomes an officer. He knows several Somali youths considering careers in law enforcement.\u201cWe worked so hard to get Somali police officers,\u201d Mr. Bihi said.Mr. Bihi said Somalis empathized with Ms. Damond as a fellow immigrant, but resented the news media attention on Officer Noor\u2019s heritage.\u201cWhy in the world would he be seen as a Somali and not a Minneapolis police officer?\u201d Mr. Bihi said. \u201cThe community feels betrayed.\u201dThe shooting also made headlines in Somalia, where many worried it could paint a negative image of Somalis and harm the status of refugee applications, many of which have been rejected under President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\u201cMany Somalis are talking about the case as though the case occurred here in Somalia,\u201d said Abdirahman Hassan Omar, a lawyer based in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. \u201cBecause of the travel ban, this is making us worried a lot.\u201dThe shooting, said Nadiir Shariif Maqbuul, an activist in Mogadishu, will affect the Somali communities not only in Australia and the United States, but also in Europe and elsewhere.In Minneapolis, people who had met Officer Noor struggled to square their recollections of him with the shooting of Ms. Damond, which, so far at least, has defied explanation.\u201cOfficer Noor was a good guy,\u201d said Abdihakim Bashir, 35, who was shopping on Wednesday at the bustling Karmel Mall. \u201cWe were very surprised by the news. We don\u2019t know what happened. It was an accident, and every human can make a mistake.\u201dJohn Eligon reported from Minneapolis, and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

{"Headline": "In San Antonio Smuggling Case, a Fatal Journey in a Packed and Sweltering Truck", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 When the smugglers first closed the door of the truck\u2019s trailer, it was pitch black inside.There was no food and no water, and the trailer sat motionless somewhere in or near the scorching South Texas city of Laredo on Saturday morning. The heat inside was already intense.The next few hours, as they were described on Monday by the authorities for the first time, would turn into one of the nation\u2019s deadliest human trafficking episodes. One group of undocumented immigrants was packed into the trailer, then another and another. Some of them guessed there were up to 200 people at one point.A smuggler opened the door and told the migrants they would finally be leaving, reassuring them that the truck had a refrigeration system.Once the truck was on the highway, the immigrants \u2014 some of whom had crossed the Rio Grande by raft and owed smugglers thousands of dollars \u2014 seemed to be fine. Then some had trouble breathing and started to pass out.They banged on the trailer\u2019s walls, to get the driver\u2019s attention, but the truck did not stop. The driver later told federal investigators what the immigrants may have soon discovered: that the trailer\u2019s cooling system did not work and its four vent holes were probably clogged. But the immigrants found a small vent hole that was open, and took turns breathing through it to get some air.Ten people died during the journey or later at hospitals. Nearly 30 others were hospitalized.Even as President Trump has made it clear that he will not tolerate illegal immigration, the tragedy illustrated the extremes people will go to to sneak into the United States and opened a window into human smuggling at the border, a clandestine world of drug cartels, rafts, \u201cstash houses\u201d and empty promises.It quickly became a political issue in Texas. The Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, who has long denounced illegal immigration, took to social media to link the case to the state\u2019s new and highly controversial law banning so-called sanctuary cities \u2014 those that do not cooperate with immigration agencies.\u201cSanctuary cities entice people to believe they can come to America and Texas and live outside the law,\u201d Mr. Patrick wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday. \u201cSanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and cartels. Today, these people paid a terrible price and demonstrate why we need a secure border and legal immigration reform.\u201dState Representative Eddie Rodriguez, a Democrat, said the comments went \u201ctoo far.\u201dMr. Rodriguez said in a statement that when \u201c10 people from any background perish under such horrific circumstances, it is an occasion deserving of solemnity and respect, not self-indulgent cheerleading.\u201dMuch was still unanswered on Monday, including exactly how many people had been in the truck, and how they managed to get to San Antonio undetected, since it was likely that the driver passed through a Border Patrol traffic checkpoint at some point after leaving Laredo.Survivors who were interviewed by investigators said they had been loaded into the trailer from various locations in or near Laredo. Many of the details in the criminal complaint came from an immigrant who was hospitalized and who was referred to by the initials J.M.M.-J.He was from Aguascalientes, Mexico, and with a group of 28 others had crossed the Rio Grande by raft in three trips. In addition to $5,500 he would owe his smugglers when he got to his final destination in San Antonio, people with ties to the Mexican criminal organization known as the Zetas cartel were paid in pesos for protection and for the raft crossing.The Mexican man and the others in his group then hiked through the South Texas brush until the next day, when they were picked up by a vehicle and driven to the trailer. Another immigrant described waiting in a stash house in Laredo for 11 days with 23 other people before being loaded into the trailer.A third survivor, who was identified in the complaint by the initials H.L.-C. and was headed to Minnesota, told investigators that he and his brother crossed through in Laredo. \u201cHe stated he thought there were approximately 180 to 200 people in the tractor-trailer when he got in,\u201d the complaint said.By the time the police came to the truck Sunday morning, alerted by a Walmart employee, a number of immigrants had already fled, either in vehicles that picked them up before the police arrived or on foot.The bodies of the 10 dead, all adult men, have been taken to the Bexar County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, which is working with other agencies to determine their identities, a spokeswoman said. Officials with the Mexican Consulate are also assisting. The men\u2019s bodies will be returned to their families once their identities are established, a process involving fingerprint and DNA checks and other forensic tools that could take considerable time.One man was a Guatemalan who had previously lived in the United States as a so-called Dreamer, one of the young immigrants protected from deportation by an Obama administration policy. But he had lost his protection because of a conviction for larceny and aggravated assault, said Silvia Mintz, a lawyer working for the Guatemalan Consulate in Houston.How the survivors\u2019 immigration status will be handled in the coming weeks remained unclear. All were in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Immigration lawyers said they should be regarded as crime victims, and as witnesses to a crime, which in some cases can protect them from deportation.\u201cWe are exploring every avenue, and hopefully we can get them some immigration relief,\u201d Ms. Mintz said.On Monday morning, the driver, Mr. Bradley, made a brief appearance in Federal District Court, answering, \u201cYes, I do,\u201d when Judge Betsy Chestney asked if he understood the maximum penalties. It was unclear whether prosecutors would seek the death penalty, which is infrequently used in federal court.Mr. Bradley told federal authorities that he was unaware of his human cargo. According to court documents, Mr. Bradley said when he stopped at Walmart to urinate, he heard movement in the trailer and opened it.He said he was knocked down by fleeing immigrants and said \u201che then noticed bodies just lying on the floor like meat,\u201d according to the criminal complaint.Mr. Bradley said he tried to administer aid, but he did not call 911.Mr. Bradley\u2019s remarks to investigators raised a host of questions, including why he ended up in San Antonio at all. He told investigators that his ultimate destination was Brownsville, where he was supposed to deliver the trailer to its new owner. Mr. Bradley told investigators, however, that he was not given a delivery address in Brownsville. In addition, if the truck was in Laredo and bound for Brownsville, San Antonio is in the opposite direction.Court records from Colorado and Florida appear to show a criminal history for Mr. Bradley. Those records belong to a James Bradley with the middle initial B., rather than M., of the same age and general physical appearance.In 1996, James B. Bradley was arrested by the Aurora, Colo., police and charged with menacing with a deadly weapon and assault. He pleaded guilty in 1997 to a single felony charge and was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation, but records show that the probation was revoked multiple times, putting him back in jail.

{"Headline": "Lively and Refreshing Wines at the Right Price", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesSeveral little-known red grapes of Italy have achieved some small measure of renown beyond their home territories in the last 15 years, but montepulciano has not been among them.Unlike aglianico, nerello mascalese and frappato, montepulciano did not burst on to the scene, leaving behind a frenzied Instagram trail of fervent sommeliers and impassioned wine merchants. While those grapes have all deservedly had their moments, montepulciano has largely been ignored.I don\u2019t argue that it should have been otherwise. The other grapes, at least, have their champions, star winemakers whose successes demonstrated great potential and carved plausible paths for others to follow.This is the less-traveled coast of Italy, at least among Americans, who seem far more acquainted with Rome, Naples and the Amalfi Coast than they are with the Adriatic cities of Ancona and Bari. Maybe this unfamiliarity contributes to the lack of general enthusiasm about Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo, but in my experience, it has been the style of the wines themselves that limits the enthusiasm.In the recent era, when wine critics worshiped at the altar of power and density, many montepulciano producers tried to prove their thoroughbred bona fides with opulent richness and an overreliance on new oak barrels. It was a disastrous equation that resulted in jammy, oaky, tannic wines that for me, at least, were not worth seeking out.But Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo has a longer tradition of juicy, inexpensive wines that are uncomplicated and cheap. Often, these wines were made by the large cooperatives that dominated the region. But in recent years, more small, serious producers have appeared, and the overall quality of the wines has risen.It is obligatory at some point to distinguish between our subject, Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo, a wine made of the montepulciano grape, and the very different wine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano made of sangiovese grown in the vicinity of the Tuscan town Montepulciano. Confusing, I know.To get a better sense of the state of Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo today, the wine panel tasted 20 bottles from recent vintages. The tasting included ordinary bottles from 2013, \u201914 and \u201915, and riservas, which require longer aging before they can be released, from 2011 and \u201912.Perhaps not unexpectedly, the wines in our tasting divided largely into two styles: those that were fresh, fruity and tannic, and others that were overbearing, oaky and tannic. If by no other characteristic, you could sense the difference between the styles in the quality of the tannins.The montepulciano grape has plenty of astringent tannins in its skins, which give the wines, even the simple ones, a robust structure. The grape tannins also have a clean freshness that seems a natural part of the wine.But new oak has tannins, too. When the wines have seen too much new oak, you can sense it in the tannins, which have a woody, bitter, drying quality, even if the wine does not have overt flavors from the oak.\u201cMontepulciano can be easily manipulated,\u201d Francesco said. \u201cFresh, fruity wines can be turned into international oak bombs,\u201d though he allowed, as a good sommelier would, that this style was not necessarily unattractive to certain palates.\u201cWhen you try to make more expensive wines, you lose what made montepulciano attractive in the first place,\u201d Marika said.I would say the problem is not necessarily charging more for the wines. The montepulcianos of both Valentini and Pepe are considerably more expensive than anything that was in our tasting, and well over our $100 a bottle cap. The problem is making wines in styles perceived to be popular among big spenders, which could require costly investments in new oak barrels.Indeed, of the six bottles in our tasting that cost more than $25, only one, the 2011 Contesa riserva at $38, made our top 10, at No. 3. This was a powerful wine, and powerfully tannic, yet it was beautifully balanced, floral, spicy and fruity. Our other favorites topped out at $25.No. 1 was the superb 2014 Ode from CantinArte, lively, fresh and pure. \u201cThis is montepulciano,\u201d Marika said.Both of these wines were notable for the absence of oakiness, which allowed the purity of the fruit to show. The Ode was fermented and aged in steel tanks, and the Modo Antico in concrete. While I don\u2019t mean to say that these are the best methods for making montepulciano, these bottles suggest that the best methods are those not intended to add tannins or flavors to what\u2019s already in the grape.Other wines well worth seeking out include the vibrant, fresh 2013 Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo from Italo Pietrantonj; the earthy, lively 2015 from Valle Reale; the zesty, herbal 2014 Malandrino from Cataldi Madonna; and the pretty, floral 2015 from Fantini Farnese. Each of these wines cost less than $20.It should be said that all of our favorites were relatively simple wines, even the $38 Contesa riserva. They did not offer much in the way of complexity, intrigue or mystery. But they are lively, pure and refreshing, which is important. They are also good values, and they are versatile with meats and tomato-based sauces.Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo may not have much in the way of star power, but you\u2019ll get a good drink of wine.BEST VALUE Lively and pure, with chewy tannins and fresh flavors of red fruit. (Grand Cru Selections, New York)Tight and structured, floral and pure, with spicy flavors of dark fruits. (Third Leaf, Bridgeport, Pa.)Tannic and balanced, with spicy, lingering flavors of red fruits and flowers. (Vinifera, Ronkonkoma, N.Y.)Vivacious and well balanced, with chewy tannins and flavors of fresh red fruits. (Bon Vivant Imports, Boise, Idaho)Lively and fresh, with earthy flavors of dark fruits. (Leonardo LoCascio Selections/Winebow, New York)Earthy and zesty, with flavors of red fruits, herbs and minerals. (Vias Imports, New York)Pretty and well balanced, with aromas of flowers and herbs. (Empson USA, Alexandria, Va.)Lively, tannic and earthy, with flavors of herbs and cherries. (Wineberry America, Valley Cottage, N.Y.)Lingering flavors of sweet red fruits and herbs. (Della Terra, Napa, Calif.)Big, dense and oaky, with flavors of fresh red fruit and discernible oak tannins. (Masciarelli Wine, Weymouth, Mass.)An earlier version of this article misstated the type of vessel used to age the 2015 Annona Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo Modo Antico. It is a concrete vat, not a steel tank.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Atla, Mexican for Every Moment of the Day", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review12 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Since Atla ambled up to the corner of Lafayette and Great Jones Streets this spring, all the people who run to every new opening in town have been telling me they want to eat chilaquiles for breakfast there; they want the chicken enchiladas for lunch; they want to hide from the afternoon sun with a tall glass of iced tepache, a tingling, off-dry agua fresca Atla makes by letting sugar ferment with pineapple rinds.Sometimes, under their breath, they query a few of the prices at this casual Mexican cafe (\u201cFourteen dollars for radishes?\u201d), but I haven\u2019t talked to anyone who doesn\u2019t think Atla is an extremely likable place. Despite its fairly modest goals, or maybe because of them, Atla is one of the least divisive restaurants Manhattan has seen in some time. It\u2019s as if people, worn out by the sheer effort of being scandalized by the news, had decided that 2017 would be more bearable if we could all just find one thing to agree about. Atla is that thing.Opened by Enrique Olvera, the chef best known for Pujol in Mexico City, together with his proxy in New York, Daniela Soto-Innes, and their chef de cuisine, Hugo Vera, Atla knows just what it\u2019s doing without seeming to try. This combination is as attractive in a restaurant as it is in a person.One thing it is not trying to do is make a big statement. Mr. Olvera and Ms. Soto-Innes made their statement already, at Cosme, their more elaborate restaurant on East 21st Street, which is now nearly as well known as Pujol. Having proved at Cosme that they have original things to say about Mexican cuisine, they are set free at Atla to serve Mexican food that New Yorkers may want to eat every day. Which is not to say that this is the everyday cooking of Mexico.While Cosme specializes in the kind of layered, multicomponent dishes with which chefs make their mark, Atla\u2019s menu is simpler. The chilaquiles are just chilaquiles, tortilla chips in red or green salsa under white onions and a tangy crema. The chips are thick enough to keep their crunch, and they get more of it from a sprinkling of toasted flaxseeds.Flaxseeds are not a standard garnish for chilaquiles, but they are symptomatic of the contemporary strain of nutrient-conscious eating Atla displays. It has less in common with the sturdy cooking of traditional Mexican restaurants than with the modified health-food aesthetic of places like Dimes that cater to the yoga-mat crowd.Besides a regular cafe con leche Atla serves two versions with no dairy; one is made with cashew milk (a little odd) and another with coconut milk (wonderful). In any form, the cafe con leche is made with strong espresso, sweet enough to get along without sugar.Chia bowls usually bore me, despite their exemplary levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but the one at Atla held my attention. It\u2019s stirred with sweet Mexican cinnamon, like a semisolid horchata, and topped with candied ginger, pumpkin seeds and nuts.A number of dishes are flat-out salads, like the fine if not soul-stirring quinoa with cucumbers and pico de gallo. Others are salad-adjacent. Those $14 radishes, cool, crisp and skinny, surround a smooth avocado dip. The chunky guacamole is pounded with nearly enough tarragon, mint and basil to qualify as an herb salad. When it arrives it is nearly invisible under a single chile-dusted corn chip the color of a wet bluestone sidewalk, and the size of a flip-flop.A smaller, rounder blue masa chip, spread with farmer cheese and capers, is the foundation of the arctic char tostada. As an attempt to introduce Russ & Daughters to Mexico it is all right, but it doesn\u2019t go beyond that. The ceviche verde, on the other hand, is more dynamic than you expect, thanks to the fresh ginger in its tart green sauce, among other tricks.Depending on your metabolism, all this will leave you feeling either refreshed and ready to meet the day or slightly hungry. To make a lunch of the chilaquiles I needed to fortify the plate with poached chicken, bringing a $14 dish to $19.There are more substantial things to eat. Gray sole fried in a crunchy panko crust that tastes of garlic and butter is a complete meal. It comes with a small cucumber salad, like a Viennese schnitzel, although in Vienna they probably wouldn\u2019t bathe the cucumbers in herb juice and add green chiles and cilantro. Nor would they sell you a $3 plate of warm tortillas so you can make your own tacos. Maybe they should, though.The pambazo, meanwhile, is the traditional sandwich of chorizo and potatoes on a soft roll dipped in guajillo salsa. It\u2019s more or less the pambazo you would get out of a Oaxacan lunch truck if you were lucky enough to find one parked on Lafayette Street.Still, the overall lightness of the food has some bearing on the one real debate you could have about Atla. The question is not whether to go, but when. (People plan their meals at Cosme a week ahead or more, and while Atla takes reservations, going there tends to be a spur-of-the-moment decision.)The dining room\u2019s corner space is wrapped in plate glass. By day this invites the sunshine in and provides a wide-screen view of the endless fashion parade of NoHo. By night, when the eggs and other breakfast dishes roll off the menu and the room fills up with people more interested in mezcal and the \u201coverproof margarita\u201d than coffee and agua fresca, the windows become sounding boards.At times like this you may notice all the other hard surfaces, like the stone floor; you may wonder why only some of the seats have backs; you may be frustrated in your effort to keep all your plates and glasses on the small round table.The very qualities that make Atla ideal for a relaxed breakfast or lunch, in other words, make it a dinner destination that is best approached with a moderate appetite, a resilient lower back and a suspicion that whatever your friends are saying probably isn\u2019t important anyway. Better still, treat it as a drinking spot where food is an added attraction.For dessert there is a curious tamal topped with queso fresco. It\u2019s more salty than sweet, a minor-key reprise of the great corn-husk meringue at Cosme. The most appealing dessert I had was a roasted sweet potato under a caramelized pool of sweetened condensed milk. It is off the menu now, but I am telling you about it anyway because I suspect it will be back. I know I will.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Gets a Tech Makeover", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlso last year, in a less publicized development, Jean Yang, 30, returned to this city after more than a decade of living in Boston, finding a Pittsburgh she hardly recognized from her 1990s childhood.These seemingly unrelated events have one thing in common: Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s School of Computer Science.Because of the top students and research professors at Carnegie Mellon, tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber have opened offices here.The big tech firms, along with their highly skilled, highly paid workers, have made Pittsburgh younger and more international and helped to transform once-derelict neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and East Liberty.\u201cI loved C.M.U., and that\u2019s the main reason why I stayed,\u201d said Mr. von Ahn, who, in addition to his role at Duolingo, is a consulting professor in the School of Computer Science.There were also business advantages to remaining: Duolingo is close to the engineering talent (\u201cC.M.U. is pumping out some of the best, at a rate of about 500 a year,\u201d Mr. von Ahn said), and for millennial job-seekers, Pittsburgh\u2019s quality-of-life-metric is looking better these days than ever-costlier, ever-more-crowded New York or San Francisco.For Mr. Wirth, the software engineer who started at Duolingo in February, Silicon Valley is a fun place to visit, but living and working in the Bay Area would be a grind.\u201cI was just there last week for a conference,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. \u201cI was talking to someone who told me, \u2018My commute is two hours on the bus.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do that.\u201dKamal Nigam, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who is the head of Google Pittsburgh, said that a decade ago, workers hired by the company had family or personal connections to the city. That is no longer the case. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people who are moving to Pittsburgh for the very first time, from all over the country and the world,\u201d Mr. Nigam said.He added, \u201cWith the growing number of start-ups and the big companies in the area, people realize they can have not just one job at a good tech company, but a tech career here.\u201dFor many years, Pittsburgh was a place 20-somethings fled or avoided. In the 1990s, Allegheny County, which includes the city, was the second-oldest large county in the United States, behind only a geriatric zone in Florida. It was a notoriously difficult place to be young and single, and an earlier generation of computer science students put in their four years at Carnegie Mellon, grabbed their diplomas and left.This is the sleepy city Jean Yang knew while growing up near the campus, where her father was a research scientist in the School of Computer Science. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize no one wanted to stay in Pittsburgh,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI was just leaving because I thought everyone wants to leave where they grew up. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come back as an adult.\u201dBut Ms. Yang\u2019s field of research is in computer programming languages, and, as she put it, \u201cC.M.U. is the best place for the kind of work I want to do.\u201d When she was offered an assistant professor position in the School of Computer Science and discovered a changed Pittsburgh on her visits back, Ms. Yang accepted the job and returned last August.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an excitement about being here,\u201d she said. \u201cI go out to eat and drink in East Liberty. Lawrenceville I go to a lot. Everywhere I go didn\u2019t exist when I was growing up.\u201dPut simply, where the tech world is going \u2014 self-driving cars; personal A.I. concierges; robot workers \u2014 is where Carnegie Mellon\u2019s faculty and students have been for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s like being in Hogwarts,\u201d said Andrew W. Moore, the dean of the School of Computer Science. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool and exciting to have these glimpses of the future, and to see all these people running around and having these crazy ideas.\u201d\u201cI get to see these cool things all the time and I\u2019m just stopping to say, \u2018Well, what does this even mean for the world?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou start thinking, \u2018Someone can use this in dance class.\u2019 Then you think: \u2018Wait. Can we use this to judge gymnastics competitions?\u2019 Then you say, \u2018Wait, couldn\u2019t we use this in securing Penn Station in New York?\u2019\u201dSpeaking of Red Whittaker, the professor who led Carnegie Mellon in winning the $2 million Darpa Urban Challenge self-driving car competition in 2007, Mr. Gutkind said, \u201cRed was into self-driving vehicles before anyone,\u201d using Carnegie Mellon\u2019s resources and reaching out to local investors for money and technical support.A legend in the robotics field, Professor Whittaker turns out also to be a gentrification pioneer: He was instrumental in locating the school\u2019s National Robotics Engineering Center in an abandoned foundry in Lawrenceville, in 1996.\u201cLawrenceville was in the lost and found, it was really rough,\u201d he said, adding that the introduction of a state-of-the-art research facility and its educated work force was, among other developments in the area, a \u201ccatalyst and galvanizing influence\u201d for the neighborhood.\u201cThe real estate and the culture of the neighborhood was a very big thing for robotics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd robotics was a very big thing for the neighborhood.\u201dWhich means even a Monocle reporter being dispatched to check out the Espresso a Mano cafe with its rotating exhibitions by local artists can be traced back to the geeks, in a six-degrees-of-Carnegie-Mellon sort of way.Advertisement"}

And by \u2018\u2018sorry,\u2019\u2019 I mean \u2018\u2018not sorry.\u2019\u2019 Right now, the far-right website Breitbart News is selling T-shirts emblazoned with the words \u2018\u2018Unapologetically American.\u2019\u2019 The shirt\u2019s label is printed with the Breitbart logo, \u2018\u2018Made in USA\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018#WAR.\u2019\u2019 This is a shirt that wants to be starting something.

He won. So, then, did the offenses, insults and assaults he and his campaign not only refused to apologize for but also, in the case of, say, the former campaign staffer and journalist-mauler Corey Lewandowski, swore never happened. Witnesses and contradictory video footage be damned.If you see things that way, you\u2019re also likely to be of the mind that all Barack Obama did as president was apologize for America. Mitt Romney\u2019s book, from 2010, was called \u2018\u2018No Apology: The Case for American Greatness\u2019\u2019 and sprang from the premise that, in 2009, Obama toured the world asking other governments for forgiveness. According to Romney, \u2018\u2018He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally and for acting without regard for others.\u2019\u2019In Obama\u2019s view, apologies were sometimes warranted and should be offered without shame. But among nationalists and certain conservatives, his humility secured him a reputation as weak. Trump succeeded where Romney failed, in part because he could run against a caricature of Obama instead of the man himself. The concoction of a chronically contrite Obama made the anti-apologetic Trump seem more masculine, more American.During Obama\u2019s overseas trip to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Germany and France in early June 2009, he cheered America\u2019s diversity, but earlier that year, in Turkey, he spoke about our country\u2019s \u2018\u2018darker periods.\u2019\u2019 He was referring to the torture of Iraqis but also to America\u2019s enslavement of Africans and its decimation of American Indians. Maybe this is what really stuck in certain people\u2019s craw: He was airing our dirty laundry in front of foreign hosts, talking about ugly flash points in the creation of the United States that we haven\u2019t settled. The offspring of that violence still await a substantial apology. At this point, they know not to hold their breath.My daddy Alabama, momma LouisianaYou mix that Negro with that Creole, make a Texas bamaI like my baby heir with baby hair and AfrosI like my Negro nose with Jackson Five nostrilsShe\u2019s not merely proud of natural hair and wide nostrils.

It names Facebook accounts and Tumblr pages that feature people with natural, unstraightened hair, brazenly eating food \u2014 like watermelon \u2014 negatively associated with black people that, like most human beings, black people also enjoy.The Obamas\u2019 engagement with their blackness mirrored the culture\u2019s engagement with the variety of blackness teeming within it. In the course of three years, the sitcoms \u2018\u2018Black-ish,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Insecure\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Atlanta\u2019\u2019; the Marvel Comics drama \u2018\u2018Luke Cage\u2019\u2019 and the Southern soap opera \u2018\u2018Queen Sugar\u2019\u2019 all turned up on television.

At some point, along with \u2018\u2018Lemonade,\u2019\u2019 they\u2019ve all been deemed unapologetic in their blackness. There\u2019s something celebratory in the phrase, but it\u2019s also defensive and defiant. Nearly all of this work has white patronage. So a great deal of the astonishment over the proud detail of its blackness comes with an awareness of a white gaze. Blackness was never forced to owe black people an apology for anything.Practitioners of unapologetic blackness know their culture is being watched and shared, and the pride isn\u2019t so much in the blackness itself but in its encryption, in what the 1990s fashion company (and Solange) called Fubu \u2014 For us, by us. They were originally just talking about jeans and sweats. But the Fubu spirit continues to insist that, in a country that for so long has refused to see our full selves, we can see one another. Why should anybody have to apologize for that?Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

She was a lifelong libertarian and an intermittently active Republican. She worked in engine development for Ford for 29 years, she told me, until the program she worked on was scuttled. A year later, her job was, too. This was 2006, which was also the year that Locke decided to transition; she began hormone therapy the next year. \u201cYour entire life, you look at yourself, and you don\u2019t see the person that everybody else sees,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s very disconcerting. It\u2019s not something you can talk to anyone about. You don\u2019t even want to admit it to yourself.\u201dSince then, Locke had been self-employed. After Ford, she interviewed for some full-time positions but never got them, and she could not shake the suspicion, even if she couldn\u2019t prove it, that it had to do with the transition. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018We can\u2019t wait to bring you on board, but we have to do a background check.\u2019 And then I don\u2019t hear from them ever again.\u201d At church, where she played bass in the ensemble that performed at worship services, \u201cI was told that they couldn\u2019t allow someone like me to represent the church \u2014 as if I\u2019m doing something sinful, or I\u2019m evil. And that crushed my soul.\u201dWhen Trump gave his speech announcing his candidacy, Locke told me, \u201cI listened to that, and I was drawn to Trump immediately.\u201d She liked what he had to say about regulations, border security, immigration. When he came to Michigan, she went to the rallies and phone-banked for him. She pulled out her phone to show me a picture she took of him at one of the rallies, a view from the crowd, the glare from the spotlights giving him a slightly apparitional quality. \u201cI was standing front and center,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump, when he came out, saw my hat, and he looked at me and said: \u2018Thank you for your service.\u2019 Ted Nugent\u201d \u2014 he was the opening act \u2014 \u201csaluted me.\u201dLocke had little love for social conservatives but also had little for Democratic members of the L.G.B.T. community who couldn\u2019t understand why her gender identity didn\u2019t dictate her politics. Part of what appealed to her about the Trump supporters she came to know was how little they seemed to care about that identity. \u201cOut of all the people I\u2019ve ever had the opportunity to speak with about politics,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Trump supporters, quite frankly, they don\u2019t give a damn one way or another what your orientation is \u2014 whether you\u2019re a trans individual or not. There are some extremists, but there are extremists in all walks of life. Has anyone given me a hard time since we\u2019ve been together?\u201d I shook my head. Locke swiped some more on her phone until she came to a photo from a rally in Novi, Mich., in which she was flanked by two burly bearded men from the Bikers for Trump. \u201cDo they look like they give a damn?\u201dThey didn\u2019t \u2014 and this was something that struck me, too, at the handful of Trump rallies and similar events I attended before and after the election. The abiding atmosphere, encouraged by Trump himself, was always us versus them, and eruptions of collective rage \u2014 toward protesters, reporters, Hillary Clinton in absentia \u2014 that would have been hard to imagine in pre-Trump American politics were routine. But among the Trump supporters themselves, within the safety of the self-defined \u201cus,\u201d there was palpable loosening of the strictures that have traditionally attended sexuality and gender in Republican politics, a genuine-seeming acceptance of difference in the midst of a political movement that had been, from the beginning, a hurricane of polarized identity. It was something that my liberal friends never quite seemed to believe when I described it to them \u2014 and that disbelief, I think, was part of the point.Ever since Republican politics absorbed the substance and style of talk radio, they have contained a tension between advancing actual conservative ideas and instinctively embracing anything that seems likely to antagonize liberal sensibilities \u2014 categories that overlap substantially but not completely. During George W. Bush\u2019s first term, there was the brief vogue among conservative intellectuals for \u201c \u2018South Park\u2019 Republicans\u201d: a term, coined by the iconoclastic conservative journalist and \u201cSouth Park\u201d superfan Andrew Sullivan, to describe people like Sullivan himself, who were socially liberal but \u201cbelieve we need a hard-ass foreign policy and are extremely skeptical of political correctness.\u201d It was an intriguing sort of identity jujitsu, making a case for a more pluralistic Republicanism as a mischievous rebellion against liberals\u2019 own rigidly enforced pluralism.The crowd erupted in cheers. The move here was obvious enough: What better way to screw with liberals\u2019 self-image than to ostentatiously affect tolerance? But the applause that lines like this got seemed genuine, not ironic. There was a palpable feeling of exhilaration, a sense of trying on identities that were until recently off-limits but were now fair game. Maybe that meant putting on a Pepe the Frog lapel pin; maybe it meant cheering the auteur behind a bunch of Make America Great Again-themed beefcake photos. Maybe it meant both at once.Former Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, a Republican who lost in 2016 \u2014 even as Trump won his state \u2014 after his fate was tied to the State Legislature\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which he signed into law, might have an interesting answer to that question. Trump\u2019s understanding of his own base is ultimately no less cartoonish than his understanding of his many enemies. More than 40 municipalities in Michigan now have nondiscrimination ordinances on the books, many of them in deeply red counties, including the small rural community where Locke lives.\u201cThat just tells you the level of acceptance the people of the state of Michigan have,\u201d she told me in December. \u201cIf you were to go to the House of Representatives in Lansing, or the Senate\u201d \u2014 each now controlled by Republicans \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019re just as bad as McCrory is in North Carolina. But they have this twisted perception of what the people really think. People don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d On the other hand, there were a lot of things that people didn\u2019t seem to give a damn about before Trump swept them up in the magpie-style assemblage of his politics. And then, all of a sudden, they did.Charles Homans is the politics editor for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Natalia Veselnitskaya, Lawyer Who Met Trump Jr., Seen as Fearsome Moscow Insider", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 When American prosecutors accused a senior Russian official\u2019s son of laundering $14 million by investing in Manhattan property and other assets, she was called to defend him. When Moscow regional officials battled Ikea over the Swedish retailer\u2019s expansion, she took on their case.But lawyers and others in Moscow\u2019s legal community called her a trusted insider, one who could be counted on to argue and win important high-profile court cases that matter to the government and to one senior, well-connected official in particular.Ms. Veselnitskaya, 42, earned her status as the go-to lawyer for the Moscow regional government. For years, she has been a lawyer for the Katsyv family, whose patriarch, Pyotr D. Katsyv, was minister of transportation of the Moscow region for more than a decade, and whose son was caught up in the New York money laundering case.The elder Mr. Katsyv is now a vice president of Russian Railways, a state-owned railroad monopoly that is the country\u2019s largest employer and one long dogged by corruption allegations.It is not known exactly what Ms. Veselnitskaya said in the roughly 30-minute meeting. Donald Trump Jr. said she spent much of the time attacking American sanctions. Ms. Veselnitskaya has denied that, at the behest of Russian officials, she discussed compromising material with members of the Trump campaign team.Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told reporters that the Kremlin had never heard of her. Asked about possible links between Ms. Veselnitskaya and the Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, the ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, said that it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with her efforts.But in Russia, lines between career, loyalty and government service tend to blur more than in other countries.Ms. Veselnitskaya built her career in the sharp-elbowed struggle for land as the Moscow suburbs expanded, as once derelict factory sites and other plots became wildly valuable with the spread of shopping centers and new highways. And she forged an important connection to the Katsyv family.William Browder, an American-born hedge fund manager who has tussled repeatedly with Ms. Veselnitskaya, said of the elder Mr. Katsyv: \u201cIn the world of Russia he\u2019d be the equivalent of a Chris Christie: no formal relationship to the Kremlin, but with very strong relations to the powers that be.\u201dThe family\u2019s trust in Ms. Veselnitskaya was rewarded in May, when she helped Denis P. Katsyv, Pyotr\u2019s son, fight the money laundering claims in New York brought by the Manhattan federal prosecutor at the time, Preet Bharara. Mr. Bharara tangled with Ms. Veselnitskaya several times and protested at one point that she had been charging the government for a $995-a-night room at the Plaza Hotel.Prevezon Holdings, Mr. Katsyv\u2019s company, paid $6 million to resolve the claim without admitting any crime. While the prosecution portrayed the settlement as a victory, Ms. Veselnitskaya told the newspaper Izvestia that it was \u201calmost an apology from the government.\u201dIn recent years, she had become the public face of Moscow\u2019s efforts to reverse international travel and financial sanctions on key Russian figures linked to an alleged $230 million tax fraud.Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed the fraud, was arrested by the same prosecutors who he suggested had organized it. He died in jail in 2009 amid accusations of beatings and medical malpractice.In 2012 Mr. Browder, who had been Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s boss, successfully campaigned for the United States Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, a collection of sanctions naming Russian officials linked to Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s death. An outraged Mr. Putin responded by banning Americans from adopting Russian children.She also attended a congressional committee hearing on American policy toward Russia a day after the screening, taking a front-row seat.\u201cShe has this kind of patriotic thing about her,\u201d said Andrei Nekrasov, the Russian documentary maker who made the film, which critics called inaccurate. \u201cShe does have a tendency to go a bit solemn, if not pompous and say \u2018My country is being attacked\u2019 \u2014 that is her style.\u201dIt was Ms. Veselnitskaya\u2019s desire to get the United States to reverse the Magnitsky Act that prompted her to seek a meeting with the Trump campaign, she said Saturday in written responses to questions from The New York Times. On Tuesday, her office withdrew the promise of an interview.One lawyer who has opposed her in court described her technique as 20 percent law, at which she excelled, and 80 percent acting. She would wave her hands and describe the travails of her victims in emotional terms, the lawyer said, who feared using his name for the safety of his family.Mr. Putin\u2019s government has long been criticized as favoring an elite of loyal and trustworthy insiders who are permitted to manipulate the courts and government agencies to promote their interests \u2014 so long as they toe the Kremlin line. Ms. Veselnitskaya, lawyers and others who have followed her career said, was well versed in this game and wielded its weapons in the mad dash for real estate profits in the Moscow region that often pitted factions of current and former regional officials against one another.In one instance, a small nonprofit, Spravedlivost, that tried to expose corruption in the Moscow region, published a series of articles accusing a group that included Ms. Veselnitskaya, her former husband, Aleksandr Mitusov, and Mr. Katsyv of being corporate raiders who used their clout in the regional government and the courts to seize valuable land.Ms. Veselnitskaya helped bring a defamation suit against the nonprofit and the factory owner who had accused her of grabbing property. The court hit the representatives of Spravedlivost and the factory owner with hefty fines.In 2008, her work with her stepdaughter attracted the attention of Vladimir R. Soloviev, now a well-known talk show host on state-run television.\u201cThey were involved in several very similar and very dubious stories,\u201d Mr. Soloviev wrote in a much-shared blog post about the spread of corporate raiding in Russia. \u201cInternecine strife, strange court decisions, documents that appear from nowhere and, as a rule, all connected with land plots in the Moscow region.\u201dIn another such case, Ms. Veselnitskaya took on Ikea, claiming that some of the land under an office complex owned by the Swedish company on the outskirts of Moscow belonged to an old farming cooperative.It was one of many cases brought against the Swedish giant, and a former board member said they never could figure out who was behind them. This case was ultimately dismissed by the Russian Supreme Court.Mr. Agalarov\u2019s fortune is based partly on giant shopping centers built around Moscow by his Crocus Group, whose work would undoubtedly have brought him into contact with Mr. Katsyv \u2014 and Ms. Veselnitskaya.When a friend wrote that she wished that Yuri Chaika, the Russian state prosecutor, had the same principles as Ms. Yates, Ms. Veselnitskaya objected, accusing the Americans of being corrupt. \u201cIn the United States, politics has long been the most lucrative type of business,\u201d she wrote.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a statement from President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s spokesman. The spokesman said on Monday, not on Tuesday, that Mr. Putin had never heard of Natalia Veselnitskaya.An article on Wednesday about Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. in 2016 to discuss possible compromising material about Democrats, misspelled in one passage the given name of the father of Denis P. Katsyv, whom Ms. Veselnitskaya represented in a money-laundering case. He is Pyotr Katsyv, not Petr.Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko and Lincoln Pigman from Moscow; Kenneth P. Vogel and Sharon LaFraniere from Washington; and Jesse Drucker from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Some Men Don\u2019t Work: Video Games Have Gotten Really Good", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Their LeisureThat\u2019s the logic behind a new working paper released on Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The paper \u2014 by the economists Erik Hurst, Mark Aguiar, Mark Bils and Kerwin Charles \u2014 argues that video games help explain why younger men are working fewer hours.By 2015, American men 31 to 55 were working about 163 fewer hours a year than that same age group did in 2000. Men 21 to 30 were working 203 fewer hours a year. One puzzle is why the working hours for young men fell so much more than those of their older counterparts. The gap between the two groups grew by about 40 hours a year, or a full workweek on average.Other experts have pointed to a host of reasons \u2014 globalization, technological change, the shift to service work \u2014 that employers may not be hiring young men. Instead of looking at why employers don\u2019t want young men, this group of economists considered a different question: Why don\u2019t young men want to work?Mr. Hurst and his colleagues estimate that, since 2004, video games have been responsible for reducing the amount of work that young men do by 15 to 30 hours over the course of a year. Using the recession as a natural experiment, the authors studied how people who suddenly found themselves with extra time spent their leisure hours, then estimated how increases in video game time affected work.The analysis excluded full-time students, and showed that the amount of time young men spent on household chores or child care was not going up.In some ways, the increase in video game time for men makes sense: Median wages for men have been stagnant for decades. Over the same period, the quality of video games has grown significantly. In the 1990s, games like Mario Bros. were little more than eight-bit virtual toys. Today, you and your closest buddies can go on quests in games like World of Warcraft that can last for days.Large, social video games did not become hugely popular until the release of World of Warcraft in late 2004. These games are very different from more rudimentary games like Pong and Space Invaders that older men grew up playing.Experts say that the social aspect is particularly important.\u201cGames provide a sense of waking in the morning with one goal: I\u2019m trying to improve this skill, teammates are counting on me, and my online community is relying on me,\u201d said Jane McGonigal, a video game scholar and game designer. \u201cThere is a routine and daily progress that does a good job at replacing traditional work.\u201dAdam Alter, a professor of marketing and psychology at New York University who studies digital addiction, highlighted the fact that, unlike TV shows or concerts, today\u2019s video games don\u2019t end.Most forms of entertainment have some form of a stopping cue \u2014 signals that remind you that a certain act or episode is ending, like a commercial or a timer. \u201cMany video games don\u2019t have them,\u201d Mr. Alter said. \u201cThey\u2019re built to be endless or have long-range goals that we don\u2019t like to abandon.\u201dThe analysis also did not count activities like using Facebook and Snapchat or browsing the web. Time spent on those activities did not grow as much as time spent on video games.But if we accept the authors\u2019 claim that some segment of men is dropping out of the labor force to play games, is that necessarily a bad thing?Young non-college-educated men \u2014 the group most likely to be home playing games \u2014 are more likely to say that they are happy than similar men a decade ago. Older non-college-educated men are the unhappier ones.According to Mr. Hurst, young men may simply be shuffling around the years in their life that they want to work. \u201cWhy not have a little fun in your 20s and work in your 80s?\u201d he said.Of course, that assumes that young Americans who choose video games over work \u2014 a group for whom there is no historical data \u2014 will be able to find good jobs someday. And that they won\u2019t be seduced by the kinds of games available in 2070.An earlier version of this article misstated an employment status for the video game scholar Jane McGonigal. She is continuing to design video games; she is not a former game designer.Advertisement"}

And Mr. Ryan admittedly has a lot on his plate, so the dress code is unlikely to be a top priority.Still, while he may have seen this as an easy win, electorate-wise, it may prove to be a thornier problem than he was anticipating. Dress code issues have become a cause that resonates far beyond the borders of whatever institution or industry is in question, and one that unites people across political parties and national borders. And sports preferences!And now this.The issue is that definitions of \u201cappropriate dress,\u201d the catchall phrase for what is expected in a professional wardrobe everywhere from Capitol Hill to pro-am golf to \u2014 well, The New York Times \u2014 are so vague and open to interpretation that they have an enormously wide margin of error.After all, what might be \u201cappropriate\u201d at, say, Facebook, at least judging by the favored gray-T-shirts-and-jeans uniform of its chief, Mark Zuckerberg, is probably not appropriate on, say, the House floor.And who is to judge what is appropriate? The individual? The institution? The term is so vague as to raise the possibility that we should get rid of dress codes entirely. Is that the answer?Probably not. But that leaves Mr. Ryan, for example, with the option of specifying exactly what \u201cappropriate\u201d means, down to the garment \u2014 probably another recipe for trouble, as demonstrated by the L.P.G.A. \u2014 or (perhaps easier) specifying what isn\u2019t appropriate (Hawaiian shorts? spaghetti-strap dresses?). Or simply appending adjectives to the definition of \u201cprofessional\u201d in an attempt to clarify it for the 21st century.In any case, it\u2019s a slippery slope.We wish him luck.Advertisement"}

Mr. Abbas spoke at his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah before a leadership meeting.\u201cNow everybody is mobilized,\u201d said Zakaria al-Qaq, a Palestinian professor and expert in national security at Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem. \u201cThis is multidimensional,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEveryone wants to be part of the political equation.\u201dMr. Qaq said he believed that calm could be restored if Israel removed every trace of the new equipment it had installed. But pointing to the volatility of the site and its centrality particularly for the Palestinians of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, he said, \u201cAl Aqsa is the last place left for people to express themselves religiously or politically.\u201dThe true test of where things are going may come on Friday. On regular Fridays tens of thousands of Palestinians from Jerusalem and the West Bank, and Arab citizens of Israel, come to pray at the site.Several other entrances to the site for Muslims remained closed. Refusing to pass through the metal detectors, worshipers took the extraordinary step of praying outside.Immediately after the July 14 attack, Mr. Abbas\u2019s mainstream Fatah party whipped up emotions by calling on Palestinian Muslims via Twitter and Facebook to turn out in large numbers to pray at Al Aqsa in defiance of the Israeli decision to close it, and called the next week for a \u201cDay of Rage.\u201dHours after the Israeli embassy staff, including the security guard, returned home from Jordan, the Israeli security cabinet decided to replace the metal detectors with less obtrusive security measures it said would be introduced over a period of six months.Although all visitors to the nearby Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray, pass through metal detectors, Palestinians considered the detectors outside Al Aqsa as a symbol of Israel asserting its claim to sovereignty there.The Israeli police have not specified exactly what will replace the metal detectors, though Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the police, said it might involve \u201cfacial recognition\u201d equipment.The alleyways of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City already bristle with security cameras.

{"Headline": "Facebook, Seeking to Satisfy Publishers, May Let Them Charge for Articles", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is working on a new tool that could help drive subscriptions to news organizations that publish articles directly on the online service, an effort to improve the fraught relationship between the social giant and media companies.The tool would be added to Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product, which allows publishers to post news articles that can be read within Facebook rather than on the publisher\u2019s website.The discussions about the tool are still in the early stages, according to two people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were not public. But it is possible that Facebook could produce a metered pay wall product similar to those used by some publishers. After reading 10 New York Times articles on Facebook, for instance, a user could be sent to The Times\u2019s subscription sign-up page.Facebook plans to start a pilot with a small group of publishers using the tool in October and to expand the initiative in 2018 if early results are promising. It was not clear which publishers might participate in the test.\u201cWe are in early talks with several news publishers about how we might better support subscription business models on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cAs part of the Facebook Journalism Project, we are taking the time to work closely together with our partners and understand their needs.\u201dWhile nearly all publishers have shifted their attention to increasing digital revenue, most are still seeking profitable solutions that will work in the long term.Although many publishers recognize the importance of online platforms for getting their content in front of broad audiences, there are also drawbacks. Publishers are concerned about losing valuable ties to their readers, particularly subscriber data and payment connections. Readers may also become accustomed to staying in Facebook to consume news, instead of, say, navigating directly to publishers\u2019 sites.At the same time, Facebook has drawn criticism, particularly from publishers, for its role in distributing untrue articles that readers can mistake for real news.It is not clear if Facebook will benefit financially from a news subscription feature. The company does not intend to take a cut of payments to news outlets, according to one of the people familiar with the talks. Facebook indirectly benefits, however, by encouraging people to spend more time on its site; while they are there, those users will see more ads.As more publishers move toward subscription models, a news subscription service like the one Facebook has proposed could work to their advantage by driving more casual readers to pay for news.But it could have risks. If many news outlets participate in the feature, it could create a bundling effect, allowing readers to read potentially hundreds of free articles a month \u2014 10 from The New York Times, 10 from The Washington Post, 10 from The Wall Street Journal, and so on \u2014 before they are asked to pay.An earlier version of this article misidentified the news outlet that first reported Facebook\u2019s plan to introduce a new subscription tool.

{"Headline": "2 Israeli Police Officers Killed in Attack in Old City of Jerusalem", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 In an extraordinarily brazen assault early Friday, three Arab citizens of Israel armed with guns and knives killed two Israeli police officers guarding an entrance to Jerusalem\u2019s holiest site for Jews and Muslims, an emotional and volatile focal point of the Israeli-Arab conflict.Security camera footage showed the armed assailants emerging to attack from within the sacred compound in the Old City of Jerusalem that Jews revere as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. Police officers pursued the assailants, who fled back inside the compound and exchanged fire; all three assailants were killed.The police identified the slain officers as Advanced Staff Sgt. Maj. Hayil Satawi, 30, who was married with a 3-week-old son; and Advanced Staff Sgt. Maj. Kamil Shnaan, 22, the son of a former parliamentarian. Both officers were members of the country\u2019s small Druze community and came from towns in northern Israel.Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, identified the assailants as residents of Umm el-Fahm, a large Arab town in central Israel, near the border with the West Bank: Muhammad Ahmed Jabarin, 29; Muhammad Hamid Jabarin, 19; and Muhammad Ahmed Mufdal Jabarin, 19. It was not immediately known if the three were related, but their names indicated that they belonged to the same large clan.\u201cWe cannot allow for agents of murder, who desecrate the name of God, to drag us into a bloody war, and we will deal with a heavy hand against all the arms of terror, and its perpetrators,\u201d President Reuven Rivlin of Israel said in a statement. \u201cThe state of Israel will defend its sovereignty and its citizens with a strong hand, and will not allow anyone to provoke the region into a bloody war.\u201dThe police announced that they had evacuated and closed the compound, and helicopters circled above the area after the attack.The closing of the holy site is an exceptional and potentially explosive measure; Israeli-imposed restrictions on Muslim entry to the compound have prompted spasms of rioting in Palestinian areas in the past. Previous Israeli measures taken in response to, or to prevent, violence at the site have also strained Israel\u2019s relations with Jordan, a neighbor and crucial ally that retains a special role in administering the site under the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty of 1994.Apparently in an effort to calm the atmosphere, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, telephoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and strongly condemned the attack. He also called on Mr. Netanyahu to reopen the holy site, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said he had told Mr. Abbas that Israel would \u201ctake all the necessary actions to maintain security on the Temple Mount, without changing the status quo,\u201d referring to the delicate arrangements that govern regular access to, and control of, the site.The call came after Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian movement Mr. Abbas leads, called via Twitter and Facebook for Palestinians to turn out in large numbers to pray at Al Aqsa in defiance of the Israeli decision to close it. Those who came prayed in the streets outside the Old City walls.Keenly aware of the sensitivities, the Israeli police described Friday\u2019s events as \u201cextraordinary and extreme,\u201d adding in a statement: \u201cShooting on the Temple Mount is a grave and delicate occurrence, with diplomatic and international significance, and it will be dealt with accordingly.\u201d One of the assailants had tried to flee into a mosque at the site before being shot, the police said.The Old City is in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war and then annexed, a move that was never internationally recognized.The authorities said the site would remain closed to worshipers until the investigation of Friday\u2019s events was completed, and that it was likely to reopen gradually after the weekend. The police said that the assailants had been armed with two improvised automatic weapons, a handgun and at least one knife, and said officers were making sure that other weapons were not being stored at the site.The grand mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, was detained along with another cleric, according to local news reports. Earlier in the day, he told Maan, an independent Palestinian news site, that Israeli forces had prevented him from entering the Aqsa compound at multiple entrances on Friday.\u201cWe insist on reaching Al Aqsa Mosque and performing prayers there,\u201d Sheikh Hussein told Maan. \u201cThe occupation preventing us from praying marks an assault against our right to worship in this pure Islamic mosque.\u201dThe gates around the Old City have been the scene of numerous deadly stabbing and gun attacks, mostly against police officers guarding the historic area, which is also popular with tourists. Dozens of civilians have also been killed in a wave of Palestinian attacks in Jerusalem, the West Bank and cities across Israel since the fall of 2015. Attacks by Arab citizens of Israel, who also identify as Palestinian nationals, have been much rarer.The gateways to the Old City and the entrances to the Aqsa Mosque compound are heavily guarded by Israeli security forces, particularly on Fridays, when thousands of Muslims attend prayers. The attack, which took place soon after 7 a.m., immediately raised questions about security arrangements.The Islamic State militant group took responsibility for the June attack, though that claim could not be confirmed independently and was dismissed by the Israeli security services, who said they found no direct links or communications between the assailants and the group.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should Superstar Athletes Make More Money and Run Their Leagues?", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SportsAs the sports world fell into the early days of its annual summer coma, a series of portentous moments were taking place. At a glance, and taken individually, they looked a lot like the peripheral or back-\u00adoffice goings-on that typically fill the quieter months until football season starts. But by the time Lonzo Ball, the Lakers rookie point guard, whose passing ability is exceeded by only his father\u2019s self-promotional thirst, lit up the N.B.A.\u2019s summer league in Las Vegas in early July, a pattern was emerging. Beyond all the insiderish commentary about N.B.A. free agency and where Gordon Hayward, a borderline All Star, might end up, there was a steady stream of news that seemed to call into question the structure of labor and compensation in American professional sports.It started on the first day of July, when Stephen Curry signed a five-year contract with the Golden State Warriors for just over $200 million. Over the course of Curry\u2019s previous contract, his play and his anodyne charm helped increase the value of the Warriors to $2.6 billion, from a sales price of $450 million in 2010. When news of Curry\u2019s deal came out, LeBron James, who has been the subject of studies on the economic impact a basketball player can have on a city\u2019s economy, tweeted: \u2018\u2018So tell me again why there\u2019s a cap on how much a player should get?? Don\u2019t answer that. Steph should be getting 400M this summer 5 yrs.\u2019\u2019A few days later, Ball walked onto the court of a summer-league game wearing his family-designed, family-marketed Big Baller Brand sneakers. A couple nights after that, former N.B.A. players gathered in Charlotte to play in the BIG3, a three-on-three league, one of whose founders is Ice Cube, that will be crossing the country this summer.Then, in mid-July, Leslie Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets, announced his team was for sale. The write-ups speculating on what the Rockets might fetch (more than a billion, easily) highlighted the fact that Houston had recently traded for Chris Paul, one of the league\u2019s best players. The implication was clear: Paul and his new teammate James Harden, who signed a $169 million contract extension this summer, would be baked into the Rockets\u2019 sales price.While Ball was testing whether his sneakers could hold up to the rigors of an N.B.A. game, Floyd Mayweather, one of the canniest boxers ever, got together with the profane mixed-martial artist Conor McGregor to put on a high-energy, four-city car wreck of a promotion that skidded past pretty much every established standard of taste and competition. In late August, the two men will box each other in Las Vegas, a prize fight so devoid of competitive intrigue that even the most imaginative fight pundits have all but given up trying to figure out how McGregor is even going to lay a glove on Mayweather.Boxing has had more near deaths than Fred Sanford, and after McGregor\u2019s laughable training videos began to leak online \u2014 from a skills perspective, he looks like a Wall Streeter sorting out some rage issues \u2014 it seemed possible for a moment that this bout might finally be the indignity that causes the sport to keel over into its grave. But fights have their own economy, one that relies heavily on personality and self-promotion, and after Mayweather and McGregor finished their tour, it seemed likely that millions would chip in for the $89-to-$99 pay-per-view price to watch the bout, generating what many predict will be a nine-figure payday for Mayweather. Boxing is still the best con going, especially for the top fighters, who get a healthy portion of the gate and broadcast revenue. In what other big-time sport can an athlete reap so much of the money he generates? As recently as 2015, even after boxing has endured all manner of ailments \u2014 rampant corruption, fading superstars, utter indifference from the media \u2014 the two highest-paid athletes in the world were Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, according to Forbes magazine.Mayweather-size paydays might seem impossible in the N.B.A., given that more than a dozen players on each team all need their own paychecks. But back in the 2011 N.B.A. lockout, one prominent player, Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, revealed that some players had discussed starting their own league. A handful of stars went on a barnstorming tour of local gyms and semipro tournaments, which in turn led many to ask why there was any need at all for the N.B.A. But labor eventually made big concessions, and when the games resumed, the players\u2019 share of the money generated by basketball had been cut significantly. The N.B.A. was thriving; franchise valuations were skyrocketing and the league had a stable of young, marketable stars. And yet, thanks to some creative accounting that showed a few teams operating at a loss, the players had to limit what they could earn to ensure the financial health of their billionaire owners. No reasonable answer ever explained this away. But then a new television-rights deal (worth a reported $24 billion) raised the cap, player salaries went up and the talk of alternative basketball leagues fizzled out.Now the expected rises in salary cap have leveled off \u2014 and small but significant grumblings like James\u2019s tweet can be heard. The summer\u2019s basketball developments are, to varying degrees, expressions of athletes\u2019 power. BIG3 and Big Baller Brand might fail, but their very existence shows the possibilities for enterprising pros. We\u2019ve now seen washed-up basketball players in the BIG3 sell 15,000 tickets in the Barclays Center in Brooklyn without a dollar going to the N.B.A. We\u2019ve seen one of the most hyped and well-publicized rookies to enter the N.B.A. play in a shoe that will not contribute a single penny to the profits of Nike or Adidas. Developments like these allow athletes to start thinking more seriously about how they can leverage their influence to change the economics of professional sports.In the past, when players pushed for significant changes in the name of safety, fair compensation or anything else, \u2018\u2018tradition\u2019\u2019 got in the way. The N.F.L. season has to last at least 16 games, because that\u2019s the way it has been for decades. N.B.A. teams have to play on back-to-back nights because that\u2019s the only way to fit in all 82 games, a number set decades ago. Baseball\u2019s drastic restrictions on what a player can make at the start of his career is just part of the sport\u2019s accepted business model; so are unguaranteed contracts in the N.F.L. We accept that players in the N.B.A. and N.F.L. will be drafted and have little say about where they\u2019ll go. We accept that leagues need to protect their owners from their worst spending impulses when it comes to answering the question why some 20-year-old superstar-in-the-making shouldn\u2019t be paid whatever someone will pay him. The N.B.A.\u2019s apparent philosophy is that if salaries were uncapped and the draft replaced by an auction system, average players would suffer because all the money would go to superstars and to exciting, yet ultimately unproven, prospects.We assume that the major sports leagues have to stay in power because we can\u2019t imagine a world without them. And when viewed entirely from a dollars standpoint, it\u2019s hard to get too worked up over whether a team pays James $25 million or $100 million per season. But a new, truly player-driven league could also address other problems dogging the N.B.A.: the interminable regular season that causes players to take entire games off, the dilution of talent over 30 franchises, the ever-changing relationship with its supplier, the N.C.A.A., and the competitive imbalance in which only a handful of teams can contend for a championship.In the six years since the N.B.A. lockout, fans have come to scrutinize players\u2019 tweets, Instagram posts and vacation plans. Every above-average free agent becomes his own three-day news cycle. The league promotes this rabid attention as proof of its strength, but the players\u2019 strength is mighty, too. Almost any reasonable iteration of a new league could work, as long as it has a handful of superstars.Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poland\u2019s President Vetoes 2 Proposed Laws Limiting Courts\u2019 Independence", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Andrzej Duda was a relatively obscure member of the right-wing Law and Justice party when the leader of the party and the most powerful man in the country plucked him from the chorus line to become its candidate for president in 2015. For most of the party\u2019s first 20 months in power, he was a reliable proponent of the governing party\u2019s nationalist initiatives.On Monday, President Duda defied his patron, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and vetoed two bills aimed at placing Polish courts firmly under political control.There were already whispers of growing friction between the two leaders, an apparent schism that reflects a broader divide that has split Poland. The country was once in the vanguard of the democratic change that swept the region after the collapse of Communism. But it has steadily moved toward light authoritarianism and strident nationalism under Law and Justice, which has systematically dismantled much of that progress.Law and Justice officials, seemingly blindsided by the vetoes, retreated to Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s office in the party headquarters to discuss ways forward. In a speech to the nation, Beata Szydlo, the prime minister, defended the legislation and insisted the party would not give up.\u201cThe president\u2019s veto has slowed down the proceedings on reform,\u201d Ms. Szydlo said. \u201cBut we will not back down from the path of repairing the state. We will not give in to pressures.\u201dExactly how the party will proceed \u2014 whether it will seek to overturn the president\u2019s veto, or come up with fresh legislation \u2014 she did not say.Since assuming power, Law and Justice has drawn criticism from European Union officials and political opponents for a series of initiatives that, step by step, have placed formerly independent institutions more firmly under political control. Warnings from Brussels were met with defiance and counterwarnings to stay out of Poland\u2019s domestic politics.Mr. Duda\u2019s move came after several days of dire warnings from the union that passing the laws could result in legal action, even sanctions \u2014 as well as after growing street protests.One of the laws he vetoed would have forced the resignation of all Supreme Court justices, with their replacements to be selected by the justice minister. The other would have given government-appointed members effective veto power in the National Council of the Judiciary, which selects judicial candidates. Both will be sent back to Parliament.Share your views on the European Union\u2019s role in these countries and on how being part of the bloc has affected your life.Parliament has the power to override the vetoes, but doing so would require the agreement of 60 percent of lawmakers \u2014 a threshold that the Law and Justice Party, which has only a thin majority, could not meet without support from other parties.No such partners stepped forward Monday. Pawel Kukiz, a pop star who formed his own political party and was considered the likeliest to side with Law and Justice, posted praise for President Duda on his Facebook page.\u201cWithout the reform of the justice system, there is no possibility of building a just state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bills prepared by the Parliament largely met these goals. However, I couldn\u2019t sign them.\u201dMr. Duda said he was troubled by the provisions that gave the country\u2019s chief prosecutor and justice minister power over the choice of high court justices. He was also upset that the bill was pressed through Parliament without being presented to his office for consultations.\u201cPoland needs reform of the judiciary,\u201d Mr. Duda said, \u201cbut I am a supporter of a wise reform.\u201dA practicing Catholic and former Boy Scout with a cherubic smile and an upbeat demeanor, President Duda, 45, went along with the government\u2019s earlier initiatives, like the one asserting control over the Constitutional Tribunal, which rules on the constitutionality of new legislation and is now dominated by government supporters. Another placed supporters in control of government-owned media.The president came under heavy fire for pardoning a party official whose appeal on abuse of power charges was still working its way through the courts. The official, Mariusz Kaminski, was then put in charge of the country\u2019s secret services.But the latest moves against the courts were apparently a step too far for the president.\u201cI feel that the reform in this shape will not increase the sense of security and justice,\u201d Mr. Duda said at the news conference.Mr. Duda said he would sign a third bill, which reorganizes Poland\u2019s local judiciary. It would give the justice minister the power to select the heads of the local courts and \u2014 in certain cases \u2014 even to direct judges to particular cases. Although protesters and political opponents praised the president\u2019s vetoes, they said they would continue their campaign until the third bill is vetoed as well.The president is a fresher and more telegenic personality than Mr. Kaczynski, now 68, a dour figure who lives alone in north Warsaw and prefers to govern from behind the scenes.Mr. Duda, the son of teachers, was a studious young man in his native Krakow. He earned a law degree at Jagiellonian University in Krakow and joined its faculty, becoming chairman of its administrative law division.In the early 2000s, he was a member of the centrist Freedom Union Party, which supported liberal democratic policies and Western-style free market reforms. But by 2005, when he started his own law firm, his conservatism and Catholicism drew him to Law and Justice, which that year won power in parliamentary elections.He was never a major figure in the party, first acting as a legal adviser, then as a deputy minister in the Justice Ministry and as a legal aide to Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s twin brother, former President Lech Kaczynski, who died in a 2010 plane crash. For a few months, he was the party\u2019s press spokesman. He lost a race for Parliament in 2007, though he got in a few years later, and finished third for mayor of Krakow in 2010.By late 2014, when Mr. Kaczynski chose him as president, Mr. Duda was representing the party in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.As the day dragged on, it became clearer that Mr. Kaczynski and the party\u2019s leaders were genuinely surprised and upset by the president\u2019s move.\u201cI believe this is the beginning of a conflict within the ruling camp,\u201d said Krzysztof Gawkowski, secretary general of the Democratic Left Alliance, a small opposition party. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s hard to say how far Andrzej Duda\u2019s independence will go.\u201dLech Walesa, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who led the Solidarity movement that toppled Communism a quarter-century ago, called the decision \u201cdifficult and courageous.\u201dMr. Walesa, who was the first president after Communism, and who has feuded with Mr. Kaczynski since the 1990s, said he was \u201cpositively surprised,\u201d adding that he believed Mr. Duda was \u201cbeginning to feel like a president.\u201dBut Mr. Walesa called on protesters not to slacken their efforts. \u201cWhat\u2019s comforting is that the nation is waking up, that the youth are waking up,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop protesting!\u201dAt Monday\u2019s news conference, Mr. Duda said he had spent the weekend consulting with analysts, historians, philosophers, legal scholars and others, but was most struck by a discussion he had with Zofia Romaszewska, a veteran anti-communist activist who is a supporter of the government.She \u201ctold me something which struck me most during the weekend,\u201d Mr. Duda said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Mr. President, I lived in a state where the general prosecutor could do virtually anything, and I wouldn\u2019t like to come back to this state.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a lawmaker who said the vetoes should spur \u201cquick reform of the justice system.\u201d He is Stanislaw Tyszka, not Pawel.An article on Tuesday about a decision by President Andrzej Duda of Poland to veto two bills that would have placed his country\u2019s courts under political control translated imprecisely part of the name of the country\u2019s leading opposition party. It is usually rendered in English as Civic Platform, not Civil Platform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s President Sidelines Opponent by Stripping His Citizenship", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Once they were prominent allies in opposing the Kremlin: President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and the former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili. Mr. Saakashvili even went so far as to emigrate to Ukraine to serve as a regional governor under Mr. Poroshenko.But they have now fallen out so badly that on Wednesday, Mr. Poroshenko stripped Mr. Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship, leaving him stateless.He resigned his post and set up an opposition political movement, and in the process badly soured his relations with Mr. Poroshenko. That culminated in the decree Mr. Poroshenko signed on Wednesday.He said the president was risking stirring another popular uprising in Ukraine. And in the ultimate insult for opponents of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Saakashvili suggested that Mr. Poroshenko might have to flee to Russia.\u201cNow, doubtless, you, as was the case with your predecessor, will be tempted to try and hold on to power at any price,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou may try this, just remember, they are waiting for you in Russia! Ukrainians have twice dealt with this pestilence and they will not stop.\u201dMr. Poroshenko\u2019s office did not publish the decree stripping his onetime ally of citizenship, and there was some confusion over the legal basis for the action. Local media quoted officials saying that Mr. Saakashvili had failed to disclose on his citizenship application that he was the subject of a criminal investigation in Georgia.The decree sent ripples through Ukrainian politics. The Georgians who moved to Ukraine to join the government after 2014 have been a powerful force behind the scenes, working to overhaul the country\u2019s bureaucracy. To comply with Ukrainian law on government service, they had to renounce their Georgian citizenship and accept Ukrainian citizenship.The decree sets a precedent that could open the way for the Georgians to be stripped of their citizenship and removed from their positions, stalling the anti-corruption activities.One official in particular appears vulnerable, according to Serhiy Leshchenko, a lawmaker and anticorruption activist: Gizo Uglavy, the deputy director of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine.The bureau, which gained notice last summer when it revealed off-the-books payments to President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, has been locked in a power struggle with the Poroshenko administration.The bureau was created to comply with International Monetary Fund requirements to fight corruption, and the president cannot fire its leaders. But the administration has maneuvered in other ways to curb the bureau\u2019s power, including by removing its jurisdiction over the accounting records showing payments to Mr. Manafort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything You Need to Understand About Trump and Russia", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s where things stand.First, everything is fine because nothing happened between Trump and the Kremlin. And if anything did happen, no one should care and the only people who do are liberals whining about the election results. (Don\u2019t get distracted by the fact that the main person still trying to reargue the vote tally is Trump himself. That\u2019s the kind of thing that liberals toss in to muddy the waters.)Trump and his people never spoke to any Russians, and if they did, they either forgot about it or innocently failed to mention it because it was just normal socializing. And if it wasn\u2019t just socializing, then there was no discussion of the campaign, and if there was discussion of the campaign, it was perfectly appropriate.It is not at all strange for a presidential candidate to get help from the Kremlin to win an election. Who knew that you\u2019re not supposed to sign up Boris Badenov as a campaign adviser? (Or that health care would be hard, or that the president is not supposed to ask the F.B.I. chief to go easy on his friends, or that France is America\u2019s oldest ally?)By now, you should be convinced that there was nothing to investigate about Russia. And if there was, Trump wasn\u2019t being investigated personally.It may seem like Trump picked Jeff Sessions as attorney general at least partly to run interference on the non-investigation of the non-collusion. But move along; there\u2019s nothing to see here either. After all, what\u2019s the point of even having an attorney general if he can\u2019t shut down investigations of your actions?In fact, the president suggested that the crafty Sessions hoodwinked him into giving him the top legal job in the first place. If he had known Sessions would recuse himself on the Russia thing (which didn\u2019t actually happen or Trump didn\u2019t know about), then Trump would never have done that.Got everything so far?In the interview, Trump said Sessions was being \u201cvery unfair to the president,\u201d which surprised the rest of us, who thought Senator Jeff had been basically the biggest toady around. (Chris Christie gave him a run for the money before the New Jersey governor slunk away from presidential politics so he could spend more time with his family on beaches he had closed to the public.)Trump told The Times peevishly that Sessions\u2019 recusal stuck him \u201cwith a second man,\u201d Rod Rosenstein, adding helpfully that the second man is called \u201ca deputy.\u201d Then he claimed Sessions hardly knew Rosenstein, who Trump said derisively was \u201cfrom Baltimore.\u201dThat\u2019s a Democratic city, explained Trump, who is from New York, a Democratic city.Despite the visible tire treads on his body from the wheels of the Trump bus, Sessions said Thursday that he will stay on as long as it\u2019s appropriate. To whom? The president already thinks it\u2019s not appropriate and has vaguely threatened to fire more people if the probe goes into his personal finances, which it kind of has to.I don\u2019t think Sessions should have been made attorney general \u2014 for other reasons. But he should stay on and let Trump fire him. Of course, if Trump does that, then his soldiers of disinformation will probably explain that, well, gee, the president didn\u2019t know you\u2019re not supposed to do that.It\u2019s truly disturbing how often we hear that lame spin from this White House: Trump and his team are not evil or criminal or corrupt. They are merely ignorant and poorly informed and innocent of Washington\u2019s arcane ways. That is why they have trouble making moral judgments that most children could make.Advertisement"}
