{"Headline": "The Austen Legacy: Why and How We Love Her, What She Loved", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionEvery few years, I reread a Jane Austen novel, and I\u2019m not alone, according to \u201cAmong the Janeites,\u201d Deborah Yaffe\u2019s playful exploration of Austen obsession. In fact, if I were a true Janeite, I\u2019d be handstitching my empire-waisted gown and perfecting my country dancing, and I\u2019d enjoy it, as Yaffe does when she decides to go all out for a Jane Austen Society of North America (Jasna) convention. What I might not enjoy are the members\u2019 competing opinions about who Jane was and what she would be thinking about every little issue, personal and political. And the Janeites are not all women: Yaffe interviews quite a few men. Perhaps the most peculiar is Arnie Perlstein, a conspiracy theorist convinced that Austen buried in her apparently conventional novels a \u201cradical critique of 19th-century patriarchy\u201d that he has \u201cspent more than 15,000 completely uncompensated hours devising.\u201d Other Janeites don\u2019t need compensation. Among the most fascinating is Sandy Lerner, one of the founders of Cisco Systems who, along with her boyfriend-then-husband-now-ex-husband, gave you the router that allows you to sit up in bed and read this review on your computer screen. After Lerner sold her stake in Cisco, she bought and refurbished Chawton House, where Jane\u2019s brother Edward Austen Knight lived, and where (in the nearby village of Chawton) Jane herself spent the last eight years of her life. Lerner then installed a large library of women\u2019s literature written between 1600 and 1830 in Chawton House and opened it for study by students and scholars.Yaffe\u2019s tone is light but precise. Her \u201cjourney through the world of Jane Austen fandom\u201d is amusing and sometimes mind-boggling. Every avid devotee has her or his very own Jane, whether secretly abused or coolly observant or a revolutionary in disguise. One fan Yaffe meets is the scholar Devoney Looser, author of \u201cThe Making of Jane Austen.\u201d Looser goes to Jasna conferences and participates in Janeite projects, but what she\u2019s really interested in is how the Jane Austen whose books were first published simply as \u201cby a Lady\u201d became the ubiquitous cultural presence she is today.Looser begins by asserting that \u201cshe was not born, but rather became, Jane Austen,\u201d which might have been a surprise to the Lady, given the self-confident wit and psychological perceptiveness of her novels. What Looser is actually after is what has led to Janeite-ism. To this end, she offers a good survey of the landscape of books in the 19th century: how they were presented to buyers and readers, how they were illustrated, which authors were popular and why. If the chapters on illustrators suffer, it\u2019s only because Looser gives us too few examples to view. (She does point out that for much of the 19th century Austen\u2019s characters were portrayed by illustrators as contemporaries of their readers; it wasn\u2019t until roughly 70 years after Austen\u2019s death that the characters depicted in the novels began wearing Regency gowns.)The first few chapters of \u201cThe Making of Jane Austen\u201d plod forward in their perhaps necessary way, but the second half, where Looser discusses the various groups that attached themselves to Austen\u2019s works and saw themselves in Austen\u2019s works, especially at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, is energetic and revealing. On the one hand, the members of traditional London men\u2019s clubs adored Austen because they felt that they alone had the discernment to appreciate her (conservative) politics and literary nuance. On the other, suffragists, both overt and covert, claimed her as their own. Looser writes particularly vividly of a huge demonstration on a hot and windy day in June 1908 when 1,000 marchers, part of a crowd of 10,000, carried heavy silk banners bearing the names of important women (among the authors were not only Jane Austen but Mary Wollstonecraft and Elizabeth Barrett Browning) on their way to the Royal Albert Hall. Looser also discusses how academia has treated Austen and how her novels have been taught in schools, partly by means of textbooks that have excerpted, cut and manipulated her work. One of Looser\u2019s most amusing illustrations is from the October 1971 issue of National Lampoon (\u201cJane Austen. Isn\u2019t that the kind of cupcake they used to sell at the A.&P.?\u201d), which makes fun of those who have avoided English literature courses.But it\u2019s Paula Byrne\u2019s \u201cThe Genius of Jane Austen\u201d that gives us the most insightful analysis of the making of the Austen legacy. Byrne\u2019s investigation into Austen\u2019s enjoyment of plays during a period when theater was both popular and lucrative and when playwrights and actors were questioning and mocking social norms (especially those dictating male/female relationships) gives us real insight into how Austen learned to focus her material, make it amusing and give it critical punch. Byrne\u2019s knowledge of Austen\u2019s life and letters, of her family connections (her older brother Henry\u2019s \u201cunflagging interest in the theater\u201d gave her many opportunities to go to plays because he lived in London), allows Byrne to portray an engaged and active literary artist, looking for ways to shape her material, carefully choosing her settings and subjects. At the same time, Byrne demonstrates her own ample knowledge of the history of the English theater. The illustrations she has included are colorful and instructive \u2014 I especially like the etching of Robert Elliston, Austen\u2019s favorite comic actor, who doesn\u2019t look anything like Colin Firth.The Austen novel I chose this year was \u201cEmma.\u201d Thanks to Paula Byrne, I now readily see that the amusement Austen is giving me (and herself) in the rambling, self-serving monologues of Mrs. Elton, the deceptive interactions of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and the playful upending of class-based snobbery in Emma herself was inspired by plays Austen knew well and techniques she saw on the stage. Austen was in her late 30s when she was writing \u201cEmma,\u201d her fourth published novel, about the same age as Alice Munro when she was pulling together the stories in \u201cLives of Girls and Women,\u201d or Virginia Woolf when she was composing \u201cJacob\u2019s Room.\u201d Janeite that I am, I can only wish Austen had lived long enough to write 12 more works of fiction, like Munro, or at least six more, like Woolf.Jane Smiley\u2019s most recent book is \u201cGolden Age,\u201d the third volume of the Last Hundred Years trilogy.Advertisement"}
