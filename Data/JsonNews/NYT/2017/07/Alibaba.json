{"Headline": "U.S. and Chinese Executives to Meet on Nations\u2019 Economic Relations", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeaders of major United States companies with deep ties to China will meet on Tuesday with their Chinese counterparts to try to ease the increasingly rocky economic relationship between the countries.On Tuesday, Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce, will host a daylong meeting in Washington with more than 20 business leaders from the United States and China. The session will be brokered by Jack Ma, the executive chairman of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of the private-equity firm the Blackstone Group and an adviser to President Trump.The goal is a frank discussion of the issues that trouble economic relations between the countries. Topics are expected to include the customs hurdles facing Chinese companies that sell goods to the United States and the exportation of American natural gas products to China. Participants are to produce a list of suggestions for officials of the two governments to consider.The meeting will be held a day before a separately scheduled economic policy discussion between the United States and Chinese governments on Wednesday. Tuesday\u2019s meeting is largely a private-sector event, and United States and Chinese officials have no obligation to act on its conclusions, the organizers said.A Commerce Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.The American participants are expected to include a dozen chief executives, among them Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jim Umpleby of Caterpillar, Doug McMillon of Wal-Mart Stores, Mary T. Barra of General Motors, and Ryan Lance of ConocoPhillips. The Chinese executives are expected to include Tian Guoli, chairman of the Bank of China, and Ning Gaoning, also known as Frank Ning, chairman of the state-owned oil company Sinochem.Tuesday\u2019s meeting is occurring at a sensitive time for the Trump administration and the business community. American business leaders and policy makers have long been frustrated by China\u2019s stance on a host of issues, including widespread Chinese theft of intellectual property, the United States\u2019 huge trade deficit with China, and the heavy government subsidies enjoyed by many Chinese companies. Aware of the resentment, Mr. Trump and Mr. Ross have moved to rewrite American regulations involving the two countries. Among other things, they are considering tariffs on imported metals while promising to revise unfavorable trade deals.In a telephone interview late Monday, Mr. Schwarzman said the gathering was organized at the behest of Mr. Ma of Alibaba.\u201cHe thought it would be a really excellent idea if we got the two business communities together in a small group, where we can have open and honest discussions about the friction that happens in the trade area on a practical basis,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said. \u201cThe objective is to share observations of the different companies and have more general discussion on what each of these companies thinks needs to change.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Ma did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Given the ill will between many American businesses and the Chinese, some people doubted that the meeting on Tuesday would lead to meaningful progress.\u201cThe consensus American view is, China has a lot of bad trade practices that we need to fix,\u201d said Derek Scissors, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on Asia. Given that Blackstone and Alibaba have strong business interests in China, Mr. Scissors added, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get that out of a Schwarzman-Ma meeting.\u201dStill, the talk is occurring when executives in the United States are increasingly unhappy over the lack of progress by the administration and Congress on domestic issues like infrastructure and taxes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New S.E.C. Chairman Pledges to Look After Ordinary Investors", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the new Securities and Exchange Commission chairman offered few specific policy recommendations in his roughly 25-minute speech, beyond calling for the creation of an advisory board to review transparency in the bond market and a continued crackdown on stock swindles.The nomination of Mr. Clayton, a former Sullivan & Cromwell partner, by President Trump to be chairman of the S.E.C. drew criticism from many Democrats on Capitol Hill and investor advocates because his legal experience largely has come from representing big corporate clients.Critics said Mr. Clayton\u2019s professional experience doing corporate work for big Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs Group and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, might cause him to put the interests of corporate America before those of ordinary investors.But in a lunchtime speech to the Economic Club of New York at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Clayton, who is known as Jay, tried to balance his concern for investor protection with reducing regulatory burdens that deter private companies from going public.\u201cInvestors should know the S.E.C. is looking out for them,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.\u201cWe need to be mindful of international issues,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cWe should be doing what we can to fight corruption.\u201dThe S.E.C. chairman opened his remarks with an approving nod to his predecessor, Mary Jo White, who, like Mr. Clayton, had come to the commission from a large law firm, in Ms. White\u2019s case, Debevoise & Plimpton. But Ms. White also had a law enforcement background, having previously served as the United States attorney in Manhattan.Mr. Clayton noted that Ms. White\u2019s last public speech as S.E.C. chairwoman also was before the Economic Club of New York. And he said he agreed with Ms. White\u2019s assessment in that speech that the agency \u201cis today a stronger protector of investors than ever before.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Clayton outlined a number of principles that he said would guide his stewardship of the agency. One of those principles, he said, is a commitment to protect the \u201clong-term interests of the Main Street investor.\u201d He also said he does not see the need for \u201cwholesale changes to the commission\u2019s fundamental regulatory approach.\u201dThe agency, however, needs to \u201chave a realistic vision for how rules will be implemented\u201d and should listen to investors and others to determine if rules and regulations are working as intended, he said.Several times during his remarks he referred to ordinary investors as \u201cMr. and Ms. 401(k),\u201d a recognition that the bulk of the savings Americans have stowed away rests in corporate 401(k) investment plans as opposed to traditional corporate pension plans.Mr. Clayton said an important focus of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement effort would be rooting out \u201cfraud and shady practices\u201d that especially target ordinary investors.He did return to a theme that has been a talking point since he was nominated \u2014 steps the commission can take to encourage more companies to go public.In some cases, he said, \u201cincreased disclosure and other burdens\u201d may be contributing to companies deciding to remain private as opposed to filing for initial public offerings.\u201cI have been vocal about my desire to enhance the ability of every American to participate in investment opportunities, including through the public markets,\u201d Mr. Clayton said. \u201cI also want American businesses to be able to raise the money they need to grow and create jobs.\u201dOrdinary investors should not be shut out from participating in the capital formation of the country\u2019s growing companies, he said.With more Americans retiring, Mr. Clayton said there needed to be more focus on transparency in the bond market and the relative safety of those securities as opposed to stocks. He said this is necessary as older investors tend to allocate more money to bonds and other fixed-income products in order to reduce market risk.Mr. Clayton said he was looking into creating a Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee to review issues involving the sale and marketing of bonds to retail investors.\u201cAs waves of baby boomers retire every month and need investment options, fixed income products, which are viewed as a stable place to store hard-earned money, will attract more and more Main Street investors,\u201d he said. \u201cYet, many of those investors may not appreciate that fixed income products are part of markets that differ significantly from the better-known equities markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many are unsure, however, about diving headfirst into online retail, because China\u2019s favorite way to shop is also an industry better known for piracy and dusty deliverymen than for shine and polish.To court the luxury market, companies like Alibaba and JD.com are using their vast customer base to offer upscale retailers support on issues like digital marketing, pricing, customer services and, in the case of Mr. Tang, delivery.\u201cThe most difficult thing to overcome is the experience for the shoppers,\u201d said Xia Ding, president of JD.com\u2019s fashion division. \u201cBut because we own the logistics we are really able to deliver luxury goods in a way that makes shoppers feel like they are getting the same special experience as they get offline.\u201dAt about the same time, the Chinese government also stepped up efforts to crack down on daigou shoppers, increasing checks at airports and lowering duties on some luxury goods imported through official channels.As a result, brands have seen a shift in luxury shopping habits, with more and more Chinese consumers now choosing to buy at home rather than abroad. This so-called reshoring has caught the attention of Chinese e-commerce companies, causing major players like Alibaba and JD.com, as well as smaller luxury-focused companies like Secoo and Xiu, to invest aggressively in the luxury sphere.\u201cMass market brands already know that there is no choice but to be on these e-commerce platforms,\u201d said Liz Flora of L2, a market research company based in New York. \u201cSo luxury is really the next frontier for these e-tailers. You can see the competition getting more and more fierce.\u201dBut so far, China\u2019s e-commerce companies have struggled to persuade top international luxury brands to sell on their platforms. Luxury companies have long been concerned that with e-commerce, it would be impossible to replicate the gilded, perfectly curated in-store shopping experience. Brands also worry about their products being sold next to counterfeit and gray-market items \u2014 an issue that Alibaba in particular has struggled with in the past.Still, there is no ignoring the reality that Chinese consumers love shopping online. Chinese shoppers spent $758 billion online last year \u2014 more than the United States and Britain combined, according to official data, buying everything from toilet paper to luxury cars.Some brands have already made the leap. Burberry in particular has led the push into e-commerce in China, opening a flagship store on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform. Others, like the Hong Kong jeweler Chow Tai Fook and the Swiss watch brand Tag Heuer, have stores on JD.com.To appeal to brands, e-commerce companies offer to increase efforts to crack down on counterfeits.\u201cOne of our goals was to clean up the e-commerce market so we could ensure that anyone who bought online was buying a real Tag Heuer,\u201d said Leo Poon, general manager of Tag Heuer in greater China. \u201cSo far it\u2019s been working and we\u2019re seeing sales picking up.\u201dBut for more high-end luxury brands, increasing the anti-counterfeit effort is not enough.\u201cLuxury brands are control freaks,\u201d Mr. Bonhomme of CuriosityChina said. \u201cThey want complete control over everything.\u201dFor now, some luxury brands are opting to create their own e-commerce websites to sell directly to consumers. Many, like Cartier and Bulgari, have also begun partnerships with Tencent\u2019s popular WeChat mobile messaging service to create online stores, flash sales, and marketing campaigns featuring major Chinese influencers.Ultimately, e-commerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com are hoping that the allure of their vast consumer base will be too difficult for luxury brands to resist. Shiny add-on features like the white-glove delivery service may make swallowing the e-commerce pill a little easier for the brands.On a recent morning, Mr. Tang, the courier, pulled out of a JD.com warehouse on the outskirts of Beijing with a single delivery box in tow. Three-wheeled delivery carts whizzed past as he drove calmly toward the city\u2019s central business district.After waiting for the customer for nearly two hours, Mr. Tang stepped out of the car, pulled on his signature gloves and headed out to deliver the package.\u201cWow, I wasn\u2019t expecting this service at all,\u201d Yan Luxia, 30, said as she received the box and took out a designer Italian leather handbag.Ms. Yan, who manages a dating service in Beijing, later said the premium delivery service had been a very \u201csatisfying\u201d experience.\u201cBut to be honest,\u201d she added, \u201cconsumers care more about the authenticity of the product.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Urban China, Cash Is Rapidly Becoming Obsolete", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 There is an audacious economic phenomenon happening in China.It has nothing to do with debt, infrastructure spending or the other major economic topics du jour. It has to do with cash \u2014 specifically, how China is systematically and rapidly doing away with paper money and coins.Almost everyone in major Chinese cities is using a smartphone to pay for just about everything. At restaurants, a waiter will ask if you want to use WeChat or Alipay \u2014 the two smartphone payment options \u2014 before bringing up cash as a third, remote possibility.Just as startling is how quickly the transition has happened. Only three years ago there would be no question at all, because everyone was still using cash.\u201cFrom a tech standpoint, this is probably one of the single most important innovations that has happened first in China, and at the moment it\u2019s only in China,\u201d said Richard Lim, managing director of venture capital firm GSR Ventures.Even so, the attendant cultural shift was graspable only in person. I recently moved to Shanghai and felt the change with cash acutely because my first few weeks in the metropolis of more than 20 million were spent cut out of the system. Because of an issue with my bank, I couldn\u2019t immediately link my account to WeChat, which has become a virtual wallet for so many.That meant I had to navigate China the way I would have three years ago: with a stack of red 100-renminbi notes.At coffee shops and restaurants, I held up lines as I fumbled out my wallet and peeled off the bills to give the cashier. If I was hungry I had to go outside and find a restaurant, while bowls of noodles, groceries and coffee materialized at our office, ordered by my colleagues and paid for on the phone. If I had to get somewhere, I couldn\u2019t use my phone to unlock one of the ubiquitous bicycles that are a part of China\u2019s bike-sharing craze.Even the buskers were apparently ahead of me. Enterprising musicians playing on the streets of a number of Chinese cities have put up boards with QR codes so that passers-by can simply transfer them tips directly.\u201cIt has become the default way of life now,\u201d said Shiv Putcha,\u00a0an analyst with the research firm IDC. \u201cLiterally every business and brand in China is plugged into this ecosystem.\u201dSome Scandinavian countries have also weaned themselves from cash but still use cards frequently. In China, the change has been to phones.\u00a0One friend didn\u2019t realize how reliant she had become on mobile payments until her bank called her. She had left her A.T.M. card in the machine three weeks earlier and had not noticed its absence.In practical terms, this means Tencent and Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, the two Chinese internet companies that run WeChat and Alipay, respectively, are sitting atop a gold mine of staggering proportions. Both companies can make money off the transactions, charge other companies to use their payment platforms and all the while collect the payments data to be used in everything from new credit systems to advertising.Mr. Lim said that according to recent data, Ant Financial and Tencent were set to surpass credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in total global\u00a0transactions per day in the coming year. The key is that both companies are able to provide payments on the cheap,\u00a0partly\u00a0by allowing smaller vendors to make use of a simple printout of a QR code or their phone, instead of an expensive card reader. A back-end system that stores\u00a0a record of user accounts, instead of having to communicate with a bank, also keeps costs down.While Tencent does not break out what it makes from mobile payments, in the fourth quarter of 2016 the \u201cother services\u201d item in its earnings almost tripled from a year earlier to 6.4 billion renminbi, or $940 million, driven largely by mobile payments.There are some potential future problems with China\u2019s sweeping embrace of online payments. As the country builds its entire consumer economy around two private smartphone payment platforms, it is slowly locking out people unable to get onto those networks, and locking itself into those companies.At the simplest level, that makes life difficult for tourists and business travelers who are unlikely to open a bank account in China and so will find it hard to turn their phones into wallets.More broadly, it means things could get harder for foreign and local businesses alike. Foreign companies hoping to sell to Chinese consumers now must deal with Alibaba and Tencent or risk being unable to take payments. Likewise, Chinese companies reliant on Alibaba and Tencent have to build out separate structures to deal with the world of Facebook, Google and credit cards that still dominate elsewhere.There is a corollary for what could happen here. In Japan in the early 2000s, flip phones could do everything from stream cable TV to pay at stores. But because the phones were so advanced, Japan was slow to adopt smartphones, and it went from tech giant to tech laggard in 15 years.No doubt aware of this, Alibaba and Tencent are pushing to expand beyond China to ensure their newest innovation doesn\u2019t go the way of the dinosaurs. Still, competition is most likely looming.\u201cThe million-dollar question is: Will Western firms decide to build a system and compete?\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cThe answer is probably yes.\u201dUntil then, new arrivals like me have to deal with being locked out of China\u2019s online payments infrastructure.Earlier this month, though, I lucked out using cash. As I was trying to get a pile of stuff from Ikea back to my new apartment, a cabdriver looked skeptically at the huge rolled-up mattress pad I was planning to load into the back of his car.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take you,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI can only take cash.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I have,\u201d I said to my fellow Luddite, who grumpily agreed to ferry me home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Refugee Boats\u2019 and African Capitalism", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Until a few days ago, you could order \u201crefugee boats\u201d from Alibaba, the enormous Chinese e-marketplace. The Chinese-made rubber boats, available for a couple of hundred dollars, had \u201cgood capacity of anti-sinking,\u201d the item\u2019s order page claimed, even if \u201cthe boat is filled fully with water.\u201dSummer is here, and it\u2019s once again high season for North African human traffickers, who send tens of thousands of migrants a year across the Mediterranean to Europe \u2014 in boats very different from those found on Alibaba. Scores of them sink, killing thousands every year.At least 2,300 migrants have drowned in the first half of 2017, and the number of crossings is increasing. During the last week of June alone, more than 10,000 migrants from Africa reached Italy, bringing the total so far up to around 100,000, according to the International Organization for Migration. Amnesty International fears that 2017 will become \u201cthe deadliest year for the deadliest migration route in the world.\u201dUnable to reach a comprehensive solution, the European Union has taken to piecemeal steps, like an agreement last week to clamp down on the export of inflatable boats and marine motors to Libya \u2014 hence their disappearance from Alibaba.The union\u2019s boat ban is laughable, given the root causes behind the surge of south-north migration: war, unemployment, social unrest, terror, religious oppression, all worsened by Africa\u2019s skyrocketing birthrates. Youth unemployment already stands at around 50 percent. With an average age of 18 years and a population set to double by 2050, the continent needs roughly 20 million new jobs each year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Europe, though, has a proclivity to blame the wrong things. Especially for the left, the root causes of Africa\u2019s problems include Western exploitation, unfair trade and capitalism itself \u2014 a diversion of attention that is welcomed by corrupt African governments, many of which have figured out how to profit off their people\u2019s endless misery.In fact, Africa does not need less capitalism, but more.Of course Europe has a historical debt to Africa, and it has a practical interest in helping the continent through aid and a generous migration policy. But unless the prevailing mentalities on both sides \u2014 guilt in Europe and victimhood in Africa \u2014 change, the 60-year chain of disappointments known as \u201cdevelopment aid\u201d will continue.The main reason Africa is doing so poorly is that many of its leaders are unable or unwilling to provide the fundaments of a market economy: education, property rights, rule of law, reliable tax schemes, a proper banking sector.Take Egypt. European diplomats in Cairo recently told me they feared the country was on the brink of collapse. Its population (92 million, crammed in an inhabitable space the size of the Netherlands) is growing by 2.5 million a year, while energy and water are in short supply and food prices are rising. Only 74 percent of its citizens are literate, and the country needs an extra 90,000 teachers just to keep up with the population growth.Corruption and legal uncertainty make for a hostile business climate. Many women marry young and become pregnant before they even think about contraception, a medical aid worker in the Egyptian countryside told me. Things are made worse by an inheritance law and a culture that privileges male offspring, he said: \u201cA family that has three daughters naturally wants a son next.\u201dAn African farmer who can neither read nor own land will not be able to get a loan to buy a tractor, and without a tractor he\u2019ll never be able to become an exporter. European protectionism, or the impositions of Western market liberalism generally, are a very secondary problem.In their impressive book \u201cWhy Nations Fail,\u201d the economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson pinned down the crucial difference between European/Northern American and African/Latin American societies: The former have built inclusive institutions that reward initiative and performance, whereas the latter cling to extractive institutions that rob people of the fruits of their labor.\u201cLeaders of African nations that have languished over the last half-century under insecure property rights and economic institutions, impoverishing much of their populations,\u201d they write, \u201cdid so because they could get away with it and enrich themselves at the expense of the rest.\u201d Africa\u2019s political systems, in other words, often don\u2019t produce the basic prerequisite of productivity: the incentives to make a country prosperous.That\u2019s why development aid has often been as effective as pouring water into a bucket riddled with holes.In the best-case scenario, this approach will move Europe away from its own addiction to development aid as a moral salve and an easy solution to a complex problem. Whether Germany can actually make it happen \u2014 can actually rally its fellow union states behind a free-market, investment-led approach \u2014 is hard to predict. But even if it fails, it still shows that at least some people in Europe know they need to change.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Believing the Fed \u2014 for Now", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho are you going to believe, the Fed or your own eyes?But so far there is little evidence that Wall Street is worried. Despite the occasional swoon in technology stocks and the persistent decline in energy issues, the market continued to rise through the second quarter. The SPDR S.&P. 500 Trust, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, returned 3.1 percent for the period, including dividends.But the bond market did not completely ignore the erosion in economic data. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent and were as low as 2.1 percent in the last week of June.Investment advisers express concern about the worsening economic readings, but are willing, for the moment, to accept the Fed\u2019s contention that they represent a dip in an otherwise robust expansion. They warn, however, that if the weakness lingers, it may be time to start believing their own eyes and lighten up on stocks.The interest rate increases are not \u201cnegative or problematic yet,\u201d said Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer of multi-asset class investing at Neuberger Berman. But \u201cif economic growth and inflation continue to come in very soft and potentially roll over, it\u2019s possible that the Fed will engage in a policy mistake.\u201dA widely followed, continually updated forecast of national economic output from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta declined to 2.6 percent annual growth for the second quarter from an earlier 4.3 percent outlook around the beginning of May. That is after a meager 1.4 percent annualized growth announced for the first quarter.In another sign that the economy is flagging, demand for credit has moderated. After increasing at more than 7 percent a year in 2014 and 2015, the rate slipped to 6.5 percent last year and just 2.6 percent in April, according to the Fed.The yield curve has flattened, meaning long-term bond yields have fallen as short-term rates have risen. An inverted yield curve, in which short rates are higher than long rates, often heralds a recession.Meta indicators like the Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which compares economic readings with forecasts, went from its highest level in more than three years, recorded in mid-March, to a six-year low around the end of June.Investors are facing \u201ca little bit of a mixed message\u201d from the hawkish Fed and the feeble economic indicators, said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Sextant International Fund. Stocks have remained strong, in his view, because investors are choosing to believe messages coming from Washington, and not just from the Fed.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of hope in the marketplace, in particular hope for reforms from the federal government\u201d to overhaul the tax code and spend big money upgrading the nation\u2019s infrastructure, Mr. Klimo said. He cautioned that investors had become conspicuously complacent, but then added that \u201cabsent some external shock, it does seem as though things can cruise along for a little bit\u201d in the stock market.He envisions biotechnology and other health care stocks cruising along better than most, as effective ways to overhaul the provision of medical care continue to elude policy makers. The right blockbuster drugs can enrich the companies that make them while saving lives at lower cost than other treatments. Cancer drugs developed by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb are notably promising, he said.Health care was among the strongest groups of stock funds in the second quarter, with the average portfolio up 6.5 percent, according to Morningstar. Industrials and natural resources were notably weak. As well as the health funds did, they managed on average to trail the 7 percent return of Health Care Select Sector SPDR, a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector.The average domestic stock fund over all was up 2.7 percent in the period. Bond funds rose 1.4 percent.International stock funds beat their domestic counterparts handily. The average one gained 5.6 percent, led by portfolios that invest in Europe, China and India.Given their concerns about valuations and economic growth, it\u2019s no surprise that investment advisers are looking abroad for opportunities. Mr. Klimo is a fan of Chinese internet stocks, like Tencent and Alibaba. Like many investors, he is unenthusiastic about oil, he said.Tim Guinness, chief investment officer of Guinness Atkinson Funds, also likes stocks in China and the region around it.\u201cThe cheapest part of the world is the Far East\u201d excluding Japan, he said. \u201cChina is making a good transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.\u201dMr. Guinness foresees China following the same path of development that Japan did from 1970 to 1990, an excellent time to own Japanese stocks.\u201cWe\u2019re increasing our weightings significantly to the Far East and reducing them to the U.S.,\u201d he said.He is wary of American stocks because he finds them expensive. He has no concern about the Fed raising rates during a period of iffy economic growth.\u201cThe time is well past for stopping quantitative easing and increasing interest rates,\u201d Mr. Guinness said. Quantitative easing is the program of asset purchases that the Fed used to shore up the economy after the financial crisis. The Fed is expected soon to start disposing of the assets it bought, another source of worry for many investors.Mr. Guinness cited a number of largely overlooked difficulties resulting from extremely low rates. Low rates limit the earnings of banks, forcing them to be overly cautious in their lending. Low bond returns limit returns for savers and force companies to add more cash to their pension plans, reducing capital investment.\u201cYou\u2019ll be amazed that interest rates going up will be good for markets, not bad,\u201d he said.Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, maintains a bullish outlook on the stock market and a glass-half-full view of the economy. The yield curve may be flattening, but at least it\u2019s not inverted. As for the Citi surprise index, he finds it to be a volatile indicator that often bounces back quickly from plunges like the recent one as economists adjust their expectations after the data disappoints them.\u201cI think the economy is still performing pretty much the way it has been since 2010,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. The modest growth in the first quarter, the most recent one for which a figure has been released, \u201cseems slow, but you\u2019ve got slower growth in the labor force.\u201dThe number of people available to work is not expanding as much as it used to, limiting economic growth. He noted that the meager growth rate had been enough to keep unemployment below 5 percent. That should allow the Fed to nudge short-term interest rates to 2 percent next year, he predicted, from about 1 percent after the June increase, and give the central bank ammunition if the economy begins to stall.One benefit of the modest pace of growth is that even with so few out of work, Mr. Yardeni said, inflation remains low. Consumer prices rose just 1.6 percent in the 12 months through June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the unemployment rate was only 4.4 percent. For May, the Atlanta Fed recorded national wage inflation of 3.4 percent.\u201cAs long as inflation remains subdued, and as long as we don\u2019t have a recession, bonds and stocks should continue to work,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, wonders how long low inflation will continue to support the markets. He warned in a note to investors that inflation is a risk, despite the tepid economic growth.Wage growth has been tame, but with few suitable people left to hire for companies that need to expand to meet consumer demand, it could flare up, he said. Productivity growth, often a way to keep a lid on prices, has been low after years of modest capital investment, he added.\u201cInvestors should prepare for both wage and consumer price inflation to rise between 3 and 4 percent in the next couple years,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThis does not imply a recession is looming or a bear market for stocks is imminent,\u201d but \u201cit implies a major investor mind-set change.\u201dEven with inflation quiescent, the rich valuations and a so-so, or worse, economy make even some bulls less than enthusiastic about stocks.\u201cIf someone came into a lot of money and asked what to do with it, they have my condolences,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. \u201cEverything has been picked over.\u201d He added, though, that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee any particular reasons to get out of stocks or bonds at this point.\u201dHe encouraged investors to stick with stocks that have healthy dividend yields, and he prefers technology as a rare source of growth these days and energy stocks as \u201ca good contrary bet.\u201d He would also give emerging markets a chance. But not all of them.\u201cIndia stands out, China does not,\u201d he said, disagreeing with Mr. Guinness.Mr. Knutzen at Neuberger Berman recommended Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which are Treasury notes and bonds that rise in value if inflation goes up, and debt issued in emerging economies. He has been reducing exposure to stocks of large American companies and investing more in smaller companies and overseas markets where valuations are lower.\u201cWe have become more cautious in our views,\u201d Mr. Knutzen said. The economic backdrop provides \u201can O.K. environment for stocks, but there\u2019s not much margin for error.\u201dAdvertisement"}
