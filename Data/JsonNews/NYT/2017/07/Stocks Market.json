{"Headline": "BlackRock Earnings Rise 9 Percent, Buoyed by Passive Funds", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, said on Monday that second-quarter earnings had risen 9 percent as investors continued to pour money into the company\u2019s expanding fleet of exchange traded funds.The company, which oversees $5.7 trillion in assets, received $94 billion in net investor money during the quarter, with $74 billion of that amount flowing into the company\u2019s iShares-branded exchange traded funds.BlackRock now manages $1.5 trillion in exchange traded funds, passive investment vehicles that track a wide variety of indexes and investment strategies.Indeed, as BlackRock cements its place as the industry leader in terms of E.T.F.s \u2014 with the index giant Vanguard entrenched in second place \u2014 Mr. Fink will remain under pressure to ensure that its other activities, from managing bonds to to its struggling stock-picking division, keep pace with the surging passive business.\u201cThis was one of our best quarters ever,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe had strong flows, our fees are up and we are continuing to build deeper and broader relations with our clients.\u201dIn explaining the rush of money into E.T.F.s, Mr. Fink emphasized that now, more than ever, the job for financial firms is to provide solutions-driven advice as opposed to merely pushing a client into a certain fund.\u201cClients are looking for outcomes \u2014 they are not looking for products anymore,\u201d he said.Generally one to take a cautionary view toward the markets, Mr. Fink said that the broader investment environment was rapidly improving \u2014 thanks to a turnaround in Europe, consistent growth coming out of China and an improving United States economy.But he pointed out that equity markets were becoming increasingly expensive and would need to see a good batch of earnings this quarter as well as progress in Washington to remain at current levels.\u201cThe price-to-earnings multiples are very high,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will need to see validation in earnings, and I hope we see progress on tax reform and infrastructure, too.\u201dMore than ever, Mr. Fink is positioning BlackRock to focus on such systematic investment strategies as basic index funds, E.T.F.s and blended strategies like smart beta and factors that target investment themes like momentum and low volatility.The common theme: low costs and reliance on machines as opposed to experts making bets on stocks.As of the end of the second quarter, BlackRock managed $3.7 trillion in passive investment money and $1.6 trillion in active strategies.Reflecting the buoyancy in the markets in the second quarter, BlackRock said that $51.8 billion flowed into equity E.T.F.s and $21 billion was directed toward bond E.T.F.s \u2014 an area of increasing focus for the firm.During a time when bond markets have been less liquid than in the past, institutional investors are increasingly using E.T.F.s to make big bets in emerging markets and high-yield sectors.For the quarter, BlackRock earned $857 million, or $5.22 a share, up from $789 million, or $4.73 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Profits Fall Far Short of Expectations, but Investors Shrug", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy day\u2019s end, Mr. Bezos had not returned the favor, with Amazon reporting profits that were less than a third of what Wall Street had expected.No matter. It was still the kind of performance that investors have come to expect from Mr. Bezos and Amazon: a 25 percent increase in sales and example after example of how the company is pouring money into original video programming, warehouses and shaping the future with new technology and products like its Echo family of gadgets.The company\u2019s stock fell only about 3 percent in after-hours trading.The relative indifference to Amazon\u2019s bottom line was another sign of why the company is so frightening to competitors and critics. Investors would almost certainly have pummeled any other retailer that turned in the kind of performance that Amazon reported Thursday. Instead, they give Amazon several miles of leash because of its history of turning investments into sales growth and technology leadership.\u201cYes, we are continuing to invest and stepping up investments,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with reporters, repeating a variation on a theme that company executives have expressed many times before.For a short time on Thursday, Forbes estimated Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth at $90.6 billion, compared with $90 billion for Bill Gates, a philanthropist and a co-founder of Microsoft, moving Mr. Bezos to the No. 1 spot for the first time.By the end of the day, Mr. Bezos had dropped back to No. 2.For the second quarter, ending June 30, Amazon said its net income was $197 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, in the same period a year earlier.Analysts had expected a decline in profits, but not one that big. The average earnings estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was $1.42 a share. Mr. Olsavsky said the company\u2019s operating income, a different measure of profits, was within the range of possibilities it had previously shared with investors.Mr. Olsavsky did not play down the fact that Amazon had found ways to invest in the growth of its business. The company\u2019s revenue increased 25 percent, to $38 billion from $30.4 billion a year ago. That made analysts happy. Their average revenue estimate was $37.2 billion.Since the Whole Foods deal was announced, several members of Congress have raised concerns about its potential impact, expressing fears that it could accelerate consolidation in the food industry, eliminate jobs at brick-and-mortar retailers and further limit the availability of grocery stores in already underserved areas.\u201cI would be very surprised if this deal had really substantive problems with the F.T.C.,\u201d Mr. Keeley said, referring to the Federal Trade Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201dFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201dEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201dAt least they hope not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mind-Boggling Ascent of Amazon and Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesAmazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are having a moment.Yet noteworthy as these real-world achievements are, they may understate Amazon\u2019s importance. Despite an earnings report on Thursday evening that disappointed the market and led to a 2.5 percent decline in its share price, Amazon is remarkable as a purely financial entity. Its stature as one of the most successful companies in the history of the stock market is already assured. In fact, the numbers show that since 1997, when it became a publicly traded company, Amazon has evolved into one of the century\u2019s greatest wealth-generating machines.When I first spoke with Professor Bessembinder in May, he had prepared a list of the 30 greatest wealth creators in the stock market through 2015. But this past week, he showed me a Lifetime Wealth Creation list, with fresh rankings through 2016. The stocks at the very top remained the same: Exxon Mobil, followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM.But further down the list, Amazon appears for the first time. It is ranked 14th, just behind such august names as Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble and ahead of Coca-Cola and DuPont.In essence, the list shows which stocks have been the most profitable for shareholders over history. A very small group \u2014 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks \u2014 account for all of the stock market\u2019s net gains from 1926 through 2016, he found. And only 30 stocks \u2014 Amazon is now one of them \u2014 account for more than 30 percent of all of the market\u2019s wealth creation in that 90-year period.What\u2019s more, Professor Bessembinder found that Amazon\u2019s annualized return through 2016 was 37.4 percent, the highest of all the top 30 wealth creators. That is partly because Amazon hasn\u2019t existed for that long: It\u2019s easier to sustain fast growth for shorter periods. Exxon, for example, which has created more than $1 trillion in wealth for shareholders since 1926, more than any other company, ground out its gains at a slower pace: It has an annualized return of only 11.9 percent, Professor Bessembinder said.Even after the earnings blip on Thursday, Amazon\u2019s value in the market has skyrocketed this year. It has risen more than 36 percent. \u201cIf it holds onto those gains, we can expect that it will climb higher on the cumulative wealth creation list,\u201d he said.Of course, while Amazon\u2019s market power has been wonderful for its own investors, it has damaged many of its competitors \u2014 diminishing the wealth of shareholders of those companies.Consider how Amazon\u2019s cumulative stock returns dwarf those of its retail competitors and the overall market. Using Thomson Reuters data, I calculated that over the last 15 years through Tuesday, Amazon returned more than 8,200 percent, compared with 125 percent for Walmart, 2.2 percent for Sears, and 302 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, dividends included.If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 \u2014 and had held onto your shares \u2014 that money would be worth $83,000 today.By comparison, $1,000 invested in the entire Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends, would amount to $4,100 \u2014 not a bad performance, until you look at the gaudy Amazon returns. Far worse, if you had put the money in Walmart shares, your investment would be worth only $2,250. And if you had stuck with Sears during all of its travails, you would be almost where you started, with $1,022.Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm, has another way of comparing Amazon\u2019s stock returns with those of its retail competitors. It has built the Death by Amazon Index, which it describes as \u201ca way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com.\u201d Those companies \u2014 there are now 54 of them \u2014 include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart.The numbers are stark. The Death by Amazon Index has declined 18.9 percent through Monday \u2014 trailing Amazon by almost 55 percentage points.Unlike Mr. Gates, who has diversified his portfolio and has been giving money to charity at a rapid pace, Mr. Bezos continues to bet heavily on Amazon. As Thursday\u2019s earnings report showed, that does entail risk. The company\u2019s ever-expanding retail operations are sapping its profits, but it has been raking in earnings through cloud computing. As has been the case since Amazon\u2019s inception, it pays no dividends, instead plowing cash back into the company\u2019s core.For now, the mighty Amazon wealth-creation machine continues to roar. Whatever happens next, this is already one of the great tales in the history of capitalism.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

For decades, there have been fitful negotiations between Washington and Brussels on trade liberalization, but they have always run up against the protectionism of France and some southern European states.Between Britain and America, there are few such problems. Each country is the other\u2019s biggest investor: About a million Americans work for British-owned companies, and a similar number of Britons work for American-owned companies. A liberal trade deal, based on mutual recognition of standards and qualifications, will bolster both economies.Prime Minister Theresa May keeps saying she wants Britain to be a \u201cglobal leader in free trade.\u201d In parallel to the talks with Washington, Britain is starting discussions with China, Japan, India, Australia and others. Global trade deals should supplement rather than replace Britain\u2019s economic relationship with the remaining 27 European Union states. The nonmember Switzerland, for example, exports nearly five times as much per head as Britain does, mostly to the European Union, while simultaneously having bilateral trade deals around the world.I\u2019ve learned in politics that almost no one listens to the other side.

Canadians have a type of federation on their doorstep that they decline to join, but with which they enjoy the closest possible diplomatic, military and economic ties.

{"Headline": "William McNabb, Chief Executive of Fund Giant Vanguard, to Step Down", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRiding a surge in popularity for index and exchange traded funds that passively track a wide variety of indexes at low costs for investors, Vanguard\u2019s assets under management have soared to more than $4.4 trillion from $1 trillion seven years ago.Mr. McNabb will be succeeded by Tim Buckley, 48, Vanguard\u2019s chief investment officer. Mr. McNabb, 60, will remain chairman of the board. The change will become effective on Jan. 1, 2018. Mr. Buckley will be the fourth chief executive of Vanguard since its founding in 1975.Vanguard has one of the more tightly knit cultures in corporate America, with just about all the firm\u2019s senior leaders having worked at corporate headquarters in Malvern, Pa., for decades.Starting with its founder, John C. Bogle, Vanguard executives have been bound by a nearly religious belief that, over the long term, a passive investing style produces superior returns compared with trying to outsmart the market by picking individual stocks.Having been in the top job for just 10 years, a period that may have been the most successful in Vanguard\u2019s history, Mr. McNabb\u2019s departure will certainly strike some in the industry as being abrupt.In an interview on Thursday, he acknowledged as much, saying that when he informed the Vanguard board 12 months ago about his decision, some members asked, why now. But in making his case, he argued that Vanguard\u2019s bench of like-minded thinkers was deep enough to allow him to step aside.\u201cIt has never been about me personally \u2014 it is about the team,\u201d Mr. McNabb said in an interview. \u2018It has been about building upon the principles that Mr. Bogle laid out. I have also observed that bringing a fresh perspective is a very valuable thing. I think Tim is well positioned to take over.\u201dThe move highlights the self-denying spirit at the firm, where big egos and flashy personalities are frowned upon.Unlike its peers, Vanguard is owned by its funds \u2014 and ultimately its investors \u2014 so as money rushes in, expenses are persistently reduced, resulting in perpetual savings for the legions of Vanguard clients.This idea of working for investors, as opposed to shareholders, has become dogma, so much so that the firm has been criticized in some quarters for not investing enough to keep up with the trillions of new dollars rushing in.Mr. Buckley, like his predecessor, is a culture carrier and has a lean intensity that can be seen in many of the firm\u2019s top leaders, not least Mr. McNabb.\u201cThis place gets in your blood,\u201d said Mr. Buckley, who has been Vanguard\u2019s chief investment officer since 2013. \u201cThe opportunity to serve our clients well \u2014 that is what keeps us here. It is an awesome responsibility.\u201dMr. Buckley joined Vanguard in 1991 as an assistant to Mr. Bogle, and he said that he has never considered leaving the firm.Still, as all of Wall Street is struggling to grapple with Vanguard\u2019s growth and its dominance in passive investing, Mr. McNabb\u2019s decision could be seen as a pre-emptive strike of sorts to lock in a new generation of leadership at the firm.Also promoted on Thursday was Greg Davis, who oversaw the firm\u2019s fixed income division. Mr. Davis, 46, will succeed Mr. Buckley as chief investment officer when he takes formal control early next year.Vanguard also said on Thursday that two new directors were joining its board, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy secretary at the United States Treasury and Deanna Mulligan, the chief executive of the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.Mr. McNabb joined Vanguard in 1986 and became chief executive in 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis. He replaced Jack Brennan, who at 53 was also fairly young to be a departing chief executive.As Mr. McNabb will do for Mr. Buckley, Mr. Brennan remained chairman (until 2010), offering guidance to his successor. Mr. McNabb said that was extremely helpful.\u201cThis is an organic process,\u201d Mr. McNabb said. \u201cI just turned 30 for the second time, and I think 10 years is a good period of time. Tim is well prepared and will take us to tremendous levels \u2014 now is as good a time as any.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Profits by Putting Investors in the Slow Lane", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWall Street has developed a new way, clouded in obscurity, to fleece the hundreds of millions of Americans who have money invested in company pension plans, mutual funds and insurance policies.Institutional brokers are legally obliged to execute trades on the exchange that offers the most favorable terms for their clients, including the best price and likelihood of executing the trade. The 12 exchanges, most of which are owned by New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Better Alternative Trade System (BATS), along with the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Investors Exchange (IEX), are supposed to compete to offer the best opportunities.But that\u2019s not what is happening. Instead, brokers routinely take kickbacks, euphemistically referred to as \u201crebates,\u201d for routing orders to a particular exchange. As a result, the brokers produce worse outcomes for their institutional investor clients \u2014 and therefore, for individual pension beneficiaries, mutual fund investors and insurance policy holders \u2014 and ill-gotten gains for the brokers.Although the harm suffered on each trade is minuscule \u2014 fractions of a cent per share \u2014 the aggregate kickbacks amount to billions of dollars a year. The diffuse harm to individuals and the concentrated benefit to Wall Street create yet another way in which the system is rigged, justifiably eroding public confidence in the fairness of the financial system.This is how it works: The likelihood of executing a trade at the best price depends on the length of the queue to buy or sell and the incentives to trade. Longer queues lead to longer delays to execute a trade. Delays typically lead to worse outcomes. Quite simply, it makes no sense to wait on a longer line to receive a worse execution.And yet, brokers choose longer queues hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of times a day. Publicly available trade and quote data show that the queues to buy or sell stock are considerably longer on exchanges that offer kickbacks. Even though the queues decrease the likelihood of getting a trade completed and impair the price performance after the trade is executed, brokers still direct trades to these places because of the kickbacks they receive.One exchange, the IEX, refuses to pay rebates. Created by Brad Katsuyama (whose odyssey to defy the ethos of Wall Street was told in Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cFlash Boys\u201d), IEX has a speed bump that prevents high-frequency traders from front-running ordinary investors. (Yale University, where we work, has a de minimis exposure to IEX through an investment by one of the university\u2019s external managers.)Since opening on Aug. 19, 2016, IEX has delivered on its promise of better execution. Consider data on effective spread, which measures an exchange\u2019s ability to provide trade executions at attractive prices. A lower effective spread is good for investors, since the gap between what buyers pay and what sellers receive is smaller.BATS (a rival stock exchange founded by a high-frequency trader) posts data on this measure of execution quality for the major exchanges on its website. According to our calculations, in the six months before IEX\u2019s arrival, Nasdaq led the effective spread rankings in the widely used Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, with the number of top ranks ranging from 169 to 216 stocks.In September 2016, IEX\u2019s first full month of operation, the exchange crushed its rivals, offering the best effective spread for 412 of the S.&P. 500\u2019s stocks. In the ensuing months, IEX\u2019s dominance increased, with the exchange displaying the lowest effective spread for 497 of the stocks in the S&P 500 in May 2017 and for 500 stocks in June 2017. (In June, the S&P 500 actually contained 505 stocks.)The added cost to investors trading on other exchanges is stunning. On average, the competing exchanges have effective spreads 96 percent higher than IEX\u2019s for stocks in the S.&P. 500, with the premium ranging from 80 percent to 158 percent on the exchanges for which BATS provided data.The obvious question in light of IEX\u2019s superior execution quality is why the exchange has a market share of just over 2 percent. One reason seems obvious: Unlike the other exchanges with greater market share, IEX does not pay broker kickbacks. (BATS and the New York Exchange have each recently converted one of their exchanges to a kickback-free model.)Elimination of kickbacks would elevate the integrity and quality of America\u2019s securities markets, improving executions for real investors and restoring a sense of fairness. Since kickbacks result in worse trade execution, brokers that route client orders for kickbacks violate their duty of best execution.Senator Mark Warner, a member of a Senate subcommittee on banking and investment, recognizes the conflict created by the practice of paying rebates. On July 14, Senator Warner wrote to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton urging the full elimination of rebates to \u201cincrease price transparency, reduce fragmentation, strengthen stability, and bring U.S. equity markets\u201d closer to the competitive mandate.Maybe it\u2019s time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to start enforcing its own best-execution rule.Jonathan Macey is a professor at Yale Law School.

{"Headline": "Mysterious Document Is Latest Blow for Dalian Wanda", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 A mysterious document circulating on Chinese social media purported that regulators had warned state-run banks against financing several overseas deals by the conglomerate, Dalian Wanda Group. Then a credit-rating agency expressed skepticism about the company\u2019s debt.The market reaction was swift on Monday, with shares and debt issued by several subsidiaries of Wanda falling sharply.The mounting pressure on Wanda reflects the challenges facing large Chinese companies that borrowed heavily to finance their breathtaking growth over the last few years.The mysterious document that went viral, before being blocked by Chinese censors, appeared to be a cellphone photo of the first page of an internal document from the Agricultural Bank of China. The document described two supposed meetings about Dalian Wanda, one involving a National Development and Reform Commission official, Zheng Chiping, and the other with China Banking Regulatory Commission officials.The bank, the document said, was told by regulators that it was forbidden to lend to six of Wanda\u2019s overseas acquisitions even if those ventures ran into difficulty raising money abroad. The regulators, the document said, also told the bank that it could not help the overseas projects with foreign currency or financial registrations.The reform commission and the Agricultural Bank of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wanda declined to comment.At least two projects listed in the document fall under Wanda\u2019s AMC Entertainment: its deals to acquire Carmike Cinemas and the Nordic Cinema Group deal. It is unclear to what extent AMC, as an American company, needs financing from Chinese banks \u2014 although controversy in China about the creditworthiness of AMC\u2019s corporate parent could make non-Chinese lenders more wary as well.To investors, it did not matter whether the document was authentic or regulators\u2019 warnings were real: In this shaky environment, company stocks and bonds are proving volatile.Shares in Wanda Hotel Development Company fell 5.8 percent in trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Softening Ticket Sales Are Drawing Hollywood\u2019s Focus", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 All year, Hollywood executives have been brushing aside worries about box-office stagnation in the United States and Canada by pointing to strong ticket sales in China.Ticket sales for imported films in China are up 34 percent this year, to roughly $2.3 billion, according to the Beijing research firm EntGroup. Look at Paramount\u2019s \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight.\u201d That sequel managed only $45 million in its opening weekend in North America, but it took in $120 million in China.On closer look, however, the rosy picture doesn\u2019t quite hold up, underscoring why Hollywood has recently been pushing so hard for film-related concessions from the Chinese government.New data from comScore, a Virginia-based analytics firm, indicates that Hollywood is having a tough time in China. From Jan. 1 to June 30, Chinese cinemas played 24 movies from Hollywood, generating $1.76 billion in ticket sales. In the same period a year earlier, the country let in 22 Hollywood movies, which collected about $1.73 billion.So as they scratch for growth, studios like 20th Century Fox and Universal have been scrambling to position themselves as bigger players in China, where the number of movie screens has increased to more than 40,600 from 12,407 in 2012. The accounting firm PwC recently estimated that China would have roughly 80,377 screens by 2021 \u2014 double the number in the United States.But analysts say studios are facing systemic challenges in the country, including a slowing overall economy. Chinese moviegoers are also growing more discerning; film quality is increasingly important. Movie theaters in China may also be hurt as streaming services proliferate. More than 80 million people in the country now pay to watch video online, a 32 percent increase from last year, according to Analysys, a Beijing research firm.American movie executives are also pushing for shorter blackout periods, which China uses to promote local films, and longer marketing windows; under the current setup, Hollywood studios are given only about a month to mount advertising campaigns for their movies.\u201cThat\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d Mr. Rosen said, referring to more advance notice. (China controls the release dates.)Hollywood also wants to receive a bigger portion of ticket sales. Studios receive about 50 percent of box-office revenue in the United States, but China allows foreign companies to receive only a 25 percent cut. Studios have asked for closer to 40 percent.Mr. Rosen said negotiations over revised film terms, taking place between Chinese officials and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, could drag into next year. He noted that the Communist Party\u2019s 19th Party Congress will take place in Beijing in the fall.\u201cI would be very, very surprised if anything was in place related to Hollywood before that,\u201d Mr. Rosen said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Struggles to Navigate the Markets", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWho cares about a few bad weeks in fixed-income markets?Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, raised that reasonable question last week. The answer is Lloyd C. Blankfein at the rival Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, which on Tuesday reported a 40 percent year-on-year slump in revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. Goldman\u2019s market compass is a little off, and investors may soon expect Mr. Blankfein to fix it more quickly.The quarter to June was the second in a row in which Goldman, the $90 billion financial company, has been out-traded by its peers. While others warned that the period would not be as good as a year earlier \u2014 basically because fewer freaky things happened in the market \u2014 JPMorgan and Citigroup reported revenue shrinkage in their equivalent divisions less than half as severe as Goldman\u2019s.They may be less exposed to commodities or benefit more from steady corporate business rather than hedge funds. And swings in markets can have a bigger impact on Goldman because it lacks a large commercial banking business. Last quarter, the firm\u2019s dire fixed-income performance was offset by strong equities trading and a $1.2 billion slug of revenue from equity investments that Goldman holds on its own book.Over time, the firm\u2019s exposure to volatile fixed-income trading will become more muted. In the most recent quarter F.I.C.C., as it\u2019s known, made up around 15 percent of net revenue, against 24 percent in the second quarter of 2016.Mr. Blankfein\u2019s push into retail banking is still in its infancy, but the 20 percent-plus returns on equity that other consumer lenders manage \u2014 more than twice what Goldman reported last quarter \u2014 suggest that is a promising new direction.Targeting less flighty corporate clients and longer-term asset managers may also muffle some of the noise, though that will take time, too. Of course, that will also dampen Goldman\u2019s traditionally unmatched ability to ping back significantly when markets do.That ping-back potential \u2014 referred to in analyst-speak as operating leverage \u2014 is a big part of Goldman\u2019s investment appeal. It helps explain why the bank trades at 1.1 times its estimated book value a year from now, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.The implication is that investors believe Goldman can push its return on equity well into double digits. As Mr. Dimon at JPMorgan suggested, a few bad trading weeks needn\u2019t change their minds. But a couple more uninspiring quarters might.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve received many emails and comments recently from people who have money to invest. They even know how it should be invested. But they just can\u2019t get themselves to put the money into the stock market.Why are they scared? Many of them cite the fact that markets are at record highs and the endless stream of uncertainty in the news.Feel that way yourself? Well guess what: You don\u2019t have to invest the money. Really, it\u2019s true!Funny, but even as I type these words, I feel a sense of relief. I gave myself this same advice awhile back when I noticed how worried I was about my investments.You see, I hate losing money in investments that are outside my control. It ties me up in knots and distracts me from just about everything. So awhile ago, when I moved some money out of a 401(k) plan into my retirement account after a job change, I left it in cash.I told myself that I was fine with missing out if the market continued to go up. But I wasn\u2019t fine with investing this pile of cash just in time to get my head taken off in a big, scary market drop. And guess what? That was and still is true. So, I\u2019m fine sitting in cash earning 0.16 percent or whatever the rate might be. I just don\u2019t want to lose.This decision has cost me in paper gains that I might have achieved, given how well the stock market has done since that decision, but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t see it as a real cost. Instead, I see it as an investment in my sanity and my human capital.The fact that I didn\u2019t have to worry about losing money in that area of my life allowed me to feel comfortable taking risks in other areas. I\u2019ve started two or three new businesses and moved my family to New Zealand. The risks I have taken have provided, and will continue to provide, a much higher return than what I might have received if I remained fully invested in the markets.I know what you\u2019re thinking, but this not a sneaky way to engage in market timing, where one states with great confidence what the markets will do next and invests (or not) accordingly. Instead, this is about taking comfort in less risk (and living with less potential reward) in one area while taking more risk in another. Having a pile of low-risk investments offers ballast to an otherwise risky life.Of course, each individual needs to take a complete and careful look at the total financial picture. You need to weigh when and where you take risks. But along the way, don\u2019t be afraid to make the moves that make it easier to take the risks that don\u2019t fit neatly into a spreadsheet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New S.E.C. Chairman Pledges to Look After Ordinary Investors", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the new Securities and Exchange Commission chairman offered few specific policy recommendations in his roughly 25-minute speech, beyond calling for the creation of an advisory board to review transparency in the bond market and a continued crackdown on stock swindles.The nomination of Mr. Clayton, a former Sullivan & Cromwell partner, by President Trump to be chairman of the S.E.C. drew criticism from many Democrats on Capitol Hill and investor advocates because his legal experience largely has come from representing big corporate clients.Critics said Mr. Clayton\u2019s professional experience doing corporate work for big Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs Group and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, might cause him to put the interests of corporate America before those of ordinary investors.But in a lunchtime speech to the Economic Club of New York at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Clayton, who is known as Jay, tried to balance his concern for investor protection with reducing regulatory burdens that deter private companies from going public.\u201cInvestors should know the S.E.C. is looking out for them,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.\u201cWe need to be mindful of international issues,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cWe should be doing what we can to fight corruption.\u201dThe S.E.C. chairman opened his remarks with an approving nod to his predecessor, Mary Jo White, who, like Mr. Clayton, had come to the commission from a large law firm, in Ms. White\u2019s case, Debevoise & Plimpton. But Ms. White also had a law enforcement background, having previously served as the United States attorney in Manhattan.Mr. Clayton noted that Ms. White\u2019s last public speech as S.E.C. chairwoman also was before the Economic Club of New York. And he said he agreed with Ms. White\u2019s assessment in that speech that the agency \u201cis today a stronger protector of investors than ever before.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Clayton outlined a number of principles that he said would guide his stewardship of the agency. One of those principles, he said, is a commitment to protect the \u201clong-term interests of the Main Street investor.\u201d He also said he does not see the need for \u201cwholesale changes to the commission\u2019s fundamental regulatory approach.\u201dThe agency, however, needs to \u201chave a realistic vision for how rules will be implemented\u201d and should listen to investors and others to determine if rules and regulations are working as intended, he said.Several times during his remarks he referred to ordinary investors as \u201cMr. and Ms. 401(k),\u201d a recognition that the bulk of the savings Americans have stowed away rests in corporate 401(k) investment plans as opposed to traditional corporate pension plans.Mr. Clayton said an important focus of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement effort would be rooting out \u201cfraud and shady practices\u201d that especially target ordinary investors.He did return to a theme that has been a talking point since he was nominated \u2014 steps the commission can take to encourage more companies to go public.In some cases, he said, \u201cincreased disclosure and other burdens\u201d may be contributing to companies deciding to remain private as opposed to filing for initial public offerings.\u201cI have been vocal about my desire to enhance the ability of every American to participate in investment opportunities, including through the public markets,\u201d Mr. Clayton said. \u201cI also want American businesses to be able to raise the money they need to grow and create jobs.\u201dOrdinary investors should not be shut out from participating in the capital formation of the country\u2019s growing companies, he said.With more Americans retiring, Mr. Clayton said there needed to be more focus on transparency in the bond market and the relative safety of those securities as opposed to stocks. He said this is necessary as older investors tend to allocate more money to bonds and other fixed-income products in order to reduce market risk.Mr. Clayton said he was looking into creating a Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee to review issues involving the sale and marketing of bonds to retail investors.\u201cAs waves of baby boomers retire every month and need investment options, fixed income products, which are viewed as a stable place to store hard-earned money, will attract more and more Main Street investors,\u201d he said. \u201cYet, many of those investors may not appreciate that fixed income products are part of markets that differ significantly from the better-known equities markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Confidential I.P.O. Filings Work, if They Stay Confidential", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewTaking a company public is no walk in the park, and one of the first moves by the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has been to try to lighten the regulatory burdens associated with a public offering.The lightening is a good idea, provided the agency can keep quiet about what it learns.The burdens of a public offering include complicated and lengthy disclosures via the registration statement, which the commission reviews, often carefully, before permitting a public listing.If companies make mistakes in their registration statements, lawsuits are likely and liability is strict.Congress has tried to lighten the load. In the 2012 Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups, or JOBS, Act, it permitted companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue to submit their draft registration statements to the agency for a confidential review.The idea was that companies could get the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission without public agony. In a nonconfidential filing, investors can view the registration statement as soon as the company has filed it and can view the back-and-forth between the agency and the company. Sometimes, the agency requests changes in the registration statement, which can be embarrassing for the company, as well as its lawyers and bankers.A confidential filing might also appeal to companies because it allows them to have more control over the timing of the public offering announcement, often thought to be important to the success of the offering.Now the Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it will extend the opportunity for a confidential review to all companies, not just relatively small ones.Moreover, the right to confidential review will apply not just to an initial public offering, but also to any other securities offerings made in the first year after the company goes public.\u201cBy expanding a popular JOBS Act benefit to all companies, we hope that the next American success story will look to our public markets when they need access to affordable capital,\u201d said Walter J. Clayton, the commission chairman.It is a different perspective for the agency, which is usually thought to work like a police officer on the beat. Sitting down with prospective issuers and going through their draft offerings is more collaborative, especially if it is done confidentially.The confidential offering is a good idea, with one caveat.The public offering process has become so technical that any effort to reduce its burdens should be applauded.It does, however, add another layer of people to the already large number who are working on a public offering.In addition to the executives at the company working on the offering, outside lawyers and bankers will also be involved. Now, commission employees will know about pending offerings before investors find out.It is not easy to capitalize on this knowledge, but people certainly have traded on government information before.The possibility that insider trading will occur does not mean the policy is a bad idea. But it does suggest that the commission will have to be vigilant in ensuring that its confidential reviews stay confidential.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Juries, Lawyers Now Favor the Uninformed", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "Jury selection in Martin Shkreli\u2019s trial followed the growing tendency to cut not only jurors who have an opinion, but also those who know anything about a case.Supported byJudge Kiyo A. Matsumoto turned to a young woman who works in accounting and asked if she had read or heard anything about the case. Just that morning, a court officer had confiscated a juror\u2019s copy of The New York Post with the case on the cover.\u201cOh, no, never,\u201d the woman said.\u201cOh, very good,\u201d Judge Matsumoto responded.The next day, after lawyers and the judge had dismissed more than 300 jurors in all, the woman made it onto the jury as an alternate.Jury selections today have moved beyond seeking the unbiased to favoring the uninformed.Dismissing potential jurors who might favor either the prosecution or the defense has long been a tenet of the American jury system; the right to an impartial jury is guaranteed by the Constitution.But now, perhaps in a sign of a polarized age, lawyers from both sides appear increasingly to be concerned that opinions mean inflexibility. They are looking for jurors who not only have no viewpoints on the case, but also little exposure to the subject matter, who don\u2019t follow the news, haven\u2019t traveled to the places discussed at trial and have pastimes as innocuous as possible.One juror at a Manhattan federal trial this year was dismissed by prosecutors who explained they were concerned about his spending his leisure time being \u201ca First Amendment advocate.\u201d \u201cEveryone in this courtroom is a First Amendment advocate, including the United States, I would hope,\u201d a defense lawyer shot back.A possible result: Jurors without the expertise to analyze specialized evidence may instead use lawyers\u2019 storylines, or their own feelings about a defendant, to decide a case.\u201cThe problem is, anybody who knows enough about the case runs the risk of being dangerous for one or both sides,\u201d said Leslie Ellis, a director at the trial consulting firm DecisionQuest. \u201cYou usually cannot ask them questions to get at how deep their knowledge on this runs, or will they get everything right when they\u2019re in deliberations.\u201cOne side or the other will strike them because they don\u2019t want anybody in the jury room who can override their witnesses, and become a bigger influence than the witnesses.\u201dYet when Judge Matsumoto asked about 45 potential jurors \u2014 who had already been weeded from a much larger group \u2014 whether any owned stocks, only five or so raised their hands. (More than half of Americans own stocks.) Few said they knew about major financial entities like the banking giant UBS, or the Securities and Exchange Commission.A similar pattern has appeared in the jury makeup for a range of cases.Donald L. Blankenship, a former chief executive of Massey Energy Company, was charged with covering up safety violations, leading to an explosion that killed 29 coal miners in 2010. The deaths and the charges were highly publicized, especially in West Virginia, the trial\u2019s location.Still, one seated juror said during the jury selection that the case was \u201csomething about embezzling\u201d or \u201cmaybe something about safety.\u201d Another, who said she only knew there was \u201csome kind of explosion or something,\u201d explained she was \u201creally not in the mood to listen to the news.\u201d She was also chosen.The jury selection in a recent terrorism case in Federal District Court in Manhattan also suggested that prosecutors were striking people who had been favorably exposed to Muslims or the Middle East.In jury selection, a judge may excuse a juror for hardship, like a work conflict, or for cause, like bias. After those jurors are dismissed, lawyers from each side get a certain number of peremptory strikes, where they cut people who they think will not support their side. The number of permitted challenges varies depending on the type of case and the court.The trial in Manhattan was of an Arizona man who, prosecutors said, assisted a New York college student in joining the Islamic State by helping coordinate his travel through Turkey to Syria.A potential juror who took part in an exchange program in Turkey and had visited there? Cut by the prosecution.A journalist who had gone to Egypt, whose sister had worked in Syria, and who had lots of friends who had visited Turkey? Cut by the prosecution.A Manhattan musician whose wife worked at the United Nations and who told the judge his wife\u2019s colleagues had \u201copened my mind to the Muslim world\u201d? Cut by the prosecution.When a defense lawyer, Daniel Habib, asked the government to explain its strikes, prosecutors said the exchange-program man\u2019s \u201cprior experience\u201d could \u201cseep into his deliberations\u201d; the journalist was \u201ctoo enthusiastic\u201d; and the United Nations spouse had talked \u201cin a loud manner.\u201dLeft in the jury were people who, for the most part, had expressed few opinions about or experiences with the Middle East or Muslims.In a recent insider trading case in San Francisco, lawyers struck several jurors with financial experience, including one who\u2019d worked in venture capital and said, \u201cYou kind of see how the sausage is made.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t always a plus to know little.John H. Langbein, professor emeritus of law and legal history at Yale, said in a 2015 speech that this setup was premised on the societal arrangements of the time, where villagers collectively made their towns run. As time went on, \u201cresponding to the growing reality that the jurors were ceasing to have knowledge of the events in dispute, jury trial changed function and became primarily an occasion for educating the jurors about the facts,\u201d he said.Generally, prosecutors look for \u201cpeople who are community-minded,\u201d like people who are married, employed in a role that requires dealing with others or involved in community groups \u2014 that is, people who can reach a consensus, said Arlo Devlin-Brown, a partner at Covington & Burling who was until last year a federal prosecutor in Manhattan. They are \u201ctrying to avoid people who may be loners,\u201d he said.And not all lawyers today look for jurors who are coming to a case with little knowledge of the subject matter. Asked about how he would pick jurors for Mr. Shkreli\u2019s trial, Robert J. A. Zito, a longtime white-collar defense lawyer who will soon become a professor at Marist College, said, \u201cI would want financial people on the jury, because the underlying transactions are very complicated.\u201dAt Mr. Shkreli\u2019s jury selection, lawyers seemed to be taking the opposite tack. A manager at a broker-dealer \u201cwould be an expert in the room,\u201d argued Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer Benjamin Brafman, and the man was dismissed.Finally, after two and a half days of questioning the jury, lawyers needed only 15 minutes to make their picks.While Mr. Shkreli and his lawyers hurried into a court conference room, prosecutors, federal agents and a paralegal for the government huddled over a table in the courtroom, making notes on pages printed with each juror\u2019s name, juror number and space to write notes on the juror.The groups of lawyers gathered around Judge Matsumoto and, in quiet voices, gave their strikes. Twelve jurors and six alternates remained when they were done, including one current and one retired United Parcel Service driver, two human resources employees at a community college, a utility company employee, a parking meter repairman, a retired veterinarian, a software support worker and a current and a retired speech pathologist.Soon after the jurors took the seats they\u2019d sit in for the next six weeks or so, Mr. Brafman gave his opening argument.\u201cYou are savvy New Yorkers: There is no expertise\u201d you need to evaluate the case, he said, no \u201cspecial math.\u201d\u201cYou need street smarts,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smaller Housing Markets Lure Individual Investors", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by360 ViewAfter Andrew Bahr, a structural engineer, lost a bidding war last fall for a two-bedroom apartment in Queens, he decided he was done trying to buy real estate in New York.\u201cI was tired of looking around me and seeing all the home prices shooting up and I\u2019m not getting a piece of that pie,\u201d said Mr. Bahr, 26, who was stunned when a buyer offered $15,000 more than his $345,000 bid on the apartment in Jackson Heights.Rather than wait for another apartment to come along, or save more money, he turned his gaze well beyond the city limits, all the way to Atlanta. On March 1, he bought a four-bedroom house there for $100,000.In doing so, he traded in the dream of living in a home he owns for a chance to turn a profit.A tenant lives in his Atlanta house, paying $1,050 a month \u2014 enough for Mr. Bahr to pocket $400 each month after paying his mortgage, taxes and property management fees. Mr. Bahr lives in Jackson Heights, in a studio he rents for $1,467 a month. \u201cWe live in the wrong state, we definitely do,\u201d he said.Mr. Bahr\u2019s unconventional path to ownership is one that was carved in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. After millions of distressed homes flooded the market across the country, some large institutional investors, like Blackstone, began buying and transforming single-family homes \u2014 a symbol of American upward mobility \u2014 into rental properties.In exchange, Mr. Bahr can be a landlord at arm\u2019s length. He has never visited his property and does not know the name or occupation of the person who rents it. \u201cSometimes I wish I was more involved,\u201d he said. \u201cA big part of my savings went into that property, and I feel like I should help out, but they\u2019re doing it all for me.\u201dDon Ganguly, the chief executive of HomeUnion, which started in 2014, said that most HomeUnion investors live in expensive coastal markets, like San Francisco and New York, where salaries are high but so are housing costs. Their dollars go further in smaller markets, like Indianapolis, Dallas and Orlando.The need to look farther afield for what is affordable is common for New Yorkers just searching for a place to live. Can\u2019t afford to live in Brooklyn Heights? Give Bedford-Stuyvesant a try. If all of Brooklyn is out of your budget, welcome to New Jersey.It turns out that aspiring investors face a similar conundrum. The mom-and-pop landlord who may have bought a rental property around the corner a decade ago now also needs to look farther, and since there is no need to actually live in the home, that net can be cast far and wide.\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s an extension of the search for affordability in New York,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants. \u201cThis becomes another leap.\u201dBut there is a difference between moving with your family to the suburbs and buying a house that is a plane ride away and occupied by a stranger. Buying a property that you may never see changes your relationship with it. Mr. Ganguly, who was initially surprised by how few HomeUnion investors flew out to see the houses they were about to buy, compared the process to buying stocks. \u201cThey flipped the switch in their head to say, \u2018It\u2019s an asset,\u2019\u201d he said.Like stocks, a house may appreciate in value over the years, while rental income offers a steady return in the short term. On HomeUnion\u2019s website, listings include detailed projections for returns. The company estimates that, on average, investors who put down 20 percent on a property and hold it for 15 years can expect annual returns of 11 to 19 percent, a figure that includes rental income, appreciation and increased equity.But buying a house is hardly the same as buying stock in a company. Stocks don\u2019t have roofs that leak or tenants who stop paying the rent \u2014 and stocks don\u2019t come with monthly mortgage bills.HomeUnion recommends that its investors set aside $1,000 per property in a reserve fund. However, $1,000 will not necessarily cover the cost of a boiler breaking the same month that a tenant moves out. If you lose your job or have other financial strains, you could be a paycheck away from trouble, even if your property is appreciating on paper.\u201cThe possibility of a surprise $5,000 fee is always there,\u201d said Callum Runcie, 42, who lives in Port Washington, N.Y., with his family and who owns three investment properties through HomeUnion. He earns about $2,000 a month on the portfolio. An air-conditioner recently broke at one of his properties, and he was waiting to hear back on the repair cost. \u201cThey said it\u2019s kind of a big deal,\u201d he said, referring to the property managers at HomeUnion. When a tenant moved out of one property, Mr. Runcie spent $2,000 on renovations while the home was vacant for two months.Investing in a market that you do not know, and relying on a third party to manage the property, requires research, and trust in the company providing the information. \u201cThe biggest risk, if you\u2019re investing in real estate, is that the house doesn\u2019t appreciate,\u201d said Nela Richardson, the chief economist for Redfin. \u201cNot having local expertise is like going in blind.\u201dHomeUnion offers local market reports and listings that include details about local salaries, rents and demographics. Mr. Bahr read up on Georgia tenant laws before he purchased his home to make sure that he could easily remove a difficult tenant, if necessary. And, he has relatives who live in the Atlanta area, which made him feel more confident about it.Ultimately, Mr. Bahr sees Atlanta as a more realistic option than the market where he lives. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to be able to own a home in New York, unless my salary doubles,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to wait 20 or 30 years for that to happen.\u201dInstead of waiting on New York, he is planning to buy a second rental property in Atlanta.Advertisement"}

This exceeded by 11 percent the companies\u2019 research and development spending of $465 billion during these years.The authors contend that many big pharmaceutical companies are living off patents that are decades-old and have little to show in the way of new blockbuster drugs. But their share buybacks and dividend payments inoculate them against shareholders who might be concerned about lackluster research and development.A few companies have spent more money repurchasing shares than they allocated to research over the period, the study found. They included Gilead Sciences, which spent $27 billion on buybacks versus $17 billion on research, and Biogen Idec, which repurchased $14.6 billion in stock and spent $13.8 billion on research and development.\u201cThe key cause of high drug prices, restricted access to medicines and stifled innovation, we submit, is a social disease called \u2018maximizing shareholder value,\u2019\u201d the study\u2019s authors concluded.This concept, the authors said, is actually \u201can ideology of value extraction.\u201d And chief among the beneficiaries of the extraction are drug company executives, whose pay packages, based in part on stock prices, are among the lushest in corporate America.\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of spending on R&D in the U.S. economy, and no shortage of spending on life sciences, even though it has declined somewhat in real terms,\u201d one of the authors, William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said in an interview. \u201cBut there really is very little drug development going on in companies showing the highest profits and capturing much of the gains.\u201dWhile stock buybacks appear to be particularly troublesome among drugmakers, big companies in other industries \u2014 in sectors like banking, retail, technology and consumer goods, among others \u2014 are also buying back boatloads of their shares. Through May, some $390 billion in buybacks have been announced this year, $13 billion more than at this time in 2016, according to figures compiled by Jeffrey Yale Rubin at Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm.Many companies contend that stock buybacks are a great way to return value to their shareholders. Investors often agree. By reducing the equity outstanding at a company, the repurchases increase its per-share earnings, often giving a boost to its stock.Buybacks made at low cost can be a fine use of a company\u2019s capital. But when share repurchases replace a company\u2019s research-and-development spending, that indicates its management is unable or unwilling to spend on innovation that could generate future earnings to shareholders.As the buyback binge continues, another new academic study shows, a heavy reliance on them actually hurts corporate performance over the long haul. These researchers found that the more capital a business invests in stock repurchases based on its current market capitalization, \u201cthe less likely that company is to experience long-term growth in overall market value.\u201d\u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d is by Robert U. Ayres, emeritus professor of economics, political science and technology management at the global business school Insead, and Michael Olenick, a research fellow there. It compares the performance of companies that lean heavily on buybacks with those that do not.Spending money on buybacks and dividends has increased among United States companies from negligible levels in the 1980s, the researchers said, to 38 percent of earnings in 2000. By 2011, buybacks had grown to 79 percent of earnings, rocketing to 110 percent in 2015.Mr. Ayres and Mr. Olenick found that 199 companies repurchased shares equal to at least half their current value. Some 64 companies spent over 100 percent of their current market capitalization on buybacks.When the academics combined these companies\u2019 current market values with the amounts they had spent on buybacks, the sum showed what the companies should have been worth if they had invested the money in a money-market account instead.Fifty companies have spent more inflation-adjusted capital buying back stock than their businesses are currently worth in market value, the study found. Companies on this list include HP Inc., J. C. Penney and Sears Holdings.By contrast, the research identified 269 strong performers that have repurchased stock worth just 2 percent or less of their current market values. They include Facebook, Xcel Energy, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.Company executives who buy back large numbers of shares instead of investing in their businesses are committing corporate suicide, Mr. Olenick said. \u201cWhen managers can\u2019t create value in the business other than buying their own stock,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cit seems like it\u2019s time for a management change.\u201dHis co-author, Mr. Ayres, said he suspected the buyback craze was rooted in executives\u2019 laser focus on short-term results. \u201cThey have short-term expectations,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re in their jobs for a few years at most; they\u2019re not really interested in the long-term future of the company.\u201dShare buybacks provide immediate gratification, the stock market equivalent of a sugar high. That makes them alluring in the short term. Until the crash that usually follows.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Finance Meeting\u2019s Meager Results Reflect Nation\u2019s Problems", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s top leaders have gathered every five years since 1997 for a National Financial Work Conference. At past gatherings, they have created entire regulatory agencies and rearranged the rules for huge markets, almost overnight.So economists and regulators have been almost breathlessly speculating about this summer\u2019s work conference. Would the regulatory commissions overseeing the banking, securities and insurance industries be merged into the central bank? Would the legal definition of securities be broadened to shed some regulatory daylight on widespread activities like shadow banking, peer-to-peer online investment networks and off-balance-sheet wealth management products?But the actual results of the two-day work conference, which ended on Saturday afternoon, were much more, well, modest, to put it politely.The biggest accomplishment of the conference appeared to be an announcement that a commission would be established under the auspices of the cabinet. The commission would meet regularly to discuss issues of financial stability.But the leaders of the various financial regulatory agencies already meet regularly at the offices of the State Council, which is China\u2019s cabinet, although these meetings are not officially at the level of a commission.Some economists speculated in the final days before the two-day conference that at least the State Council meetings would be moved to the central bank. Allowing the central bank to serve tea and provide a conference room might give the central bank staff a little extra confidence by allowing them to negotiate as hosts. The central bank also has a history of advocating broader financial reforms than the other principal financial regulatory agencies: the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.But the leaders did not even move the meetings away from the State Council\u2019s offices to the central bank. And the result of the conference fell far short of predictions that the regulatory agencies might become clearly subservient to the central bank.The statement that accompanied the end of the conference did mention that the central bank had a role to play in preventing systemic financial risk. That is already the role of central banks in many countries. But Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group based in Shanghai, said that the specific mention of it in the statement might strengthen the central bank\u2019s hand somewhat.But he was skeptical of the new commission, noting that it would lack legal powers and have very few staff members. \u201cChina failed to achieve a real breakthrough in financial regulatory reform, and the rising conflicts between financial regulation and financial realities will continue to create troubles in the coming years,\u201d Mr. Liu said.State-controlled media carried a statement that described President Xi Jinping of China as having said at the conference, \u201cFinance is an important core competitiveness of the country, financial security is an important part of national security, and the financial system is an important economic and social development of the basic system.\u201dThe apparently meager results from the conference underline not just bureaucratic resistance to change, which Mr. Xi probably has the political muscle to overcome, but the very real and complex policy dilemmas facing China.One example lies in the vast, lightly regulated off-balance-sheet activities of Chinese banks, which Mizuho Securities calculated on Friday to be roughly equal to the entire assets on the balance sheets of the banking industry. Regulators in the West would probably force banks to move these activities as quickly as possible onto their balance sheets, which would probably have the effect of curtailing them.But many of these off-balance-sheet activities, like various kinds of loan guarantees, are crucial to providing financing for China\u2019s vigorous small and medium-size enterprises. These smaller businesses have had little luck competing with large, state-owned enterprises for conventional bank loans. But they account for the bulk of the job creation in China, at a time when the government is trying to slim down chronically loss-making industries like steel manufacturing and coal mining that are also big employers.Other financial regulatory disputes in China involve bureaucratic turf issues. One question lies in how to modernize China\u2019s antiquated securities law, which still applies only to stocks and bonds and lacks provisions to cover the more complex instruments issued these days by insurance companies, banks, online lenders and other types of financial institutions.The China Securities Regulatory Commission has pushed hard for the broadest possible definition of securities, which would give it much greater influence. The banking and insurance regulators have resisted this, contending that many of the new financial instruments are extensions of banking and insurance.One mystery left unresolved by the statement at the end of the conference lies in who will run the top financial regulatory agencies in the years ahead, particularly the central bank.Zhou Xiaochuan has been the governor of the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, since 2002, making him one of the world\u2019s longest-serving central bankers. Mr. Zhou is already more than two years past the usual retirement age for Chinese officials at his level. He received a special dispensation from the usual age limits by being allowed to join a senior government advisory body that is exempt from age limits.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Struggles at Procter & Gamble Draw Scrutiny of Nelson Peltz", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTide detergent dominated the American laundry room for decades and helped make Procter & Gamble a consumer products behemoth.But consumers have increasingly been shunning premium-priced brands like Tide for cheaper versions of laundry detergent. And the detergent market is just one of many in which Procter & Gamble is battling to keep bargain-hunting customers.Across a number of its mission-critical, multibillion-dollar product lines \u2014 from Pampers diapers to Olay skin creams to Gillette razors \u2014 Procter & Gamble is fighting to retain its market share.Those struggles have now attracted the attention of Nelson Peltz, a billionaire investor and activist shareholder.Arguing in a regulatory filing that the company was in need of a shake-up, Mr. Peltz announced on Monday that he was seeking a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble. His investment firm, Trian Fund Management, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in February.The filing signals a ratcheting-up in the size of the corporate targets of activist investors, who through behind-the-scenes cajoling or sometimes high-profile public proxy wars try to force companies to change their strategies with an eye toward profits for themselves.Activist investing has attracted larger and larger pools of money, allowing managers like Mr. Peltz to hunt for ever-bigger corporate game. A proxy fight at Procter & Gamble, which has a market value of nearly $225 billion, would be among the biggest in corporate history.And Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is merely the latest consumer-driven company to capture the attention of activist investors.Last month, Daniel S. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund, Third Point, said he would agitate for changes at Nestl\u00e9, and Jana Partners had earlier pressured the retailer Whole Foods to revamp its board. Whole Foods ultimately announced that it would sell itself to Amazon.Companies with mature consumer brands \u2014 like Procter & Gamble, with its Tide detergent and Gillette razors \u2014 can be ripe targets for activists because their days of surging growth are often well behind them.While companies may want to keep the brands, enjoying the cash they can generate, activist investors tend to be more aggressive in their approach. They often look for ways to sell the brands and reinvest in new technologies or brands that can generate better growth opportunities, said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, a firm that consults with companies and funds on activist campaigns. (Mr. Park is not involved in Mr. Peltz\u2019s crusade with Procter & Gamble.)That Procter & Gamble has become the quarry for activist investors is a sign of how far the once-iconic giant has fallen.For years, Procter & Gamble attracted the best-and-brightest marketing M.B.A.s from the nation\u2019s top schools. It spurred many a Harvard Business School study of its internal methodologies and disruptive innovations. And it was the home to many big consumer hits, like the Swiffer duster and Crest Whitestrips.But thanks in no small part to lackluster economic growth overseas, combined with a strong dollar, Procter & Gamble has had 13 consecutive quarters of sales declines. Its shares have lagged behind the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.The company is on its third chief executive, David Taylor, in eight years. It is slashing billions of dollars in costs and shrinking its work force.To meet the challenges, Procter & Gamble has moved quickly to reduce its portfolio of brands, selling about 40 beauty brands, including CoverGirl makeup and Clairol Nice \u2019n Easy hair coloring, to Coty last year.But analysts say what has gone missing from Procter & Gamble is innovation, new products or designs that will spur top-line growth.\u201cOlay hasn\u2019t grown in years,\u201d said Mark Astrachan, an analyst with Stifel Financial. \u201cPantene has been relaunched I don\u2019t know how many times at this point. On shaving, it was not focused on the fact the market was moving online and to products offered at a lower price point. It didn\u2019t launch a shaving club until it had lost considerable market share.\u201dAnd while the company is beginning to lower the prices of its goods to compete with less expensive products, the prices of its brands are, on average, 40 percent higher than the average price in the category, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein Research. Tide is twice the average price in the laundry detergent arena, Mr. Dibadj said.For now, Mr. Peltz has emphasized cutting costs and trimming the layers of management bureaucracy at Procter & Gamble, but not much else.Since taking its stake in Procter & Gamble in February, Trian had held about a half-dozen meetings with the company, outlining its arguments, according to two people briefed on the matter. The company made its own counterarguments, including asking for more time to prove the worth of its current strategy.Those discussions reached a head last week when Procter & Gamble formally declined to give Mr. Peltz a seat.In a statement on Monday, the company said it had had \u201can active and constructive dialogue\u201d with Trian. It also said that its board was \u201cconfident that the changes being made are producing results\u201d and that it \u201cexpresses complete support for the company\u2019s strategy, plans and management.\u201dTrian said Monday that it was not seeking to break up Procter & Gamble \u2014 a well-worn tactic of activists \u2014 or seeking to replace David S. Taylor, who has been the company\u2019s chief executive for less than two years. If Mr. Peltz is elected, Trian said, the firm will renominate the director who had been defeated, effectively expanding Procter & Gamble\u2019s board by one seat.For the most part, Trian has tended to apply pressure behind the scenes with corporate management, a self-described \u201cconstructivist\u201d tact. Mr. Peltz meets regularly with management teams and board members, often discussing lengthy analyses that the firm has put together. (The firm\u2019s \u201cwhite paper\u201d on General Electric ran to about 80 pages.)Since setting up Trian in 2005, Mr. Peltz and his partners, Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, had resorted to proxy fights just twice before Procter & Gamble. That is out of 23 campaigns at 20 companies, according to data from FactSet.Trian\u2019s win rate in its proxy fights is 50 percent. In the battle against the ketchup maker Heinz for board seats, Trian won two of the five seats it sought. But with the chemical maker DuPont, shareholders rejected Trian outright and re-elected all of the sitting directors, although the company\u2019s chief executive, Ellen J. Kullman, retired five months later, after the company fell short on financial performance targets.People with knowledge of Trian\u2019s interactions with Procter & Gamble stressed that the discussions had been cordial, with the two sides agreeing on a number of issues.While Mr. Peltz has not signaled any interest in breaking up Procter & Gamble, some analysts say that could still be the ultimate outcome.\u201cFor almost a decade, they have been talking about improvement, and for all of their efforts and advantages, I haven\u2019t seen it play out at all,\u201d said Mr. Dibadj, the Bernstein analyst, who has advocated a breakup of the company. \u201cThis is an organization that is simply too big and too complex.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about efforts by the investor Nelson Peltz to gain a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble misstated the name of the company that bought beauty brands from Procter & Gamble last year. It is Coty, not Cody.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Invests in Canada, but Should You?", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameAl Rosen takes a different view. A veteran forensic accountant and independent equity analyst who predicted the collapse of Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecom company, two years before its 2009 demise, Mr. Rosen has a message for people investing in Canadian stocks: be wary.It is a mystery to Mr. Rosen why Mr. Buffett bought into Home Capital Group, a company that has been the subject of a titanic battle between the investors who believe in the company and other investors \u2014 short sellers \u2014 who do not. Certainly, Mr. Buffett expects to make money on his deal. But in an interview, Mr. Rosen said he thought there was more to the story than the markets yet know.Mr. Rosen is certain of this: International accounting rules followed by Canadian companies since 2011 are putting investors in Canadian stocks \u2014 not just Home Capital Group\u2019s \u2014 at peril. Canada\u2019s rules, which are substantially different from the generally accepted accounting principles (G.A.A.P.) governing American companies, give much more leeway to corporate managers when it comes to valuing assets and recording cash flows.In addition, a 1997 decision by the Supreme Court of Canada has severely limited investors in suing company auditors for malpractice. Combined, these two factors generally make Canadian stocks a danger zone, Mr. Rosen said.American investors often fail to recognize this, though, because they assume Canadian companies are abiding by American accounting standards. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to alert investors in the U.S. to this,\u201d Mr. Rosen said in an interview. \u201cBut there\u2019s just that belief that Canada is following U.S. standards when it\u2019s not.\u201dIn Mr. Rosen\u2019s view, the international accounting standards followed by Canadian companies allow managers to apply overly rosy assumptions to the financial figures they report to investors. For a while, these assumptions can propel stock prices \u2014 and executive bonuses \u2014 well beyond where they would be otherwise, he said.Canadian accounting rules can also mask problems at a company. How else, Mr. Rosen asked, to explain the events leading up to the June 22 bankruptcy filing by Sears Canada? The company\u2019s shares trade on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market in the United States.Sears Canada\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t good. Both revenues and same-store sales had fallen, but it reported shareholders\u2019 equity of 222 million Canadian dollars (about $171 million) and 1.24 billion Canadian dollars ($956 million) in total assets.In the report, company management characterized Sears Canada as a going concern. In accounting parlance, that meant the business was expected to operate without the threat of liquidation for the next 12 months.The auditor for Sears Canada did not challenge this view and assigned the company an unqualified \u2014 or \u201cclean\u201d \u2014 opinion on April 26. The report fairly represented Sears Canada\u2019s financial position, the opinion said. And that opinion may well have been justified under Canadian rules.Less than two months later, Sears Canada was bankrupt.\u201cWhat are the auditing and accounting rules in Canada that allow you to give this totally clean opinion on a company and you can\u2019t even look beyond six weeks?\u201d Mr. Rosen asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the scary situation with Sears, and we\u2019re just seeing it more and more on other cases coming forward.\u201dBut that\u2019s not the outcome, Mr. Rosen said. In practice, the rules allow company executives to inflate their revenues and hide excessive acquisition costs. They also let managers overstate assets and understate liabilities, he said.Not all managers will do so, of course. But Mr. Rosen\u2019s forensic accounting work has taught him that \u201cfor every honest manager, there\u2019s a cheat waiting to pounce.\u201dA spokeswoman for the I.F.R.S. Foundation, Kirstina Reitan, said its members disagree with Mr. Rosen\u2019s take. \u201cThe success of accounting standards depends on companies applying them properly and exercising sound judgment,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cBoth U.S. G.A.A.P. and I.F.R.S. are high-quality standards, and one is not more prone to abuse than the other.\u201dStill, the differences between the two standards can be significant. Consider, for example, the approach taken to recognizing revenue under the international standards.Under these rules, companies can record revenues based on only a 50.001 percent probability of eventually collecting the money \u2014 something Mr. Rosen calls the \u201cmore-likely-than-not rule.\u201d By contrast, under American guidelines, managers must have a reasonable assurance that they will generate the revenues before they can record them; companies generally interpret this as 70 percent to 80 percent certainty, he said.Valuing assets is another problem with international standards, Mr. Rosen said. Under the generally accepted accounting principles used in Canada before 2011, a company would have to complete the sale of a property or building before recording the results of the transaction for financial reporting purposes.Because the international standards instead focus on current value accounting, executives have much more freedom to assign value to assets that may or may not be real.What can these differences mean to a particular company? In \u201cEasy Prey Investors,\u201d Mr. Rosen presents a side-by-side example of one public company\u2019s 2011 financial results based on the previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles and the new international standards. The company, which owned rental properties, showed a $4 million loss under G.A.A.P. and an $82 million profit under the international standards.\u201cMany Canadian-traded stocks are trying to appear more financially adequate by utilizing the massive holes in I.F.R.S.,\u201d Mr. Rosen wrote in his book. He calls financial reporting in Canada right now \u201cthe calm before the storm.\u201dThe Toronto Stock Exchange index is up 6 percent over the past 52 weeks. Although that pales next to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 return, it is nonetheless respectable.Seems as good a time as any to heed a warning from an experienced investigator like Mr. Rosen.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Loses No. 1 Spot in Market Value Among U.S. Automakers", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor almost three months, Tesla reigned as the most valuable automaker in the nation, ahead of both General Motors and Ford Motor, thanks to a remarkable run-up in its stock this year. It seemed its chief executive, Elon Musk, could do no wrong.But a spate of negative news this week has brought the electric-car maker\u2019s many challenges into focus, especially its ambitious plans to ramp up production of its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, which begins rolling off the assembly line on Friday.With investors shying away, Tesla has seen its shares fall by almost 17 percent since Monday\u2019s intraday high, to $308.89, including a 5.6 percent drop on Thursday. That reduced the company\u2019s market capitalization to $50.7 billion, according to Bloomberg, and put G.M. ahead once again, at $52.6 billion.\u201cThe market is punishing them harshly for that,\u201d Mr. Whiston said.It may be harder for Tesla to pass G.M. a second time. Auto sales in the United States are slowing over all, and Tesla is not yet a significant player in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market. In the second quarter, Tesla produced more cars than it delivered to customers, causing some analysts to question whether demand for current models \u2014 the Model S sedan and the Model X, a sport-utility vehicle \u2014 is reaching a plateau.With established manufacturers expanding their electric options, \u201cTesla will face intense competition by the next decade,\u201d Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients.But by far the biggest concerns are related to the Model 3.Until now, the company has produced the Model S and Model X, which can sell for $70,000 and up, in relatively small numbers. In 2016, Tesla made about 85,000 vehicles. But the Model 3 will be priced at roughly $35,000 and is aimed at a wider range of buyers. With the Model 3 in the lineup, Tesla expects to sell about 500,000 cars a year by 2018.Last year, Mr. Musk predicted that Tesla would sell about 100,000 Model 3s this year. But late on Sunday, outlining a production plan on Twitter, he said the company expected to make 30 this month, 100 in August, and 1,500 in September. He expected production to climb to about 20,000 cars in December. That would leave it well short of 100,000.Concern over Model 3 production was compounded when the company said its giant battery plant in Nevada had struggled to produce enough battery packs.\u201cUp to now, Tesla has had little experience with volume production,\u201d Axel Schmidt, managing director of the automotive practice at Accenture, a large consulting firm, said in an email. Ramping up Model 3 production \u201cremains a huge challenge,\u201d he said.The slump in Tesla\u2019s share price halts a remarkable surge for the company, in which its stock rose from a little over $180 in November to more than twice that recently.The crash raised questions about the reliability of the technology and about whether Tesla had overstated its capability in its marketing, and even in using the name Autopilot. Federal agencies opened investigations, including one to determine if there was a safety defect in Autopilot.The stock price languished even after Mr. Musk laid out an updated \u201cmaster plan\u201d for the company, with a pledge to expand beyond electric cars into battery-powered pickups, semi-trailer trucks and buses, and to equip them with advanced self-driving systems.But this year, investors began focusing on the introduction of the Model 3 and Mr. Musk\u2019s confident prediction that Tesla would be able to increase sales fivefold next year.Tesla raised $1 billion in stock and debt offerings to bolster its coffers in advance of the Model 3 introduction. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded its investigation of the fatal crash and found no defects in Autopilot.April brought more good news: a strong jump in vehicle production in the first quarter, and a new surge in the stock price that pushed Tesla\u2019s market value to $48 billion, surpassing the market capitalization of Ford Motor. The run continued, and on April 10, the stock surged to $312.39.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Ends Obama-Era Retirement Savings Plan", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Obama-era program that created savings accounts to help more people put away money for retirement is being shut down by the Treasury Department, which deemed the program too expensive.The goal of the myRA accounts \u2014 which operated much like Roth I.R.A. accounts \u2014 was to encourage saving, particularly among lower-income workers. Account holders could contribute up to $5,500 a year, or $6,500 if they were 50 or older. The money could be deducted automatically from users\u2019 paychecks, or they could contribute to the accounts by making transfers directly from checking or savings accounts.The myRA program was deemed a conservative way to save \u2014 and tailored for people who were not accustomed to investing in the markets \u2014 because account holders could not lose money. The funds were invested in United States Treasury savings bonds, which paid the same variable rate as the Government Securities Fund, available to federal employees through the government retirement plan.There was not a minimum deposit or a fee. But the maximum workers could save was only $15,000. At that point the balance would be rolled over to a private-sector retirement account, perhaps a more traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds.Mark Iwry, the chief architect of the program that was built over nearly six years while he served as senior adviser to the Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, said it had been designed to have many uses over time. Besides being a safe way to introduce people to saving for retirement, it was expected to serve as a key investment option within some state-run retirement programs \u2014 geared to the tens of millions of people without access to employer-sponsored plans \u2014 that are in the process of being created.\u201cThe decision to cancel the myRA in its introductory phase reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of its purposes and potential as a long-term investment in working families\u2019 economic security and financial independence,\u201d Mr. Iwry said. \u201cThere are several legitimate ways to assess a program\u2019s costs and benefits \u2014 prematurely is not one of them.\u201dSeveral states \u2014 including California, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 are moving ahead anyway. And while some states had plans to include myRA as a \u201csafe\u201d investment alternative, that will no longer be an option.\u201cGiven that this administration has worked to reduce access to retirement plans for millions of Americans,\u201d the letter said, \u201cit is more critical than ever for the Treasury to strengthen one of their remaining options for retirement savings.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wealth Advisers Set Up Shop With a Shared Back Office", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to traditional financial advisers, Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management does not quite play to type.Now, sitting on more than $4 trillion in assets, registered investment advisers are posing a direct threat to the old model of huddling with brokers from Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley and following their advice \u2014 for a hefty fee, usually \u2014 about which stocks, bonds or mutual funds to buy.Able to farm out onerous back-office and custodial responsibilities to firms like Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, brokers are leaving top Wall Street houses in droves to establish their own independent shops.Founded on the principle of providing low-cost stock trades to individual investors, Charles Schwab\u2019s growth in recent years has been propelled by its adviser segment, which offers a wide array of custodial services to registered investment advisers as well as access to the Schwab mutual fund supermarket.Of the $2.9 trillion in assets that Schwab oversees, $1.3 trillion now comes from financial advisers \u2014 up from $863 billion in 2012. The rest belongs to individual investors.More than 7,500 registered investment advisers use Schwab to park assets, giving it, according to the company\u2019s calculation, a 29 percent market share and putting it far ahead of competitors TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s Pershing subsidiary.Advisers can call on a Schwab expert for help in setting up a business or for legal advice in dealing with a complex trust, as well as execute quick and easy trades of individual securities or mutual funds.Schwab even runs a training program for interns, who are then farmed out to select advisers.What\u2019s most crucial, though, for a wealth manager just hanging out a shingle, is the sense of security.Whether you are a successful Wall Street broker going independent or starting a second career from scratch, being able to tell a client that the assets are with Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade offers a peace of mind that advisers say is absolutely critical to their business.\u201cSchwab put us in business when they developed their platform,\u201d said Harold Evensky, a longtime financial adviser who writes books and gives speeches on the merits of independent investment advice.A cluster of low-slung buildings in a northeast suburb of Phoenix is an unlikely hub for this wealth explosion \u2014 not least for Schwab, whose headquarters have long been in San Francisco. But because creating a back office for $1.3 trillion in assets is labor-intensive work, Schwab has been expanding its business in more affordable cities like Dallas and Orlando, Fla.Overseeing this growing fief within Schwab is Bernie Clark, the head of adviser services, who, unlike the rest of the senior management team at the company, is not based in San Francisco.A gregarious, backslapper of a man, Mr. Clark works out of the Phoenix office, and he exudes the can-do spirit of the traditional financial adviser one often finds teeing off at the golf course or holding forth at a rotary luncheon.But instead of pushing stocks or a hot new mutual fund, Mr. Clark and the new breed of adviser he represents are preaching the virtues of transparent, low-cost planning strategies.\u201cWhether it\u2019s price, access to funds or fiduciary standards, we are democratizing the industry,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Just outside of Mr. Clark\u2019s office suite is a sprawl of cubicles where Schwab employees can be heard counseling financial advisers all over the country on matters large and small.And unlike a Wall Street firm, where the trading floor, in its size, pride of place and all-around clamor represents the beating heart of the institution, the execution hub in Phoenix is a less exalted place.Nicknamed \u201cthe hole,\u201d it is a modest enclosure without the windows that pull the Arizona sunlight into the football field-size space where the Schwab back-office advisers do their work.Above all there is silence: Since more than 95 percent of executions, be it the selling of a security or the buying of a mutual fund, are done electronically, there are no shouts or exclamations to be heard.The Schwab trading floor may seem sleepy, but its work moves at hyperspeed. For advisers over all, the firm trades $1.5 billion per day in equity-related products, and exchange-traded funds represent the largest chunk \u2014 a third \u2014 of that amount.Outside of Vanguard and BlackRock, which together control nearly 70 percent of the market for exchange-traded funds, few financial firms have played as prominent a role as Schwab in feeding the current E.T.F. frenzy.According to Cerulli, a research firm, 80 percent of registered investment advisers rely on exchange-traded funds to give their clients exposure to various investment strategies. While Vanguard and BlackRock have been the two main choices for registered investment advisers, Schwab has introduced its own branded fleet of tracking funds, which it prices well below the peer group and in some cases offers free to clients.Schwab\u2019s $78 billion in exchange-traded funds is dwarfed by the nearly $2 trillion that Vanguard and BlackRock manage, but its growth has been rapid, up from just $8 billion in 2012. And its aggressive pricing on the Schwab platform give its funds an outsize influence, pushing competitors to keep slashing their own, already rock bottom fees.With the back-office responsibilities of his investment firm safely outsourced to TD Ameritrade and Schwab, he has plenty of time to do exactly that.\u201cWithout a good custodian,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cnone of what we do works.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Procter & Gamble\u2019s Board Could Use a Fresh Member", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsNelson Peltz, the corporate agitator, is opting for the close shave at Procter & Gamble.Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian Partners, which owns a $3.3 billion stake, is taking a more surgical approach to the $223 billion company \u2014 whose brands include razors and detergent \u2014 than it did with its last proxy fight at DuPont, lobbying for a single board seat. Trian is also dangling niceties like promising to support management and not calling for a breakup.Given Procter & Gamble\u2019s many challenges, shareholders would be silly to pass on his assistance.The company, which is based in Cincinnati and whose brands include Gillette, Tide and Pampers, is struggling to navigate changing consumer habits. Upstarts like the Dollar Shave Club have cut into its market share of products with easy online purchasing and delivery and original marketing. P.&G. is increasing its online presence and has fought back with price cuts, but its stock price has lagged competitors\u2019 and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index in the last year, and \u2014 as Mr. Peltz points out \u2014 over the last decade.Procter & Gamble\u2019s revenue in the fiscal third quarter declined. David Taylor, the longtime employee who became chief executive two years ago, drummed up some new costs to cut, but analysts appear underwhelmed by the company\u2019s focus on \u201cirresistibly superior\u201d products. Trian said it was concerned that $13 billion of identified cost savings would not materialize given an \u201coverly complex organizational structure and a slow-moving and insular culture.\u201dWhile those may sound like fighting words, Mr. Peltz\u2019s push comes with a smiley emoticon. Trian is not seeking a breakup, or to push out Mr. Taylor, or even to cut research and marketing expenses. Mr. Peltz\u2019s first move as director would be to reinstate the board member he displaced.It is a notable contrast with Trian\u2019s approach at DuPont, where it sought four board seats and urged for a separation of businesses. Trian got no seats, but the chief executive was out five months later, and DuPont announced a merger with Dow Chemical that would lead to a breakup.Procter & Gamble\u2019s board may still be smarting from its last nick with activism. In 2013, the hedge fund boss William Ackman persuaded Procter & Gamble to remove its chief executive and bring back its former boss A. G. Lafley. Mr. Ackman then sold his shares. Yet, the company\u2019s share price has increased less than 10 percent over the last four years \u2014 the stock market equivalent of five o\u2019clock shadow.Mr. Peltz may not have all the answers to Procter & Gamble\u2019s troubles, but a fresh look on the board is warranted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ways of Winning in a Bull Market", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a bull market (the current one reached its eighth birthday in March), mutual fund managers can find many ways to win. In the second quarter, three of the better-performing stock funds scored with picks as varied as well-known technology companies, micro-cap stocks and Asian innovators.Those hefty holdings partly spring from the fund\u2019s design: It\u2019s benchmarked against the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. Thus, to favor a company, as Mr. Baker has with Tesla, his fund must have a greater allocation to the stock than the index does. Tesla accounts for less than 1 percent of the Nasdaq.Mr. Baker aims to identify and exploit enduring technological themes, like the continued growth of e-commerce and cloud computing. Lately, a favorite motif is the emergence of artificial intelligence. \u201cA.I. will change the world in ways we can\u2019t even imagine now,\u201d he said.The fund\u2019s Tesla holding is partly a wager on that belief. Mr. Baker, a Tesla owner himself, said he likes the company not just for the quality of its cars but also for its continuous improvements to its self-driving technology. Many other companies are developing that technology, too, but Mr. Baker is bullish on Tesla\u2019s prospects.\u201cIn a year or two, we may look back and think it\u2019s funny we focused on Tesla being an electric-car company when they\u2019re building a big competitive advantage in autonomous driving,\u201d he said.Tesla\u2019s stock has been falling lately, dropping more than 15 percent from a peak on June 23. Mr. Baker said his fund has added to its Tesla position this year, though he wouldn\u2019t comment on whether the fund had bought or sold shares recently.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009. Over that time, he said, he has learned patience: \u201cI appreciate more and more that, in a world dominated by people trading E.T.F.s and quantitative traders and hedge funds, the biggest competitive advantage I have is a long-term time horizon.\u201d Mr. Baker retains an average holding for about two years and will keep favored stocks far longer. Nvidia, for example, has been an overweight in the fund \u2014 a larger allocation than in the benchmark \u2014 for Mr. Baker\u2019s whole tenure.The fund, with an expense ratio of 0.91 percent, returned 9.34 percent in the second quarter, compared with a total return of 3.09 percent, including dividends, for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Yet he said he tries to guard against being too patient, striving to stay focused on why he bought a stock and not stumbling into what he called \u201cthesis creep.\u201d \u201cIf things don\u2019t play out, you don\u2019t want to rationalize or justify,\u201d Mr. Chace said.The Wasatch fund differs from the typical micro-cap offering tracked by Morningstar in that it invests more of its shareholders\u2019 money abroad. About 20 percent of the fund is parked in foreign stocks, compared with 3 percent for its average peer. Mr. Chace, who has managed the fund since 2004, can invest as much as 30 percent of the assets in foreign fare. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep pushing it up,\u201d he said.He said he has raised the fund\u2019s foreign stake because the United States micro-cap pool has been stagnant. (Wasatch counts as micro-caps companies with market capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion.) Over the last decade, relatively few domestic companies have issued stock in initial public offerings, or I.P.O.s, he said.India, in contrast, has many small companies with good growth rates, and Mr. Chace has gravitated there. His fund\u2019s top two holdings at the end of March \u2014 MakeMyTrip and Natco Pharma \u2014 are Indian ventures.Similarly, one of his recent good performers was V-Mart Retail, which specializes in selling apparel in India\u2019s smaller cities and countryside. Because of the company\u2019s rural market, it\u2019s not being squeezed by e-commerce companies in the way many big retailers are, he said.Mr. Chace\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.67 percent, returned 8.93 percent in the second quarter.Until last year, the fund was known as the Matthews Science and Technology Fund, but its sponsor, Matthews Asia, changed the name because Mr. Oh, who has overseen the fund since 2006, was finding opportunities beyond that narrower niche. He said his goal is to invest in companies benefiting from a growing middle class throughout Asia and rising disposable incomes there. \u201cThe question we\u2019re asking is, \u2018What will consumers with incremental income spend on?\u2019\u201dLately, an answer has been beauty products. One of the fund\u2019s larger holdings has been Hugel, a South Korean cosmetics and pharmaceuticals company whose offerings include botulinum toxin (or Botox) wrinkle treatments. Korean cosmetics makers have been innovators for more than a decade, Mr. Oh said, but their market was largely limited to South Korea and Japan.Now a surging middle class in China has created a big new pool of potential buyers, he said. In April, Bain Capital agreed to pay about $800 million for a controlling stake in Hugel.Mr. Oh invested in the TAL Education Group, a Beijing tutoring company, for similar reasons. Education is highly valued there, he said, and as parents see their discretionary income rise, they\u2019ll often spend some of the surfeit on their children\u2019s educations. His fund, with an expense ratio of 1.24 percent, returned 13.57 percent in the second quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best Path to Long-Term Change Is Slow, Simple and Boring", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyMany of life\u2019s choices fall into two categories:\u25a0 Option A: Exciting and complex and quick, but the action rarely works.\u25a0 Option B: Boring and simple and slow, but it works nearly all the time.I have been thinking a lot lately about why we are so intrigued by Option A.The list is endless. Trying to sell at the top of the stock market or buy at the bottom, day trading, raising venture capital and seven-day diets. If you can find a way to make some things exciting and complex and superfast, you can sell it to people even when the evidence is clear that it works only rarely.Compare these options with things like benefiting from compound interest slowly over time, buying and holding low-cost diversified investments, building a business using the business\u2019s own profits, eating healthy and exercising. They work \u2014 every time. But few people choose them over the exciting option.There are plenty of reasons we pick Option A over Option B. It\u2019s got me thinking about the quiet power of incremental change. Incremental change is about taking small, gradual steps instead of making big sweeping changes.I suggested a different approach. Send a personal email to 10, 50 or even 100 people you know and tell them about the novel, why you wrote it and how much you love it. Then, ask them to read it and provide feedback and tell them that they are free to share the book, too.It\u2019s boring and simple, and if you keep at it, there is a good chance it will work if the book is good. I bet you need only one guess to know what reply I received: \u201cIs there anyone you can introduce me to?\u201dAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the entire industry built around selling the dream of making quick money. You can trade options, gamble on currencies or jump into penny stocks and get rich. All while sitting in your basement, just wearing your underwear.Why wouldn\u2019t you do that? Well, because it doesn\u2019t work.Sorry, that is not correct. Let me be more precise. It works just often enough for someone to claim it works and sell it to you. But it probably won\u2019t work for you.You know what will work? Small actions repeated consistently over a very long period of time. Incremental change is short-term boring, but long-term exciting.Here is one trick to help you keep picking Option B: Remember to stop every once in a while and look back at where you started. We often get so focused on the goal that is still way over the horizon that we forget to turn around to see how far we\u2019ve come.Every day, I make it a point to look back and notice how far I have come. Some days, the distance I have come is clear, while other days I see I still have room to improve. But keeping track of this incremental change helps reinforce why I\u2019m making short-term boring choices. Because at some point, I\u2019ll look back and see how far I have come, and short-term boring will become long-term exciting.I dare you to try it too and see what happens next.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aiming to Do Good, Not Just Well", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you want to invest in companies that are not just making a profit but are also doing good in the world (or, at least, doing no harm), you may find yourself overwhelmed by confusing choices.It\u2019s like searching for new headphones or a restaurant in a strange city \u2014 too many options, too much information \u2014 but more stressful because the stakes are so much higher.The vocabulary of this kind of investing is arcane. It is known as environmental, social and governance (or E.S.G.) investing, or sometimes simply as \u201csocially responsible investing.\u201d These labels encompass a wide array of options and criteria, which have been used for years among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, focused on companies in the United States.Lately, this kind of investing has surged in the international sector, too. EPFR Global, an investment information provider in Cambridge, Mass., says traditional mutual funds and E.T.F.s involved in international E.S.G. investing have been pulling in new money for much of the last three years, with an uptick in the last few months.George Serafeim, a Harvard Business School professor, said the recent profusion of international options springs partly from today\u2019s deluge of data. These days, information is more accessible on foreign companies and on the performance of strategies oriented to environmental, social and governance investing, he said. That has helped fund managers prove that their approach can compete with common ones like buying domestic value or small-cap stocks.Todd L. Rosenbluth, senior director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA, an investment research firm, said he likes to see at least three years of performance when assessing an actively managed fund. That can give a sense of its ability to weather the market\u2019s ups and downs. His rule of thumb would eliminate some of the offerings in this niche; they\u2019re too new. But a few E.S.G. pioneers have offered international funds for years.When evaluating index funds, Mr. Rosenbluth doesn\u2019t worry as much about an offering\u2019s age. With such funds, an investor can check the performance of the underlying index \u2014 MSCI, for example, provides data on its many indexes on its website.Mr. Rosenbluth added that, before investing in any international E.S.G. index fund, you should compare its performance to that of a broader, well-established index like MSCI\u2019s EAFE, which includes stocks from 21 developed countries excluding the United States. A fund need not beat a broader index, but its performance should be reasonably close, he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you are hoping your money will appreciate,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said.People eyeing international E.S.G. funds may also want to add another layer of evaluation that\u2019s not needed with ordinary investments: assessing whether it meets your own definitions of social responsibility. You could call that its \u201cE.S.G.-ness.\u201dThe old-fashioned way of doing that is to check the fund\u2019s holdings, typically available on its website. If you worry about climate change and find a clutch of oil drillers, even ones with good E.S.G. reputations, you might think twice about buying in.\u201cThe rating doesn\u2019t tell you if the fund is an intentional E.S.G. fund,\u201d Mr. Hale said. \u201cIt just tells you what\u2019s in the portfolio. We did it this way because there\u2019s a lot of interest in E.S.G. among retail investors but, relatively speaking, a lack of product. There are only about 150 E.S.G. funds in the U.S. market, and we have about 8,000 mutual funds.\u201dCosts can consume the returns of international E.S.G. investors, just as they can for everyone else. And funds in this niche can cost more than counterparts outside it. That\u2019s a frustration for Daniel M. Flannery, owner of Balanced Rock Investment Advisors in Boston.Mr. Flannery said he directs his clients to low-cost index funds because ample evidence shows investors do better when they keep costs down. But he has had trouble finding E.S.G. funds with rock-bottom expense ratios. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking carefully and trying to get E.S.G. exposure, you get stuck at expense ratios of around 0.3 to 0.5 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see options that can drive that down to the 0.1 or 0.2 percent you can get with non-E.S.G. index funds.\u201dHigher prices for newer international E.S.G. funds are no surprise: New funds often charge more than older ones, partly because they\u2019re often smaller and don\u2019t enjoy the same economies of scale.Mr. Hale of Morningstar predicted that expense ratios would fall as international E.S.G. funds and E.T.F.s grow and even more offerings crowd into the sector. \u201cAny fund out there that truly wants to build a significant asset base is going to have be price-competitive,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Health Bill Collapses", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The seven-year Republican quest to undo the Affordable Care Act appeared to reach a dead end on Tuesday in the Senate, leaving President Trump vowing to let President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement collapse.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot easier,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to own it. I\u2019m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We\u2019ll let Obamacare fail, and then the Democrats are going to come to us.\u201dThe fate of the repeal effort looked to be sealed on Tuesday, when a last-ditch attempt to force a vote to abolish the health law without a replacement fell short of support. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, seemed resolved to force senators to vote next week, but by Tuesday afternoon, it was clear he did not have 50 votes even to clear a procedural hurdle before considering a repeal-only measure.Both moderate and conservative senators said they would not support the bill.Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, all Republicans, declared that they would not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement: enough to doom the effort before it could gain any momentum. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, also rejected that path.The collapse highlighted a harsh reality for Senate Republicans: While they freely assailed the health law when Mr. Obama occupied the White House, they could not come up with a workable plan to unwind it that would keep both moderate Republicans and conservatives on board. It was an enormous embarrassment for a party that rode electoral waves to control first the House, then the Senate and then the White House, but has not been able to deliver a major legislative victory.\u201cThis has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s given it their best shot, and as of today, we just simply do not have 50 senators who can agree on what ought to replace the existing law.\u201dThe reaction on Wall Street was muted. Stocks spent most of the day lower as shares of health insurers declined, and the dollar, which has steadily lost ground for most of the year, slipped further.Mr. Trump has considerable leverage to gum up the works of the Affordable Care Act. He could throw insurance markets into a tailspin at any time by cutting off the subsidy payments to insurers, as he has threatened to do. He could further destabilize the markets by not enforcing the mandate that most Americans have health insurance.And he could cancel advertising and other efforts to encourage enrollment under the Affordable Care Act when the annual sign-up period begins in November. A barrage of negative statements from the administration could project an official view that the health law is collapsing, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.The lack of certainty over the subsidy payments, which go toward reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, has been a major concern for insurers. The companies say premiums will be significantly higher without the funding, and some companies that have submitted rates to sell insurance in the market next year could decide to pull out.\u201cWith open enrollment for 2018 only three months away, our members and all Americans need the certainty and security of knowing coverage will be available and affordable for them,\u201d said Justine Handelman, a senior executive at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.While Mr. Trump has promised destruction, other Republicans signaled that they wanted to take a more constructive approach. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, announced that he would hold hearings in the next few weeks on stabilizing the individual health insurance market.Members of both parties have ideas about how to stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums. One possible action is to provide money for the payments to insurers for reducing customers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. In addition, two Democratic senators, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia, want the federal government to help pay the largest claims through a backstop known as reinsurance. Senators of both parties also want to help people in counties where no insurer chooses to offer health plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace \u2014 a real possibility in some places next year.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, implored Republicans to defy Mr. Trump and work with Democrats to strengthen insurance markets.\u201cThere\u2019s a fork in the road for our Republican colleagues,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey can do what Donald Trump said, which is sabotage the system out of anger and out of pique,\u201d or they can work with Democrats on improvements to the health law.\u201cWhether they can resist Trump, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats alike were trying to make sense of the repeal effort\u2019s apparent downfall \u2014 and figure out what comes next.Two other Republican senators, Ms. Collins and Rand Paul of Kentucky, had objected last week.That bill would have eliminated the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for the purchase of private insurance. But it would have left in place the law\u2019s requirement that insurers provide specific benefits, and the prohibition on denying coverage or charging higher premiums because of a person\u2019s pre-existing medical conditions.The repeal-only idea quickly ran into a wall on Tuesday.\u201cI did not come to Washington to hurt people,\u201d Ms. Capito said in a statement, taking issue with both Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill and the idea of repealing the health law \u201cwithout a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.\u201dMs. Murkowski said, \u201cThere\u2019s enough chaos and uncertainty already, and this would just contribute to it.\u201dThe idea of repealing the health law without providing a replacement also spooked a bipartisan group of 11 governors, including Brian Sandoval of Nevada, an influential Republican critic of Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill.\u201cThe Senate should immediately reject efforts to \u2018repeal\u2019 the current system and replace sometime later,\u201d said the group, which included five Republicans, five Democrats and one independent. \u201cThis could leave millions of Americans without coverage. The best next step is for both parties to come together and do what we can all agree on: fix our unstable insurance markets.\u201dMr. McConnell appears determined to drive the effort to a final public showdown with a procedural vote that would let the Senate consider the repeal-only measure. He can afford to lose only two Republican senators, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie. But he already appears to have lost at least three: Ms. Collins, Ms. Murkowski and Ms. Capito.More could still defect, unwilling to be recorded voting for a procedural step in what is all but certain to be a doomed exercise. But that could be an awkward stance for Republicans who voted for the repeal bill that the Senate passed in 2015 and Mr. Obama vetoed.\u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to vote the same way you voted in 2015,\u201d Mr. Paul said on Tuesday, \u201cthen you need to go back home, and you need to explain to Republicans why you\u2019re no longer for repealing Obamacare.\u201dReporting was contributed by Avantika Chilkoti, Emily Cochrane, Robert Pear and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington, and Reed Abelson and Gregory Schmidt from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Finish, Dalian Wanda of China Rewrites a Blockbuster Sale", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWanda had reached an overall agreement with the property firm Sunac China Holdings last week, but Wanda announced at a signing ceremony on Wednesday that it was backtracking and would instead sell just the theme parks to Sunac. The hotels will instead be sold to R&F Properties, based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.The hasty reorganization of the deals has raised concern about the due diligence conducted by many of China\u2019s first-generation dealmakers as they seek to become bigger players domestically and around the world. It is also further evidence that Chinese companies have been under greater official pressure to reduce their piles of loans, because the financial authorities have been alarmed that debt-fueled acquisitions by conglomerates could put the broader Chinese economy at risk.\u201cI have not heard of such a dramatic turnabout,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, who specializes in the politics of Chinese banking policies. \u201cIf it turns out to be government pressure, it would be typical of what we have been seeing \u2014 the government becoming more interventionist in the financial markets,\u201d he said.The event itself began in disarray, with sheepish Wanda employees initially telling journalists the briefing would be delayed for about an hour, hurriedly ushering the news media out of a hotel ballroom.The Chinese news media later posted photographs showing that the logo of R&F Properties had been removed from the sign announcing the deal. A Chinese journalist described hearing a glass break, while other news media reported seeing people angrily storming out of a room.Wang Jianlin, Wanda\u2019s chairman, acknowledged the delay, but blamed a slow printer and said reports of a \u201cquarrel\u201d were inaccurate. \u201cIn fact, we were talking and laughing,\u201d he said.The revision of the deal came in the wake of volatile stock movements for both Wanda and Sunac.Both companies have seen their shares slump in recent days over questions about their debt levels and corporate strategies. The ratings agency Fitch cut Sunac\u2019s credit rating, while Standard & Poor\u2019s put Wanda on negative credit watch.\u201cEveryone is concerned about Wanda Commercial\u2019s debt problems,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThe vast majority are really concerned, but very few people are really just spreading rumors. They only want to make chaos.\u201dHe cited a Chinese idiom that describes how some people \u201charm others to benefit themselves,\u201d before expressing confidence in his firm\u2019s finances. Mr. Wang said Wanda had about $25.2 billion in cash, excluding revenue from its theme parks.\u201cWanda Commercial has decided to clear a large portion of its bank loans,\u201d Mr. Wang said.The new agreement, however, \u201coffers Sunac better liquidity than the previous transaction plan, and reduces our debt level,\u201d said Sun Hongbin, Sunac\u2019s chairman. The firms said Sunac did not need a loan from Wanda to complete the revised deal.Tang Yucheng contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why All Shareholder Voices, Even Passive Ones, Matter", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe popularity of index funds and passive investing strategies continues to grow in America. Their collective assets have swelled to more than $6 trillion in recent years. This surge has reignited the long-running debate about whether active or passive investment approaches should reign supreme in today\u2019s financial world.But a new twist has recently grabbed the spotlight in this conversation \u2014 centered on what role these index funds should play (or shouldn\u2019t play) in contested situations where shareholder votes can determine a company\u2019s future.The focus on this issue is a consequence of the continued prominence of activist investing. Through June 2017, 320 companies based in the United States have been subject to an investor who publicly advocates change or makes demands to improve corporate governance, shift strategies or shake up management. Over a quarter of these cases have been at large companies with market capitalizations of more than $10 billion.Because of the sizable investment that index funds like State Street, Vanguard and BlackRock now have in so many companies, they often essentially become the swing votes in proxy fights, determining whether an activist\u2019s nominees or the company\u2019s nominees get elected to the board.Lately, a chorus has been growing to strip the indexes of these voting rights. Some have argued that because these funds are passive, that alone should disqualify them from voting. Others contend that they don\u2019t have sufficient bandwidth to go in-depth on companies and situations as active shareholders can and are not as incentivized to address poor corporate governance issues that hurt ordinary investors.As an activist investor who recently lost an expensive, monthslong proxy campaign where a lack of support from the indexes was the difference, you might expect me to be firmly in the camp advocating to disarm these funds. You would be wrong.I believe that when it comes to public companies in America today, it is critical to remember that the deck is stacked against all shareholders. As a rule, management and boards have tremendous control over companies. That is why both passive and active shareholders must work together to make their voices heard.The philosophies of proxy voting groups at the large index funds have been evolving, with improved corporate governance at the top of the agenda. It is inevitable that these governance groups will get bigger, and specialization among the professionals will increase, paving the way for more nuanced feedback and engagement with both sides during proxy contests.It is true that there are cases where I don\u2019t agree with the decisions of the index funds. In our recent Taubman Centers proxy contest, we asked shareholders to replace the chairman and lead director. Just days before the vote, Taubman\u2019s board agreed to destagger and refresh the board (moving to a board elected every year) \u2014 two top priorities for the passive funds in the stock.Despite receiving nearly unanimous support from active managers and full support from the proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Egan Jones, votes from the index funds combined with the Taubman family\u2019s 30 percent vote won the day for the company.The silver lining for all shareholders seeking change was that a board and management team that had previously ignored the will of shareholders got a loud and clear wake-up call: disenfranchising shareholders, maintaining poor corporate governance policies and underperforming peers are simply unacceptable.It\u2019s understandable that in this case the passive investors took the opportunity to effect real governance change in a proxy contest. Many of the active common shareholders were concerned that this change did not go far enough, a concern we shared.I am, however, optimistic that these passive funds will increasingly be willing to engage with active investors.This dialogue will help passive investors better use the knowledge and experience fundamental investors can bring through their years of engagement with these companies and the individuals that run them.Ultimately all investors \u2014 active, passive and activist \u2014 need each other to help instill accountability and fight back against poor governance, underperformance and corporate self-enrichment at the expense of shareholders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Partisan Conflict Is High, but the Market Doesn\u2019t Care", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe United States is so sharply divided that political consensus appears to fray almost daily. Yet two truths about politics can be demonstrated with hard numbers.The first is that partisan conflict doesn\u2019t just seem to have become more intense this year: It has actually reached new levels of nastiness.The second is that the stock market simply doesn\u2019t care. In fact, the rising acrimony has been a fine environment for stocks, though possibly detrimental to the economy itself.Nearly everything is quantified these days: how much we eat, how frequently we exercise, how much time we spend glancing at a Facebook post or reading an article. In the age of Big Data, why not measure trends in political vituperation?\u201cThe long-term trend is pretty impressive,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s safe to say that this year, partisan conflict in the United States has reached an all-time high.\u201dDespite periodic spikes around elections and specific political battles, conflict generally declined from 1891 until the early 1920s, remained fairly stable until 1965 \u2014 the year that the landmark Voting Rights Act was signed into law \u2014 and then began a long climb to its current stratospheric levels, she has found. One striking discovery is a clear \u201crally \u2019round the flag\u201d effect: Conflict ebbed in the early crisis of the Great Depression, in World War I and World War II.But contentiousness increased in the 1960s, accelerated during the Great Recession and leapt during the debt ceiling crises and health care battles of the Obama administration. It catapulted to previously unexplored levels with the election of President Trump and kept moving higher, the monthly Philadelphia Fed index shows.\u201cYou might not have expected that, with both branches of Congress and the presidency controlled by the same party,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. But the kinds of conflict measured by her indexes require three basic ingredients: disparate political preferences or views; the power to block or obstruct; and constraints, usually fiscal, that cause political eruptions. All of those are abundant now, she said.The widespread shock among many Democrats when Mr. Trump won the election in November appeared as a spike in the monthly index. \u201cI thought the index would go down after the election, but that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d she said.Instead, the index rose further after Mr. Trump issued widely contested executive orders on travel and on undocumented immigrants, she said, and the continuing emotional battles over the Affordable Care Act have intensified conflict.What\u2019s more, she said, fiscal constraints mean that even if the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress pivot toward the relatively popular goal of tax reform, the partisan conflict thermometer is likely to stay elevated.\u201cThe index picks up conflict over fiscal issues, and since the Great Recession, with debt levels so high, it\u2019s not easy to just cut taxes,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. \u201cA tax cut, even a simple one, raises questions about expenditures. What spending are you going to cut? Medicaid? Not without a lot of conflict.\u201dYou don\u2019t need a fancy index to know that people are angry and divided. But converting the shouting into numbers makes it possible to conduct comparative quantitative analysis. What scholars have found are negative correlations between partisan conflict and a variety of economic factors.And Professor Azzimonti has found negative correlations between conflict and foreign direct investment. \u201cIt makes sense that foreigners will be reluctant to invest in the United States when they don\u2019t know what Congress or the president are going to do, or what specific policies are going to be enacted,\u201d she said.Her econometric models suggest that increased conflict is associated with slower economic growth, perhaps because partisan conflict leads economic decision makers to defer productive risk-taking. But she can\u2019t prove cause and effect. \u201cCorrelations, yes, we see them, but causation is difficult to pin down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that others will pursue that.\u201dOne thing is clear, though: The stock market has gone on one of the greatest bull runs in history despite rising levels of partisan conflict. Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist with Ned Davis Research Group, and Alex Sun, a market analyst with that firm, pointed out in a recent note to clients that stocks tend to rise more rapidly when the Partisan Conflict Index soars. The title of their note was: \u201cStock Market to Politicians: Keep Arguing.\u201dProfessor Azzimonti says she can\u2019t explain it. \u201cWe economists don\u2019t really understand the stock market,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t. I\u2019m the worst trader in the world.\u201dEven in the era of Big Data, some mysteries have not been unraveled with numbers. Right now, the sublime indifference of the stock market is one of them.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Down the Mighty Columbia River, Where a Power Struggle Looms", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "To ride down the Columbia River as the John Day Dam\u2019s wall of concrete slowly fills the view from a tugboat is to see what the country\u2019s largest network of energy-producing dams created through five decades of 20th-century ambition, investment and hubris.Nearly half of the nation\u2019s hydropower electricity comes from more than 250 hydropower dams that were built on the Columbia and its tributaries \u2014 a vast and complex arc of industry and technology that touches tens of millions of lives across the West every day.The idea is part of a package of proposals that would transform much of the infrastructure in the United States to a mixture of public and private partnerships, lowering costs to taxpayers and improving efficiency, administration officials said. Assets of two other big public power operators, based in Colorado and Oklahoma, would be sold, too, if Congress approves the measure.Debates about government and its role in land and environmental policy are always highly charged. But perhaps nowhere could the proposed changes have a more significant impact than along the great river of the West \u2014 fourth largest by volume in North America, more than 10 times that of the Hudson. Privatization would transform a government service that requires equal standards across a vast territory \u2014 from large cities to tiny hamlets \u2014 into a private operation seeking maximum returns to investors.Wringing profits from a system that has provided electricity at cost would inevitably raise prices, critics of the idea said, while supporters envision a streamlined grid open to innovations that government managers cannot imagine.CANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,0001,000250KalispellDAM OWNERSHIPColumbia R.SeattlePolsonGovernmentCoeur d'AleneSpokanePrivateWenatcheeOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONTANAWASHINGTONMissoulaYakimaAstoriaLewistonRichlandLongviewWalla WallaButteBozemanIDAHOColumbia R.PortlandPACIFICOCEANColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsSalemCorvallisBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioBoiseIdaho FallsOREGONSnake R.WYOMINGBurleyTwin FallsCALIFORNIANEVADAUTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,000Columbia R.1,000Kalispell250Coeur d'AleneSpokaneSeattleDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.PrivateMissoulaWASH.AstoriaLongviewRichlandWalla WallaButteBozemanPortlandColumbia R.Columbia riverbasinSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPACIFICOCEANBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseORE.IDAHOSnake R.WYO.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.DAM OWNERSHIPMissoulaWASH.GovernmentRichlandPrivateButteColumbia riverbasinPortlandColumbia R.BozemanSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseIDAHOORE.Snake R.PocatelloTwin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityANNUAL ENERGYOUTPUTIn average megawattsCANADAChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000MONT.Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMissoulaDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentRichlandButtePrivateColumbia R.IDAHOJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPortlandBozemanSalemColumbia riverbasinWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneOntarioBendIdaho FallsBoiseORE.PocatelloSnake R.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentPrivate2,000250WASH.Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsSeattleColumbia R.MONT.PortlandColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsBrownlee Dam340 megawattsSnake R.ORE.IDAHOUTAHCALIF.NEV.A New York Times reporter and photographer went down the river in June, bunking with a five-man tug crew over 30 hours as workers cooked their meals, rested between shifts and transited through four dams and locks. We were looking for the interconnections of electricity and navigation, private industry and government management, engineering and biology, and what is at stake in this new energy debate.The possible fate of that system is raising alarms for some, and questions for almost everyone whose life connects to the river.\u201cThe uncertainty is the biggest thing of all: How would it work?\u201d Terry Oxley, the captain of the tugboat, the Crown Point, said as he gazed out over the water, hands flicking the controls with practiced aplomb. Mr. Oxley, 63, has worked the tugs for 39 years.\u201cI guess I want more input,\u201d he added. \u201cWho\u2019s going to control it? Who\u2019s going to have the say so? When are they going to release the water, the flood control, the spill patterns for the fish? It\u2019s such a big deal, and it\u2019s all intertwined.\u201d\u201cNo room for error,\u201d he said as he slowed the tug to a crawl approaching the locks at McNary Dam, 200 miles upriver from Portland. The Crown Point had picked up a 14,000-ton load in Pasco, Wash. \u2014 three barges of wheat and one empty fuel tanker \u2014 before taking it to Vancouver, Wash. Crew members were posted on the four barges pushed by the tug, reporting back by radio as the distance to the walls of the lock narrowed to inches.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing a lot of energy,\u201d Mr. Wyatt, 41, said. \u201cWe hit something even at one mile an hour, it makes a big boom.\u201dThe dams and the locks that make up Mr. Wyatt\u2019s workplace were built by engineers who utterly transformed \u2014 or destroyed, depending on your point of view \u2014 what had been one of the wildest rivers in America.The dams blocked the river\u2019s flow, creating a network of placid reservoirs. Irrigation canals spidered out, fostering one of the nation\u2019s richest breadbaskets in the orchards and vineyards of Washington. Mammoth turbines powered the airplane factories of Puget Sound and the boom of postwar California.But development came with costs. Native American tribes saw their lands destroyed. Salmon stocks, already decimated by overfishing, were driven into further peril by rising water temperatures and dams that made it harder for fish to move up- and downriver in their ancient cycles of reproduction.Native American tribal leaders said that the old river would never come back, but that the federal government was now bound, through court decisions and treaties, to work with tribes going forward.\u201cObligations are tied to the federal relationship,\u201d said Jaime A. Pinkham, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a member of the Nez Perc\u00e9 tribe. \u201cWhen you privatize, what happens to the voice of the Indian people?\u201dThe new proposal would keep the electricity-making in government control, while spinning off the system of getting that electricity to market. Partial privatization would require complex new contracts delineating the responsibilities of the public and private partners. And what feeds into that system has grown more complicated since the 1980s as well, with a huge growth of new sources like wind and solar.But some energy experts who back the Trump plan said that despite the thorny details, a powerful word could resonate in Congress: fairness. Low prices in a nonprofit system have been a huge boost to economic growth in this corner of the nation.\u201cWe should have a debate about why some minority of Americans get subsidized power and others don\u2019t,\u201d said Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute.Government brought electricity to remote rural towns starting in the 1930s, and people there haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201cWhen you have something that works, having caution about changing it seems reasonable,\u201d he said.In cities like The Dalles, 90 minutes east of Portland, Google has become a community patron of sorts, too, residents said, with grants to libraries and schools.\u201cGoogle has been good for us,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Steve Lawrence. \u201cThey\u2019re a full partner.\u201dWind revenue is paying for the expansion of the Sherman County Courthouse and the annual dividend checks that property owners in the county have received. Kathy McCullough said kilowatt dollars had become important to her family farm\u2019s budget, hedging against fluctuations in wheat prices.Bonneville power managers repeatedly hit the off switch on wind this year in Sherman \u2014 curtailment is the term \u2014 because too much water was coming through the dams after last winter\u2019s huge snowpack, which in turn meant more hydroelectricity flowing through the grid.More curtailments have happened this year than ever before, according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, as Bonneville managers struggled to keep the system in balance. A change in ownership, supporters of the Trump plan in Sherman said, could be good for them in opening new opportunities for wind power sales.\u201cThe B.P.A. does a terrible job,\u201d Ms. McCullough said in reference to Bonneville Power. \u201cI don\u2019t know that privatizing would be bad at all.\u201dSome environmental groups also chafe against Bonneville, for the access fees that they said could discourage wind development and the system\u2019s difficulties in juggling all of the new energy sources.But Doug Howell, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in Washington State, said privatizing would not solve those problems \u2014 and could in fact make them worse.\u201cThe answer is not privatizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s integration.\u201dOne longtime veteran of river management said the new argument over the power system\u2019s future just reprised an old question: Whom does the Columbia belong to?\u201cEverybody takes a piece of the Columbia,\u201d said Tom Eckman, a senior adviser to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. \u201cAnd then they have to collaborate and cooperate over its resources, or fight over them.\u201dSource: Dam data from the Northwest Power and Conservation CouncilAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Fees Are Great, if You Actually Get Them", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith investment costs, less is more. Many investors are getting the message that paying less for mutual funds (or for any investment, really) will put more money in their pockets in the long run.But investment costs are full of unpleasant surprises, and academic studies have found that many people aren\u2019t taking advantage of better-priced alternatives.\u201cIn one part of the market there is enormous cost competition, and investors there have never had it better: They can buy funds almost for free,\u201d said Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel with the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.\u201cBut outside of that space, there isn\u2019t as much competition,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors need better information about what they\u2019re paying and what they\u2019re getting.\u201dBy now, many people understand that fund fees take a toll on returns.Now, many cost-conscious investors are voting with their wallets.Last year, there were $326 billion in outflows from the highest-cost actively managed funds, and a record $429 billion in inflows to the lowest-cost index funds, according to Morningstar\u2019s analysis of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the United States.As a result, the market share of low-cost passive funds swelled to 32 percent in 2016, from 23 percent in 2012.On the face of it, there is a benevolent domino effect happening: As more investors choose cheaper funds, the assets in those funds grow \u2014 and the corresponding costs further decline. Or they should.But positive as this trend may be, it masks some glaring, persistent differences in fund costs throughout the industry, said Michael J. Cooper, a professor of finance at the University of Utah. \u201cExpense ratios are dropping, which is wonderful,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the disparity between high-cost funds and low-cost funds hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dEven controlling for characteristics like a fund\u2019s style, size and risk level, the study revealed a constant disparity in fund pricing over time \u2014 and the risk of lower returns for those who buy pricier funds, because of the compounding effect of fees.\u201cThe costs for getting it wrong \u2014 investing in high-expense funds when close-to-identical low-expense funds are available \u2014 are large,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe show that a low-expense fund investor could have earned 70 percent to 145 percent more\u201d than someone who chose comparable funds at a higher price.The authors looked at the effect of fees over a 48-year horizon, which helped to show the potentially dramatic toll of investment costs over decades.The analysis built on work by other researchers who had found that Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index funds, which merely track the S.&.P. 500, show a surprisingly wide price gap, \u201cdespite being basically the same peanut butter,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. He found that, for the period of 2000 to 2014, an investor in the lowest-cost S.&.P. 500 index funds would have ended up with a balance 22 percent higher than someone who invested in the highest-cost funds.\u201cIt\u2019s baffling,\u201d said Mr. Hauptman of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cYou have nearly identical funds, yet one can cost 1 percent more than the other. In a competitive environment, why do these products exist?\u201dYet they do. Even confining one\u2019s view to the landscape of S.&.P. 500 index funds \u2014 often referred to as plain vanilla funds because they simply mirror the performance of big companies \u2014 the range of choices is dizzying. There are about 50 different S.&.P. 500 funds, with over 150 different share classes, according to Morningstar, and fees vary widely.What can account for such stark differences? One reason Vanguard maintains such low fees is the economy of scale of its equity index funds, which are among the biggest and cheapest in the industry.Rydex funds, by contrast, have fewer assets under management, which can drive up costs. And the Rydex S.&.P. 500 fund \u201cis more expensive than some other index funds because it is priced twice a day and designed for tactical fund traders,\u201d said Ivy McLemore, a spokesman for Guggenheim Investments, which offers the Rydex funds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Top Fed Job, Slow and Steady Beats Wall Street Brash", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsOnly in Trumpland can Gary D. Cohn be considered a suitable Federal Reserve chairman.The registered New York Democrat did not have a government background when he became director of the National Economic Council. Still, he had honed his finance skills during more than 25 years at Goldman, and he quickly hired White House staff members with complementary experience. His operation contrasted with those of cabinet members like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who struggled to answer basic questions about school curriculums in her confirmation hearing.Choosing Mr. Cohn as head of the central bank would be an unconventional pick. Over the last 40 years, Fed chiefs have been economists and have also served at least two four-year terms. Ms. Yellen will have served only one if Mr. Trump does not renominate her. The last one-term, noneconomist Fed chairman was G. William Miller, who had been the chief executive of Textron before President Jimmy Carter tapped him. At a time of high inflation, his policies tanked the dollar and he lasted just over a year.Mr. Cohn spent much of his time at Goldman as a trader. He joined its J. Aron commodities unit and became the head of the divisions for fixed income, equities and global securities before he became the company\u2019s president. Goldman is known as the most alpha of the investment banks, and the hard-charging job fit Mr. Cohn\u2019s personality.Running the central bank is a more sedate affair. The staff consists of number crunchers with doctorates in economics who pore over various models to analyze growth and employment. News conferences after meetings by the interest-rate-setting committee are carefully scripted. Ms. Yellen, like her forebears, chooses her words carefully, knowing any hint of surprise can rattle markets.Her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, learned that in 2013, when he said the central bank would no longer be purchasing bonds, causing United States Treasury yields to surge in what became known as the \u201ctaper tantrum.\u201d Mr. Cohn, a blunt talker, may find such restrictions suffocating. Markets will prefer a more boring choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Possible Alternative to Stocks and Bonds: Commodities?", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaking a case that the stock market isn\u2019t expensive these days often means dragging Tina into the conversation.Tina is short for \u201cThere is no alternative.\u201d It is a claim that after a decade of loose monetary policy and low interest rates, bonds, the traditional alternative to stocks, are no better a bargain than high-flying stocks.Yet there may be one alternative to stocks. Commodities got cheaper through much of the second quarter, adding to several years of mediocre-to-weak performance. Gold and silver were hit hard. So were materials that work for a living, such as iron ore, copper, oil (and substances refined from it), although some of them staged rebounds late in the period, as did many agricultural products.Ordinary investors can take positions in commodities through funds that hold them directly or that own shares of companies that mine, grow or process them. But should they? Prices have tumbled, but have they tumbled enough?Investment advisers are divided on whether commodities are on the verge of reversing their poor performance, compared with stocks, and some who do think so aren\u2019t especially enthusiastic about it. There is wider agreement that commodities or shares of production companies are worth owning for the sake of broadening a portfolio and reducing risk.\u201cThe stock market as a whole looks expensive to us,\u201d said Matt Kadnar, an asset allocation specialist for GMO, \u201cbut commodity stocks look like they\u2019re trading at a bit of a discount, relative to where they have traded historically, and there\u2019s a diversification benefit.\u201d\u201cHaving some element of your portfolio in commodity-based equities makes sense,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s much harder to call them a strong buy, as you could have 15 months ago when they were being taken to the cleaners.\u201d That was around the time crude oil was trading at multiyear lows, in the mid-$20s a barrel, roughly half of where it is now. Agricultural products and industrial and precious metals were also near long-term bottoms.Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, agrees that commodity producers\u2019 stocks would have been a better buy then, but he still thinks they are worthwhile now and likely to perform well in the second half as evidence mounts of a broadening global economic recovery.\u201cAs commodities have gone out of vogue, commodity-oriented companies are probably cheap, although I would have said that with a lot more conviction in the first quarter of 2016,\u201d Mr. Memani said. \u201cAs the synchronized global growth picture persists, the discount may disappear.\u201dOne reason that Mr. Kadnar thinks shares of production companies have recovered less than they should have is that there is a bias against them that actually creates long-term value.\u201cOne of the things we like about commodity equities is that managers tend to avoid them,\u201d he said.Mr. Kadnar was hinting at a shortcoming inherent in investing in commodities: There are no correct fundamental prices for them. Yardsticks like price-earnings ratios exist to indicate whether stocks are reasonably valued, but commodities typically move, often with violent swings, in response to ephemeral and often unpredictable economic, industrial and even meteorological events.Investors can work around those difficulties, said Scott E. Wolle, chief investment officer for global asset allocation at Invesco, by comparing recent prices with their very long-term averages (most commodities are trading well below their average prices over the last 10 years, he noted) and choosing exposure to a broad range of markets, seeking diversification into and within commodities.\u201cThat\u2019s a long-term measure of value that should put you on the right side of the trade,\u201d he said.Exchange-traded funds with a diversified range of physical commodities include iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust, PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund and United States Commodity Index Fund. The first two are heavily weighted toward energy commodities; the third has equal allocations of 14 commodities.E.T.F.s for production-company stocks generally focus on narrower segments, like SPDR S&P Metals & Mining, FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund and VanEck Vectors Agribusiness.Commodities are useful in hedging against inflation, Mr. Wolle said. He acknowledged that inflation has been subdued worldwide for many years and that commodity prices have suffered for it, but they remain \u201cone of the few assets that can protect you against that.\u201dCertain commodities, most notably gold, also serve as hedges against political uncertainty and upheaval, Mr. Wolle said. There certainly has been some of that in the last several months, and gold has rallied about 20 percent from its low in late 2015.With global monetary policy still loose, he recommends exposure to precious metals to guard against any uptick in inflation. The immediate outlook is also auspicious for industrial metals and energy, in his view, as economic growth picks up in more parts of the world, though he advises steering clear of agricultural commodities.As for how to get exposure, Mr. Wolle favors the materials themselves, or funds that own them directly, rather than commodity stocks. Some companies hedge their own exposure by using derivative contracts that lock in a specific price for what they produce, limiting the benefit of rising prices, he pointed out.The Wells Fargo Investment Institute, by contrast, favors a none-of-the-above approach when it comes to short-term allocations to commodities. It has been bearish since the start of the year and predicts weakness into 2018, in line with its bullish outlook on the dollar, which tends to move in the opposite direction from commodities.But John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at the institute, conceded in a recent report that \u201cthe U.S. dollar could make us wrong should it become unexpectedly, excessively weak.\u201d Noting that gold, an alternative currency for thousands of years, is more sensitive to movements in the dollar than other commodities, he added, \u201cGold is where we could be really wrong.\u201dEven if commodities bounce back, they may not bounce that high, Mr. Memani of OppenheimerFunds cautioned.\u201cCommodities are probably in a good place, relative to the supply/demand dynamic,\u201d but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean prices are going back to the old highs\u201d achieved around six years ago.\u201cPeople imputed special value to commodities based on the growth spurt from 2000 to 2007 driven by an investment and construction boom in emerging markets, and China in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cAs that demand accelerated in a meaningful way, it helped prices, but that in turn brought in new supply and depressed prices. Unless we get a new boom, the chance of prices going back to that level is pretty small.\u201dIt\u2019s clear that commodities cost a lot less than they did several years ago and that stocks cost a lot more. But given the variety of opinions about commodities, it\u2019s less clear they are the best of the alternatives that value-conscious investors look for, even if the others aren\u2019t so great, either. So investors should be careful when considering what, how and why to buy.\u201cWith commodities, like anything else, there are no easy answers,\u201d Mr. Kadnar said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Believing the Fed \u2014 for Now", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho are you going to believe, the Fed or your own eyes?But so far there is little evidence that Wall Street is worried. Despite the occasional swoon in technology stocks and the persistent decline in energy issues, the market continued to rise through the second quarter. The SPDR S.&P. 500 Trust, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, returned 3.1 percent for the period, including dividends.But the bond market did not completely ignore the erosion in economic data. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent and were as low as 2.1 percent in the last week of June.Investment advisers express concern about the worsening economic readings, but are willing, for the moment, to accept the Fed\u2019s contention that they represent a dip in an otherwise robust expansion. They warn, however, that if the weakness lingers, it may be time to start believing their own eyes and lighten up on stocks.The interest rate increases are not \u201cnegative or problematic yet,\u201d said Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer of multi-asset class investing at Neuberger Berman. But \u201cif economic growth and inflation continue to come in very soft and potentially roll over, it\u2019s possible that the Fed will engage in a policy mistake.\u201dA widely followed, continually updated forecast of national economic output from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta declined to 2.6 percent annual growth for the second quarter from an earlier 4.3 percent outlook around the beginning of May. That is after a meager 1.4 percent annualized growth announced for the first quarter.In another sign that the economy is flagging, demand for credit has moderated. After increasing at more than 7 percent a year in 2014 and 2015, the rate slipped to 6.5 percent last year and just 2.6 percent in April, according to the Fed.The yield curve has flattened, meaning long-term bond yields have fallen as short-term rates have risen. An inverted yield curve, in which short rates are higher than long rates, often heralds a recession.Meta indicators like the Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which compares economic readings with forecasts, went from its highest level in more than three years, recorded in mid-March, to a six-year low around the end of June.Investors are facing \u201ca little bit of a mixed message\u201d from the hawkish Fed and the feeble economic indicators, said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Sextant International Fund. Stocks have remained strong, in his view, because investors are choosing to believe messages coming from Washington, and not just from the Fed.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of hope in the marketplace, in particular hope for reforms from the federal government\u201d to overhaul the tax code and spend big money upgrading the nation\u2019s infrastructure, Mr. Klimo said. He cautioned that investors had become conspicuously complacent, but then added that \u201cabsent some external shock, it does seem as though things can cruise along for a little bit\u201d in the stock market.He envisions biotechnology and other health care stocks cruising along better than most, as effective ways to overhaul the provision of medical care continue to elude policy makers. The right blockbuster drugs can enrich the companies that make them while saving lives at lower cost than other treatments. Cancer drugs developed by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb are notably promising, he said.Health care was among the strongest groups of stock funds in the second quarter, with the average portfolio up 6.5 percent, according to Morningstar. Industrials and natural resources were notably weak. As well as the health funds did, they managed on average to trail the 7 percent return of Health Care Select Sector SPDR, a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector.The average domestic stock fund over all was up 2.7 percent in the period. Bond funds rose 1.4 percent.International stock funds beat their domestic counterparts handily. The average one gained 5.6 percent, led by portfolios that invest in Europe, China and India.Given their concerns about valuations and economic growth, it\u2019s no surprise that investment advisers are looking abroad for opportunities. Mr. Klimo is a fan of Chinese internet stocks, like Tencent and Alibaba. Like many investors, he is unenthusiastic about oil, he said.Tim Guinness, chief investment officer of Guinness Atkinson Funds, also likes stocks in China and the region around it.\u201cThe cheapest part of the world is the Far East\u201d excluding Japan, he said. \u201cChina is making a good transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.\u201dMr. Guinness foresees China following the same path of development that Japan did from 1970 to 1990, an excellent time to own Japanese stocks.\u201cWe\u2019re increasing our weightings significantly to the Far East and reducing them to the U.S.,\u201d he said.He is wary of American stocks because he finds them expensive. He has no concern about the Fed raising rates during a period of iffy economic growth.\u201cThe time is well past for stopping quantitative easing and increasing interest rates,\u201d Mr. Guinness said. Quantitative easing is the program of asset purchases that the Fed used to shore up the economy after the financial crisis. The Fed is expected soon to start disposing of the assets it bought, another source of worry for many investors.Mr. Guinness cited a number of largely overlooked difficulties resulting from extremely low rates. Low rates limit the earnings of banks, forcing them to be overly cautious in their lending. Low bond returns limit returns for savers and force companies to add more cash to their pension plans, reducing capital investment.\u201cYou\u2019ll be amazed that interest rates going up will be good for markets, not bad,\u201d he said.Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, maintains a bullish outlook on the stock market and a glass-half-full view of the economy. The yield curve may be flattening, but at least it\u2019s not inverted. As for the Citi surprise index, he finds it to be a volatile indicator that often bounces back quickly from plunges like the recent one as economists adjust their expectations after the data disappoints them.\u201cI think the economy is still performing pretty much the way it has been since 2010,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. The modest growth in the first quarter, the most recent one for which a figure has been released, \u201cseems slow, but you\u2019ve got slower growth in the labor force.\u201dThe number of people available to work is not expanding as much as it used to, limiting economic growth. He noted that the meager growth rate had been enough to keep unemployment below 5 percent. That should allow the Fed to nudge short-term interest rates to 2 percent next year, he predicted, from about 1 percent after the June increase, and give the central bank ammunition if the economy begins to stall.One benefit of the modest pace of growth is that even with so few out of work, Mr. Yardeni said, inflation remains low. Consumer prices rose just 1.6 percent in the 12 months through June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the unemployment rate was only 4.4 percent. For May, the Atlanta Fed recorded national wage inflation of 3.4 percent.\u201cAs long as inflation remains subdued, and as long as we don\u2019t have a recession, bonds and stocks should continue to work,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, wonders how long low inflation will continue to support the markets. He warned in a note to investors that inflation is a risk, despite the tepid economic growth.Wage growth has been tame, but with few suitable people left to hire for companies that need to expand to meet consumer demand, it could flare up, he said. Productivity growth, often a way to keep a lid on prices, has been low after years of modest capital investment, he added.\u201cInvestors should prepare for both wage and consumer price inflation to rise between 3 and 4 percent in the next couple years,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThis does not imply a recession is looming or a bear market for stocks is imminent,\u201d but \u201cit implies a major investor mind-set change.\u201dEven with inflation quiescent, the rich valuations and a so-so, or worse, economy make even some bulls less than enthusiastic about stocks.\u201cIf someone came into a lot of money and asked what to do with it, they have my condolences,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. \u201cEverything has been picked over.\u201d He added, though, that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee any particular reasons to get out of stocks or bonds at this point.\u201dHe encouraged investors to stick with stocks that have healthy dividend yields, and he prefers technology as a rare source of growth these days and energy stocks as \u201ca good contrary bet.\u201d He would also give emerging markets a chance. But not all of them.\u201cIndia stands out, China does not,\u201d he said, disagreeing with Mr. Guinness.Mr. Knutzen at Neuberger Berman recommended Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which are Treasury notes and bonds that rise in value if inflation goes up, and debt issued in emerging economies. He has been reducing exposure to stocks of large American companies and investing more in smaller companies and overseas markets where valuations are lower.\u201cWe have become more cautious in our views,\u201d Mr. Knutzen said. The economic backdrop provides \u201can O.K. environment for stocks, but there\u2019s not much margin for error.\u201dAdvertisement"}
