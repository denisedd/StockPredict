{"Headline": "Charles W. Bachman, Business Software Innovator, Dies at 92", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles W. Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92.His daughter Chandini Bachman confirmed his death.Mr. Bachman was a pioneer in the field of database management software. His work would later be eclipsed by that of other innovators, and software tools have changed drastically over the years. But behind every product search on Amazon, movie recommendation on Netflix or bid on eBay, there is a flood of digital communications mediated by database management software, which owes an intellectual debt to Mr. Bachman.He was working for General Electric when he developed a layer of software that allowed programmers to retrieve data for an automated manufacturing system that controlled a variety of tasks \u2014 production scheduling, parts ordering and inventory management.His Integrated Data Store software, first demonstrated in 1963, made it possible to share data across different applications. That capability had been talked about before, but Mr. Bachman was the first to carry it out.His software was crucial to converting the G.E. manufacturing-control system from an idea to a reality, an impressive technical feat given the limitations of the primitive computers at the time.In 1973, Mr. Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to database technology. The award is often described as the Nobel Prize for computer science. In 2014, Mr. Bachman visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama.Mr. Bachman was the first Turing Award recipient who did not have a Ph.D. The earlier winners of the prize, which was first issued in 1966, had academic backgrounds, mainly as mathematicians or physicists. Mr. Bachman had degrees in mechanical engineering, a bachelor\u2019s from Michigan State College and a master\u2019s from the University of Pennsylvania.Mr. Bachman spent his career in the business world at a series of companies large and small, including Dow Chemical, G.E., Honeywell and a start-up backed by venture capital in the 1980s.Yet it was the application of computing to business problems \u2014 rather than business itself \u2014 that Mr. Bachman found appealing.\u201cHe was always an engineer at heart,\u201d said Thomas Haigh, a technology historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who interviewed Mr. Bachman for an oral history project and studied his work. \u201cHe was motivated by the joy of tinkering with complex systems and making things work better.\u201dCharles William Bachman III was born on Dec. 11, 1924, in Manhattan, Kan., the second of four children of Grace Marie Cary Bachman and Charles W. Bachman Jr. His father was the football coach at Kansas State College, and later at Michigan State.The younger Mr. Bachman grew to be a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches, and he inherited his father\u2019s fondness for sports, but his real passion was building and fixing things. \u201cI was always going to be an engineer,\u201d Mr. Bachman told Mr. Haigh in 2004.Mr. Bachman graduated early from high school, took spring and summer courses at Michigan State and then joined the Army in 1943, serving two years in the artillery corps in New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Antiaircraft guns at the time used simple mechanical computers to target a plane\u2019s predicted flight path, a rudimentary primer for Mr. Bachman\u2019s later work.After the war, Mr. Bachman returned to Michigan State to complete his undergraduate degree in 1948. The following year, he married Constance Hadley, shortly after she graduated from Michigan State. They were married for 62 years. She died in 2012.Besides his daughter Chandini, Mr. Bachman is survived by a brother, J. Cary; three other children, Thomas, Jonathan and Sara Bachman Ducey; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Mr. Bachman began his engineering career with big companies that were starting to use computers \u2014 Dow Chemical, G.E. and Honeywell, which bought G.E.\u2019s computer business in 1970. During that time, Mr. Bachman took a leading role in computing organizations, which were establishing standards for how data is represented, shared and modeled.Later in his career, Mr. Bachman worked for smaller companies and started one of his own, Bachman Information Systems, in 1983. It focused on a technology called computer-aided software engineering that was intended to make creating software easier by offering programmers graphical tools instead of requiring them to write code line by line. His company attracted funding from two leading venture capital firms, Venrock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and it enjoyed some early success. It sold shares in a public offering in 1991, and its stock price surged for a while.The young company had some impressive technology. But it failed to catch the shift to personal computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows software and lower-cost applications programs. The remnants of Bachman Information Systems went through a couple of mergers and eventually sold to a larger corporation.\u201cCharlie was always the architect, not a managerial C.E.O. type,\u201d said Jonathan Bachman, a software project manager who worked with his father for years. \u201cAnd a lot of what he designed lives on, in a new guise, today.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Yelp\u2019s Six-Year Grudge Against Google", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp, the local search and reviewing site, would like this article to be focused on his company\u2019s growth, or on how its reviews help independent businesses, or on pretty much anything besides what it is about: how Yelp became Google\u2019s most tenacious pest.\u201cIf you were to have asked me 15 years ago, \u2018Hey, are you going to be an antitrust crusader?\u2019 I would have said, \u2018No, I have no interest in that,\u2019\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThat was not a childhood dream.\u201dGoogle wasn\u2019t always a rival. At one point, it was a suitor. But out of that union that never happened was born a mighty grudge, perhaps even an obsession.At one point, Yelp held a hackathon to create a sort of alternate-universe Google, the better for it to explain Google\u2019s ways to regulators. And then you have Luther Lowe.Unlike Google, whose office is full of artwork and free food, Yelp\u2019s Washington presence is just a rented co-working space. So Mr. Lowe keeps the elephant at Yelp\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, where there is more room. \u201cThis is a shoestring operation,\u201d he said.Asked about future investigations, Margrethe Vestager, the antitrust chief, offered a diplomatic answer, saying that even though other cases make similar allegations against Google, they must be considered one by one.\u201cThe one thing that has sort of changed from yesterday, before the decision was taken, was that now we will consider Google as a dominant company,\u201d she said.Yelp is one of a number of American companies \u2014 Microsoft and Oracle are others \u2014 that have agitated for the world\u2019s governments to take up the fight against Google. It is one tiny player, but through persistence and doggedness, and by being loud and public with its complaints, it has become an unusually prominent voice.Mr. Stoppelman feels he has no choice. Like a lot of small internet companies, Yelp lives in a world where one company, Google, accounts for an outsize share of its business, and could destroy it at any time. Its complaints to regulators are less about working toward some epic and definitive conclusion than they are about continuously brushing back the giant so Yelp can have more room to grow.\u201cIt\u2019s like, you get traffic from this company, and this company is a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re me, it seems like the obvious move.\u201dYelp\u2019s campaign against Google provides an inside look at a constant battle in the technology industry: the conflict between large companies that control how people use technology and the internet, and the smaller, more vulnerable businesses that live inside those platforms.Be it Netscape, whose 1990s-era internet browser was the catalyst for antitrust charges against Microsoft and its Windows operating system, or Spotify, whose music service must now compete with Apple\u2019s own music app, any company trying to build a business on another company\u2019s system runs the risk of being snuffed out or swallowed up.For Yelp, the issue is where Google displays \u201corganic\u201d website rankings \u2014 the ones spit out by its algorithm \u2014 in relation to the \u201cvertical\u201d results that Google itself provides.For example, say you searched for \u201csteakhouse New York.\u201d The first set of results, consuming the entire screen of a mobile phone, is a map and a set of restaurants from Google\u2019s local offering. The results have information like hours, stars and customer reviews. Below that are links to reviews, articles and other sites. Like Yelp.Yelp\u2019s contention is that by putting its own results at the top, Google is giving itself an unfair advantage, because those results don\u2019t have to jump through the same algorithmic hoops non-Google sites are subjected to. And since Yelp says few people go beyond the first or second result, companies like Yelp are made invisible.Local queries \u2014 such as looking for nearby restaurants \u2014 account for roughly a third of all search traffic. So Google has a big incentive to keep people within its search engine, where it can sell ads, instead of sending them to Yelp, which also sells ads.This dispute would be moot if people were in the habit of using a variety of search engines. Google has become so universally known and depended upon that it is sometimes hard to remember that it is a company, and it exists to make money.But as Microsoft learned in its 1990s antitrust battle, companies can face a heap of legal problems when their platform becomes so popular that people hardly use anything else. With one strike against it now in Europe, Google may be increasingly careful about how it treats competitors throughout the search engine.\u201cEven if nothing else takes place, a consequence of this kind of intervention, so visible and so significant, has been to give other firms more room to maneuver,\u201d said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the United States Federal Trade Commission and now a professor at the George Washington University Law School.Google is sitting on close to $100 billion in cash, so the $2.7 billion fine \u2014 a sum larger than Yelp\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 is hardly unmanageable.A larger concern is that the decision, and the potential for other antitrust actions, will limit Google\u2019s ability to position ads around its search box. And for all the talk about self-driving cars and delivery drones, Google is still the foundation of a big advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been as concerned as we are following this ruling,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, after the fine was announced.The impact is hard to discern, because it\u2019s impossible to judge whether Google has done wrong \u2014 and if so, how to make things right \u2014 without delving into minute detail about software algorithms and concepts like \u201cconsumer harm.\u201d Explaining all that, in a way that ordinary people can understand, has been Yelp\u2019s principal challenge with regulators. The war over how Google serves up information has been an information war.In summer 2004, a few months before the highly anticipated moment when Google first took its shares to market, Mr. Stoppelman got the flu. He searched the internet for a doctor, but instead of learning anything \u2014 like whether a doctor\u2019s patients were satisfied, or the ease of getting an appointment \u2014 he kept landing on insurance websites.This gave him an idea: How about a site where users rate and review local services? He and a co-founder got $1 million from investors and began work on the site that became Yelp. A year later, Yelp signed a two-year licensing deal that allowed Google to use Yelp content.\u201cIt was better to be friends than enemies at that stage,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said.Later, when the deal came up for renewal, Google told Mr. Stoppelman that it would soon add a feature allowing its own users to review and rate local services. Worried that Google wanted to create a parallel service that would snuff out his company, Mr. Stoppelman declined to renew the license.By 2011, Google was facing inquiries by various federal and state authorities along with regulators in Europe and Asia. It had steadily added services focused on areas like local businesses, comparison shopping and travel, and companies were complaining that it was giving its own properties preferred treatment in results.That year, Mr. Stoppelman got worried about something else. Google, he said, was taking Yelp\u2019s reviews and using them in Google products that competed with Yelp. When he raised these concerns, he said, Google responded that it was displaying information derived from search results, and that if Yelp objected, it could simply withhold its content from the search engine.Given Google\u2019s market share, the response amounted to saying \u201ctake yourself off the internet,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cThat would have destroyed the company, so it was a false choice.\u201dYelp took its first step into the regulatory arena that July, when Vince Sollitto, the company\u2019s senior vice president for communications and government relations, accused Google of stealing Yelp content at a conference of state attorneys general.The next day, according to Mr. Stoppelman, a Google executive sent him an email saying it would stop. A Google spokesman said the decision had been made long before, and was unrelated to the prosecutors\u2019 gathering. Nonetheless, Yelp concluded that there was no better way to get Google\u2019s attention than to raise the specter of regulation.\u201cThe pattern was that they would do something pushing the envelope or, frankly, evil, and we would complain about it privately, and they would say they would fix it, and nothing would happen,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cWe realized that if we were going to get what we wanted, we had to be very scrappy.\u201d\u201cI thought, this is a chance to totally refine our strategy,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.Mr. Lowe is from Arkansas and speaks with a slight drawl. He is passionate and garrulous and has a habit of sometimes tattooing his audience with a mix of detailed history and arcane policy points about Yelp\u2019s problems with Google. He is crushed if listeners don\u2019t find it to be as big a deal as he does.He said he learned some hard lessons when the F.T.C. closed its Google investigation. The first was that antitrust law is boring, complicated and political. The second was that technology is difficult to explain, even to regulators.Mr. Sollitto, who made the presentation at the prosecutors\u2019 meeting, said that during the trade commission\u2019s case, he had found himself making imperfect analogies, such as the one that Google was the only store in town and put all of its own products on the best shelves. Not an unusual thing for a merchant to do, he concedes, except that Google puts competitors\u2019 products on shelves that are out of reach.\u201cWe were having a difficult time explaining to the F.T.C. why consumers were harmed,\u201d he said.In March 2013, Mr. Lowe asked Yelp engineers if they could build an online simulator showing what Google would look like if its own services had to live by the algorithm dictating the position of third-party services, like Yelp.\u201cThey need something they can touch and experience,\u201d he wrote in an email.During a company hackathon, engineers created software that produced pages of search results ranked purely by an algorithm and compared them with Google\u2019s presentation. Their conclusion, which Google disputes, is that Google was providing its users with less useful information by steering them to its own products instead of results from around the web.That month, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, then the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, announced he was discussing a possible settlement with Google, and asked interested parties for comments. In addition to the legal documents it had sent to the F.T.C., Yelp submitted a white paper that it said showed users preferred outside companies\u2019 results over Google\u2019s in-house products.\u201cYou can do PowerPoints all day long, but it\u2019s hard for people to understand until they can sit in the driver\u2019s seat and come up with their own searches and see the results for themselves,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.When Mr. Almunia\u2019s term ended without a settlement, and Ms. Vestager became Europe\u2019s new head of competition, Yelp went into a full-on political campaign. Mr. Lowe started building a small European government-relations operation, which he staffed with employees from companies and consumer groups that were also pursuing complaints about Google.Mr. Lowe bid for it online, and ended up spending $3,000. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I had to have it,\u201d he said.A few months after Europe filed its first antitrust charges, Microsoft withdrew its regulatory complaints against the search giant because of \u201cchanging legal priorities.\u201d Last year, it dropped out of FairSearch, an anti-Google industry group.Mr. Stoppelman said Yelp had no real choice but to keep at the regulators. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the overall competition playbook for us,\u201d he said.It would be hard to find a drier assessment than the one from Mark Mahaney, a veteran internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco. Mr. Mahaney covers both Google\u2019s stock and Yelp\u2019s. Right now, he recommends buying Google, but not Yelp.Asked about Yelp\u2019s regulatory battles with Google, Mr. Mahaney said he had no idea what kind of impact, if any, it might have on the company\u2019s prospects. Still, it never hurts to try.\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the decision by Yelp to go to regulators made a lot of business sense.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Perella Weinberg Hires Tech Specialist to Court More Traditional Companies", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany investment banks are eager to stock up on technology specialists who can advise Silicon Valley denizens on mergers, initial public offerings and other transformative transactions.With its latest hire, however, the boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners wants to court more traditional companies and help show how technology is set to disrupt them.The firm is expected to announce on Monday that it has hired Richard Sherlund as a partner in its San Francisco office. Although Mr. Sherlund has a long history in technology \u2014 first as a research analyst and then as an investment banker \u2014 his role is focused more on helping clients outside that world better understand how the latest trends will reshape their businesses.Mr. Sherlund most recently served as chairman of software investment banking at Barclays. He first rose to prominence at Goldman Sachs, where he became head of United States technology research over his 25-year tenure there. During that time, he became known as a top student of software companies like Microsoft and Oracle.\u201cI think back to a comment that Larry Ellison once made about tech,\u201d Mr. Sherlund said in a telephone interview about the constant changes in the tech industry. \u201cIt\u2019s like a mystery novel, and I can\u2019t shut that book.\u201dHe left Goldman and briefly worked at Galleon Group, a hedge fund caught up in a huge insider trading case, before ending up at the Japanese bank Nomura as the head of its United States tech research team.But it was not until the move to Barclays in 2015 that Mr. Sherlund jumped from research to investment banking. And it was there that he began thinking about how to advise companies on how technology could alter their businesses.He eventually contacted Peter A. Weinberg, a co-founder of Perella Weinberg, and Robert K. Steel, the firm\u2019s chief executive, both of whom he knew from his Goldman days. Talks about the possibility of a job there eventually blossomed into Mr. Sherlund\u2019s new position.The presence of so many Goldman alumni, and the related culture, was another big draw, Mr. Sherlund said.\u201cThat culture of collaboration is the right cultural fit for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Weinberg said in an interview that the firm was looking to avoid what he described as the siloed nature of traditional investment banks, where bankers have specific industry responsibilities and rarely dived into others\u2019 lanes.\u201cIn the past, you had a meeting with an industry guy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe meeting of tomorrow, it\u2019s going to involve an industry banker, a product banker and a technology banker.\u201dAt Perella Weinberg, Mr. Sherlund is expected to work closely with Stefan Green, who joined the firm in 2014 in its San Francisco office \u2014 and is yet another Goldman alum.\u201cRick and I are highly complementary,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see people together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lasting Damage and a Search for Clues in Cyberattack", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs investigators continue to gather clues about the cyberattacks that hit computers around the world last week, some big companies and other organizations are still reckoning with the damage.At Mondelez International, a giant maker of snacks, thousands of servers and computers were rendered useless and production lines at some factories ground to a halt. The company said on Thursday that shipping and invoicing had been disrupted during the last four days of the most recent financial quarter, but that a \u201ccritical majority\u201d of its systems were back up and running.Hospitals across the United States have not been able to create electronic records for more than a week after the software maker Nuance Communications experienced significant problems with its computers. On Thursday, it was not clear when all of the company\u2019s systems would be working properly.Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Lysol spray, lowered its sales forecasts on Thursday, citing disruptions to its supply chain. And at DLA Piper, a global law firm, employees said it might be a while before all systems returned to normal.\u201cWe are working with leading industry professionals to bring these back in a graduated way when we are satisfied that appropriate safeguards are in place to bring them online securely,\u201d John Lovallo, a DLA Piper spokesman, said in a statement.But collateral damage from the attack took down computers across the world, including major multinational companies that do business with Ukraine.\u201cThere\u2019s more to this story than what\u2019s been told,\u201d said Jaime Blasco, the vice president and chief scientist at AlienVault, a cybersecurity company that has been conducting a forensic investigation of the intrusion. \u201cBased on our analysis, this attack was really, really bad. Companies that weren\u2019t using best security practices were wiped out.\u201dAt Mondelez, which makes products including Oreo cookies, Ritz Crackers and Trident gum, it took less than 20 minutes for hackers to destroy data on thousands of servers, and to cause the company\u2019s production facilities around the globe \u2014 including a Cadbury chocolate factory in the far reaches of Tasmania \u2014 to shut down.As many as 30,000 Mondelez employees had their digital data wiped, many without adequate backups, according to two people briefed on the impact who were not allowed to discuss it publicly.In a statement, Mondelez said it believed that it had contained the issue and that a \u201ccritical majority of the affected systems are up and running again.\u201d The company said that it expected to incur one-time costs from the attack in its second and third quarters, but it reaffirmed its revenue outlook of \u201cat least 1 percent growth.\u201dThat was not the case at Reckitt Benckiser, a British maker of consumer goods. On Thursday, the company was forced to trim its sales forecast for the year \u2014 from 3 percent growth down to 2 percent \u2014 as a result of NotPetya\u2019s impact on its manufacturing and distribution. Based on last year\u2019s revenue, that would amount to about $130 million.NATO officials last week questioned whether the attack would cause the alliance\u2019s mutual defense clause, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to be invoked. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, told reporters that members agreed last year that such attacks could have that effect and pledged to help Ukraine bolster its cybersecurity defenses.Officials in Britain took a harder line. Michael Fallon, the British defense secretary, said the country would consider retaliating against cyberattacks with military force.In the United States, Thomas Bossert, the homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, said if the culprit was the Russian government or hackers working on its behalf, it was a foolish effort, because companies there \u2014 most notably Rosneft, the government-owned oil company \u2014 were also hit.Like the WannaCry attacks that spread around the world in May, the attackers behind the episode last week used hacking tools that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software. Some of the tools were stolen from the National Security Agency, and a group called the Shadow Brokers made them public in April.Although the security agency has never acknowledged that its hacking tools were stolen \u2014 let alone used in the two major attacks \u2014 many security experts worry that there are other agency tools ready to be used by hackers. And they are calling on the N.S.A. to help the rest of the world defend against them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Microsoft Has Become the Surprise Innovator in PCs", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWhen Microsoft unveiled the first Surface tablet five years ago, it was a spectacular failure.At the time, the Apple iPhone was well on its way to conquering the technology industry, and the iPad appeared set to lead an even more devastating invasion of Microsoft\u2019s office-worker kingdom. Microsoft conceived of Surface, an innovative laptop-tablet hybrid, as a way to show off the versatility of its software. Windows machines, it argued, could work as phones, personal computers and tablets. And didn\u2019t everyone love Windows?Still, Microsoft persisted \u2014 and today, the company is making the most visionary computers in the industry, if not the best machines, period. In the last two years, while Apple has focused mainly on mobile devices, Microsoft has put out a series of computers that reimagine the future of PCs in thrilling ways.Yet perhaps because it\u2019s way behind Apple, Microsoft\u2019s hardware division is creating products more daring than much of what has been coming out of its rival lately.The hybrid Surface Pro \u2014 the inheritor of that first Surface\u2019s vision, the latest version of which was released in May \u2014 hasn\u2019t just become a moneymaker for the company. It was also the clear inspiration for the Apple iPad Pro, which supports a pen and keyboard but still feels less like a full-fledged laptop than Surface does.Late last year, Microsoft also unveiled Surface Studio, a big-screen desktop that bears a passing resemblance to the Apple iMac \u2014 except its vertical display effortlessly pivots into a kind of digital drafting table, a slick trick that you can imagine Steve Jobs having lots of fun showing off at a keynote address.And in the spring, Microsoft showed off Surface Laptop, which sounds humdrum enough; in shape and purpose, it isn\u2019t much different from the MacBook Air, Apple\u2019s pioneering thin and light laptop. But Microsoft\u2019s machine has a better screen than the Air, and, more important, a future. People loved the Air, but Apple doesn\u2019t appear to want to upgrade it, so Microsoft stepped in to perfect Apple\u2019s baby.\u201cI think Microsoft has recognized over the last couple years that maybe the creative community isn\u2019t as locked into the Mac as many people think it is,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s this window of opportunity for Surface to get in there \u2014 and even if that window closes with some of Apple\u2019s upcoming devices, I don\u2019t think Apple has that market locked up.\u201dLast month, I visited Microsoft\u2019s hardware lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. I arrived in the midst of a renovation, finding a team of its best hardware designers sitting in a cavernous, mostly empty room \u2014 a scene that perfectly captures Microsoft\u2019s approach to hardware.Under Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s Surface chief, the company has given its designers and engineers license to rethink the future of PCs in grand ways \u2014 to sit in an empty room, dream big things, and turn those visions into reality.\u201cWe have this mind-set that says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to take a shot at this, and if it\u2019s not going to work, we\u2019ll move on to the next thing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Panay told me. \u201cThat is celebrated \u2014 it\u2019s always, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s move.\u2019\u201dThe mind-set has resulted in several shining ideas. For Surface Studio, Microsoft built a brilliant companion device called Surface Dial \u2014 a palm-size knob that sits on your drafting-table screen, creating a tactile interface with which to control your computer.You can use Dial for basic things like turning up the volume.

And it, too, is pricey \u2014 though it starts at $800, you\u2019re looking at $1,200 to $1,500 to get a model with decent speeds and the pen and keyboard accessories (crazily, they\u2019re sold separately).For these reasons and others, it\u2019s unlikely that Microsoft\u2019s PC hardware business will beat Apple\u2019s anytime soon.

{"Headline": "Digital Privacy to Come Under Supreme Court\u2019s Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchTo obtain electronic communications, the government must obtain a warrant for any that are held for 180 days or fewer by a computer service provider. This means establishing probable cause that the evidence sought is related to a crime.But for anything older than that, investigators need only a grand jury or administrative subpoena, as long as the person whose communications are sought is informed. That notification can be delayed by as much as 90 days if disclosure might have an adverse effect, such as destroying or tampering with evidence.Back in 1986, Congress viewed communications over six months old to be abandoned and therefore subject to reduced protection, a notion that looks quaint today when emails and texts may be held for years.Another provision of the statute allows investigators to obtain information from the provider about a subscriber to any electronic service, like cellphones, by seeking a court order based on \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the records are relevant to a criminal investigation. This is a lower standard than probable cause, the usual requirement for a search warrant.The defendants were convicted of organizing a string of robberies in the Detroit area where they served as lookouts by parking near the stores. The government obtained orders directing wireless carriers to provide cell site location information showing where different numbers linked to the crew conducting the robberies were at the time of the crimes. Armed with data from various cell towers, prosecutors showed at trial that the defendants\u2019 phones were a half-mile to two miles from the robberies, helping to link them to the actual perpetrators.The defendants sought to suppress that information, arguing that it constituted a search of their phones so that the reasonable grounds standard in the Stored Communications Act for the order did not meet the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment.In Riley, the court found that a warrantless search of an arrestee\u2019s cellphone was unconstitutional, explaining that what distinguishes the device from other items that might be found on a person that the police could look at \u201cis their immense storage capacity.\u201d But rummaging through the contents of a phone or computer is not necessarily the same as getting site information that is broadcast to the carrier, especially when a person may enable it by using an app like Find My Phone.In the Carpenter case, the justices will have to weigh whether cell site data is different from a GPS tracker because learning where a person is within about a one-mile radius may not be a sufficient invasion of privacy to come within the Fourth Amendment. Nor does obtaining the location of a cellphone reveal the content of any communication, only that a call was made, so the protection afforded by the Riley decision may not apply.Determining how digital information fits under a constitutional protection adopted when there were only \u201cpersons, homes, papers and effects\u201d that could be searched requires the Supreme Court to figure out the scope of privacy expectations in a very different world from the 18th century. The problem is that legal challenges take a piecemeal approach to a statute adopted over 30 years ago, and the courts cannot rewrite provisions that may be hopelessly out of date.Whether the legislation can get through the current Senate is an open question, and it is not clear whether President Trump would sign off if the Justice Department opposes the bill. That may mean the Supreme Court will have to establish the broad parameters of digital privacy while Congress tries to deal with the intricacies of a world of electronic communication that continues to evolve rapidly.Devices connected to the internet, from cellphones to watches to personal training trackers that facilitate our personal habits and communications, are a fact of daily life, and the Supreme Court will have to start drawing clear lines around what types of electronic information are \u2014 and are not \u2014 protected by the Fourth Amendment. Simply asserting that there is a right to privacy does not provide much help in determining how far that protection should extend in a digital world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gamer Channel\u2019s Mission: Send the Trolls Packing", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery week without fail, some viewers of Misscliks, a channel on the video game streaming platform Twitch, pipe up with sexist or misogynistic comments.As the channel live-streams shows where hosts engage in activities like playing the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, viewers have made comments objectifying the female hosts. Several have called the male hosts on Misscliks \u201cpimps,\u201d or have said how lucky they are to have a \u201charem\u201d of colleagues.What sets Misscliks apart is its response to such behavior. Whenever a sexist remark pops up, the Misscliks community quickly jumps in to explain that the channel\u2019s mission is to be a diverse space where underrepresented gamers can feel safe from harassment and bullying. Commenters who persist are given timeouts, or sometimes banned outright.\u201cMisscliks is an example of a space grown from the ground up to model a different and less toxic environment,\u201d said Naomi Clark, an assistant arts professor at New York University\u2019s department of game design. \u201cTheir team deliberately set expectation and policy from the beginning to counter harassment.\u201dThe motto of the channel, led by four women, is \u201cbuild up, never tear down.\u201dTwitch has also ramped up against harassment. The company has introduced tools like AutoMod, which uses machine learning and natural language processing to identify and block inappropriate content during chats. Twitch has also given broadcasters the power to ban specific words and links from a chat; allowed broadcasters to assign moderators to police chats during live streams; and added a button on every channel that lets people more easily flag or report unwanted content.\u201cWe take harassment very seriously and understand how important this is for the entire Twitch community,\u201d Twitch\u2019s public relations director, who uses just the name Chase, said. Of Misscliks, he said it \u201chas successfully cultivated an inclusive and positive community, so if other creators are striving for a similar vibe, we encourage them to check out that channel.\u201dMisscliks was founded in 2013 by four women in the video game and e-sports industries, including one of Twitch\u2019s employees, Anna Prosser Robinson, a host and programming manager at the live-streaming platform. Ms. Prosser Robinson tapped Genevi\u00e8ve Forget of the video game publisher Ubisoft; Stephanie Harvey, a professional e-sports player; and Stephanie Powell, a community manager at Roll20, an online tabletop gaming service for games like Dungeons & Dragons.The quartet, who volunteer time to Misscliks while still engaged in their day jobs, said they created the channel after realizing how often women in the video game industry are made to feel undervalued.\u201cWe were tired of being anomalies,\u201d Ms. Prosser Robinson said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a girl who does gaming, isn\u2019t she a sparkly unicorn?\u2019 We thought if we could make it more normal to see women\u2019s faces in e-sports and make a support network, maybe they\u2019d stick around.\u201dOn any given day, Misscliks features rotating shows and content. Unlike many other Twitch channels that are built around a single personality, Misscliks is collaborative. It has a range of hosts, and users are invited to write in and pitch ideas for shows.One regular show on Misscliks is \u201cLet\u2019s Play,\u201d in which hosts play video games and people tune in to watch. Another show is dedicated to discussing and playing Heroes of the Storm, a multiplayer online battle arena video game published by Blizzard.Misscliks also has a behind-the-scenes Slack channel for its creators and hosts, where people can talk openly about any issue, or ask for help if they are experiencing online abuse or bullying.\u201cPlatforms, organizations and leagues are seeing that women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. folks are an important part of their user base and audience,\u201d said T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at M.I.T. and director of research at AnyKey. \u201cMaking sure they are able to participate is key to the bottom line.\u201dThe popularity of the Misscliks mission has yet to be determined. The channel has just over 23,000 followers, a fraction of the millions of followers drawn to some of the more popular Twitch channels.Ms. Prosser Robinson, who oversees the daily operation of Misscliks with the help of one or two others, said the channel was not aiming to be huge or a giant profit-making entity. While Misscliks makes some revenue from advertisers and subscriptions, the money goes back into the streamers and the channel, she said.Ms. Prosser Robinson said these messages were part of the \u201clittle steps\u201d being made toward dealing with harassment in gaming.\u201cAt least people now have a general awareness that it\u2019s important, which is very different compared to a few years ago,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

It was still the kind of performance that investors have come to expect from Mr. Bezos and Amazon: a 25 percent increase in sales and example after example of how the company is pouring money into original video programming, warehouses and shaping the future with new technology and products like its Echo family of gadgets.The company\u2019s stock fell only about 3 percent in after-hours trading.The relative indifference to Amazon\u2019s bottom line was another sign of why the company is so frightening to competitors and critics. Investors would almost certainly have pummeled any other retailer that turned in the kind of performance that Amazon reported Thursday. Instead, they give Amazon several miles of leash because of its history of turning investments into sales growth and technology leadership.\u201cYes, we are continuing to invest and stepping up investments,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with reporters, repeating a variation on a theme that company executives have expressed many times before.For a short time on Thursday, Forbes estimated Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth at $90.6 billion, compared with $90 billion for Bill Gates, a philanthropist and a co-founder of Microsoft, moving Mr. Bezos to the No. 1 spot for the first time.By the end of the day, Mr. Bezos had dropped back to No. 2.For the second quarter, ending June 30, Amazon said its net income was $197 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, in the same period a year earlier.Analysts had expected a decline in profits, but not one that big. The average earnings estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was $1.42 a share. Mr. Olsavsky said the company\u2019s operating income, a different measure of profits, was within the range of possibilities it had previously shared with investors.Mr. Olsavsky did not play down the fact that Amazon had found ways to invest in the growth of its business. The company\u2019s revenue increased 25 percent, to $38 billion from $30.4 billion a year ago. That made analysts happy. Their average revenue estimate was $37.2 billion.Since the Whole Foods deal was announced, several members of Congress have raised concerns about its potential impact, expressing fears that it could accelerate consolidation in the food industry, eliminate jobs at brick-and-mortar retailers and further limit the availability of grocery stores in already underserved areas.\u201cI would be very surprised if this deal had really substantive problems with the F.T.C.,\u201d Mr. Keeley said, referring to the Federal Trade Commission.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mind-Boggling Ascent of Amazon and Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesAmazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are having a moment.Yet noteworthy as these real-world achievements are, they may understate Amazon\u2019s importance. Despite an earnings report on Thursday evening that disappointed the market and led to a 2.5 percent decline in its share price, Amazon is remarkable as a purely financial entity. Its stature as one of the most successful companies in the history of the stock market is already assured. In fact, the numbers show that since 1997, when it became a publicly traded company, Amazon has evolved into one of the century\u2019s greatest wealth-generating machines.When I first spoke with Professor Bessembinder in May, he had prepared a list of the 30 greatest wealth creators in the stock market through 2015. But this past week, he showed me a Lifetime Wealth Creation list, with fresh rankings through 2016. The stocks at the very top remained the same: Exxon Mobil, followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM.But further down the list, Amazon appears for the first time. It is ranked 14th, just behind such august names as Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble and ahead of Coca-Cola and DuPont.In essence, the list shows which stocks have been the most profitable for shareholders over history. A very small group \u2014 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks \u2014 account for all of the stock market\u2019s net gains from 1926 through 2016, he found. And only 30 stocks \u2014 Amazon is now one of them \u2014 account for more than 30 percent of all of the market\u2019s wealth creation in that 90-year period.What\u2019s more, Professor Bessembinder found that Amazon\u2019s annualized return through 2016 was 37.4 percent, the highest of all the top 30 wealth creators. That is partly because Amazon hasn\u2019t existed for that long: It\u2019s easier to sustain fast growth for shorter periods. Exxon, for example, which has created more than $1 trillion in wealth for shareholders since 1926, more than any other company, ground out its gains at a slower pace: It has an annualized return of only 11.9 percent, Professor Bessembinder said.Even after the earnings blip on Thursday, Amazon\u2019s value in the market has skyrocketed this year. It has risen more than 36 percent. \u201cIf it holds onto those gains, we can expect that it will climb higher on the cumulative wealth creation list,\u201d he said.Of course, while Amazon\u2019s market power has been wonderful for its own investors, it has damaged many of its competitors \u2014 diminishing the wealth of shareholders of those companies.Consider how Amazon\u2019s cumulative stock returns dwarf those of its retail competitors and the overall market. Using Thomson Reuters data, I calculated that over the last 15 years through Tuesday, Amazon returned more than 8,200 percent, compared with 125 percent for Walmart, 2.2 percent for Sears, and 302 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, dividends included.If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 \u2014 and had held onto your shares \u2014 that money would be worth $83,000 today.By comparison, $1,000 invested in the entire Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends, would amount to $4,100 \u2014 not a bad performance, until you look at the gaudy Amazon returns. Far worse, if you had put the money in Walmart shares, your investment would be worth only $2,250. And if you had stuck with Sears during all of its travails, you would be almost where you started, with $1,022.Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm, has another way of comparing Amazon\u2019s stock returns with those of its retail competitors. It has built the Death by Amazon Index, which it describes as \u201ca way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com.\u201d Those companies \u2014 there are now 54 of them \u2014 include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart.The numbers are stark. The Death by Amazon Index has declined 18.9 percent through Monday \u2014 trailing Amazon by almost 55 percentage points.Unlike Mr. Gates, who has diversified his portfolio and has been giving money to charity at a rapid pace, Mr. Bezos continues to bet heavily on Amazon. As Thursday\u2019s earnings report showed, that does entail risk. The company\u2019s ever-expanding retail operations are sapping its profits, but it has been raking in earnings through cloud computing. As has been the case since Amazon\u2019s inception, it pays no dividends, instead plowing cash back into the company\u2019s core.For now, the mighty Amazon wealth-creation machine continues to roar. Whatever happens next, this is already one of the great tales in the history of capitalism.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel, While Pivoting to Artificial Intelligence, Tries to Protect Lead", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe computers in modern data centers \u2014 the engine rooms of the digital economy \u2014 are powered mainly by Intel chips. They animate the computing clouds of the internet giants and corporate data centers worldwide.But Intel is now facing new competitive forces that could pose a challenge to its data-center dominance and profitability.In particular, the rise of artificial intelligence is creating demand for new computing hardware tailored to handle vast amounts of unruly data and complex machine-learning software \u2014 and Intel\u2019s general-purpose chips are not yet tuned for the most demanding tasks. Instead, specialized chips are delivering better performance on artificial intelligence programs that identify images, recognize speech and translate languages.How successful Intel\u2019s efforts prove to be will be crucial not only for the company but also for the long-term future of the computer chip industry.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more competition in the data-center market than we\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Linley Gwennap, a semiconductor expert who leads a technology research firm in Mountain View, Calif.Intel has long dominated the business for central processing chips that control industry-standard servers in data centers. Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, said the company controlled about 96 percent of such chips.Big Intel customers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also working on chip designs. AMD and ARM, which make central processing chips like Intel, are edging into the data-center market, too. IBM made its Power chip technology open source a few years ago, and Google and others are designing prototypes.To counter some of these trends, Intel is expected on Tuesday to provide details about the performance and uses of its new chips and its plans for the future. The company is set to formally introduce the next generation of its Xeon data-center microprocessors, code-named Skylake. And there will be a range of Xeon offerings with different numbers of processing cores, speeds, amounts of attached memory, and prices.Yet analysts said that would represent progress along Intel\u2019s current path rather than an embrace of new models of computing.Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein Research, said, \u201cThey\u2019re late to artificial intelligence.\u201dThe Nervana technology, Intel has said, is being folded into its product road map. A chip code-named Lake Crest is being tested and will be available to some customers this year.Lake Crest is tailored for A.I. programs called neural networks, which learn specific tasks by analyzing huge amounts of data. Feed millions of cat photos into a neural network and it can learn to recognize a cat \u2014 and later pick out cats by color and breed. The principle is the same for speech recognition and language translation.Intel has also said it is working to integrate Nervana technology into a future Xeon processor, code-named Knight\u2019s Crest.Intel\u2019s challenge, analysts said, is a classic one of adapting an extraordinarily successful business to a fundamental shift in the marketplace.As the dominant data-center chip maker, used by a wide array of customers with different needs, Intel has loaded more capabilities into its central processors. It has been an immensely profitable strategy: Intel had net income of $10.3 billion last year on revenue of $59.4 billion.Yet key customers increasingly want computing designs that parcel out work to a collection of specialized chips rather than have that work flow through the central processor. A central processor can be thought of as part brain, doing the logic processing, and part traffic cop, orchestrating the flow of data through the computer.The outlying, specialized chips are known in the industry as accelerators. They can do certain things, like data-driven A.I. tasks, faster than a central processor. Accelerators include graphics processors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (F.P.G.A.s).A more diverse set of chips does not mean the need for Intel\u2019s central processor disappears. The processor just does less of the work, becoming more of a traffic cop and less of a brain. If this happens, Intel\u2019s business becomes less profitable.Mr. Gwennap, the independent analyst, said, \u201cIntel has a very good read on data centers and what those customers want.\u201dStill, the question remains whether knowing what the customers want translates into giving them what they want, if that path presents a threat to Intel\u2019s business model and profit margins.Advertisement"}

Allegretto, an economist and co-chairwoman of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, said she and her colleagues had studied 30 years of wage and employment data and found that higher minimum wages had not reduced employment.Higher pay, she said, often translates to lower employee turnover, as fewer employees leave to seek better-paying jobs. For employers, that means decreased costs for replacement hiring and training. Also, she said, the modestly higher prices that may result \u2014 for example in food concessions \u2014 are generally borne by customers.Josh Bivens, research director at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said low-income workers who receive pay increases are likely to spend that extra income, stimulating economic growth, an effect called \u201cmiddle-out economics.\u201d\u201cWage increases at the middle and bottom are recycled back into the economy as spending on restaurants, clothes, cars \u2014 all things that support employment in other sectors of the economy,\u201d Mr. Bivens said.Mr. Robinson, the SeaTac economic development director, said hoteliers had adapted to the ordinance, which requires any hotel with at least 100 rooms or 30 full-time employees to pay the $15 minimum wage. \u201cNobody eliminated rooms to get under it,\u201d he said.Steven Lou, whose company, Lou Development, is building a 132-room Hyatt House and a 237-room Hyatt Place in SeaTac, said he was not worried about the $15 minimum wage. In fact, he expected to pay even more to hotel employees.\u201cWe are willing to pay a good wage for stable, skilled employees,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter they are trained and have been with us a while, they will make more than $15 an hour.\u201dIf room prices go up a little to help pay for the higher wages, he said he thought the market could easily bear it.Taylor Kerns, investment analyst at the Corinthian Development Company, based near San Jose, Calif., said his company decided to increase the size of the Wingate hotel it was building in SeaTac to 157 rooms from 123 partly because of the higher minimum wage.\u201cWe\u2019re mostly a \u2018heads in beds\u2019 property,\u201d he said, meaning the hotel does not offer amenities like a full restaurant. \u201cSo the majority of our employees are housekeeping and security.\u201d They would typically be lower-wage employees, he said.Corinthian decided that increasing the number of hotel rooms would raise the property\u2019s revenue, but would not require many more employees to accommodate the extra guests. \u201cWe\u2019d gain in efficiency,\u201d Mr. Kerns said.He said the firm also decided to increase the room count because most of the available land in the area had been purchased. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be many new hotels for quite a while after these all go in,\u201d he said.Mr. Robinson said he advised other cities increasing minimum wages to \u201cengage the community, listen to concerns, be responsive as you can.\u201d Jobs, he said, \u201care important.\u201d He said he also works closely with developers to make the regulations work for the city and business interests.Yogi Hutsen, executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, said Cedarbrook Lodge in SeaTac was already planning to add 67 rooms to the 100 rooms already there when the higher minimum wage was approved. He said that revenue takes a harder hit in food and beverages than in lodging when wages go up because \u201cpeople are more likely to notice a price increase of a few dollars on a menu than on a room rate.\u201dHe said that it takes some time for businesses to adjust to higher wages and see \u201cwhat can be passed on and what the company has to absorb,\u201d but that his company was committed to fair compensation for its staff.He said he only wished that neighboring cities would follow SeaTac\u2019s lead and raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. \u201cWe\u2019re in a noncompetitive situation,\u201d he said, \u201cand it would be easier if everyone else was paying the exact same wages.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a hotel boom in SeaTac, Wash., misidentified the company that employs Yogi Hutsen, an executive in SeaTac. He is executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, not of Cedarbrook Lodge. (Cedarbrook Lodge is managed by Columbia Hospitality.)Advertisement"}

Stephen Colbert will host the ceremony, which will be broadcast by CBS.At least by the standards of this sometimes relentlessly predictable awards show, this will be a year of change at the Emmy Awards, with many first-time nominees populating several major categories.Here are some significant story lines that took shape on Thursday:\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which has won best drama the last two years, is ineligible for this year\u2019s Emmys because of a later start date. (Its seventh season begins on Sunday.) And HBO\u2019s competitors have gleefully filled the vacuum.This year was a transformative one for the best drama category, with five new shows \u2014 all freshman series \u2014 nominated.Those include \u201cThe Crown\u201d (Netflix), \u201cStranger Things\u201d (Netflix), \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu), \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO) and \u201cThis Is Us\u201d (NBC). Previous nominees, like \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d have been welcomed back, but \u201cHomeland,\u201d \u201cThe Americans\u201d and \u201cMr. Robot\u201d are out.NBC\u2019s landing a nomination for the tear-jerking \u201cThis Is Us\u201d snaps an embarrassing dry spell for the big four broadcast networks. The last time a drama from ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC was nominated was in 2011 \u2014 for CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201dThe best comedy category, however, had just one newcomer \u2014 \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 while the two-time winner \u201cVeep\u201d and the five-time winner \u201cModern Family\u201d were both back.Several late-night shows have adopted a staunch anti-President Trump posture in the last year, and that appears to have helped them with Emmy voters.\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which was withering toward Mr. Trump and his inner circle last season, led all shows \u2014 along with \u201cWestworld\u201d \u2014 with 22 nominations. This NBC stalwart was nominated for best variety sketch series, along with nominations for three cast members (Kate McKinnon, Vanessa Bayer and Leslie Jones), Alec Baldwin (for his portrayal of Mr. Trump) and Melissa McCarthy (for her hugely popular Sean Spicer impression).Meanwhile, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Hulu\u2019s dystopian drama about a dark future in the United States, very likely benefited from what some TV critics have described as its unique timeliness. Its nomination in the best drama category was a first for Hulu.Move over, gentlemen. This may be the year of the actress at the Emmys.The much-anticipated limited series and TV movie best-actress category will be a showdown between four Oscar winners from two shows: HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon) and FX\u2019s \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan\u201d (Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange). The other nominees in the category were Carrie Coon for FX\u2019s \u201cFargo,\u201d her first Emmy nomination, and Felicity Huffman for \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201dAs an indication of how much more interest is in the actress categories this year: Last month, when the Television Critics Association announced the nominees for its acting categories \u2014 one for drama, one for comedy, neither separated by gender \u2014 11 of the 14 nominees were women.The best actress drama category is wide open since last year\u2019s winner \u2014 Tatiana Maslany \u2014 is ineligible because \u201cOrphan Black\u201d debuted too late this year. Nominees include actresses from rookie shows \u2014 Elisabeth Moss (\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d), Claire Foy (\u201cThe Crown\u201d) and Evan Rachel Wood (\u201cWestworld\u201d) \u2014 and past nominees like Keri Russell (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) and Viola Davis (\u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d), who won the award in 2015.HBO had the most nominations with 111 \u2014 the 17th consecutive year that it has led the pack \u2014 but its lead is narrowing. Netflix, which had 92 fewer nominations than HBO just two years ago, had just 20 fewer this year.An earlier version of this article, using information from the Television Academy, misstated the number of Emmy nominations HBO garnered this year. The number is 111, not 110.Advertisement"}

Although it is too soon to say whether Microsoft can pull off a full-blown renaissance the way Apple has, the company is firmly back in favor.At the same time, the company delivered growth where it mattered to investors \u2014 in the cloud business that has become Exhibit A for bulls convinced that Microsoft has a grip on the future of computing. The company\u2019s shares popped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading after the release of the results.Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing business was the star of the company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, as it has been for many quarters. Revenue from its Intelligent Cloud business rose 11 percent to $7.4 billion.In a call with analysts, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said the company closed the highest number of multimillion-dollar Azure deals to date during the quarter. Ms. Hood also said that for the first time, the revenue Microsoft received from the commercial version of Office 365 \u2014 a cloud version of its productivity applications that customers subscribe to \u2014 surpassed the revenue the company received from traditional sales of the software.Over all, for the quarter that ended June 30, net income was $6.51 billion, or 83 cents a share, up from $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose to $23.32 billion from $20.61 billion. After adjusting those figures to include deferred revenue from its Windows 10 operating system and other items, Microsoft\u2019s revenue was $24.7 billion and 98 cents a share, which exceeded Wall Street forecasts.The average earnings estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was 71 cents a share, while the average revenue estimate was $24.27 billion. Analysts did not include the tax benefit from Microsoft\u2019s phone business, which amounted to 23 cents a share, in their earnings estimates, so a more accurate comparison with the 71 cents a share forecast was 75 cents.\u201cI\u2019d like to see more initiatives and growth there,\u201d Mr. Thibault said, \u201cinstead of pinning all our hopes on cloud.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Officials took the surfers out of the water at Jeffreys Bay when they spotted the shark approaching them, from around 700 meters, or nearly half a mile, away.Back on shore, upon reviewing the footage, Mr. Fanning was astonished at the shark\u2019s size.\u201cLook at that thing, that thing is a beast \u2014 at least they saw this one,\u201d he said.The incident is the second of its kind in two days, after another Australian-Brazilian pair, Julian Wilson and Filipe Toledo, were plucked from the waters when marshals saw a mako shark nearby.In 2013, an experienced open-water swimmer was killed by a great white shark at Jeffreys Bay.[10:15 a.m.]It must be awfully hard to surprise Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who has traveled the world on behalf of his philanthropic foundation.But Mr. Gates seemed somewhat taken aback after visiting a cattle station in central Queensland, where he had an up-close experience with cutting-edge genomics.Mr. Gates spent time with the Australian Agricultural Company, which artificially influences genomes to breed Wagyu beef cows, which are among the most sought-after in the world.He was there on behalf of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and unsurprisingly was most interested in how the company\u2019s techniques could improve the quality of African cattle and help feed people on that continent more efficiently.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s poorest countries are in hot regions, so to understand how to raise livestock in a tropical climate, Australia\u2019s a great place to go learn from,\u201d Mr. Gates said in an accompanying video.While some readers may roll their eyes at Mr. Gates\u2019s use of the word \u201ccowboys\u201d to refer to Australian farmers \u2014 harmlessly misplaced parlance \u2014 it would be difficult to describe him as anything less than intrepid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Pop-Up Employer: Build a Team, Do the Job, Say Goodbye", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the organization chart for the maker of True Story, a card game and mobile app in which players trade stories from their daily lives, resembled that of any company. There was a content division to churn out copy for game cards; graphic designers to devise the logo and the packaging; developers to build the mobile app and the website. There was even a play-testing division to catch potential hiccups.Upon closer inspection, the producer of True Story wasn\u2019t really a firm: The workers were all freelancers who typically had never met and, perhaps more striking, the entire organization existed solely to create the game and then disbanded.True Story was a case study in what two Stanford professors call \u201cflash organizations\u201d \u2014 ephemeral setups to execute a single, complex project in ways traditionally associated with corporations, nonprofit groups or governments.And, in fact, intermediaries are already springing up across industries like software and pharmaceuticals to assemble such organizations. They rely heavily on data and algorithms to determine which workers are best suited to one another, and also on decidedly lower-tech innovations, like middle management.But to the extent that temporary organizations replace permanent ones, they have the potential to add to the economic uncertainty that workers must increasingly contend with.Temporary organizations capable of taking on complicated projects have existed for decades, of course, perhaps nowhere more prominently than in Hollywood, where producers assemble teams of directors, writers, actors, costume and set designers and a variety of other craftsmen and technicians to execute projects with budgets in the tens if not hundreds of millions.In principle, many companies would find it more cost-effective to increase staff members as needed than to maintain a permanent presence. The reason they do not, economists have long argued, is that the mechanics of hiring, training and monitoring workers separately for each project can be prohibitively expensive.But Ms. Valentine, who studies management science, and Mr. Bernstein, a computer scientist, note that technology is sharply lowering these costs. \u201cComputation, we think, has an opportunity to dramatically shift several costs in a way that traditional organizations haven\u2019t realized,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s way easier to search for people, bargain and contract with them.\u201dThere is some evidence that the corporate world, which has spent decades outsourcing work to contractors and consulting firms, is embracing temporary organizations. In 2007, Jody Miller, a former media executive and venture capitalist, was a co-founder of the Business Talent Group, which sets up temporary teams of freelancers for corporations.\u201cWe\u2019re the producers,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cWe understand how to evaluate talent, pick the team.\u201dSome of Ms. Miller\u2019s biggest clients are in the pharmaceutical industry, whose economics are not unlike Hollywood\u2019s in that it is heavily project-based and a small handful of blockbusters drive most of the profits. Business Talent Group teams frequently work on the kickoff of a new drug \u2014 devising the strategy for reaching out to patient groups, journalists, doctors and insurers \u2014 and help pry open new markets for existing drugs.Similar intermediaries have sprouted in other industries. In the tech world, there is Gigster, a platform founded in 2014 that knits freelancers together into software-building teams, so that an entrepreneur with no technical know-how can hand off an idea and get back a fully functional app in months or a prototype in weeks.In entertainment, there is Artella, a platform that helps freelance animators, sound designers and other talent form teams that produce animated features. Artella, by also providing the costly technical tools that support animation, may one day allow freelancers to compete with the major studios.Ms. Valentine and Mr. Bernstein wanted to take the concept further. They created a platform, Foundry, in which the process of assembling and running a temporary organization could be automated, without so much as a phone call.Each project began with a project leader and an organization chart. To fill each role, Foundry emailed a group of qualified workers on Upwork, a huge freelancer site, which generated pools of candidates. Once the workers were hired, something Foundry could do automatically, they were assigned tasks and communicated through Slack, the messaging software. The organization chart could be altered as needed, generating new roles and new workers.The professors recently presented their research at a prestigious computer-science conference.Three lessons stand out across the flash-type models. First is that the platforms tend to be highly dependent on data and computing power. Roger Dickey, a co-founder of Gigster, says every member of each team assembled by the company reviews every other member, generating 20 to 30 data points per person per project. Artificial intelligence then looks for patterns and helps the company figure out how best to build future teams.Second is the importance of well-established roles. Sociologists and organizational theorists have marveled for decades at the way disaster response teams or emergency room trauma units pull off complex tasks, even if they have never met before, because the division of labor is understood.The same goes for flash teams. Dave Summa, who worked on a team that the Business Talent Group assembled to advise a major agribusiness company on which markets to compete in, said it fell to him to define the questions that needed answering and the mode of analysis, while a colleague oversaw teams of workers who produced specific plans.\u201cHe was very detail-oriented and meticulous,\u201d Mr. Summa said. \u201cHe let me do what I was good at. I let him do what he was good at.\u201dThen there is perhaps the least likely of innovations: middle management. The typical freelancer performs worker-bee tasks. Flash-like organizations tend to combine both workers and managers.True Story, according to Daniel Steinbock, one of the game\u2019s inventors, would have been lost without its managers. When the writers, who composed short poems for each game card, first submitted their work, he and his business partner had one overriding impression: \u201cMost of the content was really bad,\u201d he said.\u201cBut some of it was less bad,\u201d he added. What followed was a long, tortured cycle of identifying the poems that had some redeeming value and asking the writers to try again and again. The key to the process was another freelancer they hired to oversee this work, who later became jokingly known as the chief poetry officer. \u201cSomewhere along the way they got hired to manage the process of deciding what was good and what was not,\u201d Mr. Steinbock said. \u201cThat worked well.\u201dThe flash organization has obvious limits. It tends to work best for projects with well-defined life spans, not continuing engagements. Microsoft probably would not set up one to build Windows given that it releases a new version every few years.Yet the flash model appears to have revolutionary potential. If nothing else, millions of middle-management jobs that fell by the wayside in recent decades might one day be reincarnated as freelance project-manager positions. \u201cThe bottleneck now is project managers,\u201d Ms. Valentine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough position to fill.\u201dAnd while traditional white-collar freelancing \u2014 and certainly its gig-economy equivalent on platforms like Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk \u2014 can be isolating, being part of an organization tends to be emotionally satisfying.\u201cOne thing that was really surprising and exciting about what we saw was how quickly flash organizations developed solidarity and collective behavior,\u201d Ms. Valentine said. Flash organizations may even promote upward mobility \u2014 if, say, the person brought in to crank out one-line poems can ascend to a supervisory position.Still, even while fostering flexibility, the model could easily compound insecurity. Temporary firms are not likely to provide health or retirement benefits. And even if high-skilled workers like project managers and web developers find they are well compensated on the open market, said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, low-skilled workers tend to fare worse outside firms.Mr. Bernstein concedes that the anxiety is legitimate, though he says platforms could eventually dampen insecurity by playing a role that companies have historically played: providing benefits, topping off earnings if workers\u2019 freelance income is too low or too spotty, even allowing workers to organize.\u201cThis could be a potent force among many in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a policy perspective, we have to figure out how to empower labor when contracts last a few minutes or a few weeks.\u201dFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hackers Are Targeting Nuclear Facilities, Homeland Security Dept. and F.B.I. Say", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "Supported bySince May, hackers have been penetrating the computer networks of companies that operate nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, as well as manufacturing plants in the United States and other countries.Among the companies targeted was the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., according to security consultants and an urgent joint report issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week.The joint report was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by security specialists who have been responding to the attacks. It carried an urgent amber warning, the second-highest rating for the sensitivity of the threat.The report did not indicate whether the cyberattacks were an attempt at espionage \u2014 such as stealing industrial secrets \u2014 or part of a plan to cause destruction. There is no indication that hackers were able to jump from their victims\u2019 computers into the control systems of the facilities, nor is it clear how many facilities were breached.Wolf Creek officials said that while they could not comment on cyberattacks or security issues, no \u201coperations systems\u201d had been affected and that their corporate network and the internet were separate from the network that runs the plant.In a joint statement with the F.B.I., a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said, \u201cThere is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.\u201dThe hackers appeared determined to map out computer networks for future attacks, the report concluded. But investigators have not been able to analyze the malicious \u201cpayload\u201d of the hackers\u2019 code, which would offer more detail into what they were after.John Keeley, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, which works with all 99 electric utilities that operate nuclear plants in the United States, said nuclear facilities are required to report cyberattacks that relate to their \u201csafety, security and operations.\u201d None have reported that the security of their operations was affected by the latest attacks, Mr. Keeley said.In most cases, the attacks targeted people \u2014 industrial control engineers who have direct access to systems that, if damaged, could lead to an explosion, fire or a spill of dangerous material, according to two people familiar with the attacks who could not be named because of confidentiality agreements.The origins of the hackers are not known. But the report indicated that an \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d actor was responsible, which is the language security specialists often use to describe hackers backed by governments.Hackers wrote highly targeted email messages containing fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for control engineering jobs and sent them to the senior industrial control engineers who maintain broad access to critical industrial control systems, the government report said.The fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were Microsoft Word documents that were laced with malicious code. Once the recipients clicked on those documents, attackers could steal their credentials and proceed to other machines on a network.In some cases, the hackers also compromised legitimate websites that they knew their victims frequented \u2014 something security specialists call a watering hole attack. And in others, they deployed what are known as man-in-the-middle attacks in which they redirected their victims\u2019 internet traffic through their own machines.Energy, nuclear and critical manufacturing organizations have frequently been targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The Department of Homeland Security has called cyberattacks on critical infrastructure \u201cone of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.\u201dOn May 11, during the attacks, President Trump signed an executive order to strengthen the cybersecurity defenses of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order required government agencies to work with public companies to mitigate risks and help defend critical infrastructure organizations \u201cat greatest risk of attacks that could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security.\u201dThe order specifically addressed the threats from \u201celectricity disruptions and prolonged power outages resulting from cybersecurity incidents.\u201d\u201cWe never anticipated that our critical infrastructure control systems would be facing advanced levels of malware,\u201d Mr. Wellinghoff said.In 2008, an attack called Stuxnet that was designed by the United States and Israel to hit Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility, demonstrated how computer attacks could disrupt and destroy physical infrastructure.The government hackers infiltrated the systems that controlled Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuges and spun them wildly out of control, or stopped them from spinning entirely, destroying a fifth of Iran\u2019s centrifuges.In retrospect, Mr. Wellinghoff said that attack should have foreshadowed the threats the United States would face on its own infrastructure.Critical infrastructure is increasingly controlled by Scada, or supervisory control and data acquisition systems. They are used by manufacturers, nuclear plant operators and pipeline operators to monitor variables like pressure and flow rates through pipelines. The software also allows operators to monitor and diagnose unexpected problems.But like any software, Scada systems are susceptible to hacking and computer viruses. And for years, security specialists have warned that hackers could use remote access to these systems to cause physical destruction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Houston Braces for Another Brush With the Peril of Zika", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal HealthHOUSTON \u2014 With 4.5 million people in a hot, muggy metropolis built atop a bayou, America\u2019s fourth-largest city, Houston, is a perfect target for the mosquito-borne Zika virus. But it may be better prepared than any other urban center to stop an outbreak.The city last year increased its mosquito-control budget by 33 percent. Officials are testing new high-tech traps and have plans to release genetically modified mosquitoes that produce short-lived offspring, reducing the population.Should the virus start spreading here, officials are prepared to follow Miami\u2019s example, beginning aerial spraying and house-to-house inspections to clear standing water in which mosquitoes breed.\u201cWe\u2019re much better prepared this year than we were last year,\u201d said Mustapha Debboun, mosquito control director of Harris County, which includes Houston.Almost everywhere, Year 2 of Zika is looking much less threatening than Year 1. But the risk posed by this virus is far from gone.According to the Pan American Health Organization, the number of infections has declined precipitously in the Americas, except for Peru, Ecuador and Argentina.Fewer infections overseas should mean fewer travelers returning to the United States with live virus in their blood, reducing the likelihood of an outbreak here.Dr. Scott C. Weaver, a Zika expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in nearby Galveston, described himself as \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the epidemic was fading out.Still, he warned, \u201cit\u2019s premature to conclude that the danger is over.\u201d Data is limited on infections just over the border in Mexico, and the rainy season \u2014 prime time for mosquito breeding \u2014 has just begun in Central America and the Caribbean.Still, it\u2019s a far cry from the situation last year, when a surge of babies born with abnormally small heads in Brazil sowed an international panic. The birth defects were shown to be linked to infection with the Zika virus, transmitted to pregnant women by common household mosquitoes.Ultimately, the country recorded about 5,100 cases, of which about 4,800 were acquired by travelers overseas. Florida reported 218 cases of locally acquired Zika infection, however, mostly in Miami. Texas recorded only six, all in the Brownsville area, abutting Mexico.As winter returned, the disease receded from the headlines. This summer, there is no panic in cities like Houston, only uncertainty.Some pregnant women here are nervous; others are not, despite the city\u2019s efforts to sound the alarm with posters, movie theater ads and other public messages.Jessenia Rocha, 31, a behavioral health representative at Legacy Community Health, is pregnant with her fifth child. Recently she drove 13 hours to San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico, for her great-grandmother\u2019s funeral.\u201cMy doctor said, \u2018Don\u2019t go,\u2019 but I had to be there,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my doctor said, \u2018O.K., then wear long sleeves and use repellent.\u2019\u201dMs. Rocha stayed only two hours, then drove straight back.Krystle McConico, 31, a gospel singer expecting her first baby, worries not at all. \u201cTwo of my close friends are also pregnant, and we haven\u2019t had one conversation about Zika,\u201d she said. \u201cMy physician didn\u2019t mention it at my first appointment.\u201dHer job has taken her to Africa and Asia without problems. Some of her fearlessness may stem from her belief that God will protect her, she said.\u201cAlso,\u201d she added, \u201cmosquitoes just don\u2019t like me. I can sit on the porch with my mother and father, and they get bitten all over and I get nothing.\u201dHarris County\u2019s mosquito-control program began during a 1965 epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis and was strengthened after the West Nile virus arrived in 2002.Every day at dawn, workers hoist nearly invisible nets in local parks to capture birds for blood sampling. (West Nile and several other dangerous viruses are found in birds, although Zika is not.)More than 400 mosquito traps are scattered around the county. Some are baited with dry ice, which emits carbon dioxide, the element of human breath that draws mosquitoes.Some traps exude the lactic acid-ammonia mix of human sweat, while still others use water to attract egg-laying females.The biggest weakness in the county\u2019s defenses is that officials still do \u201cpassive surveillance\u201d for cases of Zika infection \u2014 meaning they must wait for doctors to report them.Not every doctor who sees a rash and red eyes thinks of Zika. Test results can take weeks, and doctors often fail to alert the health department to new cases, even though they are legally required to do so.Dr. David E. Persse, Houston\u2019s chief medical officer, said he would prefer to do \u201cactive surveillance\u201d \u2014 by, for example, testing all blood specimens taken in local hospitals. \u201cBut there\u2019s no money for it,\u201d he said.More than 60 percent of the counties on the Gulf Coast and Mexican border, the areas likeliest to see a Zika outbreak, are rated \u201cin need of improvement\u201d for mosquito control, said Dr. Oscar Alleyne, public health adviser to the National Association of County and City Health Officials.The $1.1 billion in Zika funding that Congress passed last year runs out in September. The Trump administration seeks to cut the C.D.C. budget by $1.2 billion, to what the agency had 20 years ago.Many county health departments depend on C.D.C. grants, and they have already been \u201ceviscerated,\u201d said Claude Jacob, president of the health officials\u2019 association. Some 43,000 public health jobs were cut over the last decade.\u201cWe need a contingency fund for epidemics,\u201d said Dr. Paul Jarris, chief medical officer of the March of Dimes, which fights for Zika funding because of the danger to infants. \u201cIf we have a hurricane, FEMA doesn\u2019t have to wait for months until Congress responds. Not having a fund just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dMoney is not the only obstacle to turning back the virus.If there is no intense epidemic somewhere in the Western Hemisphere this summer, it will be hard to test any candidate Zika vaccine, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.For a valid study, between 2,500 and 5,000 people \u2014 ideally in several locations \u2014 must get either a vaccine or a placebo.\u201cIf we get a big, big outbreak, we can get an answer about the vaccine\u2019s efficacy by mid-2018,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, it may take till 2020 or 2021.\u201dThe virus is a great threat to pregnant women, however, and Dr. Fauci said he hoped there would be enough potential customers in middle-income countries like Brazil and Mexico, along with wealthy American tourists and business travelers, to keep vaccine research going.At least one concern is gone: It now seems clear that the Zika virus will not sweep through Africa or Asia, damaging tens of thousands of babies, as had been feared.Since Zika was found in Africa in 1947 and detected in spots in Asia in the 1950s, scientists suspect it has circulated silently on those continents for decades, probably misdiagnosed as mild dengue or other rash-causing fevers. If so, most girls may get it in childhood and become immune before entering their childbearing years.If the Zika virus does reach Houston, it may not spread rapidly for another reason: Though huge, the city is not dense. Real estate is so cheap that even the poorest neighborhoods, like East Aldine and the Fifth Ward, have some grass around each house.Population density is far lower than in the slums of Brazil or Mexico, where a mosquito can find many victims living almost on top of one another.Officials do what they can to keep Houstonians on guard. The county\u2019s \u201cSkeeter School Bus\u201d visits schools and playgrounds to enlist children in the cause, since they are effective at nagging their parents to empty birdbaths and clean gutters, said Dr. Umair A. Shah, public health director of Harris County.But a sense of fatigue is pervasive.\u201cLast year, as soon as you turned on TV \u2014 Zika! As soon as you got to work \u2014 Zika!\u201d Ms. Rocha said. \u201cThis year, I haven\u2019t seen anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Lose When the World Moves On From Email", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWhat was most notable about the Podesta stash \u2014 not to mention earlier releases from the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own server \u2014 was the Clinton campaign\u2019s apparent slavishness to email. No thought appeared too big or too small to escape documentation and discussion over a fundamentally insecure communication channel invented more than 50 years ago, and meant for subjects far less weighty than a campaign for the presidency. The Democrats\u2019 email troubles suggested how thoroughly email had seduced us, and how deeply we\u2019d all overcommitted to it \u2014 and how desperately we all needed to move to something more secure.The younger Mr. Trump\u2019s emails only underline that point. But they also suggest what we\u2019ll lose when, inevitably, the world does move on to something better than email \u2014 an unmatched historical record of some of the most important stories in the world.Precisely because it\u2019s inescapable, insecure and irresistibly convenient, email provides an almost uncomfortably intimate view into the historical record. It preserves time, location and state of mind, the what-when-where-and-who of every story we might want to dig up. The last two decades, email\u2019s high-water era, have thus been a bounty for anyone wishing to understand exactly what was happening in the inner circles of powerful organizations \u2014 for journalists, historians and prosecutors of white-collar crime, among others.Yet we should mourn email\u2019s death as much as we celebrate it; every organization\u2019s gain in privacy is bound to result in a loss of public transparency.One of email\u2019s best tricks is asynchronicity \u2014 you can send an email even if your recipient is away, unlike a phone call. But in this instance both parties appeared available to talk in real time; several of the missives were sent within minutes of each other. And not only that, they often both used iPhones. (Brace yourself: Mr. Goldstone\u2019s mobile email signature, \u201cThis iPhone speaks many languages,\u201d is destined to become an unbearable meme.)In other words, they could both have clicked one app over and hashed all this out in a phone call, which would have been faster and left almost no trace. (They did suggest holding a phone call, but it isn\u2019t clear if that took place; in an interview with Sean Hannity, Donald Trump Jr. said he recalled coordinating only through email.)But, no. Despite the sensitivity, email offered something irresistible to the participants. It was easy and it was there, and it felt secret at the time. Looking at the chain now, you might marvel at the brazenness of their conversation \u2014 what sort of numbskull would you have to be to write down, in an email, that you\u2019re offering a foreign government\u2019s help with a presidential campaign?And those are just the famous cases. Email evidence has become a routine linchpin of white-collar criminal prosecution, because everything anyone has ever thought is likely to be contained in email.Not for long.

{"Headline": "Microsoft to Cut Up to 4,000 Sales and Marketing Jobs", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft is overhauling its big sales and marketing organization in a move that will cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs, mostly outside the United States.A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that \u201croles will be eliminated\u201d and that most of them will be abroad, but he declined to be specific. The precise number is uncertain partly because in some countries, especially in Europe, labor laws require negotiations. The possible total was described by a person familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans, who was not authorized to speak on the record about them.Microsoft workers were notified on Thursday if their current job was affected. Some of the workers will get other jobs within the software company.\u201cThis is being done mainly to evolve the skill sets we need,\u201d said Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.In an internal email last week, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, described the reorganization and its rationale. He wrote that there was \u201can enormous $4.5 trillion market opportunity\u201d for Microsoft in the coming years.The sales and marketing changes, Mr. Althoff wrote, were intended to \u201cenable us to align the right resources for the right customer at the right time.\u201d Key areas of opportunity, he said, included expanding its cloud offerings in data analysis and artificial intelligence, and helping companies in every industry to become digital businesses, using Microsoft tools.Microsoft\u2019s global head count is 121,500, a number that has increased in the last few years.The one major work force cutback at Microsoft came in 2014, when 18,000 jobs were eliminated.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has made that transition to cloud software delivery, and its personal computer software business is no longer considered an engine of growth.New capabilities are being built into the cloud services, notably big data analysis and artificial intelligence. And businesses require specialized cloud software, tailored for their industry.The Microsoft email last week said the reorganization was intended to sharpen its focus on \u201csix priority industries\u201d: manufacturing, financial services, retail, health, education and government.Sales and marketing jobs in the future will often require more technical and industry-specific knowledge than before, Mr. Shaw said. The reorganization and job cuts, he added, were an effort to match the company\u2019s skills with the changing marketplace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "W.N.B.A.\u2019s Seattle Storm Embrace a Role in Social Activism", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 When the three women who make up Force 10 Hoops, the ownership group of the Seattle Storm, first purchased the team a decade ago, they did not see it as only a sports venture.The co-owners \u2014 Lisa Brummel, Ginny Gilder and Dawn Trudeau \u2014 constitute one of only two all-female ownership groups in major American sports, and they understood the role that they could play in furthering the progressive causes they believed in.\u201cI definitely got involved in the ownership group because I saw that this was the intersection of three things that I love: sports, business and social justice,\u201d said Gilder, a two-time United States Olympic rower whose efforts to fight for equality date to her protests as a Yale undergraduate in the 1970s.Sports teams are typically cautious when they decide to endorse an organization or a cause. But the Storm, who hosted the W.N.B.A. All-Star Game that was won by the West, 130-121, on Saturday, showed their activist bent when they held a rally on Tuesday night for Planned Parenthood, raising $41,790 by donating ticket proceeds.Teaming with Planned Parenthood, a frequent target of President Trump\u2019s administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, is anything but a cautious choice.And as Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, pointed out in an email, the Storm and the league speaking up for the organization reflected not only a historic moment, but also personal histories.\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to make sports history with the Storm,\u201d Richards wrote. \u201cThis is the first time ever a professional sports team has partnered with Planned Parenthood.\u201dShe added that Trudeau had \u201crelied on Planned Parenthood for birth control years ago,\u201d and that Imani Boyette of the Chicago Sky \u201crelied on Planned Parenthood when she grew up without health insurance.\u201dThe Storm\u2019s owners sought out a sweet spot of consensus, and the success of the event confirmed their read of their own fan base in a city known for its $15 minimum wage. The decision to take advocacy from implicit to explicit came directly from the days after the presidential election last fall.\u201cFor me, this thing with Planned Parenthood really came out of the sense of profound despondence in early November,\u201d Gilder said. \u201cThe sense of such utter helplessness. We live in a state where I can\u2019t vote a Republican out of office at the state level. So where do I personally make a difference? And sometimes, giving money just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s enough.\u201dThe decision to hold the Planned Parenthood event grew from this desire to do more, but the owners did not want the players to feel pressured to join. So the idea was discussed at the team\u2019s annual dinner.\u201cWe told them at that dinner that we were planning on doing this, that it was an owner initiative, that they had no responsibility to participate,\u201d said Trudeau, a former longtime executive at Microsoft.The Storm\u2019s event was not too surprising, however, in a league where social activism has become common. The Liberty and the Minnesota Lynx spoke out about police relationships with minority communities last season. The league\u2019s president, Lisa Borders, frequently weighs in on Twitter about political issues. And the league, in which many stars are gay, has supported the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community through events.Trudeau sees the effort by the Storm as reflective of that environment.\u201cLook, we\u2019re citizens, too,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt\u2019s like what we\u2019ve seen with athletes in recent years. You\u2019re living in this world. And you\u2019re saying: \u2018This isn\u2019t right. What can I do?\u2019 And all of us look at what assets, what tools, are available to us. I want to make a difference.\u201dThe state of the Storm and the league, some argue, represents progress as well. Long before Brummel owned the Storm or held a senior executive role at Microsoft, she was selected by the Dallas Diamonds in the 1981 Women\u2019s Professional Basketball League draft.\u201cWhen I was drafted into that league, the leagues were lucky to be in existence for more than two years,\u201d Brummel said. \u201cThat was Step No. 1. The idea that not only the league would survive, but you would be an advocate for something was well beyond what was even imaginable. It was just about survival at that time.\u201dContrast that with the present: a league in its third decade, and for the Storm an all-female ownership group, a female team president (Alisha Valavanis) and a female head coach (Jenny Boucek).\u201cBasketball is obviously what people would associate the Seattle Storm with,\u201d Brummel said, \u201cbut I think as soon as you go down to the next level, when you look at both the business expansion things we\u2019ve done and the social justice things, people expect us to do something like this.\u201dBrummel pointed out other efforts such as hosting the Pacific-12 Conference basketball tournament and a men\u2019s pro-am league game, and partnerships with other women\u2019s sports organizations at the pro and college level, including the Seattle Reign of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League.Yet all three owners stressed the need for balance between basketball and advocacy. The Planned Parenthood rally was expected to be the exception, not the rule. The primary goal of the Storm is to win championships.But after spending Tuesday night surrounded by \u201cpeople who share my values and our values,\u201d as Gilder said, the Storm\u2019s owners do not sound ready to leave the fight.Advertisement"}

After the first attack, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the theft of the cyberweapons was equivalent to Tomahawk missiles\u2019 being stolen from the military, and he issued a scathing critique of the government\u2019s stockpiling of computer vulnerabilities. The N.S.A. has not only failed to assist in identifying the vulnerabilities its weapons were designed to exploit but has also not even acknowledged their existence or their theft.It remains a mystery whether the N.S.A. knows how its weapons were stolen. What is known is that a group called Shadow Brokers started offering them for sale in August and made them public in April. It promised a fresh batch last month, offering them to monthly subscribers. Former intelligence officials said it was clear the weapons came from an N.S.A. unit formerly known as Tailored Access Operations.Secrecy, of course, is the N.S.A.\u2019s stock in trade, and acknowledging authorship of stolen cyberweapons runs counter to everything the spy agency does.

The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.As is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how.

Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.Apple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place.\u201d The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple\u2019s encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.\u201cThe addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,\u201d Apple said.China\u2019s rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.The iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple\u2019s business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s global sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.But the iPhone has also become emblematic of China\u2019s long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.Apple already stores some of the data of China\u2019s residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.In 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.Careful not to offend, Apple said it \u201cappreciated\u201d that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users\u2019 locations.The opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple\u2019s iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple\u2019s Chinese partner.Apple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple\u2019s permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.Other American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.Even though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple\u2019s smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Town Melts Down", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "FeatureA veteran political reporter takes stock of how Washington has \u2014 and hasn\u2019t \u2014 changed in the time of Trump.Supported byIn the political order of the pre-Trump era, Spicer represented a Washington \u2018\u2018type\u2019\u2019 in good standing: an amiable plodder in his job as spokesman for the Republican National Committee and a stock character of the local ensemble. He was an eager shooter of the breeze, visible at cocktail parties and serviceable on TV. I once described the pre-Trump Spicer as being a \u2018\u2018lower-wattage aide,\u2019\u2019 which he would often remind me of whenever I used to see him around the city. He never appeared overly bothered by this and spoke in a tone somewhere between stage-wincing and sarcastic pride that he even rated a mention at all.After I had waited 45 minutes, Spicer stepped out and apologized. In the same way that a dog can take on a resemblance to its owner, Spicer has acquired a swollen, hopped-up and somewhat persecuted countenance, as if he were the physical embodiment of a news cycle on steroids. Wattage, for better or worse, was no longer an issue for Sean Spicer, who has a legitimate claim to being the most well-known White House spokesman of all time. I told him that I would come back the next day and that I wanted to interview him. \u2018\u2018No, you\u2019re not,\u2019\u2019 Spicer said quickly. \u2018\u2018Not on the record, you\u2019re not.\u2019\u2019 Then, softening, he said he would consider it but that any spotlight trained on him would not be helpful \u2018\u2018to my current status.\u2019\u2019This phrase \u2014 \u2018\u2018current status\u2019\u2019 \u2014 struck me as a perfectly of-the-moment representation of the city from which Spicer had derived a creditable identity for himself until he (and it) had become otherwise occupied. To begin with, it was well known that Spicer\u2019s \u2018\u2018current status\u2019\u2019 had been a volatile predicament from pretty much the start of this volatile presidency. \u2018\u2018Embattled\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018beleaguered\u2019\u2019 effectively became part of his job title. There was the recurring \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\u2019 character (\u2018\u2018Spicey,\u2019\u2019 played by Melissa McCarthy), real-time chyron shaming (CNN: \u2018\u2018President\u2019s spokesman says he can\u2019t speak for the president\u2019\u2019) and nonstop abuse and incredulity from much of the press corps. And yet in keeping with the Trump-era rule stipulating that \u2018\u2018the enemy of the enemy of the people is my friend,\u2019\u2019 the mockery directed at this blandly ubiquitous greenroom denizen \u2014 just the kind of Washington political hack Trump ran against \u2014 propelled him to a golden status with \u2018\u2018the base.\u2019\u2019 At Trump\u2019s postelection rallies across the country, the press secretary was engulfed by squealing, selfie-seeking fans and drew a fuss meriting its own headlines (\u2018\u2018Spicer Treated Like a Rock Star at Trump\u2019s Nashville Rally\u2019\u2019). His daily briefings became appointment cable viewing for groupies and hate-watchers alike, at least until the White House started disallowing cameras at many of them.But now another Trumpian rule had kicked in, which is why Spicer was careful to marvel only privately at how big he had become. To be caught trumpeting your own fame and impact is a cardinal sin in Trump\u2019s White House, where attention is zero-sum, and Trump is not one for sharing. By early June, Spicer had apparently taken a few turns in the revolving doghouse of this administration. You lose track of who is supposedly on the outs in any given week \u2014 Reince Priebus? Steve Bannon? Kellyanne Conway? Press reports have dutifully described Trump\u2019s efforts to humiliate him (denying Spicer, a Catholic, an audience with the pope while at the Vatican) and listing his possible replacements at the lectern (Laura Ingraham being the evergreen mention). All of this had, perversely, compounded Spicer\u2019s \u2018\u2018current status\u2019\u2019 even more by making him a strange object of fascination in the capital: Washington loves a death watch, and Spicer has been seen as a dead man talking for months \u2014 and yet he kept showing up and taking it. \u2018\u2018You know, at first I really didn\u2019t like Spicer,\u2019\u2019 Senator John McCain told me. \u2018\u2018Now I just feel sorry for the guy.\u2019\u2019Spicer cuts an oddly compelling profile in that he represents a crossover player, someone who comfortably inhabited the old Tokyo-on-the-Potomac before Godzilla was elected and put him to work. He also seems to embody a particular neurosis of Trump-era Washington, where the lizard-brain logic of making a name for yourself is colliding with the imperative of survival in the shadow of a capricious force. To some degree, Washington will always learn how to adapt to the distinct styles, personalities and expectations of a new president. It will ascertain how decisions are made, the processes leading up to them and the factors that influence a White House organization. This is next to impossible in Trumpland, mainly because \u2018\u2018process,\u2019\u2019 such as it is, resides purely with the whims of one man. It is all about Trump. Everything is at his mercy, and little about it is comfortable. It creates an overwrought environment to perform in, and the closer in you have to operate, the more intense it becomes.In early June, I stopped by the White House to see Hope Hicks, the president\u2019s longtime aide and another close-in operator, whom I came to know during the campaign. After about 15 minutes of chatting in an ornate West Wing conference room, she asked me if I wanted to \u2018\u2018say hello.\u2019\u2019 I wondered to whom. \u2018\u2018Reince? Spicer?\u2019\u2019No, she said, \u2018\u2018Potus.\u2019\u2019Huh. It\u2019s usually not this easy to infringe on the president\u2019s schedule.\u2018\u2018Uh, sure,\u2019\u2019 I said.She walked me in.The president was sitting alone in a small dining room just off the Oval Office at a wooden table covered with papers. His cheeks were the color of coral, not the usual glowing orange we see when he\u2019s framed by a screen. Trump half-stood, said hello and shook my hand. I hadn\u2019t seen him since the election, and I congratulated him on his victory. He thanked me and pointed out that \u2018\u2018you treated me very badly\u2019\u2019 during the campaign, and that the \u2018\u2018failing New York Times\u2019\u2019 had been \u2018\u2018so unfair\u2019\u2019 to him, but he was perfectly pleasant about it. Trump also mentioned that his popularity with his base was \u2018\u2018looking great\u2019\u2019 and that he had \u2018\u2018inherited a mess.\u2019\u2019It was 12:30, but the president was not eating lunch. He was watching a recording of \u2018\u2018Fox and Friends\u2019\u2019 from about four hours earlier on a large TV mounted on the wall. This was one of those stretches when Trump was tweeting a lot, including attacks on the mayor of London following a terrorist attack on the city the previous weekend. The tweets were becoming a growing topic of concern among Republicans, many of whom were urging him to stop. But like most reporters, I found his tweets far more illuminating than anything the White House press office could ever disgorge. I urged him to keep it up.Trump assured me that he would keep tweeting. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s my voice,\u2019\u2019 Trump said of Twitter, enumerating how many millions of followers he had. \u2018\u2018They want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Trump said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u2019\u2019Nearly every White House job, as traditionally conceived, has been transformed by this president and his \u2018\u2018voice,\u2019\u2019 none more so than trying to be the spokesman for the man who is always reminding everyone that no one speaks for Trump but Trump. When I stopped back at Spicer\u2019s office a few days later, he had just completed one of his untelevised briefings, during which he appeared relatively serene, spared the camera\u2019s eye and attendant scrutiny from the Oval Office. I found him at a standing desk, flanked by TVs playing audio-only versions of his performance. I brought up his debut in January, in which he insistently defended Trump\u2019s risible claim that he had drawn \u2018\u2018the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u2019\u2019 and then left without taking questions. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not here to relitigate every [expletive] number,\u2019\u2019 Spicer said, and then launched into a lengthy relitigation about how the growth in online viewership, the advent of Twitter and the explosion of mobile devices made it entirely possible that more people watched \u2018\u2018around the globe.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018If you do apples to apples, the attendance was larger for Obama, O.K., fair enough,\u2019\u2019 he conceded. He said he \u2018\u2018owned\u2019\u2019 that, but then complained that the press perpetrates a bitterly unfair double standard against him. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait a second, you guys write corrections all the time,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he litigated. \u2018\u2018But when I do it, it\u2019s treasonous?\u2019\u2019Spicer\u2019s adviser stepped in to remind him that he had a TV interview to do in a few minutes. He walked over to a small desk in the corner of his office and started rubbing on foundation. I made a verbal note of this into my tape recorder. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you dare,\u2019\u2019 Spicer said, \u2018\u2018just so we\u2019re clear.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You\u2019re putting on makeup,\u2019\u2019 I said.\u2018\u2018You\u2019re going to say that in the story,\u2019\u2019 he charged, \u2018\u2018that I\u2019m putting on makeup?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Well, you are.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I\u2019m going on my way to a television hit,\u2019\u2019 he said. He patted his cheeks a few times with a makeup puff.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s fine,\u2019\u2019 I said.\u2018\u2018So, as long as it\u2019s in context.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You\u2019re going on TV,\u2019\u2019 I affirmed.\u2018\u2018I believe there are too many reporters who are looking for some snarky angle,\u2019\u2019 he said.We walked out of the White House, and Spicer, looking perfect, veered off to the front lawn to tape his second on-camera interview of the afternoon with Fox News.To outward appearances, This Town in the time of Trump seems as fat and cozy as ever. The city is thriving with construction projects, abundant lobbying, government contracts, media gigs and bull-market wealth. This is hardly a Trump-specific phenomenon. Washingtonians have claimed the highest average income in the country for years. Every recent administration has put its mark on the boom, and this one is no different. Trump-connected consultants and administration officials show up in chic restaurants along 14th Street, K Street, Penn Quarter and Georgetown. (\u2018\u2018WHAT A TOWN!\u2019\u2019 exulted Playbook, Politico\u2019s tip sheet, on June 2. \u2018\u2018E.P.A. ADMINISTRATOR SCOTT PRUITT celebrated exiting the Paris agreement by dining last night at .\u2009.\u2009. Le Diplomate, the French bistro on 14th Street with some aides!\u2019\u2019) The swamp feels anything but drained; more like remodeled into a gold-plated hot tub.But as Trump\u2019s impulsive, vindictively personal style has been transferred, unhumbled and unpivoted, to the White House, it has also introduced new variables into the capital\u2019s power calculus \u2014 one being that access to power governs status. Since Trump is everywhere, \u2018\u2018access\u2019\u2019 in the traditional sense holds much less currency than it once did. Getting close to him requires sucking up to fewer people than it did with pre-Trump presidents: The most direct path might be to suck up to a cable-TV booker, get on one of \u2018\u2018the shows,\u2019\u2019 say something nice about him and wait for the thank-you tweet. The ability to ascertain \u2018\u2018what the White House is thinking\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018the president\u2019s mind-set\u2019\u2019 once accounted for many hours (often billable) of analysis. Now it only requires a Twitter account.Unlike previous presidents\u2019, Trump\u2019s unpredictability makes playing the power game treacherous, to say the least. Lobbyists and corporations live in fear of doing something that would agitate the White House, something that could incite a tweet and tank a stock. You hear of longtime Washington lawyers, operatives and consultants who are shunned and disparaged (usually off the record) for deigning to work with Godzilla. Trump also presents a particular challenge for Republican members of Congress. For officeholders, Trump becomes a test of coping and courage, particularly within the family he has chosen as his own, the Republican Party. Members of Congress can be seen scurrying down hallways, fake-talking on their cellphones and ducking out back doors to avoid reporters\u2019 questions about the latest tweet.I made my first visit there in late spring to meet Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and still-confidant Corey Lewandowski. He held court in the middle of the lobby bar, seated at a table marked \u2018\u2018Reserved\u2019\u2019 with a shiny glass plate. The last time I saw Lewandowski was in February, before the Super Bowl in Houston. He was there as a guest of Microsoft, wearing shorts and a red-and-white New England Patriots polo shirt and chatting with Robert Kraft, the Patriots\u2019 owner and a Trump friend, at a V.I.P. reception before the game. Lewandowski was now dressed in a sharp gray suit and shiny black dress shoes. Potential clients were knocking down his door, he told me. He was, by any measure, a made man.As with many people that populate the inner ring of Trumpland, Lewandowski has virtually no cachet independent from his relationship to the president. He has spent his career as a journeyman political operative, a two-time failed candidate for office (in Massachusetts and New Hampshire) and a police officer. Yet where the Clintons were surrounded by a vast horde of \u2018\u2018friends,\u2019\u2019 Trump ran a family business with a small network of flag-wavers. His campaign was a tiny operation, and Lewandowski got in early, stuck around and stayed loyal. Never mind that he was bounced as campaign manager in June 2016, one reason being that he had run afoul of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump; Bloomberg reported last month of a d\u00e9tente between Lewandowski and Kushner, consummated on a \u2018\u2018stroll through the White House Rose Garden,\u2019\u2019 ending in a hug.Being one of \u2018\u2018Trump\u2019s guys\u2019\u2019 positions Lewandowski at the apex of Washington influence in 2017. He is clearly close to the president. He can decipher his moods, know which buttons to push and when to stay away. Rather than \u2018\u2018going in\u2019\u2019 (local shorthand for \u2018\u2018going in to an administration\u2019\u2019), Lewandowski leveraged his big-fish status in Trump\u00adland to open a lucrative Washington consultancy to help corporations and clients \u2018\u2018navigate\u2019\u2019 the new administration. Unlike Spicer\u2019s position, this inside-out role enables Lewandowski to pick his spots and steer clear of the West Wing infighting and fiefs and, maybe most of all, the day-to-day dramas inherent in being too close to Donald J. Trump.Lewandowski warned me to keep my voice down, as he suspected that the guy sitting on the couch behind him was an eavesdropping reporter \u2014 a familiar hazard at the Trump Hotel. After a few minutes, we were joined by Anthony Scaramucci, the Long Island-born financier, fund-raiser and Trump acolyte \u2014 known as \u2018\u2018the Mooch\u2019\u2019 to fellow Trumpians, New York tabloid-headline writers as well as his long-ago Little League teammates. Scaramucci, whose sculpted jaw, hair and form-fitting suit give the impression of an infomercial host, had been having trouble landing a top White House job. He had apparently been up for a role as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses, but that stalled because of complications related to the sale of his company, SkyBridge Capital, to foreign buyers.\u2018\u2018Thanks for that thing at the White House today,\u2019\u2019 Scaramucci told Lewandowski, the first of four times he would thank him in the five minutes that we were together. The men locked eyes and nodded simultaneously: Gratitude acknowledged, accepted. Lewandowski had to rush off to catch a flight home to New Hampshire, where he lives with his wife and four children. The Mooch thanked him again.I found out later that Scaramucci was now in line to be the Paris-based ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, pending Senate confirmation. In the interim, Scaramucci has been appointed chief strategy officer of the United States Export-Import Bank, an institution that Trump derided during the campaign as \u2018\u2018excess baggage.\u2019\u2019 But the Mooch says the plan is now to keep the bank open. The excess baggage, in other words, has been claimed.There have been exceptions, but by far the most vocal critics of Trump on the right have been the columnists, political consultants and former Republican officeholders who don\u2019t need to face voters. Trump \u2018\u2018has been a complete disaster\u2019\u2019 in office beyond foreign policy, said John Boehner, the former Republican speaker \u2014 the key word being \u2018\u2018former.\u2019\u2019 (He was speaking at a private event in Houston; he later tried to walk the comment back.) You encounter many elected Republicans these days who struggle to calibrate their reactions to the president by what the Republican media consultant Rick Wilson refers to as \u2018\u2018F.O.M.T.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018Fear of Mean Tweets.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the great dichotomy of my life right now,\u2019\u2019 says Wilson, an outspoken anti-Trump voice who speaks often to clients and friends who are Republican officeholders. \u2018\u2018I have guys call me literally on the verge of tears some days, like, \u2018This guy is going to get us killed,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Wilson told me. \u2018\u2018And then they go out the next day, and they can\u2019t wait to build the wall, they want to \u2018make America great again\u2019 all day long.\u2019\u2019Elected Republicans operate in their own distinct habitat when figuring how to deal with this White House. They are, in a partisan sense, on Trump\u2019s team. They share policy goals and agenda items. They need each other, ostensibly. But members of Congress live in their own parallel power centers, with their own districts, voters and issues to worry about, not to mention the peculiar dynamics of their institution. Being married to Trump can make for tense and uncomfortable times, as any Republican of Capitol Hill these days can attest when they\u2019re not running away.When approached, Republican members attempt to fashion boundaries on Trump-related engagement. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, has gone through numerous strategies. He has tried to place Trump\u2019s tweets off-limits (\u2018\u2018I typically don\u2019t quote or comment on the tweet of the hour,\u2019\u2019 he said in February), chide reporters for focusing on these trivial matters (\u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to do my job. I\u2019ll let you guys do yours with respect to how you report, or what you don\u2019t report\u2019\u2019), suggest he has more important things to do (\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not going to comment on this stuff,\u2019\u2019 in response to a reporter\u2019s question about something Trump said about Arnold Schwarzenegger) and plead (\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s talk about policy\u2019\u2019).When I went to see John McCain, Graham\u2019s Senate sidekick, the next week, he seemed to be in a darker place. Now 80, McCain has been traveling the globe to the point of weariness, seemingly on a personal mission to reassure allies unnerved by Trump. It was Trump\u2019s ability to deceive with impunity while still claiming the mantle of the tough-talking truth-teller that seemed to gall him most. \u2018\u2018If I were a Democrat right now, I\u2019d be going after Trump for not telling the truth,\u2019\u2019 McCain said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d leave the issues, and just say, \u2018Look, you can\u2019t trust this guy, you can\u2019t trust him.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 McCain told me he had arrived at a coping strategy. \u2018\u2018After about a month, I decided I\u2019ll just watch what he does, not just what his tweets are,\u2019\u2019 McCain said. \u2018\u2018And whatever, I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u2019 He caught himself. \u2018\u2018I care,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but I\u2019m not going to react. I think it was gradual. First shock, then surprise, then Whisky Tango Foxtrot\u2019\u2019\u2014 military slang for a three-letter abbreviation that you also hear a lot these days.Ryan, who was persuaded by his House colleagues to replace Boehner as speaker in 2015, has perfected his \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t need this job\u2019\u2019 shtick. He will frequently express longing for his previous post as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. When I interviewed him in his grand office at the Capitol, I asked what he liked best about being speaker. \u2018\u2018The impact, the big impact I can have,\u2019\u2019 he said.What\u2019s the worst part?\u2018\u2018Everything else,\u2019\u2019 Ryan said. He laughed and then tried to declare what he\u2019d just said \u2018\u2018kinda off the record.\u2019\u2019As the highest-ranking Republican outside the White House, Ryan has been lacerated as one of Trump\u2019s chief enablers and portrayed as a weak supplicant. \u2018\u2018He feeds me dog food,\u2019\u2019 Mikey Day, playing Ryan, exclaimed in a brutal \u2018\u2018S.N.L.\u2019\u2019 sendup in which the apron-clad speaker scurries in to deliver the president\u2019s ice cream (\u2018\u2018Here\u2019s two scoops!\u2019\u2019). Ryan shrugged me off when I brought this up. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re going to say that anyway, so it doesn\u2019t really bother me,\u2019\u2019 he said. Ryan told me that he had settled on a method of sharing his opinions and criticisms with Trump, but only privately. \u2018\u2018We have pretty candid conversations,\u2019\u2019 he assured me. \u2018\u2018I find that public fights don\u2019t achieve anything.\u2019\u2019A few This Town veterans told me that this scary new normal has instilled in them a greater appreciation for old-normal rituals. The congressional baseball game, which obviously took on greater significance this year, is one of these. Traditionally, it has been a sleepy-but-nice event in which dorky partisans in the crowd can be heard chanting sick burns at their opposition. \u2018\u2018Justice Roberts!\u2019\u2019 Democrats taunted Republicans in 2012, after the conservative chief justice cast the deciding vote upholding Obamacare. Well, then, Republicans took to chanting \u2018\u2018T.P.A., T.P.A.\u2019\u2019 in 2015 \u2014 as Obama was trying to secure trade promotion authority from Congress (ouch!).Scalise was supposed to be playing second base for the Republican team. On June 14, the morning he was shot, he had been standing just down the baseline from Representative Tom Rooney of Florida, who played first base. As it happened, I met Rooney two months before, though I didn\u2019t realize he was in Congress. We were in Pittsburgh, at the funeral of his uncle Dan Rooney, the Hall of Fame member and owner of the Steelers. Tom introduced himself to me as \u2018\u2018someone who works in politics in D.C.,\u2019\u2019 and I assumed he was a lobbyist or consultant or some other Swamp-dweller. He was not wearing a congressional pin, the telltale way to identify a member. But Rooney rarely wears his pin, and when he does, he often tries to cover it up. He does not wish to be fussed over, lectured or hectored, or worse.It was only after Rooney and I became reacquainted through a colleague in Washington that he told me he had been a member of Congress since 2009. He said he had done much soul-searching over the years about whether his coveted position was worth the grind, sacrifice and abuse. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re putting yourself at risk,\u2019\u2019 Rooney said. \u2018\u2018Is that what we\u2019re signing up for?\u2019\u2019We were sitting in a Starbucks on Capitol Hill on a late June morning. A week earlier, Rooney, 46, was at baseball practice with his colleagues, but he left just after 7 a.m. to take his children to school. He texted his wife at 7:05 to tell her he was on his way. The gunman began firing shortly before 7:09, according to police reports. \u2018\u2018If Steve had screamed and went to the ground, my instinct would have been to walk over to him,\u2019\u2019 said Rooney, who stands 6-foot-4 and weighs 230 pounds. \u2018\u2018I would have been a big, fat target.\u2019\u2019Rooney says he has been going through many emotions since the shooting, including guilt over having left practice early. He consulted his Republican colleague Adam Kinzinger, who in 2006 wrestled and disarmed a knife-wielding attacker in Milwaukee. \u2018\u2018I definitely had some P.T.S. on the stabbing thing,\u2019\u2019 Kinzinger said. \u2018\u2018It changes you, definitely.\u2019\u2019 Political violence has worried him for a long time, he said, and he is also concerned about where the insanity of the Trump-era news cycle will lead: \u2018\u2018When your engines are constantly on red line, it\u2019s going to overheat and it\u2019s going to crush and eventually break.\u2019\u2019As with most of their colleagues, Rooney and Kinzinger are largely unknown outside their districts. The most important thing many people will judge them on is what team they play for \u2014 the Rs or Ds. They both have friends in the other party. \u2018\u2018You almost have to hide the fact that you like them,\u2019\u2019 Rooney said, of Democrats. \u2018\u2018Nobody understands what it\u2019s like to be a member of Congress except another member of Congress.\u2019\u2019 That has become another hallmark of life in the modern swamp: Common humanity is best expressed in private. Rooney observed that the increasingly pitched tone of our political dialogues \u2014 in campaigns, in Congress and certainly online \u2014 can become mutually reinforcing. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a sense that people out in the country can see the far left and the far right on social media, and they think it\u2019s O.K. to act out any way they want,\u2019\u2019 Rooney said.Suddenly, as he spoke, Rooney\u2019s tone acquired an edge. There was something he wanted to say, something that made him mad. The newly sworn-in representative Greg Gianforte had just given his first House speech. Gianforte, a Montana Republican, will be forever known as the guy who body-slammed the Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of his May 25 special election. He won anyway. And Gianforte used his maiden remarks on the floor to call for mandatory term limits, a ban on lobbying for any former member and a suspension of congressional salary if the House does not pass a balanced budget.Rooney told me about \u2018\u2018a really tender moment\u2019\u2019 he had just shared with his older brother, Pat, \u2018\u2018whose job it\u2019s been to bust my balls my entire life.\u2019\u2019 The Rooney brothers saw each other for the first time after the baseball-practice shooting at their family vacation home in Pennsylvania. Pat put his hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder and said it was really good to see him. \u2018\u2018It was the most sincere moment I\u2019ve ever had with my brother,\u2019\u2019 Tom said. \u2018\u2018And then he\u2019s like, \u2018You need to find another job.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Rooney told me he did not know if he would run for re-election next year, but said he was reluctant to be too critical of Trump, in case he did. Like many of his colleagues, he is ambivalent about the president, but his frustrations with Washington long predate Trump\u2019s arrival. His fondest hope for change with Trump was that Republicans might finally accomplish things. \u2018\u2018Things do need to change,\u2019\u2019 he told me. The shooting, and the feeling of vulnerability it engendered, would be something he considered in his \u2018\u2018Is it worth it?\u2019\u2019 calculus.An article on July 16 about Washington politics misidentified the location where John Boehner, the former Republican speaker, called the Trump administration \u201ca complete disaster.\u201d The comment was made in Houston, not Colorado.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Minecraft: The Island\u2019 Blurs the Line Between Fiction and Gaming", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe protagonist of Max Brooks\u2019s new fantasy novel doesn\u2019t have a name, a gender or even normal human appendages. Instead of hands, the narrator has clumsy, flesh-toned cubes, just one more weird feature of the strange and unsettling world where the story unfolds, where everything \u2014 the sun, clouds, cows, mushrooms, watermelons \u2014 is composed of squares.For the uninitiated, the setting may seem bizarre and disorienting, but Mr. Brooks isn\u2019t writing for novices or lay readers. He\u2019s writing for a very particular tribe: die-hard devotees of the video game Minecraft.\u201cMinecraft: The Island,\u201d which was released this month by the science fiction and fantasy publisher Del Rey, represents an unusual experiment in multiplatform brand extension. It marks the first officially sanctioned novel commissioned by Mojang, the Swedish game studio behind Minecraft, as the company seeks new ways to capitalize on the game\u2019s enormous popularity. (To eliminate any doubt about the company\u2019s consent, Mojang\u2019s name and logo appear twice on the book\u2019s cover, which bears the bland endorsement, \u201cMojang Official Product.\u201d)Unlike most video and computer games, Minecraft doesn\u2019t have clear-cut objectives or levels to ascend. Instead, it\u2019s more like an elaborate digital Lego set that allows players to build whatever they like, designing their own castles, skyscrapers, underground bunkers and booby traps.The open-ended nature of the game is a big part of its appeal. Since its release in 2011, Minecraft has sold more than 122 million copies and now has 55 million active monthly users. The game\u2019s user base exploded so rapidly that in 2014, Microsoft bought the company for $2.5 billion.\u201cWe had been thinking about fiction for a long time but wanted to make sure that it didn\u2019t take away from people\u2019s experience of the game, because everyone plays in a different way,\u201d said Lydia Winters, Mojang\u2019s brand director.But commissioning a brand-approved Minecraft novel posed unique creative and commercial challenges. How do you create a story with a beginning, a middle and an end out of an open-ended game? And would gamers bother to pick up a nearly 300-page novel about Minecraft, when they could be spending their free time playing it?Mr. Brooks \u2014 a cheerful, enthusiastic paranoiac who is obsessed with survival strategies, zombies, apocalyptic scenarios and plagues \u2014 wrote the story as a first-person, Robinson Crusoe-esque narrative, featuring an initially hapless character who is stranded on a strange island and has to build shelter, find food and fight off zombies and giant spiders, all features that exist in the game.When Mojang approached him to write a Minecraft novel in fall 2015, Mr. Brooks already had a track record as a best-selling author. The son of the actor Mel Brooks and the actress Anne Bancroft, Max Brooks turned to fiction after a brief and unremarkable career in comedy writing, which included a stint as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dAfter he was fired from the show, he started writing chillingly realistic zombie fiction and found his calling. Two of his previous books, \u201cWorld War Z\u201d and \u201cThe Zombie Survival Guide,\u201d have collectively sold more than 3.5 million copies, and \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d a faux oral history about the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, was adapted into a feature film starring Brad Pitt.Other successful authors might have brushed off an invitation to write a video game tie-in novel, an unabashedly commercial genre that some say amounts to little more than elaborate product placement. But Mr. Brooks happens to be an avid Minecraft player and jumped at the opportunity. He was determined to write a story that mirrored the experience of playing the game. He developed a plot that conformed to the Minecraft universe so closely that someone reading the book could recreate the narrative within the game and play along.\u201cI war-gamed out everything,\u201d Mr. Brooks said in a recent interview from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cMy biggest fear was that somebody tries to play out my book and finds out it won\u2019t work.\u201dIn the process, he may have also created a strange new entertainment category, one that hovers somewhere between fan fiction, role-playing games and literature \u2014 a novel set in a game, that can itself be played within the game.Publishers have been releasing novels based on popular video games for decades, hoping to capture a slice of the medium\u2019s huge fan base. Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, has published fictional series based on games like Halo, Doom and World of Warcraft, and has millions of copies of its video game tie-in novels in circulation. Other publishers have built fictional franchises based on games like Gears of War, Starcraft, BioShock and Tomb Raider.\u201cEspecially with teenage boys, it\u2019s one of the only ways we can get them to read,\u201d said Keith Clayton, the associate publisher at Del Rey.Mr. Brooks, 45, began playing Minecraft five years ago, after a family friend showed him how the game worked. He began playing regularly with his son, who is now 12, and was immediately sucked in by the creative possibilities of the game.When Mojang asked if he would be interested in writing a Minecraft novel, Mr. Brooks was so enthusiastic that he wrote a full draft before his contract was even completed. For the most part, Mojang gave him freedom to write the story however he wanted. The company\u2019s only instructions had to do with the protagonist\u2019s physical appearance.\u201cThey were very hands off when it came to the story, but very hands on when it came to inclusiveness,\u201d he said.Mojang wanted to make sure that any Minecraft player could pick up the novel and imagine himself or herself in it. The company even commissioned two different versions of the audiobook, one by a female narrator, Samira Wiley, and another by a man, the actor Jack Black, so that listeners can choose a narrator of either gender.Keeping the character\u2019s identity ambiguous wasn\u2019t too hard: Because the hero is stranded alone on an island, with only animals and other ghoulish creatures to talk to, Mr. Brooks was able to avoid using gendered pronouns.Mr. Brooks concedes that the novel, which is geared toward 8- to 12-year-olds, might not hold much appeal for those who are unfamiliar with the game.The plot was created for players, and perhaps parents and grandparents who want to understand the game\u2019s appeal, Mr. Brooks said.Above all, though, Mr. Brooks wrote it to satisfy his own creative impulses.\u201cHonestly, at the end of it all, I wrote it for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a fan first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do Egg Donors Face Long-Term Risks?", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthWhen patients consider a medical procedure, they may be told \u201cthere are no known long-term effects.\u201d But unless such effects have been systematically studied, that does not mean there are no long-term effects.That\u2019s a major concern for Dr. Jennifer Schneider, mother of a three-time egg donor, Jessica Grace Wing. Ms. Wing was a tall, lean, attractive, athletic and musically talented Stanford University student when she decided to donate her eggs to help pay for her education. Through her multiple donations, five healthy children were born to three formerly childless families.When her mother asked if egg donation was safe, Ms. Wing said she was told it was. What she did not know at the time was that no one had ever looked beyond the short-term effects of the many hormone injections needed to stimulate the release of multiple eggs at one time.Ms. Wing\u2019s cancer may have been totally unrelated to her egg donations. But given that Ms. Wing had been a health-conscious young woman with no family history of colon cancer or genes associated with this disease, Dr. Schneider wondered if the extensive hormone treatments her daughter had undergone might have stimulated growth of the cancer and if other egg donors might also be at risk.Alas, she soon discovered, it was impossible to know because no one was keeping track of the medical or psychological fate of egg donors. Once donors walk out the door, they are essentially lost to medical history.But 14 years after her daughter\u2019s death, there is still no one tracking the fate of egg donors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects information on in vitro fertilization, but not on those who donate their eggs either anonymously or to family members or friends unable to get pregnant with their own eggs.Donor eggs are typically used for women seeking pregnancy who may have undergone early menopause, have poor egg quality, a history of genetic disease, a hormonal imbalance, ovaries that fail to respond to stimulation, or are over the age of 40.\u201cEgg donors are just not on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d Dr. Schneider, who lives in Tucson and is certified in internal medicine, addiction medicine and pain management, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sperm donation, which doesn\u2019t involve hormone injections or any invasive treatments. In my opinion, egg donors need to be treated like all other organ donors \u2014 their health should be monitored.\u201dThe London doctors, K.K. Ahuja and E.G. Simons of Cromwell Hospital, called upon the British Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority \u201cto confirm that ovarian stimulation in volunteer egg donors does not increase the risk of cancer over and above the background rate.\u201d But this has yet to be done.Similar risks might also exist for women who are able to supply their own eggs for in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F. They undergo the same hormone treatments as egg donors. However, these women, who are typically older and may have endocrine or other abnormalities, are not a reliable group for determining long-term risks for young, healthy egg donors.Dr. Schneider and co-authors expressed concern as well about another group of women: those whose eggs are harvested and preserved for their own future use. They undergo the same hormone treatments, perhaps more than once if not enough healthy eggs are obtained on a first attempt. If successful, egg freezing can enable women to delay pregnancy and remain in the work force until well beyond normal childbearing years.But until more is known, Dr. Schneider has written, \u201cAll women who undergo ovarian stimulation, especially more than once, should be told that their long-term health risks are unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Close Digital Divide, Microsoft to Harness Unused Television Channels", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Silicon Valley has dreamed up hot air balloons, drones and constellations of mini-satellites to connect the world to the internet. Now Microsoft is adding its own moonshot to solve the digital divide into that mix.The United States has long grappled with uneven internet access. Many remote and less-populated areas have had particular trouble obtaining fast internet service because providers often cannot justify the cost of building out infrastructure to isolated locales with few people to serve.White-spaces technology has emerged as a potential solution to that problem. Since 2008, Microsoft and other companies have been involved in tests of television white spaces for internet access.The technology is sometimes known as \u201csuper Wi-Fi\u201d because it behaves like regular Wi-Fi but uses low-powered television channels to cover far greater distances than wireless hot spots. It is also more powerful than cellular service because the frequencies can penetrate concrete walls and other obstacles.Promoting the white-spaces technology could reap rewards for tech companies: The remaining 24.3 million people in rural areas without internet are potential customers of cloud applications, search and other digital services.To support the white-spaces plan, Microsoft is appealing to federal and state regulators to guarantee the use of unused television channels and investments in promoting the technology in rural areas.But the company faces many hurdles with the technology. For one, few manufacturers are making devices compatible with white-spaces technology, and some devices that can be used with the technology cost more than $1,000 each. The National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group, said that only 800 devices that worked with white-spaces technology had been registered with regulators.\u201cWhite spaces has tremendous opportunity to help with broadband coverage in rural areas, but it\u2019s hard to justify the cost to device makers who don\u2019t see economies of scale in rural areas,\u201d said Doug Brake, a senior analyst at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a research organization that is sponsored by tech companies including Microsoft.Mr. Smith said that he would demonstrate four devices that work with white-space technology at Tuesday\u2019s event, adding that prices for such gadgets would fall below $200 by next year.Another challenge is a battle with television broadcasters who have long argued that devices on the unused airwaves can interfere with the broadcasts run on neighboring channels. This week, the National Association of Broadcasters filed comments with the Federal Communications Commission arguing against Microsoft\u2019s request for one nationwide channel to be set aside for white-spaces use.\u201cMicrosoft has been making promises about white-spaces technology for well over a decade,\u201d Patrick McFadden, an associate general counsel for the association, wrote in comments to the commission. \u201cAt what point do we finally conclude that the white spaces project is a bust?\u201dMicrosoft said its goal was not to become a telecom provider. It will work with local internet service providers like Mid-Atlantic Broadband Communities in Virginia and Axiom Technologies in Maine by investing in some of the capital costs and then sharing in revenue. It has also opened its patents on the technology and teamed with chip makers to make devices that work with white spaces cheaper.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this to be price competitive for people in urban areas,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThere is no reason people in rural areas need to spend more.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Leslie Alexander, the team\u2019s owner, said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019ve made this decision after much deliberation with my family and friends, and do so knowing the franchise is in great shape with the players, coaches and management team in place.\u201dAlexander, 74, bought the Rockets 24 years ago for $85 million. Alexander made his wealth through investing, but with a sale that could bring 20, 30 or even 40 times the amount he paid for the team, buying the Rockets may have been his savviest investment of all.But even recent purchases of some of the league\u2019s less appealing franchises, like the Atlanta Hawks and the Milwaukee Bucks, have been staggering. The Hawks, along with operating rights to their arena, sold for $850 million in 2015, and the Bucks for $550 million in 2014.TV ratings for the last three N.B.A. Finals, all of which featured the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers, have been the highest since Michael Jordan was winning championships in the 1990s.

Any billionaire can buy a Los Angeles mansion or a private plane, but only 30 of them can own an N.B.A. team. Sitting courtside watching your own team compete, conversing with some of the most popular athletes in the world who are your employees, is priceless for some, and is a commodity rarely up for sale.The Rockets are one of the league\u2019s best and most well-run franchises. Last season, the team ran a frenetic and entertaining offense under Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, finishing with a 55-27 record while obliterating league records for most 3-pointers made and attempted in a season.They made their fifth straight trip to the playoffs and advanced to the conference semifinals before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. D\u2019Antoni, in his first season with the team, was the N.B.A.\u2019s Coach of the Year, and guard James Harden finished second in voting for the Most Valuable Player Award.Still, the Warriors came away with their second championship in the last three seasons, and chasing them might seem like a hopeless task for the rest of the league. But the Rockets have been aggressive this summer in a hectic off-season for the N.B.A. Last month, they acquired Chris Paul, one of the league\u2019s top point guards, in a blockbuster trade with the Clippers. His addition is expected to give Houston one of the top backcourt tandems in the league next season.The Rockets might not be done augmenting their roster, either. They have been pursuing the Knicks\u2019 Carmelo Anthony in a potential multiteam deal. Anthony, a 10-time All-Star, has a no-trade clause in his contract with the Knicks, but he is believed to be willing to waive it if the Knicks can work out a trade that would send him to Houston.But even as the Rockets attempt to build for the future, their current foundation gives them an enviable stability. Daryl Morey, the team\u2019s general manager and architect, and Harden recently agreed to long-term extensions. Harden\u2019s revamped deal, worth about $228 million over the next six years, will keep him under contract through the 2022-23 season.That stability will probably translate into an even bigger payday for Alexander.Scott Cacciola contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Second Attempt at a Roll-Up for WebMD Makes More Sense", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWebMD\u2019s roll-up strategy finally got a second opinion.Anyone who has suffered from a cough or rash will have been terrified at some point by WebMD. The site\u2019s diagnoses often turn up in search results for symptoms, causes and cures. WebMD attracts about 75 million monthly unique users and generates most of its $700 million or so in revenue from advertisers.In February, the company, which counts the pushy hedge funds Blue Harbour and Jana Partners among its shareholders, said it was putting itself up for sale. The offer from K.K.R. represents 30 percent more than WebMD\u2019s stock price before that decision.The acquisition values the WebMD enterprise, after backing out the cash on its books, at some 12 times forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $240 million this year. That\u2019s roughly what K.K.R. paid in 2014 for Internet Brands, home to sites such as DentalPlans.com and VeinDirectory.org, but a considerably higher multiple than the eight times Verizon paid for AOL.There should be some cost savings, though probably not enough to cover the approximately $750 million premium being paid. That would require chopping over $100 million a year, or a quarter of WebMD\u2019s operating and administrative expenses. The broader idea is to make a bigger collection of websites more attractive to health and pharmaceutical advertisers, who are projected by the research outfit eMarketer to spend more than $2 billion this year on digital.A similar idea was envisioned nearly two decades ago when WebMD \u2014 which was preparing for an initial public offering with the help of BancBoston, Robertson Stephens, Hambrecht & Quist and E-Trade \u2014 instead merged with Healtheon in an $8 billion deal that hardly lived up to the promise.Those were heady days, though, when a rival health care site, drkoop.com, went public at some 6,000 times revenue before folding two years later.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Assets of two other big public power operators, based in Colorado and Oklahoma, would be sold, too, if Congress approves the measure.Debates about government and its role in land and environmental policy are always highly charged. But perhaps nowhere could the proposed changes have a more significant impact than along the great river of the West \u2014 fourth largest by volume in North America, more than 10 times that of the Hudson. Privatization would transform a government service that requires equal standards across a vast territory \u2014 from large cities to tiny hamlets \u2014 into a private operation seeking maximum returns to investors.Wringing profits from a system that has provided electricity at cost would inevitably raise prices, critics of the idea said, while supporters envision a streamlined grid open to innovations that government managers cannot imagine.CANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,0001,000250KalispellDAM OWNERSHIPColumbia R.SeattlePolsonGovernmentCoeur d'AleneSpokanePrivateWenatcheeOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONTANAWASHINGTONMissoulaYakimaAstoriaLewistonRichlandLongviewWalla WallaButteBozemanIDAHOColumbia R.PortlandPACIFICOCEANColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsSalemCorvallisBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioBoiseIdaho FallsOREGONSnake R.WYOMINGBurleyTwin FallsCALIFORNIANEVADAUTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,000Columbia R.1,000Kalispell250Coeur d'AleneSpokaneSeattleDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.PrivateMissoulaWASH.AstoriaLongviewRichlandWalla WallaButteBozemanPortlandColumbia R.Columbia riverbasinSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPACIFICOCEANBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseORE.IDAHOSnake R.WYO.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.DAM OWNERSHIPMissoulaWASH.GovernmentRichlandPrivateButteColumbia riverbasinPortlandColumbia R.BozemanSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseIDAHOORE.Snake R.PocatelloTwin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityANNUAL ENERGYOUTPUTIn average megawattsCANADAChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000MONT.Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMissoulaDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentRichlandButtePrivateColumbia R.IDAHOJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPortlandBozemanSalemColumbia riverbasinWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneOntarioBendIdaho FallsBoiseORE.PocatelloSnake R.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentPrivate2,000250WASH.Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsSeattleColumbia R.MONT.PortlandColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsBrownlee Dam340 megawattsSnake R.ORE.IDAHOUTAHCALIF.NEV.A New York Times reporter and photographer went down the river in June, bunking with a five-man tug crew over 30 hours as workers cooked their meals, rested between shifts and transited through four dams and locks. We were looking for the interconnections of electricity and navigation, private industry and government management, engineering and biology, and what is at stake in this new energy debate.The possible fate of that system is raising alarms for some, and questions for almost everyone whose life connects to the river.\u201cThe uncertainty is the biggest thing of all: How would it work?\u201d Terry Oxley, the captain of the tugboat, the Crown Point, said as he gazed out over the water, hands flicking the controls with practiced aplomb. Mr. Oxley, 63, has worked the tugs for 39 years.\u201cI guess I want more input,\u201d he added. \u201cWho\u2019s going to control it? Who\u2019s going to have the say so? When are they going to release the water, the flood control, the spill patterns for the fish? It\u2019s such a big deal, and it\u2019s all intertwined.\u201d\u201cNo room for error,\u201d he said as he slowed the tug to a crawl approaching the locks at McNary Dam, 200 miles upriver from Portland. The Crown Point had picked up a 14,000-ton load in Pasco, Wash. \u2014 three barges of wheat and one empty fuel tanker \u2014 before taking it to Vancouver, Wash. Crew members were posted on the four barges pushed by the tug, reporting back by radio as the distance to the walls of the lock narrowed to inches.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing a lot of energy,\u201d Mr. Wyatt, 41, said. \u201cWe hit something even at one mile an hour, it makes a big boom.\u201dThe dams and the locks that make up Mr. Wyatt\u2019s workplace were built by engineers who utterly transformed \u2014 or destroyed, depending on your point of view \u2014 what had been one of the wildest rivers in America.The dams blocked the river\u2019s flow, creating a network of placid reservoirs. Irrigation canals spidered out, fostering one of the nation\u2019s richest breadbaskets in the orchards and vineyards of Washington. Mammoth turbines powered the airplane factories of Puget Sound and the boom of postwar California.But development came with costs. Native American tribes saw their lands destroyed. Salmon stocks, already decimated by overfishing, were driven into further peril by rising water temperatures and dams that made it harder for fish to move up- and downriver in their ancient cycles of reproduction.Native American tribal leaders said that the old river would never come back, but that the federal government was now bound, through court decisions and treaties, to work with tribes going forward.\u201cObligations are tied to the federal relationship,\u201d said Jaime A. Pinkham, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a member of the Nez Perc\u00e9 tribe. \u201cWhen you privatize, what happens to the voice of the Indian people?\u201dThe new proposal would keep the electricity-making in government control, while spinning off the system of getting that electricity to market. Partial privatization would require complex new contracts delineating the responsibilities of the public and private partners. And what feeds into that system has grown more complicated since the 1980s as well, with a huge growth of new sources like wind and solar.But some energy experts who back the Trump plan said that despite the thorny details, a powerful word could resonate in Congress: fairness. Low prices in a nonprofit system have been a huge boost to economic growth in this corner of the nation.\u201cWe should have a debate about why some minority of Americans get subsidized power and others don\u2019t,\u201d said Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute.Government brought electricity to remote rural towns starting in the 1930s, and people there haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201cWhen you have something that works, having caution about changing it seems reasonable,\u201d he said.In cities like The Dalles, 90 minutes east of Portland, Google has become a community patron of sorts, too, residents said, with grants to libraries and schools.\u201cGoogle has been good for us,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Steve Lawrence. \u201cThey\u2019re a full partner.\u201dWind revenue is paying for the expansion of the Sherman County Courthouse and the annual dividend checks that property owners in the county have received. Kathy McCullough said kilowatt dollars had become important to her family farm\u2019s budget, hedging against fluctuations in wheat prices.Bonneville power managers repeatedly hit the off switch on wind this year in Sherman \u2014 curtailment is the term \u2014 because too much water was coming through the dams after last winter\u2019s huge snowpack, which in turn meant more hydroelectricity flowing through the grid.More curtailments have happened this year than ever before, according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, as Bonneville managers struggled to keep the system in balance. A change in ownership, supporters of the Trump plan in Sherman said, could be good for them in opening new opportunities for wind power sales.\u201cThe B.P.A. does a terrible job,\u201d Ms. McCullough said in reference to Bonneville Power. \u201cI don\u2019t know that privatizing would be bad at all.\u201dSome environmental groups also chafe against Bonneville, for the access fees that they said could discourage wind development and the system\u2019s difficulties in juggling all of the new energy sources.But Doug Howell, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in Washington State, said privatizing would not solve those problems \u2014 and could in fact make them worse.\u201cThe answer is not privatizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s integration.\u201dOne longtime veteran of river management said the new argument over the power system\u2019s future just reprised an old question: Whom does the Columbia belong to?\u201cEverybody takes a piece of the Columbia,\u201d said Tom Eckman, a senior adviser to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. \u201cAnd then they have to collaborate and cooperate over its resources, or fight over them.\u201dSource: Dam data from the Northwest Power and Conservation CouncilAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "If GoDaddy Can Turn the Corner on Sexism, Who Can\u2019t?", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdventures in CapitalismA few years after Blake Irving became chief executive of the internet company GoDaddy, he spoke at a conference where the jeers started almost immediately.Attendees were particularly offended by GoDaddy\u2019s history of sexist television commercials, which featured women in wet bikinis and innuendos so graphic some stations had refused the ads. But when Mr. Irving tried to explain that those advertisements, created by his predecessor, had been discontinued, and that he had been hired, in part, to change the firm\u2019s culture, he was mocked.\u201cEvery time Blake quotes Sheryl Sandberg or calls himself a feminist, throw something at his head,\u201d one person shouted.Which is why it was surprising when Mr. Irving appeared as a keynote speaker a year later, in 2015, at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing \u2014 and received a standing ovation after detailing GoDaddy\u2019s efforts to become one of the most inclusive companies in tech.By then, GoDaddy had been recognized as being among the nation\u2019s top workplaces for women in tech. The company\u2019s policies on equal pay, its methods for recruiting a diverse work force and its approach to promoting women and minorities had been lauded inside business schools and imitated at other firms.So what did GoDaddy do right?The answer is more complicated than just stamping out overt sexism. GoDaddy also focused on attacking the small, subtle biases that can influence everything from how executives evaluate employees to how they set salaries.\u201cThe most important thing we did was normalize acknowledging that everyone has biases, whether they recognize them or not,\u201d said Debra Weissman, a senior vice president at the company. \u201cWe had to make it O.K. for people to say, \u2018I think I\u2019m being unintentionally unfair.\u2019\u201dThough GoDaddy still has work to do, the company is \u201cevidence that things can change,\u201d said Lori Mackenzie, executive director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford, which has worked with the firm. \u201cOftentimes, what keeps companies from shifting is believing the existing system is already fair. Blake is really committed to undermining that.\u201dWhen Mr. Irving joined GoDaddy in 2013, the firm was succeeding by selling a commodity \u2014 website registration and hosting \u2014 through outrageous, scandalous ads, such as a 2005 Super Bowl commercial where a woman\u2019s top kept coming undone while observers discussed her plastic surgery. Those ads were deliberately designed to attract attention through controversy. Today, GoDaddy is worth over $7 billion.Upon becoming chief executive, Mr. Irving immediately decreed that GoDaddy would no longer run sexist ads, and reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to combating workplace discrimination. In part, this was good business: Many of the nation\u2019s small-business owners \u2014 the customers GoDaddy hoped to attract \u2014 are female. Mr. Irving, who had previously been a high-ranking executive at Microsoft and Yahoo, also felt GoDaddy was failing to attract talented engineers and executives \u2014 including women and minorities \u2014 who were alienated by the firm\u2019s image.But to genuinely transform GoDaddy, executives decided, they needed to convince the company\u2019s 3,500 employees, most of whom thought of themselves as fair and good people, that even a seemingly impartial workplace can be discriminatory.\u201cWe needed to become the most inclusive company in tech,\u201d said Mr. Irving. \u201cWe had to erase the idea that meritocracy is enough.\u201dSome of the problems applicants and workers faced were subtle. For years, for instance, GoDaddy\u2019s job descriptions were needlessly aggressive, saying the company was looking for \u201crock stars,\u201d \u201ccode ninjas,\u201d engineers who could \u201cknock it out of the park\u201d or \u201cwrestle problems to the ground.\u201dMoreover, when GoDaddy\u2019s human resource department began reviewing how the company analyzed leadership capacities, it found that women systematically scored lower because they were more likely to emphasize past team accomplishments and use sentences like \u201cwe exceeded our goals.\u201d Men, in contrast, were more likely to use the word \u201cI\u201d and stress individual performance.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of little things people don\u2019t usually notice,\u201d said Katee Van Horn, GoDaddy\u2019s vice president for engagement and inclusion. \u201cBut they add up. They reinforce these biases you might not even realize you have.\u201dGoDaddy began focusing on countering these biases, assessing the company\u2019s hiring, employee evaluations and promotions. In particular, executives scrutinized employee reviews, which evaluated workers using questions similar to those found at many companies: Does this person reply to emails promptly? Have they sought leadership roles? Have they shown initiative?\u201cWe realized a lot of those are invitations for subjectivity,\u201d said Ms. Van Horn.GoDaddy\u2019s data indicated that women tended to systematically be scored lower than men on communication, in part because they were more likely to be a family\u2019s primary parent, and so were more likely to be off email in the early evening during homework and bedtime hours.\u201cAnd the more important question isn\u2019t whether someone responds to email right away,\u201d said Ms. Van Horn. \u201cIt\u2019s what they say, whether their responses have impact. We shouldn\u2019t be judging people based on how fast they communicate. We should be looking at whether they achieved the goals set for them.\u201dWomen also, on average, scored lower than men on evaluations of taking initiative, because most of GoDaddy\u2019s midlevel managers were men, and the culture was top-down, which made it harder for female employees to participate in and get attention for prominent projects, employees say.GoDaddy overhauled its employee evaluation forms, replacing open-ended questions with specific criteria that evaluated employees\u2019 impact, rather than their character. Instead of asking if someone is good at communicating, the new evaluation form asked managers to document instances when an employee shared knowledge with a colleague, or collaborated with a team.\u201cYou can\u2019t change a place just by hiring more women,\u201d said Ms. Weissman, the senior vice president, who oversees a technical staff. \u201cYou have to create a safe space to talk about the assumptions all of us have. You have to work against the biases.\u201dToday, almost a quarter of GoDaddy\u2019s employees are women, including 21 percent of its technical staff. Half of new engineers hired last year were female, and women make up 26 percent of senior leadership. Female technologists, on average, earn slightly more than their male counterparts.There are critics, though. One former high-ranking woman, who requested anonymity because she worried that speaking critically would harm her reputation, said she found GoDaddy\u2019s commitment to change uneven. Departments tended to take inequality seriously when top executives were paying attention, she said. But that focus lessened when scrutiny declined.\u201cWe know this is a process,\u201d Mr. Irving told me. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to fix it in a day, or a year, or five years.\u201dAnd convincing the world is going to take time, as well. When Mr. Irving gave the keynote at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, he said, he was terrified. He began by showing the audience some of the images that GoDaddy had used in commercials.From the stage, he saw hundreds of angry, skeptical faces. Then he walked through everything GoDaddy was doing. He promised that the company\u2019s dedication to eradicating the gender gap would not end. He pledged to listen to any suggestion, and to pressure other firms to steal GoDaddy\u2019s best ideas.\u201cIt was a big moment,\u201d said Elizabeth Ames, a senior executive at the Anita Borg Institute, an influential Silicon Valley group advocating for women in technology. \u201cEveryone was skeptical of GoDaddy, the same way they\u2019re skeptical about companies like Uber today. But GoDaddy was really committed to it, and it\u2019s working.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even putting those two words together \u2014 Microsoft and devices \u2014 would elicit a giggle. After all, Microsoft was good at making software, not at making gadgets.Now, however, there\u2019s been a change.This is not a joke. Sure, Microsoft still has a long way to go to catch up to Apple in PC hardware. But over the past two years, Microsoft has made many advances in PCs, such as its Surface line of computers.Consider the ingenuity of the giant Surface Studio big-screen desktop, which pivots into a kind of digital drafting table. Or the niftiness of the Dial, a palm-size knob that sits on the Surface Studio\u2019s screen and can be used for editing or other features with the turn of the wheel.\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that Microsoft\u2019s PC hardware business will beat Apple\u2019s any time soon,\u201d Farhad writes. \u201cBut anyone who cares about the future of the PC should be thrilled that Apple now faces a serious and creative competitor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
