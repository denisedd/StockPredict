{"Headline": "As Venezuela Prepares to Vote, Some Fear an End to Democracy", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne by one, the markers of Venezuela\u2019s democracy have been pushed aside.Now, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is pushing a radical plan to consolidate his leftist movement\u2019s grip over the nation: He is creating a political body with the power to rewrite the country\u2019s Constitution and reshuffle \u2014 or dismantle \u2014 any branch of government seen as disloyal.The new body, called a constituent assembly, is expected to grant virtually unlimited authority to the country\u2019s leftists.Venezuelans are going to the polls on Sunday to weigh in on the plan. But they will not have the option of rejecting it, even though some polls show that large majorities oppose the assembly\u2019s creation. Instead, voters will be asked only to pick the assembly\u2019s delegates, choosing from a list of stalwarts of Mr. Maduro\u2019s political movement.The new assembly will rule above all other governmental powers \u2014 technically even the president \u2014 with the kind of unchecked authority not seen since the juntas that haunted Latin American countries in decades past.\u201cThis is an existential threat to Venezuelan democracy,\u201d said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group.The list of delegates includes powerful members of the president\u2019s political movement, including Diosdado Cabello, a top lawmaker in the ruling Socialist Party who was involved in a failed coup attempt in the 1990s, and Cilia Flores, the president\u2019s wife.But the push to consolidate power also puts the country at a crossroads, one laden with risk.Even the members of the new assembly themselves are a wild card. Their power will be so vast that they could possibly remove Mr. Maduro from office, some analysts note, ending a presidency that has been deeply unpopular, even among many leftists.\u201cIt\u2019s a crapshoot, a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said Alejandro Velasco, a Venezuelan historian at New York University who studies the country\u2019s leftist movements. \u201cYou do this and you have so little control over how it plays out.\u201dMr. Maduro contends that the government restructuring is necessary to prevent more bloodshed on the streets and save Venezuela\u2019s failing economy, which is dogged by shortages of food and medicine.The president has refused to negotiate with street protesters, calling some of them terrorists and asserting that they are financed by outside governments trying to overthrow him. A new governing charter would give him wide-ranging tools to \u201cconstruct peace,\u201d he and leftists have said.\u201cWe need order, justice,\u201d Mr. Maduro said during an interview with state television this month. \u201cWe have only one option, a national constituent assembly.\u201dThe turmoil gripping Venezuela illustrates the sweeping declines in popularity for the Venezuelan left since the death of its standard-bearer, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in 2013.It was Mr. Ch\u00e1vez who oversaw the last rewrite of the Constitution, in 1999, which was widely backed by the voters who had propelled him to office in the belief that the country\u2019s rule book favored the rich.That new Constitution \u2014 and rising oil prices \u2014 fueled a Socialist-inspired transformation in Venezuela. It helped enable Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to redistribute state wealth to the poor, nationalize foreign assets and make him popular with his supporters. The Constitution also left open the possibility of another constituent assembly in the future.Now Mr. Maduro has taken that option at a time when the leftists are dogged by their deepest crisis in decades. This time, Venezuelans are seeing it less as a stab at reform than as an attempt by a struggling ruling class to maintain power.\u201cIt\u2019s a last-ditch effort to secure his base,\u201d Mr. Velasco said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing it at a moment of weakness.\u201dUnder the rules of the vote, the constituent assembly would take the reins of the country within 72 hours of being officially certified, though it is unclear to most people what would happen after that.Some politicians have already suggested that governorships and mayors be replaced with \u201ccommunal councils.\u201d Top members of Mr. Maduro\u2019s party have identified Luisa Ortega, the attorney general, who has criticized Mr. Maduro\u2019s crackdown on protesters, as someone to be immediately dismissed.But many fear that a likely first step will be the abolition of the country\u2019s legislature, a tactic first used by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez when rewriting the Constitution in 1999.Juan Guaid\u00f3, an opposition lawmaker, fears that the constituent assembly will dismantle his chamber, effectively liquidating any political power held by Mr. Maduro\u2019s rivals.\u201cIf there was anything left of Venezuela\u2019s battered democracy, it was the powers that were legitimately elected by the people, like the National Assembly,\u201d he said. The vote would create a \u201ctotalitarian and repressive dictatorship.\u201dStill, some say the opposition has failed to offer clear alternatives to Mr. Maduro. Eva Golinger, an American lawyer who was a confidante of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s, said rivals of the leftists had focused too heavily on wresting power from the president, something that could risk a wider civil conflict.\u201cThey only rally around regime change,\u201d said Ms. Golinger, who opposes how Mr. Maduro has gone about the constitutional rewrite.The constituent assembly would also be able to take on one piece of work left unfinished by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez: creating a more Socialist Constitution.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez later tried to amend his 1999 document with changes that he argued would speed the course of his populist revolution. But the additional measures were narrowly defeated when they were taken to voters in 2007.Mr. Maduro has indicated that he intends to pick up where Mr. Ch\u00e1vez left off. He has suggested a nine-point outline that includes increasing public spending for education and health care, giving Socialist organizations increased governing abilities and taking unspecified measures to prevent foreign meddling in Venezuela.Analysts also expect that the new Constitution could dig deeper into the economic policy favored by the president, which many economists blame for exacerbating the country\u2019s economic crisis.With much of the opposition expected to boycott the vote, it was mainly Venezuelans loyal to Mr. Maduro\u2019s party who were eager to head to the polls on Sunday.Mar\u00eda Elena P\u00e9rez, 54, a leftist activist in Caracas, the capital, said it was time for a new rule book.\u201cThe current Constitution is weak, and there\u2019s a lot that needs to be fixed,\u201d she said.In the week ahead of the vote, potential delegates were making their pitches on Venezuelan airwaves.In one video, Ysmael Modoy, a candidate from the western state of Portuguesa, urged voters to defend Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy and promised a new Constitution that better battled corruption.Some sought a lighthearted tone. Antonio Le\u00f3n, a candidate who goes by the nickname the Mask, entered his commercial dancing and singing while crossing an empty street. He didn\u2019t address any changes to the Constitution, but promised voters that he would make it easier to get government rations.\u201cRemember: You are love, you are life,\u201d he said before returning to his dance.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Around Trump, Governors Embark on Their Own Diplomatic Missions", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, huddled with the leaders of Mexico and Canada in the space of 48 hours this spring, racing to Mexico City from Seattle for back-to-back discussions on climate change and trade.And Gov. Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, recently announced he would visit Canada this summer with a message of thanks \u2014 for the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact that President Trump has harshly criticized and says he intends to renegotiate.In ordinary times, most American governors tend to avoid international exploits, boasting of their consuming interest in balancing budgets and operating the machinery of state government. When they venture abroad, it is mainly to hawk products manufactured in their states.But under the Trump administration, that has begun to change: Leadership at the state level has taken on an increasingly global dimension, as governors assert themselves in areas where they view Mr. Trump as abandoning the typical priorities of the federal government. They have forged partnerships across state and party lines to offset Trump administration policies they see as harmful to their constituencies.Unsettled by the president\u2019s skepticism of foreign trade, governors have made newly pointed appeals to international businesses and consumers, at times gently rebuking the White House for presenting an inhospitable face to the world.Mr. Hutchinson, who did not join the climate alliance, said Mr. Trump\u2019s posture on trade had worried traditional United States partners. He credited the president with having \u201cstrengthened our negotiating position,\u201d but said gestures of comity were also important.\u201cI do take advantage of the opportunity to reassure the European audiences, but also the Asian audiences, that global trade cannot be diminished,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the fabric of our global commerce, and I want to continue to be a voice for it.\u201dThe turning outward of American governors was on prominent display at the National Governors Association retreat in Providence, R.I., last week. There, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada spoke on Friday, the first foreign leader to address the group. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a Democrat who is chairman of the governors association, said representatives were present from a number of other countries, including China, Japan, Mexico and Vietnam.\u201cWhether Republican or Democrat, in this economy, that\u2019s likely your very first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cGuess what: It\u2019s my first priority as well.\u201dThe Canadian leader\u2019s friendship mission followed months of stepped-up contact between American governors and Canadian political and business leaders after Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, who has made multiple trips across the Canadian border since his election in November, said he had made it a priority to put the state\u2019s longstanding economic partner at ease.Mr. Scott, who is one of two Republican governors to join the climate initiative, along with Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, said that in Canada there had been a mood of \u201cconcern, especially initially, about this new administration.\u201d\u201cThey needed some reassurance that we were there fighting on their behalf, and on our behalf as well,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that we communicated that and gave them, the Canadians, reassurance that we\u2019re there for them.\u201dMr. McAuliffe said he had recently returned from a seven-country swing through Europe, where at every turn leaders battered him with questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on trade and immigration.\u201cWhat I try to tell everybody is, \u2018Forget the federal government. Come directly to the states,\u2019\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said, adding that in meetings abroad, \u201cI\u2019ve got to spend the first 30 minutes defending America: \u2018No, we\u2019re all about business. No, we want to trade with you.\u2019\u201dThe reassurance campaign has worked both ways: With an eye toward the Nafta talks, both Mr. Trudeau and Mayor Miguel \u00c1ngel Mancera of Mexico City, who heads a coalition of governors from Mexico, peppered state leaders in Providence with information about the value of trade in their states.But American governors have appeared to need little convincing, and Democrats and Republicans said in interviews that they had already been intensifying their international outreach to mitigate what they view as retrenchment in Washington.Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat, said Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on trade and climate had jeopardized the interests of her state, which is heavily invested in exporting electronics and agricultural goods to Canada and East Asia. \u201cThere is a sense of urgency for me, in terms of Oregon\u2019s economy,\u201d she said.\u201cIt gives citizens across the globe hope that we can bring America \u2014 or bring Americans \u2014 in, and we can reach the goals of the Paris accord,\u201d she said.Republican governors, mostly supportive of Mr. Trump, also acknowledge that they are working around the president\u2019s nationalistic stance. While Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric helped propel him to victory in the election, foreign trade is an economic cornerstone of much of red-state America, including deeply conservative rural areas that depend on exporting agricultural goods.Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to overhaul Nafta and his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional deal negotiated by the Obama administration, have rattled governors of both major parties in states that rely on commerce with Canada and Mexico, and across Asia.Vice President Mike Pence, who also appeared at the governors conference and tends to speak about policy in more cautious terms than Mr. Trump, assured state leaders that while the administration wanted trade to be \u201cboth free and fair,\u201d it was sensitive to the value of Nafta. The goal, he said, was for the pact to become \u201ca win-win-win for all of our trading partners.\u201dBut the governors\u2019 unease around trade extends well beyond the Farm Belt, and transcends Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of specific accords. Their fear is that a swerve toward protectionism, coupled with Mr. Trump\u2019s severe personal unpopularity in other countries, could make the United States a less appealing place for business over all.If anxiety about the president\u2019s approach afflicts governors of both parties, Democrats are far more eager to brand Mr. Trump a failed leader: Mr. Inslee said he viewed governors\u2019 actions on climate and trade as compensating for a \u201cgiant sucking sound of ignorance\u201d at the federal level.\u201cWe think that this is a huge opportunity for the states,\u201d Mr. Inslee said, \u201cto fill the vacuum that has been created by the total absence of leadership coming out of the White House.\u201dAnd many governors have continued to take a more conventional approach to foreign travel, promoting their states as destinations for business without offering any particular commentary on the White House.Yet even ostensibly standard trade missions have taken on a weightier character in a moment of such widespread uncertainty about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.Mr. Ricketts acknowledged that Mr. Trump\u2019s suspicion of international arrangements was a new kind of challenge for his state, Nebraska. While Mr. Ricketts emphasized that he was open to the president\u2019s approach, he said he hoped the White House would preserve existing economic bonds that favor his state, which each year sends more than $1 billion in goods to both Canada and Mexico.The purpose of his coming excursion to the North, he said, was to say \u201cthank you to one of our biggest customers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Russia\u2019s Far East, a Fledgling Las Vegas for Asia\u2019s Gamblers", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARTEM, Russia \u2014 On Russia\u2019s eastern rim, where endemic corruption and bureaucratic sloth conspire to hold back the economic dynamism enriching the rest of Asia, a shimmering palace rises from a dark forest in an improbable effort to tap into the wealth of nearby China, Japan and South Korea.At a time when few Chinese or other investors want to take a gamble on Russia, the forest property, 4,000 miles east of Moscow, beckons deep-pocketed Asians who not only do not mind risk but delight in it \u2014 and are ready to wager their money on the baccarat tables and roulette wheels of the Russian Far East\u2019s fledgling answer to Las Vegas.Tigre de Cristal, the lone casino so far in what the authorities in nearby Vladivostok hope will become a vast \u201cintegrated entertainment zone\u201d with eight different betting palaces, is Russia\u2019s biggest gambling complex. Financed largely by a Hong Kong company, Summit Ascent, it is also the single biggest Chinese investment in a region that President Vladimir V. Putin has tried to turn into a showcase of Russia\u2019s \u201cpivot to the East.\u201dEver since Nikita S. Khrushchev stopped off in the Russian Far East after a trip to California in 1959 and decreed that Vladivostok had become \u201ca second San Francisco,\u201d the port city\u2019s formidable assets \u2014 great natural beauty, location in Asia and a highly educated population \u2014 have stirred bold dreams. These have all been followed by bitter disappointment.Under Mr. Putin, Moscow has poured billions of dollars into the area, paying for huge bridges, a new university campus and other costly state-directed projects. But despite ever closer relations between Moscow and Beijing, said Artyom Lukin, an international studies professor at the Far East Federal University, \u201cRussia has realized that free Chinese money is not coming.\u201dChinese gamblers are arriving, however, if only because gambling is illegal in their own country, except in Macau on the southern coast near Hong Kong, and because the forest northeast of Vladivostok offers the only accessible casino for the more than 100 million Chinese who live in provinces just across the border from Russia.Li Yunhui, a 45-year-old businessman and gambler from Mudanjiang, a Chinese city about 150 miles from Vladivostok, said the Russian casino lacked the amenities and service of established gambling centers like Macau, but added: \u201cAt least it is close. And the air is clean.\u201dHe said he had visited Vladivostok regularly since the early 1990s and could not fathom why Russia had lagged so far behind China in building its economy. \u201cIt feels like a developing country here. This is how China was decades ago,\u201d he said. He added that he had tried to set up a small business in Vladivostok but had despaired at all the red tape: \u201cWhat you can do in a day in China takes weeks here.\u201dThe gambling venture is itself a showcase of how slowly things gets done. Government officials began pursuing the idea nearly a decade ago. They enlisted a well-connected local businessman, Oleg Drozdov, to build the hotel and casino complex now housing Tigre de Cristal. But Mr. Drozdov was arrested in 2013 on corruption charges after the ouster of the Primorye region\u2019s disgraced former governor, Sergey Darkin.Summit Ascent, the Hong Kong company that now owns 60 percent of the casino venture, took over the concrete shell left by Mr. Drozdov\u2019s builders and, after investing $200 million with other investors, finished the construction and opened the casino at the end of 2015. The company, which reported a modest profit for last year, now plans to invest an additional $500 million to build a second luxury hotel, a golf club, extra gambling rooms and other facilities in the same entertainment zone.Four other casinos planned by other companies, due to be open by now, are far behind schedule. Empty plots of land with scant signs of construction dot the forest. A Russian court recently canceled the casino project of a Russian developer because it was too slow in getting off the ground.Eric Landheer, Summit Ascent\u2019s director for corporate finance and strategy in Hong Kong, said that his company had \u201cfirst mover advantage and a monopoly,\u201d but that it did not want to be alone in the forest for long because gamblers preferred a more vibrant cluster of casinos.Gambling has a long and often troubled history in Russia, where attitudes have been shaped by the Orthodox Church, which opposes casinos as the devil\u2019s work, and by the writings of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a gambling addict who explored the allure and perils of addiction in his novel \u201cThe Gambler.\u201dA champion of traditional Christian values, Mr. Putin banned casinos and slot machines in 2009, complaining that too many Russians \u201close their last penny and pensions through gambling.\u201dHaving Chinese and other foreigners lose their money, however, is apparently not a problem. Indeed, their losses now cover the salaries of around 1,000 Russians working for the Tigre de Cristal casino and provide a badly needed source of income for the Primorsky region around Vladivostok, a city that, aside from corruption-addled, state-funded infrastructure projects, has struggled to attract outside investment. Closed to foreigners during the Soviet era, the city now has regular flights to and from Harbin, Beijing and other Chinese cities, and can also be reached by road and train.To make the fleecing of foreigners and a restricted number of Russians possible, Moscow gave permission for the establishment of four special gambling zones. The westernmost of these, in Kaliningrad, targets gamblers from neighboring Poland, while the others are in the resort town of Sochi and in the Siberian region of Altai.Russians are also allowed to gamble at the Tigre de Cristal, so long as they show their passports and register. This has not gone down well with Russian priests and those who see casinos as a poor substitute for healthy economic development.\u201cAnyone who has read Dostoyevsky knows all the problems that gambling brings,\u201d complained Andrei Kalachinsky, a veteran journalist in Vladivostok. \u201cThe spread of prostitution will definitely create jobs, but what kind?\u201dTransportation infrastructure has been another problem. A new highway connecting the casino area to the Vladivostok airport turns into a mud track in the final stretch. A winding road to the center of Vladivostok, around 35 miles away, is so clogged with traffic that Yuri Trutnev, Mr. Putin\u2019s envoy for the Russian Far East, proposed opening a ferry service to speed up the journey to the casino.The authorities have also been sluggish in delivering on a promise of visa-free entry for visitors from China and other selected countries. Despite the delay, Chinese can still obtain visas relatively easily if they sign up for a tour, and their numbers visiting Vladivostok and the surrounding Primorsky last year more than doubled to around 300,000.Yuri Kuchin, an opposition member of the Vladivostok City Council, said local bureaucrats usually hindered rather than helped foreign investments, dragging their feet on most issues unless there is a financial benefit for themselves. While a bitter critic of the government, he said he supported the foreign-led casino project as a source of jobs and a good way to squeeze out illegal gambling dens in the area, which he said were often protected by corrupt officials.The Primorye Development Corporation, the government agency now responsible for the project, declined to say what was being done to combat illegal clubs or explain how the casino project fit into the region\u2019s overall development strategy.A number of foreign projects in Vladivostok have fizzled, including two five-star Hyatt Hotels that were supposed to have opened for business five years ago but are still under construction. Yet the Tigre de Cristal casino, though delayed by various mishaps like the arrest of a local business partner, is now not only up and running, but is making a profit.Lawrence Ho, Summit Ascent\u2019s chairman and son of the Macau gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, acknowledged in a report to investors that the \u201cyear has not been without its challenges\u201d but said, \u201cOver all, I am very optimistic about the potential of our investment in the jewel of the Russian Far East.\u201dThe most lucrative sources of business at the casino are Chinese high-rollers recruited by so-called junket operators, agents who find gamblers, provide credit, make travel arrangements and manage private V.I.P. rooms at the casino. For these services, the casino pays the junket operators a chunk of what it wins from their clients \u2014 more, Mr. Landheer said, than the 40 percent to 50 percent paid to them in Macau.All the same, Tommy Li, a junket manager from northeastern China, complained that Vladivostok offered few of the attractions of Macau and was far too cold in winter. Its only real appeal for Chinese gamblers, he said, is its proximity.One of his main gripes is that there are not enough prostitutes, who he said were far more readily available, and cheaper, in Macau. Mr. Landheer, the corporate finance director, said his company was not in the business of providing prostitutes and would \u201clike to see all illegal activities eliminated.\u201dBut, he added, there \u201care many other service providers\u201d in Vladivostok ready to satisfy all the gamblers\u2019 needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sign of Progress for Greece, Investors Eagerly Snap Up New Bonds", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoving to show it has overcome the worst of its financial troubles, Greece issued bonds on global financial markets on Tuesday for the first time in years, in an offering that institutional investors eagerly snapped up.The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have had to support Greece with a staggering \u20ac326 billion in financial lifelines since 2010, when Athens was shut off from borrowing in global markets during Europe\u2019s financial crisis.The government now plans to issue bonds at least twice more before August 2018. If those are successful, it could be a turning point for Greece and signal a less volatile future for the eurozone, which is at last enjoying a broad economic recovery.A jubilant Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said that the debt sale signaled Greece was on the path to a definitive end to its crisis. It was \u201cthe most important message and the most significant step in order to finish this unpleasant adventure of the memorandum,\u201d he said on Greek television, referring to the country\u2019s bailouts, which carried harsh austerity requirements.Now, he said, it was time to discuss \u201cthe future of Greece.\u201dThe bonds issued Tuesday have a return of about 4.625 percent, well below the borrowing costs investors demanded of the Greek government at the height of its debt crisis. But the yield \u2014 markedly higher than those for bonds from other major European countries \u2014 was a reflection nonetheless of the continued risks present in Greece\u2019s finances and the economy.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The deal included an offer for investors holding Greek bonds falling due in 2019 to switch them for bonds that the government would pay back in five years, in 2022. Of the \u20ac3 billion in five-year bonds that Greece raised Tuesday, around half was new money; the rest was rolled over from the 2019 bond.More than 200 official offers worth a total of \u20ac6.5 billion were made, the government said, indicating a high level of demand. A majority of those offers came from \u201creal investors of a global caliber, not profiteering funds,\u201d it said in a reference to investors who seek high returns on risky bets.Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner of economic and monetary affairs, who appeared with Mr. Tsipras on Greek television, said, \u201cConfidence in Greece is really coming back.\u201dBut he added that Greek authorities \u201cneed to keep on pedaling\u201d by making changes to restructure the economy, as required under the bailouts.While bond sales are good news for the government, Greece\u2019s creditors are concerned that it may use them as an excuse to backslide on politically painful changes as its bailouts approach an end.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Trade Partners Watch Warily as Trump Considers Steel Tariffs", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is expected any day now to make its long-awaited decision over whether to slap tariffs on steel imports. Doing so would be a provocative move that could simultaneously lift the spirits of President Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters while angering trade partners.The tariffs could very well provoke a global trade war that could make all sides poorer.It\u2019s an unusual time for a protectionist retreat by the United States as a number of major industrialized countries work on their own free trade pacts. This week, Europe and Japan reached a landmark free trade agreement before the G-20 summit, and Mexico and China, two of the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, have been mulling their own deal.Mr. Trump and his economic team delayed a decision on steel in recent weeks as the president weighs conflicting counsel from factions of his nationalist and globalist advisers.For weeks, trade lawyers, industry leaders and members of Congress have been anxiously awaiting the recommendation from the Department of Commerce. They view it as a moment that will illuminate whether Mr. Trump is ready to make good on his campaign promises to protect flagging American industries with tariffs. Among those most on edge are economists, many of whom have been uneasy about Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox views on trade because they have seen the damage from such actions before.They hope the president is bluffing.\u201cIf he actually pulls the trigger, it could be highly disruptive to world trade,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and helped craft his economic plan. \u201cIt\u2019s not even going to really work in terms of helping American workers.\u201dIn April, Mr. Trump signed an executive order calling for a sweeping investigation by the Department of Commerce into whether steel imports were harming national security, employing a rarely used section of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The findings would give the president backing to impose import restrictions or tariffs on foreign-produced steel.Economists who were embroiled in that episode, and those who recall it ruefully, view it as a cautionary tale for Mr. Trump.\u201cThere were many more workers who used steel to make things in the U.S. than who actually made the steel,\u201d said Phillip L. Swagel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who was a senior economist for international trade during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term. \u201cMany more communities have the potential to be affected by higher prices for steel.\u201d However, the perceived political need to do something overrode economics.Studies conducted after the tariffs were lifted showed that while they were in place, they led to higher steel prices and job losses in other machinery and metal equipment industries. Domestic steel makers also cut costs and consolidated. A report commissioned by the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition found that higher steel prices led to a loss of 200,000 jobs across the country in 2002 and $4 billion in lost wages.\u201cProtecting and providing for the defense of the United States is always of the highest priority,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cSo too, however, is ensuring the strength and competitiveness of our national economy.\u201dTariffs would also have a disruptive impact on global supply chains. It is possible that a blanket tariff could lead to a global glut of steel, as exporters around the world flood other markets to make up for the diminished market in the United States.Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, worries that retaliation from China and Europe to any steel tariffs would be particularly painful for American exporters and could lead to job cuts when Mr. Trump is trying to bolster employment and labor force participation.While the steel industry, which Mr. Trump promised to revive, could benefit, other industries such as construction and housing would probably suffer. Many of the workers in these industries and the consumers who buy their goods are likely to be the types of moderate-income voters who backed Mr. Trump.\u201cIt will hurt the people it\u2019s designed to help through higher prices,\u201d Mr. Strain said. \u201cUltimately the economy will lose.\u201dOn Friday, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, warned the Trump administration against taking measures that would penalize European steel exporters. She declined to say what measures Europe would take in retaliation or what specific United States exports could face higher tariffs.\u201cBarriers on steel imports would be very bad for the E.U., as European businesses and workers could be affected very heavily and jobs would be threatened,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said in an email. \u201cAs we haven\u2019t seen the proposal yet, we will first have to check whether the measure is in compliance with W.T.O. rules.\u201d\u201cIf global trade rules are not upheld, the E.U. will retaliate, but I cannot say now exactly how and when. We understand that the U.S. has concerns about overcapacity in China but we don\u2019t think this is the right way to go, as you cannot fight protectionism with protectionism,\u201d she added.Mr. Trump\u2019s impulsiveness is another reason for worry. While Mr. Bush backed down after the W.T.O. verdict, a Trump administration with an \u201cAmerica First\u201d mentality may be less amenable to a ruling handed down by bureaucrats in Switzerland. The fear is that Mr. Trump could abandon the trade organization entirely, essentially unraveling an institution that has been instrumental in lowering trade barriers over the past two decades.\u201cThe big concern with the Trump administration is their commitment to the W.T.O. system and whether it bothers them to have the system weakened,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.So far Mr. Trump has lived up to his reputation for being unpredictable when it comes to trade. He threatened to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, before reversing himself and agreeing to renegotiate its terms. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Wilbur Ross, his commerce secretary, has since praised the defunct pact as a strong starting point for future negotiations.But Mr. Moore was optimistic that Mr. Trump would ultimately settle on a more temperate and targeted approach, and that the threat of tariffs would win the United States concessions at the negotiating table, with the bluster leading to a better deal.\u201cIn the end, I think Trump\u2019s bark will be worse than his bite on trade,\u201d Mr. Moore said, hopefully.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everywhere You Look, We\u2019ve Downgraded Real Problems Into Mere \u2018Issues\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsThere are a great many problems in this world. Among them is the way we talk about problems. Perhaps understandably, the thorniest ones make us cautious and avoidant. So we toss linguistic blankets over them until they become nothing but unexplained lumps in the room.This is what makes \u2018\u2018issues\u2019\u2019 the perfect word for the current moment. It is a word that acknowledges problems without actually addressing them, that minimizes them in hopes that they\u2019ll just drift away. It\u2019s a hedge and a dodge, at once overly punctilious and contemptuously dismissive; it\u2019s contingent, euphemistic, underhanded and easily weaponized. Our culture has all kinds of prohibitions against plain speech, but we\u2019ve long treated agenda-driven spin as just business. Entire television channels are devoted to repositioning bad situations and ugly truths as \u2018\u2018controversial issues\u2019\u2019 \u2014 mere topics of discussion, hypothetical problems, rhetorical games.By the late 18th century, people had begun to \u2018\u2018take issue\u2019\u2019 with things, which meant raising an argument against them; by the 1990s, we had begun to \u2018\u2018have issues,\u2019\u2019 which meant being neurotic. Issues can refer to concerns, topics of discussions, fundamental questions. (\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s stick to the issues.\u2019\u2019) It can denote errors, difficulties, struggles, conflicts, complaints. (\u2018\u2018My issue with this is. .\u2009.\u2009.\u2019\u2019) It can indicate psychological and emotional problems, festering resentments, longstanding feuds. (\u2018\u2018That guy has issues.\u2019\u2019) It can refer to a problem itself (\u2018\u2018the homelessness issue\u2019\u2019) or to the cause that is built around it. (\u2018\u2018My main issue is homelessness.\u2019\u2019) A political \u2018\u2018issue\u2019\u2019 can be a widely contested topic, or \u2014 more and more often \u2014 one that\u2019s mainly of interest to a particular group, one in a collection of pet projects. To call something an issue can suggest not just that it\u2019s a niche concern but that there\u2019s a lack of agreement over whether it\u2019s even a concern at all \u2014 whether it matters or exists in the way some people claim.There are many words we put in front of \u2018\u2018issues\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018women\u2019s,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018race,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018L.G.B.T.Q.,\u2019\u2019 and so on. They tend to function, intentionally or not, as big, rippling flags, signaling to anyone outside their scope that the problem can be respectfully ignored. Let somebody else worry about it: the people whose \u2018\u2018issue\u2019\u2019 this is. (Never mind who made it an issue for them in the first place; it\u2019s theirs to solve now.) To call something a \u2018\u2018woman\u2019s issue,\u2019\u2019 for instance, is to relegate it to the presumably small and narrow subset of human concerns of interest exclusively to women. \u2018\u2018Women\u2019s issues\u2019\u2019 might be used to mean \u2018\u2018problems women are likely to face,\u2019\u2019 or it might be used to mean \u2018\u2018problems women enjoy caring about\u2019\u2019 \u2014 as if problems were a matter of taste, like enjoying romantic comedies.The story deals with issues of aspiration, envy and the end of American meritocracy; it confronts the contradictions between democracy and capitalism, between liberal Western values and unchecked self-interest. The narrator veers between two polar-opposite stances: On one side, there\u2019s envy at his friend\u2019s heady social and professional climb, and on the other, deep disdain at the anti-egalitarian, un-self-conscious vulgarity of the wedding and its display of status. He is alternately jealous, self-righteous, self-pitying, insecure and superior. Lacking a center or a worldview, he is buffeted by his emotional reactions to external things. Of course, he\u2019s at a wedding. He\u2019s expected to behave himself. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s expected to behave as though none of it were getting to him, as if there were nothing remarkable about the excess around him or his reactions to it. He\u2019s in hell, basically, basting in his own issues.Something like that, I think, is how we\u2019ve reached the place where we are today. Maybe if we, unlike this helpless wedding guest, could call things by their names, we might be shocked by what that plain truth accomplishes. Maybe if we stopped being quite so cautious, we could confront reality. Maybe if we cared as much about content as form, we wouldn\u2019t be so vulnerable \u2014 so at risk of being harmed by all the threats we\u2019ve assiduously denied even exist. But at some point, we seem to have chosen another path. We grew afraid to state anything unequivocally, lest we be called on to equivocate later; we refused to describe what we saw. We told lies of omission and pretended that nothing very terrible could be happening around us. We turned concrete problems into airy, abstract, possibly unresolvable \u2018\u2018issues.\u2019\u2019 Then we gerrymandered the issues, set them apart from our common concerns and gently massaged them into the scenery until they were drained of all urgency. We left reality \u2014 and real problems \u2014 to be defined by the most ruthless, unscrupulous players.And in a climate like that, we\u2019re definitely going to have some issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Noncompete Pacts, Under Siege, Find Haven in Idaho", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOISE, Idaho \u2014 Idaho achieved a notable distinction last year: It became one of the hardest places in America for someone to quit a job for a better one.The state did this by making it easier for companies to enforce noncompete agreements, which prevent employees from leaving their company for a competitor.While its economy is known for agriculture \u2014 potatoes are among the state\u2019s biggest exports \u2014 Idaho has a long history as a technology hub. And the new law landed in the middle of the tech world, causing a clash between hungry start-ups looking to poach employees and more established companies that want to lock their people in place.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the tech ecosystem in Boise,\u201d said George Mulhern, chief executive of Cradlepoint, a company here that makes routers and other networking equipment. \u201cAnd anything that would make somebody not want to move here or start a company here is going to slow down our progress.\u201dAlex LaBeau, president of the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, a trade group that represents many of the state\u2019s biggest employers, countered: \u201cThis is about companies protecting their assets in a competitive marketplace.\u201dVersions of this clash have played out nationwide, as state lawmakers consider whether to make it easier or harder for companies to block workers from jumping to competitors. Both sides in the debate, which bridges party lines, say they are trying to create an environment in which local businesses can thrive.Proponents note that the statute applies only to \u201ckey employees\u201d who tend to have more responsibility and better pay. But employment lawyers say Idaho companies tie down all levels of workers, not just top executives, with tough employment contracts. And indeed, the new law has roots in a yearslong fight waged by a woman who never finished high school but built a career selling tech-training services, only to be sued when she left for a better-paying job.When Mike Schultz, a Republican state representative in Utah, introduced an ultimately successful bill last year to make such agreements harder to enforce, incumbent businesses were his biggest opponents. \u201cBut then you had the new entrepreneurs, and most of those guys were in favor of doing away with noncompetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the guys out there growing and trying to hire people.\u201dThe impact has fallen disproportionately on start-ups and high-growth companies, which tend to be against strict employment agreements because they are primarily concerned with growth.\u201cThe noncompete is a two-edged sword,\u201d said Matthew Marx, a professor at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business. \u201cAlthough it enables companies to retain their employees, it makes it harder for them to recruit workers with relevant experience.\u201dIt also ends up hurting wages, because most people get raises when they switch jobs. This goes far beyond defectors to the economy more broadly, and Idaho\u2019s tech scene shows why.Over the past several decades, these companies got so big that the city gained a reputation as a hub for Fortune 500 headquarters. Today, however, a new group of entrepreneurs is building on Idaho\u2019s tradition of homespun growth.Matt Rissell is one of them. Mr. Rissell is a founder and the chief executive of TSheets, which makes time-management software. Mr. Rissell started his entrepreneurial career as the owner of three Cartridge World stores. It was a tough, low-margin business and he was losing a lot of money from employees who fudged their time sheets for extra hours.Mr. Rissell enlisted an engineer friend to help him fix the problem with software. When his stores saved $2,400 the first month, Mr. Rissell realized he had found a much better business than selling printer cartridges.Today, TSheets is the darling of Idaho\u2019s start-up scene. The company was founded in 2006, but two years ago took on its first $15 million in venture capital. Since then the company has grown to 200 people from 60, and is on pace to add 100 more by the end of the year.During a recent interview in his office, Mr. Rissell said that one of his main challenges was simply finding enough people. TSheets has about 70 employees on its engineering and product team, and almost all moved there from jobs at local companies.\u201cThe ability to recruit from the local area has been extraordinary for us,\u201d he said.Two years ago, TSheets hired a pair of engineers from a smaller software company called Zenware. Jody Sedrick, Zenware\u2019s chief executive, was hurt and disappointed. He contacted a lawyer to see if it was possible to prevent his employees from leaving for a rival, but instead of spending money on legal costs, he decided to try something else: He gave each of his remaining employees a raise.\u201cI said, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re going to double down internally,\u2019\u201d he said in a recent interview.The result for the Idaho economy was that TSheets hired two people \u2014 but in doing so got 12 other people a raise. Had Mr. Sedrick decided to sue his two departing employees, something Idaho\u2019s new law made easier, those raises might never have happened.For a law that would end up riling tech companies, Idaho\u2019s statute began with an unlikely character: Debbie Nolan, a 51-year-old saleswoman who never went to high school.Ms. Nolan is from the New York City borough of Queens. She left school at 13 but through decades of work experience managed to carve out a middle-class career selling technology-training classes for office workers. She moved from New York to California to Nevada and finally to Idaho, where she worked at a company called LeapFox Learning. Ms. Nolan made $48,000 a year there, based on her extensive work history and little else.\u201cI don\u2019t think I could get a job at Walmart without a high school diploma,\u201d she said in an interview.Three years ago Ms. Nolan quit and started working at ExecuTrain \u2014 LeapFox\u2019s main competitor \u2014 where she negotiated a $65,000 salary. LeapFox sued her for violating her exit agreement, setting off a three-year legal battle that was settled out of court but inspired Ms. Nolan to get a tattoo that sits just under her collarbone and reads: \u201cTrust No One.\u201dAfter Ms. Nolan\u2019s defection, Codi Galloway, who owns LeapFox with her husband, Scott, became an outspoken advocate for amending state law to make it less expensive for businesses to block an employee from going to work for a rival. The result was a bill that shifted the burden from companies to employees, who must now prove they have \u201cno ability to adversely affect the employer\u2019s legitimate business interests.\u201dThe bar for that is so high that Brian Kane, an assistant chief deputy in the Idaho attorney general\u2019s office, wrote that this would be \u201cdifficult if not impossible\u201d for an employee to do.Ilana Rubel, one of the few Democrats in Idaho\u2019s House of Representatives, became the bill\u2019s fiercest critic. Ms. Rubel, a Harvard-trained lawyer who does intellectual property litigation for the Silicon Valley-based law firm Fenwick & West, described the proposal as \u201ctoxic to a good business ecosystem.\u201d\u201cThis bill was a giant thumb on the scale in favor of old established business at the expense of start-ups,\u201d Ms. Rubel said.Despite the bill\u2019s passage, Ms. Rubel is undeterred. She has drafted legislation to repeal the law and is enlisting tech executives to help.As Jeff Reynolds, a local entrepreneur who advises young companies at a co-working space called Trailhead, noted: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Boise, Idaho, and you\u2019re trying to build a start-up culture, it\u2019s not like we have a head start in doing that. We shouldn\u2019t try to put new impediments in our way.\u201dAt a hearing last year to debate the proposed law, one of those who showed up was Mr. Sedrick, the Zenware chief executive who lost two engineers to TSheets. He didn\u2019t mention his competitor by name, but complained about a local software company \u201chand-poaching\u201d engineers.Today, Mr. Sedrick tells a different story. In a recent interview, he said his feelings on noncompete agreements had mellowed.\u201cI want to create a good marketplace as a whole, and in reality there is enough room for all of us,\u201d he said.In addition, he said, the defections taught him how to be a better leader and more efficient boss. His employees are happier and better paid.\u201cRather than going on the defensive, because that\u2019s what a noncompete is, just go on the offensive and create a great environment so that people want to stay with you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes you a better company in the end.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trumpcare Bonfire", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFirst the good news, which came in two installments: No. 1, the Senate\u2019s health care bill \u2014 which would have stripped 22 million people of their health insurance and increased premiums for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions \u2014 collapsed Monday. Then, Tuesday, Mitch McConnell\u2019s plan to repeal much of Obamacare without a replacement also fell apart as senators defected.Now the bad news: While the Affordable Care Act is not collapsing, the Senate and House health bills and President Trump\u2019s promises to sabotage the A.C.A. have destabilized some of the health insurance marketplaces created by that law. Nearly 40 counties in Indiana, Nevada and Ohio are at risk of having no insurers participating in the marketplaces next year; other counties will have only one company offering policies.In addition, policies sold in the marketplaces could cost a lot more if the Trump administration carries out its threats to stop providing subsidies to insurers to lower deductibles for low-income and middle-income people. It can do that through administrative action. House Republicans sued the Obama administration to block the payments on grounds that Congress had not voted separately to appropriate the money, even though the A.C.A. had authorized them.If it chooses to set partisan point-scoring aside, the Trump administration would continue subsidy payments to insurers, House Republicans would drop their lawsuit and, going forward, Congress would appropriate money for these payments so that they could not be used to undermine the health care law. Quick action is needed on all fronts because insurers and state and federal regulators must finalize rates and policies for next year in the coming weeks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oh! What a Lovely Trade War", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byActually, though, health care isn\u2019t all that complicated. And Republican \u201creform\u201d plans are brutally simple \u2014 with the emphasis on \u201cbrutally.\u201dTrump may be the only person in Washington who doesn\u2019t grasp their essence: Take health insurance away from tens of millions so you can give the rich a tax cut.Some policy subjects, on the other hand, really are complicated. One of these subjects is international trade. And the great danger here isn\u2019t simply that Trump doesn\u2019t understand the issues. Worse, he doesn\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t know.And Axios reports that the White House believes that Trump\u2019s base \u201clikes the idea\u201d of a trade war, and \u201cwill love the fight.\u201dYep, that\u2019s a great way to make policy.O.K., so what\u2019s complicated about trade policy?First, a lot of modern trade is in intermediate goods \u2014 stuff that is used to make other stuff. A tariff on steel helps steel producers, but it hurts downstream steel consumers like the auto industry. So even the direct impact of protectionism on jobs is unclear.Then there are the indirect effects, which mean that any job gains in an industry protected by tariffs must be compared with job losses elsewhere. Normally, in fact, trade and trade policy have little if any effect on total employment. They affect what kinds of jobs we have; but the total number, not so much.Even if we ignore the damage to industries that use imported inputs, any direct job creation from new tariffs would be offset by indirect job destruction. The Federal Reserve, fearing inflationary pressure, would raise interest rates. This would squeeze sectors like housing; it would also strengthen the dollar, hurting U.S. exports.Claims that protectionism would inevitably cause a recession are overblown, but there\u2019s every reason to believe that these indirect effects would eliminate any net job creation.Then there\u2019s the response of other countries. International trade is governed by rules \u2014 rules America helped put in place. If we start breaking those rules, others will too, both in retaliation and in simple emulation. That\u2019s what people mean when they talk about a trade war.I\u2019m not making a purist case for free trade here. Rapid growth in globalization has hurt some American workers, and an import surge after 2000 disrupted industries and communities. But a Trumpist trade war would only exacerbate the damage, for a couple of reasons.Also, the tariffs now being proposed would boost capital-intensive industries that employ relatively few workers per dollar of sales; these tariffs would, if anything, further tilt the distribution of income against labor.So will Trump actually go through with this? He might. After all, he posed as a populist during the campaign, but his entire economic agenda so far has been standard Republican fare, rewarding corporations and the rich while hurting workers.So the base might indeed like to see something that sounds more like the guy they thought they were voting for.But Trump\u2019s promises on trade, while unorthodox, were just as fraudulent as his promises on health care. In this area, as in, well, everything, he has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. And his ignorance-based policy won\u2019t end well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Spain, Santander Hopes a New Arts Center Will Reinvigorate the City", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRenzo Piano, the center\u2019s Italian architect, got his inspiration from the sea. \u201cWater makes things beautiful, and that is the reason why this building is flirting with the water,\u201d he said of his first edifice in Spain.But Mr. Piano\u2019s financing came from the Bot\u00edn banking family, whose foundation paid entirely for the 80 million euro (about $90 million) construction. This arts center is a rarity in Spain, a project financed by family philanthropy in a country whose cultural assets are otherwise largely dependent on public funding.Santander hopes the center will reinvigorate the city in northern Spain the same way Bilbao, about 60 miles east, was transformed by its Guggenheim museum, opened two decades ago. The Bot\u00edn family\u2019s wealth, in turn, is seen to assure that a project kick-started at the height of Spain\u2019s banking crisis will stay on course, as well as at arm\u2019s length from politicians who let other such projects fall by the wayside. West of Santander sits a half-built arts complex in Santiago de Compostela and a struggling arts center in Avil\u00e9s, designed by Oscar Niemeyer.\u201cI\u2019m sure that the Bot\u00edn Foundation will guarantee continuity here and not do anything suicidal,\u201d said Vicente Todol\u00ed, a former director of the Tate Modern in London who now leads the center\u2019s visual arts advisory committee. \u201cYou don\u2019t invest in a Formula One car and then not have it compete.\u201dMr. Bot\u00edn \u201ccould have chosen another place, but of course he had to put his center right in front of his own bank, on the spot where the Romans disembarked and this city was born,\u201d said Carlos Garc\u00eda, a former president of Arca, an environmental association, who also rejects any comparison with the Guggenheim, built in what was a run-down industrial district of Bilbao.Fernando Merodio, a Santander lawyer, said he was ready to pursue his lawsuit before European courts against a museum project that promoted \u201cthe culture of money more than the culture of art.\u201dStill, most residents have clearly been won over by the project. About a fifth of the budget went toward improving the area around the building, including building an underground road tunnel that also fitted in with Mr. Piano\u2019s idea of a museum space that helps link the city center and the sea. Mr. Piano\u2019s split building structure is raised onto pillars, to let people stroll below and also not block the sea view. (Mr. Piano also designed the headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan.)Ahead of the June 23 inauguration, about 80,000 of the Cantabria region\u2019s 580,000 residents took advantage of a special membership deal, granting locals unlimited access to the Bot\u00edn Center for a one-time \u20ac2 payment (about $2.25), compared with the normal \u20ac8 (about $9) entrance ticket.\u201cIf the museum in Bilbao worked, I don\u2019t see why this one won\u2019t do better,\u201d said Emilio G\u00f3mez Cicero, a retired boat welder, who proudly showed his new membership card. \u201cWhether you like the Bot\u00edns or not, you should accept that everything in this world is moved by money.\u201dThe center\u2019s management, however, has published no forecast about the project\u2019s economic impact on Santander. \u201cWe care about the quality of the visit rather than the quantity of visitors,\u201d \u00cd\u00f1igo S\u00e1enz de Miera, the Bot\u00edn Foundation\u2019s director general, said at a news conference.The center was inaugurated by King Felipe VI and opened with two very different exhibitions. One floor is partitioned into separate rooms to hang 81 drawings by Francisco de Goya on loan from the Prado museum in Madrid. The walls also help protect the fragile works from damaging light.In contrast, the other floor remains open and bathed in natural light, even if some of the installations by the artist Carsten H\u00f6ller are already brightly lit. Mr. H\u00f6ller\u2019s \u201cY\u201d show opens onto a light corridor, which he also compared to a uterus, that lets the viewer choose between two itineraries exploring the relationship between life and death. At one end, Mr. H\u00f6ller suspended two bird cages filled with canaries, a bird valued for its bright singing and color but also as a harbinger of death when detecting toxic gases in mines. Because of the center\u2019s construction delay, Mr. H\u00f6ller said he had the rare opportunity of \u201chaving three years to prepare one exhibition.\u201d His goal, he said, was also \u201cnot to take anything away from this immaculate new space.\u201dThe center also displays its own collection, half of which comes from artists who received grants from the foundation. Mr. Todol\u00ed said that the center would focus on contemporary art, including works by Julie Mehretu, a South African artist, in October. The center will also occasionally host classical exhibitions like that of Goya, \u201cas long as the work can say something new,\u201d Mr. Todol\u00ed said. One of Goya\u2019s main themes was social injustice, with satirical scenes of aristocratic decadence contrasting with drawings of famine and hardship in the countryside. One black crayon drawing, \u201cThey Eat a Lot,\u201d shows a friar struggling to defecate because of his gluttony. The drawings were selected from the Prado\u2019s vast Goya collection because \u201cthese ones really are pertinent to the issues of today,\u201d Mr. Todol\u00ed said. While the economy in Spain has been recovering since its 2012 banking bailout, that crisis also increased significantly the wealth gap across Spanish society.In Santander, once a summer royal residence and built on banking and shipping wealth, the Bot\u00edn Center will \u201cchange people\u2019s perception of art and also their experience of the sea,\u201d said Cristina Iglesias, an artist who built the water sculptures outside the building and who will have her own exhibition there next year. \u201cFor a conservative city, I think this opening of the mind is in itself an important contribution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Brazilian subsidiary is expected to start trading on Thursday on the S\u00e3o Paulo bourse under the ticker symbol CRFB3.The corruption accusations in May led to a market sell-off and prompted some companies to suspend their plans to go public.One such company, Grupo NotreDame Interm\u00e9dica, a dental and health care insurer owned by Bain Capital, said, \u201cGiven the political and economic situation the country is in, we think temporarily suspending this process is the best path to follow,\u201d and it said it would wait for \u201ca more opportune moment to raise capital.\u201dSince May, the markets have stabilized, and other companies are discussing I.P.O. plans.

{"Headline": "Big German Bank, Key to Trump\u2019s Finances, Faces New Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump pointed to his relationship with Deutsche Bank to counter reports that big banks were skeptical of doing business with him.After a string of bankruptcies in his casino and hotel businesses in the 1990s, Mr. Trump became somewhat of an outsider on Wall Street, leaving the giant German bank among the few major financial institutions willing to lend him money.Now that two-decades-long relationship is coming under scrutiny.Banking regulators are reviewing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans made to Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses through Deutsche Bank\u2019s private wealth management unit, which caters to an ultrarich clientele, according to three people briefed on the review who were not authorized to speak publicly. The regulators want to know if the loans might expose the bank to heightened risks.Separately, Deutsche Bank has been in contact with federal investigators about the Trump accounts, according to two people briefed on the matter. And the bank is expecting to eventually have to provide information to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the federal investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.It was not clear what information the bank might ultimately provide. Generally, the bank is seen as central to understanding Mr. Trump\u2019s finances since it is the only major financial institution that continues to conduct sizable business with him. Deutsche Bank has also lent money to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and to his family real estate business.Although Deutsche Bank recently landed in legal trouble for laundering money for Russian entities \u2014 paying more than $600 million in penalties to New York and British regulators \u2014 there is no indication of a Russian connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s loans or accounts at Deutsche Bank, people briefed on the matter said. The bank, which declined to comment, scrutinizes its accounts for problematic ties as part of so-called \u201cknow your customer\u201d banking rules and other requirements.And with one of its most famous clients headed to the White House, the bank designed a plan for overseeing the accounts of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner and presented it to regulators at the New York State Department of Financial Services early this year. The plan essentially called for monitoring the accounts for red flags such as exceptionally favorable loan terms or unusual partners.Additionally, the New York regulators recently requested information related to the hundreds of millions in loans Deutsche Bank\u2019s private wealth management division provided Mr. Trump, one of the people said, paying particular attention to personal guarantees he made to obtain the loans. Those guarantees have declined as the loans were paid down and the property values increased, but it remains a source of interest to the regulators.While there is no formal investigation of the bank \u2014 and personal guarantees are often required when people receive big loans from their wealth managers \u2014 the New York regulators have questioned whether the guarantee could create problems for Deutsche Bank should Mr. Trump fail to pay his debts. To collect, the bank would either have to sue the president, or risk being seen as cutting him a special deal.It is not a hypothetical concern: Mr. Trump sued the bank in 2008 to delay paying back an earlier loan.Mr. Trump has had a complicated relationship with the bank over the past 20 years, which has included more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, according to a New York Times review of securities filings and interviews with people with knowledge of the deals. Despite all the risk-taking \u2014 and a brief loan default that spurred the 2008 litigation \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s business has made the bank money, the people said.A spokesman for the New York regulators declined to comment, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.A few years after Mr. Trump sued the bank in 2008, he moved his business from the bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending division to its private wealth division, where executives were more willing to deal with him, according to the people briefed on the matter.In the past six years, the private wealth unit helped finance three of Mr. Trump\u2019s properties, including a golf course near Miami and a hotel in Washington, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s most recent financial disclosures and the people with knowledge of the loans.The size of the loans \u2014 totaling about $300 million \u2014 is somewhat unusual by Wall Street standards, according to former and current Deutsche Bank executives and wealth managers at other Wall Street firms.While it is not unheard-of for real estate developers to obtain large wealth management loans for projects deemed too risky for an investment bank, it differs from bank to bank, and those that do issue loans of that size typically do so for top clients known to pay their bills.Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth manager at Deutsche Bank, Rosemary Vrablic, has specialized in real estate lending and is known for taking risks on clients, two of the executives and wealth managers said. And her relationship with Mr. Trump is close enough that Ms. Vrablic attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to a person who attended.Mr. Kushner has established his own relationship with the bank. He and his mother have an unsecured line of credit from Deutsche Bank, valued at up to $25 million, and the family business he ran until January, Kushner Companies, received a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank last year.Mr. Kushner\u2019s dealings at the bank have included Ms. Vrablic. In 2013, he ordered up a glowing profile of her in the real estate magazine he owned, The Mortgage Observer, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The piece concluded with a disclaimer that her \u201cpast clients\u201d included Mr. Kushner.In an interview with The Times last year, Mr. Trump suggested reporters speak with Ms. Vrablic about his banking relationships.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is the boss.\u201dIt was 1998, and Mike Offit, fresh off the trading floor of Goldman Sachs for a new job at Deutsche Bank, was hired to put Deutsche Bank\u2019s real estate lending business on the map. To do that, Mr. Offit knew he had to snag big name developers.That moment arrived when Rob Horowitz, with the real estate firm Cooper-Horowitz, approached him with an idea: Would he work with Mr. Trump, who at the time had a tarnished reputation after several of his casinos landed in bankruptcy?\u201cMy reaction was, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Mr. Offit recalled in a recent interview.To Mr. Offit, there was little downside to hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s pitch. A short time later, Mr. Trump came by Mr. Offit\u2019s Midtown Manhattan office to discuss a loan for renovations at his 40 Wall Street building. Unlike other developers who arrived with their entourages, Mr. Trump showed up alone, Mr. Offit said, and despite a reputation for bluster, he knew the financials of the deal cold.\u201cThere was some resistance from management because of Donald\u2019s reputation, but I told them that our loan would be wildly overly collateralized even in the worst-case scenario,\u201d Mr. Offit said.More deals followed. Later in the year, Mr. Trump needed $300 million to build Trump World Tower near the United Nations. But he required a construction loan, which, at the time, Deutsche did not have the right staff to manage. Determined to get the deal nonetheless, Mr. Offit found another German bank to make the loan with the commitment that Deutsche Bank would take possession once the building was constructed.But as the deal was being finalized, the other German bank had second thoughts because of worries of a labor strike. Just as the deal seemed to be falling apart, Mr. Trump produced a signed commitment from all the major construction unions promising not to strike.\u201cWe were all amazed he managed to get that,\u201d said Mr. Offit, who retired from the bank in 1999.In the mid 2000s, Mr. Trump was in need of another construction loan. But this time, the loan \u2014 up to $640 million to build Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago \u2014 did not go as well.A few years after the project began, the 2008 financial crisis upended the global economy and Mr. Trump fell behind on loan payments. According to a person briefed on the deal, Deutsche Bank was discussing a possible extension, when Mr. Trump sued it to avoid paying $40 million that he had personally guaranteed.His argument, as detailed in a letter to the bank, was novel: \u201cDeutsche Bank is one of the banks primarily responsible for the economic dysfunction we are currently facing,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.With the help of a lawyer \u2014 Steven Schlesinger of Garden City, N.Y. \u2014 Mr. Trump argued that the financial crisis allowed him to invoke the extraordinary event clause in his contract with the bank. Mr. Trump argued Deutsche Bank should pay him $3 billion in damages.The bank filed its own action against Mr. Trump, demanding he make good on the loan. In a legal filing, Deutsche Bank, which had distributed the loan to a number of other banks, called the lawsuit \u201cclassic Trump.\u201dThe standoff culminated with a meeting in Trump Tower, Mr. Schlesinger said.At the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened to remove his name from the building if he did not get more time to pay. That move, Mr. Trump suggested, would reduce the value of the building.Ultimately, the bank granted Mr. Trump additional time to repay. And when he did, it was through the Wall Street equivalent of borrowing from one parent to repay the other.Mr. Trump received a loan from Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth management unit to pay off the debt he owed the bank\u2019s real estate lending division, according to two people briefed on the transaction. The wealth management unit later issued another loan for the Chicago project that is valued at $25 million to $50 million.Ms. Vrablic, who helped facilitate the wealth management unit\u2019s loans to Mr. Trump, has built a career lending to the rich and famous.She got her start on Wall Street at Citibank\u2019s private bank in the late 1980s and later worked at Bank of America before joining Deutsche Bank in 2006.Ms. Vrablic, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has a reputation for being an aggressive advocate for her clients, according to two executives familiar with her work and profiles written in The American Banker and The Mortgage Observer.In a 2013 Mortgage Observer article, one of her clients, Herbert Simon, owner of the Indiana Pacers, remarked that \u201cwhen she came into the picture, it was a tough time to get money, and she was able to be very creative and get us what we needed.\u201dIn a 1999 American Banker article, Ms. Vrablic described her clients as having \u201cmany homes, ex-wives, and many children.\u201dMr. Trump fit that mold, but he was far from her only client in the rarefied world of New York real estate. Others included Stephen Ross, the chairman and founder of the Related Companies in New York.Mr. Ross extolled Ms. Vrablic\u2019s ability to make deals happen. \u201cShe brings knowledge \u2014 and the fact is that if she tells you something, you know it\u2019s going to get done,\u201d he told The Mortgage Observer.Ms. Vrablic was quoted in the same article as saying that real estate is her \u201cdeep dive.\u201dWhile Mr. Kushner has never disclosed the exact nature of his business with Ms. Vrablic, his financial disclosure shows a line of credit worth between $5 million and $25 million. And according to securities filings, Deutsche Bank provided a $285 million mortgage to Kushner Companies to help it refinance the loan it used to purchase several floors of retail space in the former New York Times building on 43rd Street in Manhattan.Mr. Kushner\u2019s company bought the space from Africa Israel Investments, a company owned by Lev Leviev, which has a sizable real estate portfolio in Russia.Deutsche Bank, other securities filings show, is also involved in loans the Kushner Companies received for the Puck Building in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood and a property on Maiden Lane near Wall Street. The bank was responsible for either pooling those loans into mortgage-backed securities that were sold to investors, according to Trepp, a data and analytics firm, or distributing payments to the investors.In the autumn of 2014, Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Kushner attended the Frick Collection\u2019s dinner, a black-tie event where patrons dined among famous works of art by Manet, El Greco and Turner.A picture of the pair appeared in the New York Social Diary. Mr. Kushner, dressed in a tuxedo, had his arm around Ms. Vrablic.There is no indication that federal investigators suspect a Russian connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Deutsche Bank, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Horowitz, of the real estate firm Cooper-Horowitz, also saw no Russian ties in his many years of working with Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve arranged financing for the majority of Mr. Trump\u2019s transactions, and I\u2019ve never once seen any money coming to him from Russia,\u201d he said. Mr. Horowitz was not involved in any of the private wealth management loans from Ms. Vrablic.But separate from Mr. Trump, the German bank has a host of Russian connections.Soon after Mr. Trump took office, the bank settled allegations that it helped Russian investors launder as much as $10 billion through its branches in Moscow, London and New York. In May, the Federal Reserve reached its own settlement with the bank over the money laundering violations.Deutsche Bank also had a \u201ccooperation agreement\u201d with the Russian state-owned development bank, Vnesheconombank, which has been swept up in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. And it had ties to VTB Bank, a far larger Russian bank facing sanctions in the United States and the European Union. The Russian firm\u2019s investment banking arm, VTB Capital, was created by hiring dozens of bankers from Deutsche Bank\u2019s Moscow office.Some ties are less direct. Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank\u2019s former chief executive, is now chairman of the board at the Bank of Cyprus. A large shareholder of that bank was Dmitry Rybolovlev, the Russian oligarch who purchased Mr. Trump\u2019s estate in Florida.And in May, federal prosecutors settled a case with a Cyprus investment vehicle owned by a Russian businessman with close family connections to the Kremlin.The firm, Prevezon Holdings, was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who was among the people who met during the presidential campaign with Donald Trump Jr. about Hillary Clinton.Federal prosecutors in the United States claimed Prevezon, which admitted no wrongdoing, laundered the proceeds of an alleged Russian tax fraud through real estate. Prevezon and its partner relied in part on $90 million in financing from a big European financial institution, court records show.It was Deutsche Bank.Adam Goldman and Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting from Washington, and Steve Eder from New York.

{"Headline": "White Economic Privilege Is Alive and Well", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIs the white working class losing economic ground because of policies intended to improve the lives of black people? Anxiety and resentment among some white voters about those policies certainly seemed to benefit Donald Trump\u2019s campaign last year, with its populist, ethno-nationalist message.The problem with this belief is that it is false. The income gap between black and white working-class Americans, like the gap between black and white Americans at every income level, remains every bit as extreme as it was five decades ago. (This is also true of the income gap between Hispanic and white Americans.)In 2015 \u2014 the most recent year for which data are available \u2014 black households at the 20th and 40th percentiles of household income earned an average of 55 percent as much as white households at those same percentiles. This is exactly the same figure as in 1967.Indeed, five decades of household income data reveal a yawning and uncannily consistent income gap between black and white Americans across the economic spectrum. Fifty years ago, black upper-class Americans had incomes about two-thirds those of white upper-class Americans, while the black middle class \u2014 those in the 60th percentile \u2014 earned about two-thirds as much as its white counterpart. Those ratios remain the same today.These numbers should shock us. Consider that in the mid-1960s, Jim Crow practices were still being dismantled and affirmative action hardly existed. Yet a half-century of initiatives intended to combat the effects of centuries of virulent racism appear to have done nothing to ameliorate inequality between white and black America.Conservatives like Charles Murray tend to blame either social welfare programs for sapping initiative and keeping black people poor, or black people themselves for being less intelligent than whites, or a \u201cpathological\u201d culture that now manifests itself in the white working class as well.But the historical pervasiveness and contemporary persistence of racism in America offer more than adequate explanations for what should be considered a scandalous state of affairs in regard to race-based economic inequality.Many black children, for example, attend schools that once again are as segregated as they were in the 1960s, and they are far more likely to become trapped in a prison-industrial complex that the scholar Michelle Alexander has called \u201cthe new Jim Crow.\u201dIt is important to remember the extent to which the civil rights movement led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was focused on economic injustice. Indeed, A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, who planned the March on Washington that culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, organized the event primarily to highlight and protest what they called \u201cthe economic subordination of the American Negro.\u201dAnd Dr. King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign, which he was organizing at the time of his murder, was an even more explicit argument that racial and economic justice are inextricably linked.But over that same time, black working- and middle-class households have seen their incomes stagnate in exactly the same fashion as those of their white neighbors \u2014 and from a base that was and thus remains little more than half as large.A genuine populist movement would unite working- and middle-class Americans of all backgrounds, rather than dividing them by exploiting false beliefs about the supposed loss of white economic privilege.Paul F. Campos is a professor of law at the University of Colorado, Boulder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Back to the Center, Democrats", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe path back to power for the Democratic Party today, as it was in the 1990s, is unquestionably to move to the center and reject the siren calls of the left, whose policies and ideas have weakened the party.In the early 1990s, the Democrats relied on identity politics, promoted equality of outcomes instead of equality of opportunity and looked to find a government solution for every problem. After years of leftward drift by the Democrats culminated in Republican control of the House under Speaker Newt Gingrich, President Bill Clinton moved the party back to the center in 1995 by supporting a balanced budget, welfare reform, a crime bill that called for providing 100,000 new police officers and a step-by-step approach to broadening health care. Mr. Clinton won a resounding re-election victory in 1996 and Democrats were back.But the last few years of the Obama administration and the 2016 primary season once again created a rush to the left. Identity politics, class warfare and big government all made comebacks. Candidates inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren and a host of well-funded groups have embraced sharply leftist ideas. But the results at the voting booth have been anything but positive: Democrats lost over 1,000 legislative seats across the country and control of both houses of Congress during the Obama years. And in special elections for Congress this year, they failed to take back any seats held by Republicans.Central to the Democrats\u2019 diminishment has been their loss of support among working-class voters, who feel abandoned by the party\u2019s shift away from moderate positions on trade and immigration, from backing police and tough anti-crime measures, from trying to restore manufacturing jobs. They saw the party being mired too often in political correctness, transgender bathroom issues and policies offering more help to undocumented immigrants than to the heartland.Bigger government handouts won\u2019t win working-class voters back. This is the fallacy of the left, believing that voters just need to be shown how much they are getting in government benefits. In reality, these voters see themselves as being penalized for maintaining the basic values of hard work, religion and family. It\u2019s also not all about guns and abortion. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both won working-class voters despite relatively progressive views on those issues. Today, identity politics and disdain for religion are creating a new social divide that the Democrats need to bridge by embracing free speech on college campuses and respect for Catholics and people of other faiths who feel marginalized within the party.There are plenty of good issues Democrats should be championing. They need to reject socialist ideas and adopt an agenda of renewed growth, greater protection for American workers and a return to fiscal responsibility. While the old brick-and-mortar economy is being regulated to death, the new tech-driven economy has been given a pass to flout labor laws with unregulated, low-paying gig jobs, to concentrate vast profits and to decimate retailing. Rural areas have been left without adequate broadband and with shrinking opportunities. The opioid crisis has spiraled out of control, killing tens of thousands, while pardons have been given to so-called nonviolent drug offenders. Repairing and expanding infrastructure, a classic Democratic issue, has been hijacked by President Trump \u2014 meaning Democrats have a chance to reach across the aisle to show they understand that voters like bipartisanship.Immigration is also ripe for a solution from the center. Washington should restore the sanctity of America\u2019s borders, create a path to work permits and possibly citizenship, and give up on both building walls and defending sanctuary cities. On trade, Democrats should recognize that they can no longer simultaneously try to be the free-trade party and speak for the working class. They need to support fair trade and oppose manufacturing plants\u2019 moving jobs overseas, by imposing new taxes on such transfers while allowing repatriation of foreign profits. And the party seems to have forgotten that community policing combined with hiring more police officers worked in the \u201990s \u2014 and it will work again today. It can\u2019t be the party that failed to stop the rising murder rates in cities like Chicago.Health care is the one area where the Democrats have gained the upper hand and have a coherent message about protecting the working poor from losing coverage. But the Affordable Care Act needs to be adjusted to control costs better, lest employer-sponsored health care become unaffordable. For now, the Democrats are right to hold the line in defending Obamacare in the face of Republican disunity.Easily lost in today\u2019s divided politics is that only a little more than a quarter of Americans consider themselves liberals, while almost three in four are self-identified moderates or conservatives. Yet moderate viewpoints are being given short shrift in the presidential nominating process. So Democrats should change their rules to eliminate all caucuses in favor of primaries. Caucuses are largely undemocratic because they give disproportionate power to left-leaning activists, making thousands of Democrats in Kansas more influential than millions of people in Florida.Americans are looking for can-do Democrats in the mold of John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton \u2014 leaders who rose above partisanship to unify the country, who defended human rights and equality passionately, and who also encouraged economic growth and rising wages. That is the road back to relevance, and the White House, for the Democrats.Mark Penn served as pollster and senior adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton from 1995 to 2008.

{"Headline": "After Wanda Deal, Chinese Property Developer Faces Debt Risk", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese property developer Sunac China Holdings has turned into one of the country\u2019s biggest white knights, swooping in to help troubled companies with too much debt. The risk: Sunac is amassing its own large pile of debt in the process.\u201cThe problem for Sunac is twofold,\u201d said Peter Fuhrman, chairman of China First Capital, an investment bank. \u201cThey themselves are already rather overleveraged and they are not paying distressed prices.\u201dSunac is offering a much-needed lifeline.Sunac, China\u2019s seventh-largest property developer in terms of sales, has been able to tap into its financial strength to help companies under pressure. Since 2012, Sunac\u2019s property sales have grown at double-digit rates nearly every year, giving it the firepower to scoop up assets and land plots.It is a remarkable turnabout for the company\u2019s founder, Sun Hongbin.Mr. Sun started his career at the Lenovo Group, where he was promoted to run enterprise development. But he had a falling out with Liu Chuanzhi, the founder of Lenovo, over a business dispute. Related to the dispute, Mr. Sun was sentenced in 1992 to five years in jail for misappropriation of public funds.After his release in 1994, he met with the founder of Lenovo and apologized, according to the website of The People\u2019s Daily, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper. The Lenovo founder eventually lent Mr. Sun about $74,000, which he used to start a predecessor real estate firm to Sunac.Lenovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.When Mr. Sun started Sunac in 2003, he focused on the cities of Wuxi and Chongqing and then moved on to China\u2019s most developed cities, among them Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Hangzhou, building apartments with names like Beijing Fontainebleau Chateau. Sunac built its residential projects in good locations near city centers and was aggressive in acquiring land plots \u2014 with higher debt.\u201cPeople who have failed are those who have been defeated by themselves,\u201d Mr. Sun told a newspaper, China Business News, in 2013. \u201cBut I often tell others: After you fail, you can start again.\u201dWith the Wanda deal, Sunac is extending its reach into tourism, paying $9.3 billion for 76 hotels and a major chunk of its 13 tourism projects, in the country\u2019s largest property acquisition ever. The purchase will help Sunac diversify its business, which is hurting from government restrictions on home sales as Beijing seeks to cool a frothy property market. It also strengthens the company\u2019s hand in an industry dominated by bigwigs like the China Vanke Group and Country Garden.\u201cWithin the housing industry, the powerhouses are really strong,\u201d said Lu Wenxi, an analyst for Centaline Properties who is based in Shanghai. \u201cIf you don\u2019t gobble up the fat ones, it is easy to be eaten up by others. Taking on more projects will prevent you from being eaten.\u201dInvestors have rewarded Sunac for the deal. Shares of Sunac rose 14 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday after they resumed trading after the deal announcement.But the deal will add to an already significant debt load. In 2016, the company\u2019s net gearing ratio \u2014 a measure of total debt to shareholders\u2019 equity \u2014 rose to 121.5 percent, from to 75.9 percent in 2015. Fitch Ratings recently downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating to BB-, saying Sunac\u2019s acquisitive approach had made its financial profile \u201cmore volatile.\u201dWanda is helping finance the acquisition. Sunac, in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, said Wanda would procure a loan for the company worth about $4.4 billion.Seller financing is not uncommon, both in China and the West. But Wanda\u2019s role means that Sunac doesn\u2019t have all the money upfront.\u201cIn my experience, I\u2019ve never seen it anywhere,\u201d said Lester Ross, a Beijing-based partner with the law firm WilmerHale, who has advised deals in China for the last 20 years. \u201cNo client that I represent would accept a deal like that where you\u2019re responsible for raising the money to pay for somebody else.\u201dSunac did not return multiple calls for comment. The company said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday that the deal with Wanda \u201cwill add a large number of prime land reserves and property assets for the company at a reasonable cost.\u201dThe LeEco deal is also prompting concern.Sunac invested $2.2 billion in LeEco, buying minority stakes in three of the conglomerate\u2019s more stable businesses, including the smart TV affiliate Leshi Zhixin, Le Vision Pictures, and Leshi Internet. The two companies don\u2019t have many overlapping interests, and LeEco\u2019s finances have continued to sour. Before the Wanda deal, shares of Sunac were falling on fears that LeEco\u2019s problems would spread.In a January news conference, Mr. Sun said many people had tried to dissuade him from investing in LeEco, adding that several were \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to it.\u201cI seriously considered their views, but I don\u2019t think their opinions are sufficient to change my mind,\u201d he said.Research was contributed by Ryan McMorrow, Tang Yucheng, Zhang Tiantian and Amy Cheng.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Arms Sustain Drive for \u2018Final Victory\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterA mystery has long surrounded North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.Conventional wisdom holds that the North\u2019s weapons are intended to address the country\u2019s two greatest problems \u2014 military inferiority and economic weakness \u2014 by deterring the United States and extracting concessions.But in practice, the weapons make both problems worse by increasing the risk of war and ensuring continued sanctions.\u201cPeople keep asking, \u2018What do they want, why do they test these missiles?\u2019 \u201d said Joshua H. Pollack, the editor of The Nonproliferation Review. \u201cBut they are telling us very clearly.\u201dThe country says that it plans \u2014 and analysts increasingly take this claim seriously \u2014 to force the world to accept it as a full member of the international community and, eventually, to reconcile with the United States and South Korea on its terms.North Korea envisions the United States one day concluding that it has grown too powerful to coerce and the status quo too risky to maintain, leading Washington to accept a grand bargain in which it would drop sanctions and withdraw some or all of its forces from South Korea.As a show of global acceptance, Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, would then be welcomed in foreign capitals and at the United Nations. This political agenda, much like North Korea\u2019s push for an intercontinental ballistic missile, was once dismissed as bluster. But the country\u2019s actions suggest it means what it says.Experts believe North Korea is likely to fall short of its grander ambitions, which appear premised on the kind of miscalculations to which new nuclear powers are often prone. Still, more modest goals, like a grudging global acceptance, may be more feasible.Even if North Korea\u2019s own leaders consider success unlikely, they may have judged, with some reason, that this is their country\u2019s only shot at long-term survival.The key to understanding North Korea\u2019s strategy may lie in the recent past of another Asian nuclear state: China.Mao Zedong\u2019s China began, in the 1950s, as a pariah state, isolated and threatened by the United States. It became, in the 1960s, a rogue nuclear power. And then it rose, through the 1970s, into an accepted member of the international community, embraced even by its onetime adversary.China ultimately won acceptance by playing the United States against the Soviet Union, not by rattling nuclear sabers. Its size and power also made it impossible for other nations to ignore it, advantages that North Korea lacks.But North Korea\u2019s desperation, as well as its longtime obsession with China, may have led it to see the possibility, however misguided, of achieving success by following Beijing\u2019s script.\u201cYou can see in their language and their approach that they are modeling all this on basically China and the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.Though it is difficult to imagine today an American president flying to Pyongyang to shake Mr. Kim\u2019s hand and normalize relations, it was not much easier, in the 1960s, to picture President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s 1972 trip to Beijing.\u201cThe key to understanding Kim Jong-un\u2019s long-term strategy has to do with \u2018byungjin,\u2019 \u201d said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. Byungjin, or parallel advance, is Mr. Kim\u2019s policy of developing the economy alongside the nuclear program.\u201cIdeally, from his perspective, he could replicate the Chinese model by normalizing foreign relations, from the U.S. down, on the basis of a nuclear deterrent,\u201d Mr. Delury said. Only then, with its economy, in theory, allowed to catch up to its neighbors\u2019 and its leadership accepted abroad, could North Korea feel secure.The country often explains its weapons as serving these goals, and it often ties its weapons tests to relatively small demands, like ending American military exercises on the peninsula. Mr. Pollack stressed that North Korea sees itself as playing a long game, in which small concessions add up over generations. Mr. Kim, who could hold power for decades, has time.A more radical version of North Korea\u2019s strategy, Mr. Pollack said, drives toward \u201cwhat they call the final victory: reunification.\u201dExperts disagree on whether North Korea remains intent on assimilating the South under its rule, as it tried with a 1950 invasion and subsequent efforts at destabilizing South Korea\u2019s government. But the North continues to claim that as its goal, announcing the missile test on Friday with a pledge to \u201cachieve the final victory.\u201d\u201cNorth Korea has consistently proclaimed its determination to unify the homeland and behaved accordingly,\u201d B. R. Myers, a North Korea scholar at Dongseo University in South Korea, wrote in a research paper last year.Reunification, Mr. Myers wrote, would be \u201cthe only long-term solution to the regime\u2019s chronic security problems.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s overwhelming prosperity in comparison with its neighbor leaves the North with little reason to exist as a separate state. This legitimacy crisis poses a danger just as existential as American military power.The North\u2019s leaders appear to have concluded, Mr. Myers wrote, \u201cthat unification would not be possible as long as U.S. troops remained in the South,\u201d leading them to develop weapons that could be used to force an American exit.While such goals might sound ridiculous to American ears, Mr. Pollack believes that North Korea sees this, again, as part of the Chinese model that worked once before.For years, the United States recognized Taiwan, where it based troops, as the rightful Chinese government. But that relationship flipped in 1979, when the United States normalized ties with Beijing and broke its alliance with Taiwan.North Korea may hope to use a similar playbook, splitting the United States from South Korea. The break would not need to be so drastic to fulfill the North\u2019s goals; official neutrality would do.Beijing\u2019s stated goal of reunification with Taiwan will not happen for decades, if ever, but few doubt its sincerity. North Korea may similarly see reunification prospects as remote and generations away but still essential.Research on nuclear diplomacy offers two lessons: that North Korea\u2019s strategy is likely to fail and that the country is likely to try anyway.Nuclear threats are simply not believable; the consequences of using the weapons are seen as too great to be credible. As a result, nuclear states are less likely to successfully coerce an adversary than non-nuclear states, which can more credibly threaten war.And because nuclear weapons heighten the risk to both sides, they tend to lock the status quo in place \u2014 the opposite of North Korea\u2019s goal.Mr. Kim, the research by Mr. Sechser and Mr. Fuhrmann suggests, has greatly enhanced his ability to deter the United States from invading. But if he is hoping to force the United States into a major policy change, he is headed for disappointment.This may pose the gravest risk to both the United States and North Korea itself. Should Mr. Kim miscalculate with his nuclear threats, there is a small chance he could blunder into war.If the world wishes to avoid these risks, Mr. Myers wrote, it would need to confront the \u201ctroubling explanations for North Korea\u2019s armament, instead of continuing to ignore them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "City Expands Services as More Become Homeless, Even With a Job", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetween intermittent drizzle and drenching downpours, social workers climbed an embankment just off what they called the \u201czigzag\u201d \u2014 an entanglement of roads and exits from the Henry Hudson Parkway and Riverside Drive in northern Manhattan.They were looking for a crudely built wooden loft bed wedged into concrete so that it was suspended above the ground and three feet or so beneath Riverside Drive.Kyle Stefano, one of the workers, shined a flashlight and woke the man who had slept through the rumbling traffic above him. He said that his name was Javier and that he didn\u2019t want help. \u201cWait, wait,\u201d he shouted from the darkness on Friday morning. \u201cWhat time is it? I have to go to work.\u201dAn annual survey in February found that about 3,900 people were living on sidewalks, in subways, in parks and in isolated areas, like the embankment. The tally was an alarming 40 percent increase from 2016. Though mild winter weather was cited as a factor, Steven Banks, the commissioner of social services, said the survey gave a more accurate picture of what social workers had been reporting.As part of a new approach, the Center for Urban Community Services, a nonprofit, will announce this week that under a $33 million contract with the city, it will lead a consortium to reduce street homelessness in Manhattan. Other nonprofits handle the city\u2019s other boroughs, but Manhattan was the clear epicenter of the surge, according to the survey.Tony Hannigan, the executive director of the Center for Urban Community Services, said the contract required the consortium to broaden its scope and its definition of homelessness. For a decade, the nonprofits focused on chronically homeless people, defined as living unsheltered for nine months or more and having physical or developmental disabilities, substance abuse problems or mental health issues. The providers are now being asked to help newly homeless or short-term homeless people, including panhandlers.\u201cThe economy has improved but not necessarily for people on the very bottom,\u201d Mr. Hannigan said.Mayor Bill de Blasio recently upset some homeless people and advocates with off-the-cuff remarks that included calling people begging for money on the street charlatans pretending to be homeless.But his remarks reflected a new effort by the Department of Homeless Services to better understand who is panhandling, why they are begging and how the city can help them get off the streets. \u201cWe want to dig more deeply to what their needs are,\u201d Mr. Banks said.One of their needs is to simply have somewhere to go. The city has six drop-in centers, where people can shower and get meals and services. Two more are scheduled to open by the end of the year, including one on 14th Street in Manhattan, Mr. Banks said.On Tuesday, Mr. Banks toured a new center in Ozone Park, Queens, operated by Breaking Ground, which is part of the consortium.Once home to a coffee roaster, the unassuming building still smells of coffee beans, but is filled with computers and has a new kitchen. Abdul Hasan, 38, who said he became homeless three months ago after a dispute with his family over his sexuality and drinking, said he was now getting three meals a day there instead of hanging out in nearby Forest Park.Mr. Hasan said he lived in a shelter in East New York for two months until he was attacked by other residents. He said he quit his job as a cashier at a restaurant at Kennedy Airport after he was unable to maintain his hygiene. Told about the drop-in center, Mr. Hasan said social workers have helped him apply for unemployment benefits and get a mailing address and a library card.\u201cIt\u2019s way better than the street,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have been sitting on a bench.\u201dThe city has a list of 2,000 names of people who live on the street, Mr. Banks said. That is far from the survey\u2019s estimate of 3,900 people, but Mr. Banks said it was a start to building the trust needed to get people into shelter. It takes an average of five months to establish trust and get people indoors, according to the Homeless Services Department.On Friday as she left the embankment, Ms. Stefano suspected that Javier was a fake name. She and Eric Wilson, a case manager, ticked off nicknames they have been given: Daddy-O, Animal, Tasty, Tow Truck, Charlie Tuna, Mr. Nature, Dirty Harry and Juice.\u201cSome folks have given up on the shelters,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cThe more crowded the shelters get, it trickles to the street.\u201dMr. Wilson and Ms. Stefano found several people living under an overpass in Highbridge Park in Washington Heights in Manhattan. Meticulously decorated, the encampment of half a dozen people looked like the showroom of a furniture store, complete with a comfy red velour armchair.In Harlem, Ms. Stefano and Mr. Wilson talked to Mohammad Daka, an immigrant from Ivory Coast, who was living in a tent he had fashioned out of a blue tarp, a black shower curtain and cardboard boxes.Mr. Daka and others on the street could be moved by city officials as a nuisance, though the city now gives some notice. Earlier this year, the city settled a lawsuit filed on behalf of three homeless men whose belongings, including birth certificates, were destroyed in a removal.Mr. Daka was willing to take the risk. He said he could not deal with the curfews and rules of the shelters.High-profile crimes inside shelters, including the murder of a former librarian in January 2016, keep people away.Aware of the reputation, the city is increasing the number of so-called safe haven beds. The beds are generally in smaller settings and in churches and do not have the same restrictions, like curfews. In the past 18 months, the city has added 350 safe haven beds and plans to add 360 by the end of the year, when it with have a total of 1,100.Israel Gonzalez, 47, moved into a safe haven about nine months ago after becoming homeless about eight years ago. \u201cWhen they told me they were going to house me, I said, \u2018Aww, I\u2019ve heard that one before,\u2019 \u201d he said.But in three weeks, he was in the Center for Urban Community Services safe haven in Harlem, which has 40 beds and is adding 20 more.Mr. Gonzalez said he was grateful to be off 126th Street and Third Avenue where he had made his home outdoors. He preferred it to the shelters. \u201cIn the winter, shelters get extra, extra packed,\u201d he said.He said opening more shelters and safe havens was noble of the city. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think more shelters would work,\u201d he said. \u201cMore permanent housing is the solution.\u201dThat is the solution the city would like, too, Mr. Banks said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Shows the Way to Higher Pay", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFor starters, the debate has underscored the validity of decades of rigorous research and real-life experience showing that moderate increases in the minimum raise the pay of low-wage workers without reducing job growth or work hours. The only question is whether big increases would also work. The federal minimum is a mere $7.25 an hour and most of the 30 states with higher minimums require less than $10 an hour. Large minimum-wage increases are generally defined as those calling for $12 to $15 an hour.In Seattle, the minimum rose in 2015 from $9.47 an hour to either $10 or $11, depending mainly on the size of a business. In 2016 it rose to a range of $10.50 to $13. (The period studied covers 2015 and 2016.) In 2017, it hit $11 to $15. By 2021, all Seattle businesses will pay at least $15.In attempting to assess the effects of the increase, the Seattle study excluded workers at businesses that also have locations outside the city, including chains and franchises like Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s. The intent was to isolate the impact on Seattle employers, independent of outside business concerns. But the consequence was to overlook \u2014 and most likely underestimate \u2014 the experiences of employers who can best afford the raises. Similarly, the study blames the minimum wage increase for a decline in low-wage work in Seattle, when a likely cause is the city\u2019s strong economy in which competition, not the minimum wage, bids up pay.Seen in that light, it seems safe to conclude that Seattle has tolerated its minimum wage increase well and that, by extension, other strong economies could do so. It also suggests that a key to successful large increases is a gradual phase-in that gives businesses time to adjust and experts time to study the impacts as they unfold.Caution is advisable, because large increases are largely untested. What is not acceptable is to do nothing in the face of uncertainty. Minimum wages have to go up: If the federal minimum of $7.25 had simply kept pace over the decades with inflation, it would be nearly $10 an hour today. If it had kept pace with other relevant benchmarks, like average wages and productivity growth, it would be $11 to nearly $19 today. Cities and states are experimenting with higher minimums because Congress has failed to raise the federal minimum. The experiment appears to be working.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the (Empty) Apartment Next Door Is Owned by an Oligarch", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn each of these cities there are at least some indications that what is troubling the housing market can be traced elsewhere \u2014 to Russian oligarchs, Brazilian bank accounts, Chinese businessmen. It\u2019s possible that foreign money isn\u2019t just driving up prices for penthouses; it may also be distorting the market, to the detriment of lifelong residents.But the true extent of the phenomenon is maddeningly hard to measure. So are its broader economic effects. Local governments have barely attempted to track the cash influx. And each of these global cities has become attractive to investors partly because housing in them is scarce, making claims of insufficient supply and excessive demand all the more difficult to untangle.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about an asset bubble in apples, or copper or something that you could easily forgo,\u201d said Josh Gordon, a professor in the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. Worrisome things happen when one person\u2019s asset is another\u2019s shelter.That is the largest sum since the organization began tracking foreign investment in 2009, and those purchases amounted to 10 percent of the dollar value of all existing-home sales in the United States last year. Nearly half of that money went into just three states: California, Florida and Texas.\u201cWithout a doubt, foreigners are pushing up the prices in California and Florida,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. That is good for existing homeowners, he said, and it is positive for the American economy that foreigners are confident about investing here. But it also pushes first-time buyers out of local markets, Mr. Yun said.Data they obtained from CoreLogic shows that the share of home purchases made by out-of-town buyers has increased steadily since 2004 in both metropolitan New York and Manhattan. More than one in 10 purchases in Manhattan now includes such a buyer (the \u201cout-of-town\u201d definition here doesn\u2019t distinguish between domestic investors and Russian oligarchs, but the effects are the same in the modeling, and the authors think of the problem as one of foreign money).When they assume a worst-case scenario \u2014 all of these out-of-town purchases sit vacant \u2014 rents and home prices in the city rise, wages tick up thanks to new construction jobs, commute times for workers grow longer, and center city neighborhoods become less diverse as the wealthy move in. All else equal, they conclude, the rise in out-of-town buyers from levels seen a decade ago pushes home prices up in New York by about 1.1 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but the net effect is a negative one for the city\u2019s welfare, the researchers conclude.\u201cAnd then there are costs that are harder to quantify,\u201d Professor Van Nieuwerburgh said. \u201cThe texture of the city, the socioeconomic makeup of the city, is changing.\u201dRhys Kesselman, another professor at Simon Fraser University, has proposed an intriguing alternative: a property surtax tilted toward high-end homes that would be deductible against the owner\u2019s income tax. Local residents paying income taxes would effectively owe no surtax. Out-of-town investors, foreign or domestic, who don\u2019t work in the local economy would be hardest hit (with some concessions for resident retirees).The elegance of that idea is that it doesn\u2019t require local governments to figure out who is foreign and who is not, or which homes are vacant and which are occupied. And it recognizes that the real problem isn\u2019t foreigners; it\u2019s speculation in the housing market that, these days, often tends to come from abroad.Advertisement"}

If you\u2019re a casual worker, chances are your pay will be a little lighter this week.Murmurs about growing economic inequality are in the air \u2014 and given the last week of news, it\u2019s not surprising to see why.Cuts to penalty rates for Sunday casual workers went into effect as the new financial year ticked over on July 1. Some workers have had their hourly overtime rate on Sundays drop by up to 5 percent, with further cuts to follow in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The change, which was welcomed by the Australian Retailers Association, came after a ruling from the Fair Work Commission, Australia\u2019s national workplace relations tribunal.In an untimely twist, the cuts kicked in the same weekend that Australia\u2019s federal politicians enjoyed a raise of 2 percent. Those same politicians will also see tax cuts this financial year, thanks to the lifting of the government\u2019s deficit levy on high-income earners. The pay increase will mean that the prime minister\u2019s salary rises from $517,504 to $527,852.This follows some discouraging news about the realities of a \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 the new labor category made up of independent contractors who work for ride-share companies like Uber, odd-job markets like the Australian online platform Airtasker and delivery services like Deliveroo. While those companies have been regularly lauded as disrupters of industry, the consequences of their growth have started becoming evident to many Australians.Dr. Sarah Kaine, the head of the future of work research at the University of Technology Sydney, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the gig economy could create new social classes of workers: those who enjoy established working entitlements and conditions, and those who are forced to forgo them.In May, Airtasker announced a landmark agreement with Unions NSW that pushed for a higher minimum pay for its workers, as well as an affordable insurance product that would cover illnesses and accidents.However, the buzz around the gig economy might not reflect its slice of the labor-force pie.\u201cI do have a general abiding concern that this gig economy is getting more attention than it perhaps warrants,\u201d said Roger Wilkins, a professional research fellow at the University of Melbourne.So, the news isn\u2019t great \u2014 but it\u2019s also not historically bad.\u201cOver the last 15 years, inequality hasn\u2019t really grown to any significant extent,\u201d Mr. Wilkins said. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s at the right level.

Heavy lobbying by the state\u2019s car dealerships.Since manipulating public policy to increase profits is hard to defend publicly, bottleneckers rely on other arguments.The failure to legalize direct sales by Tesla is a testament to how archaic laws stifle entrepreneurship and limit consumer choice.

Millions live in states like Virginia that did not expand Medicaid to childless adults among the working poor, as the law allowed.

{"Headline": "For Russia, Trump-Putin Meeting Is a Sure Winner", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAs for the policy of the U.S. administration, we have to understand first what it will involve,\u201d Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, said last week in Moscow at a conference of foreign policy experts from both countries. \u201cThis is what we are actually trying to do, in an utmost active manner, right now.\u201dWhatever the outcome of the encounter on Friday \u2014 which will be on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting of world leaders in Hamburg, Germany, but is expected to overshadow it \u2014 the Kremlin is betting that Mr. Putin can stage-manage the event so that he comes out looking like the stronger party.If nothing much emerges from the meeting, analysts said, the Kremlin can repeat the standard Russian line that Mr. Trump is weak, hamstrung by domestic politics.But if Mr. Trump agrees to work with Mr. Putin despite a list of Russian transgressions beginning with the annexation of Crimea and ending with its interference in the 2016 presidential election, he will also look weak while Mr. Putin can claim that he reconstructed the relationship.\u201cIt is a win-win situation for Putin,\u201d said Andrei V. Kolesnikov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center.Mr. Putin nevertheless does face some hurdles. First and foremost, it is unclear what he has to offer in exchange for American cooperation \u2014 other than collaboration in Syria and great sympathy for Mr. Trump\u2019s plight at the hands of what Russia refers to as the American \u201cdeep state,\u201d including the news media.In contrast, Mr. Putin will surely show up with finely honed talking points aimed at forging closer cooperation and reaffirming Russia\u2019s old Soviet role as the equal of the United States in umpiring global affairs.\u201cPutin will try to exploit that advantage,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, a prominent columnist who writes frequently on foreign policy. Mr. Putin has made it his mission to curb what he considers the dangerous impulse of all American presidents, including Mr. Trump, to interfere globally without consulting other powers.Some in the United States, and in the West in general, view Mr. Putin with new distrust given the sense that Russia has abandoned cooperation in favor of actively working to undermine Western alliances and open, democratic systems.Yet, Mr. Trump has shown little stomach for condemning Russia, and both presidents will most likely want to avoid as much as possible the topic of Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election.The Kremlin is aware that Trump critics will be watching for further signs that the American leader is soft on Russia. \u201cTrump is being accused of cooperating with Russia, so if he makes any concessions to Moscow, these accusations will gain strength,\u201d said Aleksei Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.The Kremlin has watched, chagrined, as the Trump administration has rolled back various positions stated during the campaign \u2014 his questioning of the viability of NATO, for example, or his expressions of sympathy for the Russian position on Crimea.\u201cThe Kremlin is astonished that the president cannot behave like a real president, like ours, so what can they do in this situation?\u201d Mr. Kolesnikov asked.Commentary in the official Russian news media suggested that Moscow was baffled by the lack of a confirmed agenda, while various senior officials and the Kremlin press service have listed possible talking points that cover virtually every major international issue.Syria, where there has already been a measure of uneasy military coordination, is of \u201cparticular importance,\u201d according to the Kremlin list.Cooperation from Washington on Russia\u2019s plan to create \u201cdeconfliction zones\u201d inside Syria would go a long way toward reviving Russia\u2019s role as a key power in the Middle East. While both leaders have expressed an interest in working together on counterterrorism, the United States still wants to see President Bashar al-Assad step down.Another main item on the Russian agenda will be what it lumps together as \u201cstrategic stability,\u201d including nuclear weapons. Russia wants the United States to remove the new missile defense shield based in Romania and Poland. In return, analysts said, Mr. Putin might respond to accusations about a new Russian missile that the United States says violates the historic 1987 treaty on limiting intermediate-range nuclear weapons.The Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.Economic sanctions applied after the Ukraine crisis could come up, since Russia is struggling to revive its economy in the face of low oil prices and an uneven investment climate. In terms of Ukraine itself, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, said on Wednesday that the meeting would be too short to discuss Ukraine with the needed detail.On Tuesday, Russia and China announced a joint effort to address the North Korea crisis, with the first step an agreement by the United States and South Korea to freeze military maneuvers in exchange for Pyongyang\u2019s freezing its nuclear missile program. Mr. Putin is deemed likely to seek Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of the deal.Russia has also been publicly grinding its teeth over the loss of its two American diplomatic dachas, a penalty imposed by the Obama administration for Russia\u2019s election meddling.In the absence of any clearly achievable goal, Moscow has been playing down expectations, with the state news media saying just an agreement to meet again would be good enough. Yuri Ushakov, the presidential foreign policy adviser, told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cfirst contact is very important.\u201dAside from four telephone calls between the two presidents since Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, there have been minimal talks between the two governments.Ultimately, a lot will ride on the chemistry between the two men, and much like any elements mingling in the same test tube for the first time, the reaction is unpredictable.In the best case for the Kremlin, the two will get along swimmingly: Mr. Trump will be as admiring of Mr. Putin in the flesh as he was on the campaign trail, and he will emerge to treat Russia as his new best friend.There is also the outside chance of a train wreck, with one of the prickly men somehow insulting the other and pushing already bad relations off the rails, hardening differences and prompting Twitter salvos. (Mr. Putin doesn\u2019t tweet but his bots do.)The Kremlin is betting on the positive, hoping that personal chemistry can slice through the problems. \u201cThey hope to sway the policy deliberations with direct contact,\u201d said Mr. Frolov, the columnist.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re the leader of a slow-moving pack.\u201dThe 2.6 percent expansion rate last quarter should assuage fears stirred by the economy\u2019s near stall in January, February and March, when gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent.But the expansion camouflages some more profound shifts just under the economy\u2019s surface.Sectors like technology, health care and banking are thriving, even as industries like retail shed jobs.The stock market has also been soaring and the housing market is similarly robust in many parts of the country, especially in coastal areas like New York, Washington, San Francisco and Boston.Another bright spot lately has been the dollar\u2019s decline against other currencies, especially the euro, which makes American exports more competitive overseas.This week, the government also reported positive figures on orders for durable goods in June and a slightly more favorable trade balance.The dollar\u2019s softness benefits American companies with sales abroad, as those foreign revenues are translated into dollars.Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago, cited impressive earnings reports from McDonald\u2019s and Caterpillar recently, and said currency gains should serve as a tailwind for corporate profits later this year. The dollar has declined as other economies, especially those in Europe, have been showing signs of life, even as expectations for the American economy have cooled this year.\u201cAt most we are expecting a slight cut in corporate tax rates next year, not big cuts,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the kind of sweeping reform we need.\u201d\u201cThe infighting both within the White House and both political parties exceeds the partisan gridlock we\u2019ve become accustomed to,\u201d she added. \u201cInfrastructure spending seems to have fallen off the radar screen.\u201dIn the second half of the year, economists like Michael Gapen of Barclays are predicting growth will remain in a range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. \u201cThe economy remains in a modest growth path, and last quarter was driven by gains in household and business spending,\u201d Mr. Gapen said.\u201cThe surprise came in the area of trade, where it looks like solid growth outside the U.S. and a weaker dollar boosted exports,\u201d Mr. Gapen added. \u201cThis is a turnaround from last year, when a stronger dollar was a drag on growth.\u201dThe figure released on Friday is the first of three estimates that the Commerce Department will provide on growth in April, May and June. The final number could be revised higher or lower, depending on factors like consumer spending, business investment, factory orders and imports and exports.The last time annual economic growth topped 4 percent was in 2000, at the end of the tech-fueled boom of the late-1990s. Since then, the American economy\u2019s best annual performance was in 2005, just before the bursting of the housing bubble, when annual growth was 3.3 percent.\u201cWe could grow slightly faster than we are now, if you had comprehensive tax reform and a 10-year infrastructure spending program,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cThat could get us to 2.5 percent growth per year or slightly better. But 4 percent is highly unlikely.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Swarms of workers exhaustedly change shifts while the noises, smells and refuse of industry march on. In places like south Chicago\u2019s Pullman neighborhood, this was the reality of U.S. manufacturing less than a century ago.Today, things have changed.

These efforts not only contribute to a cleaner environment, they are also boosting the bottom line for companies by reducing costs and building customer loyalty. Reflecting this change, the nonprofit organization B Lab has now certified more than 2,000 companies worldwide as B Corps that meet exacting standards for environmental, social and other measures of sustainability.Maximizing the impact of sustainable manufacturing requires a multipronged approach. A factory should do more than just have a light footprint, says David Fannon, architecture professor and sustainable design expert at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cSustainability [alone] is probably not sufficient.

By developing a range of operations that benefit not only the company but also the environment, workers and customers, Method\u2019s Soapbox is helping lead the movement for sustainable manufacturing. Method is among the first companies to receive a B Corp certification, and it has also reincorporated itself as a benefit corporation. Such companies count goals for social, workforce and environmental benefit along with profit among their legal obligations. For Method, these principles were part of the company\u2019s culture from its founding in 2001, when high school buddies Eric Ryan and Adam Lowry took on an entrenched industry with the bold idea that cleaning products should be good for the home and the environment.The Greenhouse / Gotham GreensThe farm atop the Method factory \u2014 owned and operated by partner Gotham Greens \u2014 is a green oasis in what is otherwise a food desert in this industrial neighborhood. Inside, urban farmers pick leafy greens and herbs for local consumers, who receive them only a day after harvest. Hydroponics and a computer-controlled climate enable farmers to grow as much food in a rooftop acre and a half as nearly 50 acres on a conventional farm \u2014 without pesticides or herbicides and using a tenth of the water.Community / WorkforceThe partners involved in building the factory chose the Pullman district of Chicago because of community input. Not only does the factory honor a rich history of community-based manufacturing in Pullman, but its managers also give preference to residents when hiring \u2014 even those without prior manufacturing experience. The result is a factory that supports the community as well as a workforce that is uniquely motivated and empowered to help foster the innovations that a small company like Method needs to compete against larger competitors.WaterTo offset water use by the factory \u2014 which ships water out of the Great Lakes region with every bottle of soap \u2014 Method turned to The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy, with funding from Method, works with farmers in the region to use less water with practices such as no-till agriculture and the use of cover crops to shelter the land in winter. Besides offsetting the water used by the factory, these techniques have the added benefit of cutting costs for farmers and reducing soil erosion, thus helping to preserve the fertility of their land.EnergyThe Method South Side Soapbox factory\u2019s 230-foot, 600-kilowatt wind turbine \u2014 refurbished and thus recycled after first seeing service in Europe \u2014 generates about a third of the power the factory uses. Two separate solar energy systems further supplement the factory\u2019s energy needs. A solar heating system supplies the cafeteria and employee showers with hot water. Three solar arrays \u2014 each on a movable stalk \u2014 serve the dual function of shading cars in the parking lot and generating electricity, tracking the sun as it moves across the sky for maximum efficiency.LandscapeMethod has developed only three and a half acres of its 22-acre building site for its soap factory. The remainder has been replanted with native prairie grasses, reclaiming this formerly contaminated and unloved site for nature as well as for industry and turning it into a place of beauty. A lack of fences and a meandering pathway enable neighbors to enjoy the grounds as they walk through \u2014 or, in the case of one community group, tend to beehives. Because most of the factory\u2019s workers live nearby, they can bike or walk to work, taking advantage of onsite showers to freshen up when they arrive.The farm atop the Method factory \u2014 owned and operated by partner Gotham Greens \u2014 is a green oasis in what is otherwise a food desert in this industrial neighborhood.

Because most of the factory\u2019s workers live nearby, they can bike or walk to work, taking advantage of onsite showers to freshen up when they arrive.Method is just one of many companies turning toward smarter, cleaner manufacturing. In a 2014 survey conducted by management consultancy McKinsey & Company, 43 percent of CEOs said that their companies had made sustainability a major focus for their businesses \u2014 up 30 percent from a 2012 survey.Today, companies are going beyond just sustainability, placing eco-friendly operations at the core of their businesses.In their 2002 book, \u201cCradle to Cradle,\u201d architect William McDonough and industrial chemist Michael Braungart put forth a vision for industry to benefit people and the natural world as well as generate profits. It was time, they said, to move to a new paradigm of sustainability they call eco-effectiveness.McDonough says that the purpose of commerce should be to create positives rather than negatives. Instead of taking resources from surrounding communities, companies should strive to benefit the environment in which they operate. \u201cWhy would you privatize the benefit and socialize the damage?\u201d he asks.A key tenet of eco-effectiveness is not just to reuse and recycle products but to recover materials so they can be \u201cupcycled\u201d into new products with no loss of quality \u2014 much as Apple is doing with its \u201cRenew\u201d program. Rather than simply melt down metallic components into low-grade alloys that can\u2019t be used for new phones and other devices, the metals are recovered separately in their pure form and put back into new products.Similarly, Method\u2019s soap bottles are made from clear recycled plastic. By colocating bottle manufacturer Amcor in its factory, Method skips the time-consuming and energy-intensive step of shipping in empty bottles from a remote facility; instead it transforms recycled-plastic pellets into the bottles you see on store shelves. In just that one area of production, costs are reduced in multiple ways with no sacrifice to quality and with significant environmental benefits.The most sustainable approach also seeks to benefit the communities where manufacturing takes place, which often means factory employees themselves. \u201cSustainable factories give back to the community by creating steady jobs in urban communities while maintaining the quality of local air and water. This helps in increasing and/or strengthening the local middle class, who can live safely with their families nearby. It\u2019s a win for both company and community,\u201d says Ramon Sanchez, director of the sustainable technologies and health program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.A recent study found that worker morale was 55 percent higher in companies with strong sustainability programs. Ripple effects include greater employee loyalty, higher motivation and positive impacts on turnover and recruitment.When choosing a location for its factory, Method had a vision to stimulate a local economy and tap into a community of motivated workers. It incorporated features such as an abundance of natural light, recreational areas and a rooftop garden to contribute to mental well-being.The result is a workforce eager to learn and engage in the kind of creative problem solving that companies need to remain globally competitive, says Garry Embleton, vice president of operations and supply chain at Method. More and more, studies show that employees desire mission and purpose in their work lives.\u201cWhen you walk into this factory, you\u2019re contributing to something bigger,\u201d says Embleton.This new breed of manufacturing does more than lead to greener products and better communities \u2014 it also boosts the bottom line. In 2013, GE saved $300 million by significantly reducing its water use and gas emissions compared to its 2004 and 2006 baselines.Method\u2019s South Side Soapbox factory, the only Platinum LEED\u2013certified factory in its industry, is headed toward similar results, inspiring other companies to follow suit. The factory launched in January 2015 with a single assembly line, and it is already adding another to keep up with double-digit growth. At the same time, B Lab named Method as a 2016 Best for the World company. This year the company achieved a B Impact Assessment score of 146 out of a possible 200, putting it in the top 2 percent of B Corps.\u201cMethod\u2019s South Side Soapbox factory might represent the new normal for many small urban manufacturing corporations in the U.S.,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cThese companies use sustainability as a way to increase their competitiveness in the global markets.\u201dJust like those making goods, customers increasingly feel the need to be part of a broader movement contributing to greater customer retention and, ultimately, revenue.\u201cNew customers, particularly millennials, consider one of the main goals of any business is to improve society more than just generating profits,\u201d Sanchez says.It\u2019s all part of the virtuous cycle envisioned by companies defining what it means to manufacture sustainably: to benefit not just the manufacturer but also surrounding eco- and economic systems.At Method, McDonough says, it comes down to a feeling: \u201cThis factory is looking at the idea of being able to humbly experience the joy of working toward the good.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

I did everything I could,\u201d he said before Mr. Liu died. \u201cThings are pretty difficult right now. It\u2019s hard for me to get the kinds of responses I need.\u201dThese days, major Western governments struggle to get responses from China about prisoners and conditions in Tibet and Xinjiang. Many Western politicians have also become less willing to dwell on human rights problems when other issues \u2014 North Korea, trade and investment, terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity \u2014 fill their meetings with Chinese officials, said rights advocates and experts.A spokesman for Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, issued a statement that \u201cshe would like a signal of humanity for Liu Xiaobo and his family,\u201d while President Trump said nothing publicly about his case, leaving any comment to lower-ranking officials.Ms. Merkel\u2019s statement was a reflection of how the world order has shifted, with the United States under Mr. Trump departing from its traditional role as the most vocal advocate of human rights.Still, Mr. Kamm and others said the shift came many years before Mr. Trump entered the White House in January.Beijing issued video and still images of Mr. Liu in a hospital in northeast China, as if to say: We don\u2019t need lectures about how to take care of our prisoners. Beijing ignored advice from a German and an American cancer specialist who visited Mr. Liu, at its invitation, and who said he was well enough to travel for treatment.\u201cIf Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was able to win some freedom for half a month \u2014 or two weeks or four days or half a day \u2014 and could speak out after eight years of silence, that would be intolerable for the government,\u201d said Wu Yangwei, a writer who uses the pen name Ye Du and is a friend of Mr. Liu\u2019s. \u201cTen years ago, it might have been different, there might have been a little hope. But the political atmosphere has shifted.\u201dLobbying China over its harsh prison sentences for dissent and its other shackles on citizens\u2019 rights has never been an amicable conversation; progress has long been spotty. But Mr. Liu\u2019s case reflects how Western pressure on China\u2019s human rights problems has decreased, while Chinese leaders have become adept at using economic and diplomatic lures and threats to thwart it.The shifting geopolitics around China and the human rights issue also appeared to be reflected in the disjointed reaction to Mr. Liu\u2019s death from top officials of the United Nations, where China has moved to raise its prominence by increasing financial support and furnishing peacekeeping troops.But Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the secretary-general, was more circumspect. Asked for a comment, his spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, said Mr. Guterres was \u201cdeeply saddened,\u201d but he did not address the circumstances of Mr. Liu\u2019s death or the restrictions on Mr. Liu\u2019s wife. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything further to say at this point,\u201d Mr. Dujarric told reporters on Thursday.In 1989, Mr. Liu was detained for nearly two years after the Chinese government called him a \u201cblack hand\u201d who supported the student demonstrators who crowded Tiananmen Square before an armed crackdown. Back then, Communist Party leaders railed against Western-inspired subversion and imprisoned leading participants in the protests who hadn\u2019t fled.Yet China was more vulnerable to pressure, and sometimes made concessions.But since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and its economy took off, leaders in Beijing have become increasingly set against making concessions on human rights cases. That posture has reflected China\u2019s economic and diplomatic strength. But it has also reflected leaders\u2019 longstanding fears that, even with robust growth, broad public support and a powerful police apparatus, they are vulnerable to political foes.Mr. Kamm of the Dui Hua Foundation said he would continue to present lists of political prisoners to Chinese officials. Now he also plans to point out how the government\u2019s treatment of Mr. Liu hurt China\u2019s image, he said.\u201cI think they have taken an incredible hit on this,\u201d Mr. Kamm said. \u201cThere are five prisoners on my list tonight that I will use this to try to get out of prison into their loved ones\u2019 arms.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a news analysis article on Friday about how the issue of human rights has receded in Western diplomatic contacts with China misstated the year Xi Jinping became president of China. It was in 2013, not 2012. (He became general secretary of the Communist Party, effectively the country\u2019s leader, in 2012.)Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

For decades, there have been fitful negotiations between Washington and Brussels on trade liberalization, but they have always run up against the protectionism of France and some southern European states.Between Britain and America, there are few such problems.

{"Headline": "U.S. to Paris for $400? What Money Buys on the New Low-Cost Airlines", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayPerhaps you\u2019ve been intrigued by the affordable (and in some cases downright cheap) fares being dangled lately by low-cost, long-haul carriers like Norwegian, Level and XL Airways. Fleeting introductory fares for a handful of cities are one thing, but everyday fares in and out of major hubs are another.Let\u2019s take a look at what you can actually get, and when.In the fall, the list is slated to grow: Providence, R.I., to Guadeloupe (Oct. 29); Providence to Martinique (Oct. 30); Fort Lauderdale to Martinique (Oct. 30); Newark to Rome (Nov. 9); and Los Angeles to Rome (Nov. 11). Winter additions will include Oakland, Calif., to Rome (Feb. 6); and Newark to Paris (Feb. 28). Next year Norwegian will also add Chicago to London (March 25); Austin, Tex., to London (March 27); Oakland to Paris (April 10); and Boston to Paris (May 2).What can you book today? I ran some searches to find out, and to compare some of Norwegian\u2019s fares to other airlines.One recent search, from New York City to Paris, was for a departure on Oct. 6, returning on Oct. 15. A round-trip direct flight was about $561 with taxes and surcharges. That was cheaper than most flights on major carriers, including British Airways, Air France, Delta and United, which for those dates were offering economy tickets around $700 to $800. Great. Yet in this particular case, while the Norwegian fare was cheap, it wasn\u2019t the absolute cheapest because of a promotion from yet another low-cost carrier.When considering low-cost carriers, keep in mind that you\u2019re generally not buying much more than a seat. The Norwegian fares mentioned above, for instance, do not include a meal, seat selection or a checked bag. Level\u2019s fares have similar restrictions. XL\u2019s fares, surprisingly, include a meal and a checked bag.Level fares weren\u2019t available on many of the days I wanted to book, and the website was a bit wonky during recent flight searches. But in one successful session, I chose a flight to Barcelona from Los Angeles on Sunday, Sept. 7, with a return on the 14th. The site redirected me to Iberia, where several one-way fares were displayed.The cheapest fare in economy was a direct flight from Level: around $605. For a little more, $670, I could get a non-Level Iberia fare known as a Basic+ seat, which includes a checked bag and meals during the flight. (The fare was nonrefundable, but I could make changes for a fee.) And if I spent yet another $15, I could fly Optimal, which includes the Basic+ features as well as the ability to choose a particular seat. If you want to save, you\u2019ll have to resist the upsell.Now let\u2019s look at the return: The Level flight was direct (nice) for about $426. (The Basic+ fare was $491. The Optimal fare was $506.) Choosing the Level fares in both directions, the ticket was $1,029.72.I ran a search on Google Flights to compare that fare with some from other carriers. The Level price was the cheapest fare for a nonstop between Los Angeles and Barcelona. Actually, it was the only nonstop flight that turned up on those days. (Travelers willing to make a stop could have found round-trip fares for much less, like one on KLM for $723.)In some searches, comparing the same trip on Norwegian and Level was instructive. Consider a round-trip from Los Angeles to Barcelona, departing Oct. 8 and returning Oct. 15. The departure on Norwegian included one stop for about $258. The return was direct, for about $312. The total was $570, including taxes and surcharges.On Level, for the same trip, the departing flight was direct for about $295; however, there was no available Level return fare on that Sunday, Oct. 15. The return fare offered on the site was a Flexible fare for around $1,116 that included things such as a checked bag, meals, seat selection and ticket changes. That kicked the round-trip total up to $1,409.66.Bottom line?As with any low-cost option, there are trade-offs. You must weigh the ticket cost against other factors, like your physical comfort and peace of mind. Is a cheaper ticket worth not being able (or paying extra) to check a bag or have a meal during a flight? Is it worth being assigned a middle seat or one beside the bathroom? These are the sorts of questions to take into account when considering low-cost, long-haul carriers. At what price the far-flung vacation?Only you can answer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just How Far Can California Possibly Go on Climate?", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past decade, California has passed a sweeping set of climate laws to test a contentious theory: that it\u2019s possible to cut greenhouse gas emissions far beyond what any other state has done and still enjoy robust economic growth.So how will California pull this off?If California prevails, it could provide a model for other policy makers, even as President Trump scales back the federal government\u2019s efforts on climate change. The state may also develop new technologies that the rest of the world can use to cut emissions.And if California falters, or if the experiment proves too costly? \u201cOther states and countries will be watching that, too,\u201d Mr. Borenstein said.Second, the board envisioned the number of electric cars and other zero-emissions vehicles on California\u2019s roads rising to 4.2 million by 2030 from 250,000 today. Freight trucks would have to become more efficient or electrified, while cities would need to adopt far-reaching strategies to promote mass transit, biking and walking.So, as a complement to these efforts, Mr. Brown insisted on expanding another major program: cap and trade.In 2012, under a previous climate law signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Air Resources Board imposed a statewide ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions. It then distributed a fixed number of tradable pollution permits to power plants, refineries, factories and other large emitters.So far, California\u2019s initial cap has had a relatively minor effect on emissions, as other policies, like the renewable electricity mandate, have done most of the heavy lifting and businesses have had relatively little trouble staying under pollution limits.But as the cap keeps tightening, it\u2019s expected to have a sharper bite. The law Mr. Brown signed extends the program through 2030, and limits the ability of businesses to purchase cheap offsets to comply (by, for example, paying for tree-planting programs).Notably, the Air Resources Board must also now set a ceiling on permit prices \u2014 if they spike, regulators will flood the market with permits to prevent a political backlash. While no one is exactly sure how much California\u2019s climate policies will ultimately cost, this ceiling will set a limit on that price tag: If climate policy poses too severe a threat to economic growth, the state will prioritize growth.\u201cIf the cap-and-trade market melted down, that could be a real deterrent elsewhere,\u201d said Mr. Borenstein, the University of California professor. \u201cThe rest of the world is going to be watching closely.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to a category in the California Air Resources Board\u2019s proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions. One-third of the reductions would come from a variety of climate pollutants other than carbon dioxide, not just from methane.

{"Headline": "Hackers Find \u2018Ideal Testing Ground\u2019 for Attacks: Developing Countries", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The attack had the hallmarks of something researchers had dreaded for years: malicious software using artificial intelligence that could lead to a new digital arms race in which A.I.-driven defenses battled A.I.-driven offenses while humans watched from the sidelines.But what was not as widely predicted was that one of the earliest instances of that sort of malware was found in India, not in a sophisticated British banking system or a government network in the United States.Security researchers are increasingly looking in countries outside the West to discover the newest, most creative and potentially most dangerous types of cyberattacks being deployed.As developing economies rush to go online, they provide a fertile testing ground for hackers trying their skills in an environment where they can evade detection before deploying them against a company or state that has more advanced defenses.The cyberattack in India used malware that could learn as it was spreading, and altered its methods to stay in the system for as long as possible. Those were \u201cearly indicators\u201d of A.I., according to the cybersecurity company Darktrace. Essentially, the malware could figure out its surroundings and mimic the behavior of the system\u2019s users, though Darktrace said the firm had found the program before it could do any damage.\u201cIndia is a place where newer A.I. attacks might be seen for the first time, simply because it is an ideal testing ground for those sorts of attacks,\u201d said Nicole Eagan, the chief executive of Darktrace.At times, these attacks are simply targeting more susceptible victims. While companies in the United States will often employ half a dozen security firms\u2019 products as defensive measures, a similar company elsewhere may have just one line of defense \u2014 if any.In the case of attacks carried out by a nation-state, companies in the United States can hope to receive a warning or assistance from the federal government, while companies elsewhere will often be left to fend for themselves.That hackers managed to steal $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank generated headlines because of the size of the heist. But what interested cybersecurity experts was that attackers had taken advantage of a previously unexplored weakness in the bank\u2019s computers by undermining its accounts on Swift, the international money transfer system that banks use to move billions of dollars among themselves each day.The malware discovered by Darktrace researchers stopped short of being a full-fledged A.I.-driven piece of software. It did, however, learn while it was in the system, trying to copy the actions of the network in order to blend in.\u201cWhat was concerning was that this attack, once it got into the network, used A.I. techniques, like trying to learn the behaviors of employees on the network, to remain undetected for as long as possible,\u201d Ms. Eagan said. She said she saw a future in which countries raced against one another to hire people skilled in developing complex algorithms that could be used to run such malware.Ms. Eagan\u2019s company, which has headquarters in Cambridge, England, and San Francisco, has increasingly found hacking incidents in India since it expanded there.As other cybersecurity companies enter Southeast Asia, Africa and other parts of the world where they have not had much presence, they will continue to discover new types of malware being tested in those markets, said Allan Liska, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm based in Somerville, Mass.\u201cFor several years, Taiwan and South Korea have been proven testing grounds for some of the more advanced groups in China,\u201d Mr. Liska said. \u201cThose countries have high-speed internet, widespread internet penetration and not a lot of security infrastructure in place.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe see a pattern among the attackers. They test something, make improvements, and then six weeks later test again before launching it at their true targets.\u201dAs internet use has expanded in Africa, Mr. Liska said, his company has noticed an increase in so-called spear-phishing attacks in which hackers appear to be testing their skills in English- and French-speaking African countries. Spear phishing employs messages that appear innocuous but contain dangerous malware. They are one of the most popular forms of cyberattacks, though they largely depend on the attackers\u2019 ability to hone a message that can fool a victim into opening a link or attachment.He said that in the spear-phishing tests his company had found, attackers appeared to be testing their language, but did not include the actual malware in the link, what he described as the payload.\u201cThey save that payload for when they are going to actually launch their attack in whatever French- or English-speaking country they are after,\u201d Mr. Liska said.Countries across Southeast Asia and the Middle East that have come online over the last decade have been tempting targets for hackers, said Chris Rock, an Australian security researcher and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Kustodian.\u201cThey are a testing ground for different kinds of environments,\u201d he said. \u201cFor hackers, they can be low-hanging fruit.\u201dDoing tests in a country that presumably has fewer defenses is a double-edged sword, Mr. Rock said. On one hand, attackers can hone their skills. On the other hand, they risk being discovered. Once a cybersecurity firm has the signature of an attack, it can build defenses against it, and spread those defenses among its clients.Mr. Rock said that if one target \u201chas, actually, installed a good defense and you get caught, then you have wasted your time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Lula\u2019s Shadow, Brazil\u2019s Shipbuilders Struggle to Right Themselves", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNITER\u00d3I, Brazil \u2014 The city of Niter\u00f3i, near Rio de Janeiro, features an unusual landmark: two unfinished oil tankers emblazoned with the green and yellow of Brazil\u2019s state-run oil company, Petrobras.The giant vessels have lain beside the dock of the Mau\u00e1 shipyard for two years, a glaring monument to the country\u2019s economic woes and to ambitious policy-making gone wrong.Buoyed by rising energy prices, Brazil in 2003 set out to bolster its domestic shipbuilding sector by constructing all of the tankers, rigs and production platforms that Petrobras needed, creating tens of thousands of jobs in the process.But those plans, along with the broader economic strategy, have unraveled, undone by widespread graft, weak commodity prices and a na\u00efvet\u00e9 over what it takes to succeed in a highly competitive global industry.The shipbuilding industry is still dealing with the roller-coaster ride that was the \u201cLula\u201d era.In the late 1970s, when Brazil was still under a dictatorship, the country\u2019s shipyards employed almost 40,000 people, according to Sinaval, an industry association. It was bolstered by subsidies and protectionist deals that meant 40 percent of Brazil\u2019s international cargo was carried by ships built within the country.But after economic turbulence in the 1980s, maritime trade was liberalized, opening the industry to foreign competition. The shipbuilding industry fell into decline, and by the turn of the century, it employed just 2,000 workers.After Mr. da Silva was elected president in 2003, the left-wing leader immediately ordered Petrobras to build and source more of its materials at home. A few years later, Petrobras found vast oil reserves below a salt layer deep under the Atlantic seabed. Mr. da Silva proclaimed: \u201cGod is Brazilian.\u201dBuoyed by the policies and the discoveries, the country began building new shipyards and reopened others. Demand boomed.During this rapid expansion, the faults of the strategy started to show.\u201cThey set the bar very high and they went too fast,\u201d said Andreas Theophanatos, a regional director of Aqualis, an offshore services company. \u201cThey overheated the market, basically, and they promised things that were unrealistic.\u201dIn Niter\u00f3i, a city of half a million people just a half-hour drive from Rio, the Mau\u00e1 shipyard struggled with an order to build four ships for Petrobras. The energy company modified its design, pushing up the cost, said Ricardo Vanderlei, Mau\u00e1\u2019s chief executive.Despite the financial difficulties on the initial order, the shipyard in 2008 signed up to build more vessels, believing profit would eventually materialize. It did not. Mau\u00e1 delivered the first ship in the new contract, but Petrobras stopped paying for the rest, according to Mr. Vanderlei.Mau\u00e1 was left with the two unfinished vessels in the Niter\u00f3i harbor, as well as another half-built ship. Mr. Vanderlei described the pair that sit unfinished in Niter\u00f3i waters as \u201can embarrassment\u201d that between them cost nearly $200 million and are \u201cstuck in the Guanabara Bay, rotting.\u201dPetrobras\u2019s distribution arm said in an email that it had canceled 20 contracts, including the unfinished ships at Mau\u00e1 \u201cas a result of noncompliance with contract obligations.\u201d It did not comment further.Despite the experience of Mau\u00e1, Brazil\u2019s political leaders were unwavering, turning vessel launches into political rallies.In June 2011, Mr. da Silva\u2019s handpicked successor, President Dilma Rousseff, told thousands of cheering workers at the BrasFELS shipyard near Rio that Brazil had silenced the doubters, leaving no question that she would continue the industry efforts.\u201cYou today can look at all of this and say, \u2018We produced it. We were capable,\u2019\u201d she said.The orders kept coming in. By early 2014, Petrobras\u2019s $221 billion investment plan included building more than 100 production platforms, drilling rigs and oil tankers. In all, the country\u2019s shipyards were employing 82,000 workers.But many Brazilian shipyards soon started coming up against the same harsh truth as Mau\u00e1: Modern shipbuilding is a complex, highly technical and capital-intensive business.Asian yards had a decades-long head start, said Carlos Rocha, the director of costs and technology at the Rio offices of IHS, an international consulting firm. He said Brazilian shipyards were 20 percent to 55 percent more expensive than rivals in Japan, South Korea and China. Some Brazilian deliveries took three times as long.Asian yards benefited from cheaper financing and better economies of scale, because they often worked on multiple orders with more sophisticated supply chains. Compared with Brazilian competitors, their engineering was superior and their work forces more agile.The competitive pressures proved untenable after the shipbuilders were dealt the one-two punch of the corruption scandal and slumping oil prices.In March 2014, the police uncovered a graft scheme at Petrobras. The company had already been hemorrhaging money because Rousseff\u2019s government made it sell imported gasoline and diesel at a loss to control inflation.The scandal tainted the legacy of Mr. da Silva and helped force Ms. Rousseff from office. (Mr. da Silva\u2019s lawyers say the sentence amounts to political persecution. He has not yet been jailed, and intends to appeal.)Then the price of oil began falling, from a peak of over $100 per barrel to below $30. In 2015, Petrobras wrote off $2 billion over the corruption scandal, and stopped paying some suppliers.None of the 28 rigs it ordered from Brazilian yards were ever delivered \u2014 three lie unfinished at the shipyard where Ms. Rousseff spoke in 2011. In all, 52,000 shipyard workers have lost their jobs.Such a move could prove fatal for shipyards like Brasa, which is near Mau\u00e1 in Niter\u00f3i.The yard has just 400 workers left of the 7,000 it had hired. If no contract lands by the end of the year, it may close, said Marcus Cirio, Brasa\u2019s planning manager.\u201cThe future is not very promising,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very anxious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Choice: Follow the Postwar Order or Blow It Up", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIt seems President Trump is ready to start rolling back globalization. Let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t blow up the postwar economic order.A lot of this may look tame when set alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s fiery campaign speeches portraying trade as the bane of the American worker. He no longer calls for a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, nor does he threaten to walk away from Nafta.Despite his campaign promises to voters in industrial states eager for protectionism, some analysts suggested that Mr. Trump might ultimately be hemmed in by the standard pro-trade orthodoxy of the Republican Party.Might Mr. Trump hew to the rules overseen by the World Trade Organization even as he retreats from prior American commitments to global trade? Or will he eschew the multilateral framework in pursuit of a set of bilateral deals, turning his back on a long history of trade diplomacy?These days, quite a few economists show sympathy for the argument that some trade protection may be warranted to help workers in industries threatened by imports.Protectionism will not add to American jobs or raise wages, on the whole. At best it will shuffle jobs around \u2014 adding some in protected companies like steel makers and cutting some in industries that buy steel, like auto manufacturers. By making the economy less efficient, protectionism will also make the nation poorer as a whole.\u201cIt would be decreasing the size of the pie to increase the size of some slices,\u201d as David Autor, a top labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it to me once. \u201cWe have always done the opposite thing without making people whole.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, unanticipated shocks over the last quarter-century \u2014 when information technology swept through every industry and China emerged from nowhere to become the world\u2019s biggest exporter \u2014 might justify reconsidering market-access commitments made earlier. \u201cMaybe at the end of the day some trade responses are reasonable,\u201d said Robert W. Staiger, a trade economist from Dartmouth College.And yet even accepting that the United States may find it reasonable to retreat from trade somewhat, it is critical to figure out what this retreat might look like.The cocktail worked. Notably, the principle of nondiscrimination ensured that a given trading partner could not negotiate a tariff cut with the United States and then offer a more favorable deal to another country \u2014 undercutting the American competitive position. This broke through a logjam that had stymied previous attempts to liberalize international trade by encouraging countries to make only miserly offers.The problem is that these principles make for an ill fit with Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview, honed in the zero-sum sphere of real estate deal making where one party\u2019s win is the other\u2019s loss.In trade diplomacy, the objective is to arrive at an agreement that everybody can call a win. \u201cThe best way to have a trade commitment enforced is to make it mutually beneficial,\u201d Professor Staiger told me. \u201cIf we push to get the very best deal for the United States, we will push other countries to the point that they are indifferent.\u201dMr. Trump has railed against the fact that Germany\u2019s tariffs on imported cars from the United States are higher than American tariffs on German cars. \u201cReciprocal is, if you\u2019ve got a 30 percent tariff, you know what, we should have a 30 percent tariff,\u201d he told Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders of the Group of 7 most advanced nations in May, according to Gary D. Cohn, his chief economic adviser.This misunderstands the multiple trading of concessions that has guided trade liberalization over more than a half-century under the most-favored-nation rule, opening deals in which India offers something of value to Europe, in exchange for which Europe offers something of value to the United States and the United States offers something India likes.And this presents the risk to global trade: that Mr. Trump follows through on his talk of eliminating the nation\u2019s bilateral trade deficits through a series of one-to-one deals, abandoning the multilateral framework. This is not only pointless; in a market economy it is not possible. Trade agreements set the rules, but not the trade balance.Bilateral trade deficits are not losses. Bilateral surpluses are not gains. They say little about the overall strength or weakness of the economy. \u201cI have a deficit with my grocer and a surplus with my firm,\u201d said Carla A. Hills, the nation\u2019s trade representative during the Nafta negotiations under the administration of the first President George Bush. \u201cAs long as I run my economy properly, I stay above water.\u201dParadoxically, if Mr. Trump wants to reduce the American engagement with global trade, his best bet is to stay within the strictures of the multilateral trading system. The World Trade Organization, in fact, does not prevent the United States from raising tariffs unilaterally to protect a few industries and their workers. He does not have to convince any of the nation\u2019s trading partners.All he must accept is that the trading partners would be allowed \u2014 after negotiations \u2014 to retaliate proportionally by raising barriers against imports from the United States. \u201cThe system allows you to reset your commitments,\u201d Professor Staiger said. \u201cBut other countries are also allowed to react.\u201dNot unlike the guarantee of reciprocal benefits extended to all, the opportunity for retaliation merely ensures that the United States proportionally bears the costs as well as the benefits of its choices. Whether the ultimate objective is more trade or less, it seems like a sensible principle upon which to negotiate. And yet the big risk for the global trading system, and the postwar economic order, is that it is a cost that Mr. Trump will refuse to bear.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel, While Pivoting to Artificial Intelligence, Tries to Protect Lead", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe computers in modern data centers \u2014 the engine rooms of the digital economy \u2014 are powered mainly by Intel chips. They animate the computing clouds of the internet giants and corporate data centers worldwide.But Intel is now facing new competitive forces that could pose a challenge to its data-center dominance and profitability.In particular, the rise of artificial intelligence is creating demand for new computing hardware tailored to handle vast amounts of unruly data and complex machine-learning software \u2014 and Intel\u2019s general-purpose chips are not yet tuned for the most demanding tasks. Instead, specialized chips are delivering better performance on artificial intelligence programs that identify images, recognize speech and translate languages.How successful Intel\u2019s efforts prove to be will be crucial not only for the company but also for the long-term future of the computer chip industry.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more competition in the data-center market than we\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Linley Gwennap, a semiconductor expert who leads a technology research firm in Mountain View, Calif.Intel has long dominated the business for central processing chips that control industry-standard servers in data centers. Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, said the company controlled about 96 percent of such chips.Big Intel customers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also working on chip designs. AMD and ARM, which make central processing chips like Intel, are edging into the data-center market, too. IBM made its Power chip technology open source a few years ago, and Google and others are designing prototypes.To counter some of these trends, Intel is expected on Tuesday to provide details about the performance and uses of its new chips and its plans for the future. The company is set to formally introduce the next generation of its Xeon data-center microprocessors, code-named Skylake. And there will be a range of Xeon offerings with different numbers of processing cores, speeds, amounts of attached memory, and prices.Yet analysts said that would represent progress along Intel\u2019s current path rather than an embrace of new models of computing.Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein Research, said, \u201cThey\u2019re late to artificial intelligence.\u201dThe Nervana technology, Intel has said, is being folded into its product road map. A chip code-named Lake Crest is being tested and will be available to some customers this year.Lake Crest is tailored for A.I. programs called neural networks, which learn specific tasks by analyzing huge amounts of data. Feed millions of cat photos into a neural network and it can learn to recognize a cat \u2014 and later pick out cats by color and breed. The principle is the same for speech recognition and language translation.Intel has also said it is working to integrate Nervana technology into a future Xeon processor, code-named Knight\u2019s Crest.Intel\u2019s challenge, analysts said, is a classic one of adapting an extraordinarily successful business to a fundamental shift in the marketplace.As the dominant data-center chip maker, used by a wide array of customers with different needs, Intel has loaded more capabilities into its central processors. It has been an immensely profitable strategy: Intel had net income of $10.3 billion last year on revenue of $59.4 billion.Yet key customers increasingly want computing designs that parcel out work to a collection of specialized chips rather than have that work flow through the central processor. A central processor can be thought of as part brain, doing the logic processing, and part traffic cop, orchestrating the flow of data through the computer.The outlying, specialized chips are known in the industry as accelerators. They can do certain things, like data-driven A.I. tasks, faster than a central processor. Accelerators include graphics processors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (F.P.G.A.s).A more diverse set of chips does not mean the need for Intel\u2019s central processor disappears. The processor just does less of the work, becoming more of a traffic cop and less of a brain. If this happens, Intel\u2019s business becomes less profitable.Mr. Gwennap, the independent analyst, said, \u201cIntel has a very good read on data centers and what those customers want.\u201dStill, the question remains whether knowing what the customers want translates into giving them what they want, if that path presents a threat to Intel\u2019s business model and profit margins.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hotel Boom in SeaTac Is Unfettered by $15 Minimum Wage", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the higher minimum wage hasn\u2019t done that at all. The hotel industry is a prime example: Nine hotels are in development, which will increase the available rooms by 25 percent, to 7,000.SeaTac is home to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, now the ninth busiest in the nation, and a new light rail line links the airport to Seattle. Nearby are the corporate headquarters of Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks, Costco and Nordstrom, and Seattle\u2019s unemployment rate has been hovering around 3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Michael H. Mahoney, president of the Dallas-based development company Western International, said his company had not built anything in the Seattle area for more than 10 years, but it was drawn to SeaTac because some available property there bordered a lake and the light rail system had just been built. Business travelers can stay near the airport where it is a bit less expensive than in downtown Seattle, he said, \u201cand close to their flight home,\u201d but they still have easy access to downtown for meetings or entertainment.He said he considered the $15 minimum wage before deciding to go ahead with a 176-room Residence Inn by Marriott that is scheduled to open next spring, but it was not the determining factor. \u201cWe are competing for quality people seeking the best jobs, so would likely have been at that threshold anyway,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise\u201d about higher minimum wages, he said, but he decides whether to enter an area based on an overall favorable economic outlook. If the area is not doing well, \u201cwe\u2019re not going in there,\u201d he said, so wages are not generally a factor.Sylvia A. Allegretto, an economist and co-chairwoman of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, said she and her colleagues had studied 30 years of wage and employment data and found that higher minimum wages had not reduced employment.Higher pay, she said, often translates to lower employee turnover, as fewer employees leave to seek better-paying jobs. For employers, that means decreased costs for replacement hiring and training. Also, she said, the modestly higher prices that may result \u2014 for example in food concessions \u2014 are generally borne by customers.Josh Bivens, research director at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said low-income workers who receive pay increases are likely to spend that extra income, stimulating economic growth, an effect called \u201cmiddle-out economics.\u201d\u201cWage increases at the middle and bottom are recycled back into the economy as spending on restaurants, clothes, cars \u2014 all things that support employment in other sectors of the economy,\u201d Mr. Bivens said.Mr. Robinson, the SeaTac economic development director, said hoteliers had adapted to the ordinance, which requires any hotel with at least 100 rooms or 30 full-time employees to pay the $15 minimum wage. \u201cNobody eliminated rooms to get under it,\u201d he said.Steven Lou, whose company, Lou Development, is building a 132-room Hyatt House and a 237-room Hyatt Place in SeaTac, said he was not worried about the $15 minimum wage. In fact, he expected to pay even more to hotel employees.\u201cWe are willing to pay a good wage for stable, skilled employees,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter they are trained and have been with us a while, they will make more than $15 an hour.\u201dIf room prices go up a little to help pay for the higher wages, he said he thought the market could easily bear it.Taylor Kerns, investment analyst at the Corinthian Development Company, based near San Jose, Calif., said his company decided to increase the size of the Wingate hotel it was building in SeaTac to 157 rooms from 123 partly because of the higher minimum wage.\u201cWe\u2019re mostly a \u2018heads in beds\u2019 property,\u201d he said, meaning the hotel does not offer amenities like a full restaurant. \u201cSo the majority of our employees are housekeeping and security.\u201d They would typically be lower-wage employees, he said.Corinthian decided that increasing the number of hotel rooms would raise the property\u2019s revenue, but would not require many more employees to accommodate the extra guests. \u201cWe\u2019d gain in efficiency,\u201d Mr. Kerns said.He said the firm also decided to increase the room count because most of the available land in the area had been purchased. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be many new hotels for quite a while after these all go in,\u201d he said.Mr. Robinson said he advised other cities increasing minimum wages to \u201cengage the community, listen to concerns, be responsive as you can.\u201d Jobs, he said, \u201care important.\u201d He said he also works closely with developers to make the regulations work for the city and business interests.Yogi Hutsen, executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, said Cedarbrook Lodge in SeaTac was already planning to add 67 rooms to the 100 rooms already there when the higher minimum wage was approved. He said that revenue takes a harder hit in food and beverages than in lodging when wages go up because \u201cpeople are more likely to notice a price increase of a few dollars on a menu than on a room rate.\u201dHe said that it takes some time for businesses to adjust to higher wages and see \u201cwhat can be passed on and what the company has to absorb,\u201d but that his company was committed to fair compensation for its staff.He said he only wished that neighboring cities would follow SeaTac\u2019s lead and raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. \u201cWe\u2019re in a noncompetitive situation,\u201d he said, \u201cand it would be easier if everyone else was paying the exact same wages.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a hotel boom in SeaTac, Wash., misidentified the company that employs Yogi Hutsen, an executive in SeaTac. He is executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, not of Cedarbrook Lodge. (Cedarbrook Lodge is managed by Columbia Hospitality.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fading Trump Bump", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Thursday, I presented charts explaining that while President Trump has been dispatching self-congratulatory tweets about his economic stewardship, he has little to brag about, apart from the stock market. The economy continues to grow and add jobs at roughly the same rate it did under President Barack Obama.While Mr. Trump did get a post-election bump according to a number of metrics, that glow has faded. Trump voters appear to be increasingly frustrated with everything from the new administration\u2019s failure to enact significant legislation to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.This University of Michigan chart shows how consumer expectations jumped immediately after the election but have since dropped back to below where they were last November and close to recent lows.Declining confidence may be part of why retail sales growth has recently been slowing. As this chart shows, retail spending had been increasing steadily at 3.5 percent to 5 percent. Here again, President Trump may have gotten a post-election bump, but more recently, core retail sales growth has dropped to 2.6 percent, the lowest in more than three years.Other indicators, like the second-quarter forecast for gross domestic product, have been steadily revised downward because of the lack of progress on policy priorities and continued Washington dysfunction. This has dashed hopes for the 3 percent sustained growth rate promised by the Trump administration and contributed to growing concern among economists.Late last year, about 40 percent of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal thought the economy was more likely to underperform their growth forecasts. After the election, that percentage dropped to 25 percent. Now it is up to 57 percent, the highest since before November of last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House and G.O.P. Leaders Reach Deal on Principles of Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After six months of deliberations and occasional quarreling, the top Republican tax negotiators in Congress and the Trump administration declared on Thursday that they had united behind a set of common principles that would guide them as they rush to complete the first overhaul of the tax code in three decades \u2014 and that they would do it by the end of this year.The five-paragraph joint statement in many respects raised more questions than it answered, providing fewer specifics than the previous plans released by House Republicans and President Trump. The lack of detail highlighted the challenge that Republicans face as they try to make difficult trade-offs on legislation that could reshape the entire economy.But the long-awaited sign of progress may help generate momentum behind the Republicans\u2019 agenda as their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act remains unfulfilled and as infighting plagues the White House.The most notable development was the jettisoning of the proposed border adjustment tax on imports. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, had suggested the tax a year ago as a central plank of the plan, arguing that it would accelerate economic growth and protect American manufacturers. But the idea drew the ire of retailers, energy companies and the billionaire Koch brothers, who invested heavily to undermine it. Mr. Trump was cool to it from the beginning, and many Republicans in the House and the Senate began voicing concerns in recent months.To the glee of border tax skeptics, on Thursday the provision officially died.\u201cWe are now confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the U.S. tax base,\u201d the negotiators said in the statement, acknowledging that there were too many \u201cunknowns\u201d associated with the idea.The so-called big six \u2014 Mr. Ryan; Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Senate Finance Committee chairman; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the National Economic Council director \u2014 huddled on Wednesday evening to hash out differences ahead of the August recess.Republicans appear poised to heed the lessons from their health care legislation efforts and use a more conventional process to get a tax bill drafted. Policy staff members for the House Ways and Means Committee and for the Senate Finance Committee are expected to work through August to write the tax legislation. Mr. Trump is expected to spend time next month barnstorming the country to make the case for the tax overhaul.How the legislation will actually look remains unclear. The statement on Thursday said Republican leaders were prioritizing permanent changes that would reduce tax rates for all American businesses, encourage companies to bring back cash parked abroad and allow \u201cunprecedented\u201d capital expensing, or write-offs of big investments.\u201cAbove all, the mission of the committees is to protect American jobs and make taxes simpler, fairer and lower for hard-working American families,\u201d they wrote.No major changes have been made to the tax code since 1986, and Republicans face big obstacles as they try to reach their goal of passing a bill in 2017. Delays in passing health care legislation laid bare the deep divisions within the Republican Party and suggested that sweeping changes to tax laws \u2014 which are generally considered even more complicated than health care policy \u2014 could take even longer and drag into next year.Republicans in Congress must also finish or abandon their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, raise the debt ceiling and pass a budget resolution before they can expect to fully dig in to a tax bill.The fate of the border adjustment tax underscored how difficult it would be to make other big changes to the tax code. Armies of lobbyists have been trawling Washington, preparing to fight for and against various provisions. The taxation of small businesses, deductions for corporate interest expenses and the state and local tax deduction are expected to lead to the biggest battles. And no guidance was offered on these fronts on Thursday.To avoid getting bogged down, some Republicans have said that the party should simply push through short-term tax cuts, even if they would add to deficits and expire in 10 years. So far, however, Republican leaders remain committed to a deficit-neutral tax plan that would not reduce tax revenue.Wall Street and business groups have grown increasingly impatient that the centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda is stalling. The statement of progress was welcomed as a sign of hope that something might get done.\u201cThe engagement and enthusiasm for pro-growth tax reform from Trump administration officials and congressional lawmakers is what will propel this over the finish line,\u201d said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The demise of the border tax, which would have taxed imports and let exports go untaxed, also came as a relief to retailers, who have said for months that it would cripple an industry. On Thursday, they cheered the development.\u201cIt\u2019s an important win for retailers and American families,\u201d said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. \u201cIt allows us to pivot to working with lawmakers to getting tax reform done.\u201dAmerican exporters expressed hope that they would still benefit from a tax overhaul. \u201cFrom the beginning, we have pushed for significantly lower corporate tax rates, permanent reforms that give businesses the certainty they need to invest here in the U.S., and a territorial tax system that levels the playing field for American companies competing abroad,\u201d said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the American Made Coalition.Democrats scoffed at the latest Republican outline as another vague set of ideas that would benefit the rich. \u201cRepublicans are dripping tax ideas out like a leaky faucet with no specifics to back them up,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. He urged Republicans to work with his party in a bipartisan manner.Despite claims that they are open to working with Democrats, it was clear on Thursday that such overtures from Republicans were halfhearted.Mr. Brady said that lawmakers from the House and Senate tax-writing committees would convene next month at the Ronald Reagan Ranch in California, where they would contemplate the tax code and seek inspiration to conquer the big legislative task that awaits. Mr. Brady plans to give a speech at the event, which is still in the planning stages.Asked if Democrats would be coming along, Mr. Brady did not hesitate.\"No,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Gamble on Fast-Track Rules for Health Care Hits Wall", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the economy stagnating and Congress bridling at President Richard Nixon\u2019s heavy-handed spending controls, lawmakers in 1974 created a fast-track procedure to help make the tough decisions on rising budget deficits and swelling entitlement spending.Since then, that process \u2014 called reconciliation \u2014 has been warped for many purposes, including large tax cuts, but never has it been used for the kind of complex policy making that Republicans are trying to do now with health care. And it is showing.One by one, key provisions and large blocks of text may be stripped from the Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act because the budget rules being used to pass the legislation are for budget matters \u2014 spending and taxation \u2014 not policy.If the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, finds that a provision is primarily about policy, not about the way the government spends and taxes, she has shown no reluctance to say that the Senate must produce 60 votes to overcome those objections. And as she applies Senate rules, the health bill\u2019s delicate balance has begun to break apart, bit by bit.If in the end, the Senate cannot pass a bill \u2014 or can pass only a modest set of tweaks to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 it could come down to this: Republican leaders used a budget process never meant for such a purpose.\u201cWe are dealing with one-sixth of the economy,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who has worked on many budget blueprints. \u201cWe are dealing with something that impacts the lives of millions of Americans. It\u2019s a totally inappropriate use of the budget reconciliation process.\u201dKey provisions on abortion and Planned Parenthood funding and efforts to persuade people to maintain insurance coverage could also slip away because they violate the rules that Republicans chose to operate under.The expedited procedures were first used in 1980. Since then, Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed.\u201cReconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget,\u201d the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has said.Democrats used the reconciliation process to adopt a very small piece of \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 in a separate bill enacted one week after President Barack Obama signed the original 905-page measure in March 2010.\u201cReconciliation has never, ever been abused to the extent that it is today,\u201d Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, then the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, said at the time. The goal of the fast-track procedure, he said then, was \u201cto control the government, not expand it.\u201dTo be sure, Democrats used procedural shortcuts to clean up the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But those changes are dwarfed by the repeal bill being debated in the Senate this week and by the one passed by the House in May.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says those bills would erase the gains in insurance coverage made in the seven years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted.The Senate parliamentarian has challenged at least 11 provisions of the Republican health care bill, including one that would prevent consumers from using tax credits to help pay for insurance that includes coverage for abortions.And so far, Republicans have not pushed back. Ms. MacDonough grew up in the Washington area and graduated from George Washington University. She knows the guts of the Senate firsthand. She served as a legislative reference assistant in the Senate Library and as an assistant executive clerk for the Senate, keeping track of treaties and nominations. She was also an assistant editor of the Congressional Record.Seeking wider opportunities, she obtained a law degree from Vermont Law School in 1998.She worked for the Justice Department, then took a job as an assistant Senate parliamentarian in 1999 and became the first woman to head the office in 2012.J. Keith Kennedy, who worked for Republican senators for 28 years, said: \u201cElizabeth diligently worked her way up through the ranks. She\u2019s a very smart woman, has a wonderful sense of humor, enjoys life.\u201dBeing caught in the political crossfire between Republicans and Democrats is an occupational hazard that Ms. MacDonough has so far managed to avoid.\u201cShe is performing a very important institutional duty, is under enormous pressure and is handling it very well,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.Muftiah M. McCartin, who worked in the office of the House parliamentarian from 1976 to 2005, said Ms. MacDonough \u201cis stellar, 100 percent professional.\u201dUnder the procedure that Republicans are using to speed passage of their health care bill, senators can object to a provision if its budgetary effects are \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to some policy goal.There was talk in recent days that Republicans could try to overturn key decisions of the parliamentarian, through a strong-armed majority vote \u2014 the same way Senate Democrats ended the filibuster for most judges and presidential appointees, and Republicans then ended it for Supreme Court justices.But at least for now, Ms. MacDonough\u2019s judgments have not been overturned or overruled.The \u201cmerely incidental\u201d test \u201cis inherently subjective,\u201d Ms. McCartin said. \u201cBut Elizabeth has fidelity to Senate precedents and to advice given over the years by the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s office.

{"Headline": "World Leaders Move Forward on Climate Change, Without U.S.", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 World leaders struck a compromise on Saturday to move forward collectively on climate change without the United States, declaring the Paris accord \u201cirreversible\u201d while acknowledging President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the agreement.In a final communiqu\u00e9 at the conclusion of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, the nations took \u201cnote\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the pact and \u201cimmediately cease\u201d efforts to enact former President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge of curbing greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.But the other 19 members of the group broke explicitly with Mr. Trump in their embrace of the international deal, signing off on a detailed policy blueprint outlining how their countries could meet their goals in the pact.The statement and the adoption of the G20 Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth ended three days of intense negotiations over how to characterize the world\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, and it came as this year\u2019s meeting of major world economies here laid bare the stark divide between the United States and the rest.\u201cThis is a clear indication that the U.S. has isolated itself on climate change once again, and is falling back while all other major economies step up and compete in the clean energy marketplace created by the Paris Agreement estimated to be worth over 20 trillion dollars,\u201d said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under Mr. Obama.Differences between the United States and other nations on climate, trade and migration made for a tricky summit meeting, which unfolded amid large protests that sometimes turned violent, with several injured and demonstrators setting fire to cars and looting in the streets of the German city.\u201cNothing\u2019s easy,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the gathering on Saturday as he complimented its host, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has toiled to bridge the gap between the United States and other nations, for handling the challenge \u201cso professionally.\u201dHours later, at the start of a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Trump vowed to confront the threat posed by North Korea \u201cone way or the other,\u201d and said he appreciated the Chinese leader\u2019s efforts to respond to Pyongyang\u2019s latest provocations.\u201cIt may take longer than I\u2019d like, it may take longer that you\u2019d like, but there will be success in the end, one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSomething has to be done about it.\u201dAs he sought to build a consensus among Asian leaders about how best to deal with North Korea, Mr. Trump also held a separate meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The two leaders were tackling \u201cthe problem and menace of North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The wording on climate change in the communiqu\u00e9 represented a victory for Ms. Merkel, who played a major role in forging compromise language after France raised objections.In most other respects, though, the summit meeting had to be a bitter disappointment for the chancellor. When the meeting was first planned for Hamburg, Ms. Merkel\u2019s birthplace, she would have reasonably expected Hillary Clinton, a likely political partner, to be the American president, and she had expected the event to be a strong part of her re-election campaign for a fourth term, with voting in September.It has also been about efforts by most of the rest of the world to cajole the American president into softening his stances on global trade and the climate, with Ms. Merkel in a secondary role, trying to come up with compromises.Her standing has also suffered as Germans have been shocked by violent protests by a small bloc of anarchists who saw the G-20 as a perfect platform for their rejection of capitalism and order.The atmosphere around Hamburg has been that of an armed camp, hardly welcoming, with 20,000 police officers asking for further reinforcements to try to protect the various leaders. So far, 213 police officers have been injured, and 43 people have been arrested and 96 more detained.Ms. Merkel expressly backed the 100,000 or so peaceful demonstrators who massed here in recent days and were marching on Saturday. She may have been hoping to show authoritarian leaders like Mr. Putin and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, how to tolerate protests in a democracy. If so, she and the security forces failed, losing control in parts of the city. Ms. Merkel was born in Hamburg in 1954, weeks before her parents moved east to Communist Germany.This was always going to be risky for Ms. Merkel, and Mr. Trump\u2019s presence only intensified what were widely anticipated to be widespread and sometimes violent protests against globalization, even though Mr. Trump is a sharp critic of globalization.Whether the criticism of holding the summit meeting here will hurt Ms. Merkel in the September elections is not clear. Her popular conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared on national television on Friday strongly defending the decision. Only large cities like Hamburg, a picturesque Hanseatic port, have the infrastructure to host the thousands of leaders, delegates, journalists and lobbyists who gather at a G-20 meeting, he said.And some diplomatic work was done at the meeting, even beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings and his hyperbolic praise \u2014 regardless of his private views \u2014 of every leader he meets, including Ms. Merkel. (\u201cYou have been amazing and you have done a fantastic job.\u201d)Working overnight, diplomats first agreed on a common text on trade, with a nod toward Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d demands for restrictions on unfair trade, but they had great difficulty on climate, with the Americans demanding a reference to the use of fossil fuels.President Emmanuel Macron of France said he would continue to press Mr. Trump on climate and would hold a follow-up summit meeting in Paris in December to move the Paris deal forward.The trade section in the statement the aides thrashed out read: \u201cWe will keep markets open noting the importance of reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade and investment frameworks and the principle of nondiscrimination, and continue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard.\u201dIn his meeting with China\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump said that \u201cmany things have happened that have led to trade imbalances\u201d and that he wanted a new arrangement that is \u201cequitable\u201d and \u201creciprocal.\u201dThe climate section is more of a dodge. It takes note of the American decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and says the other countries regard the deal as \u201cirreversible.\u201d Yet it subtly left open the possibility that the United States could someday come back into the pact, specifying that the country is putting the brakes on its \u201ccurrent\u201d emissions pledge.It then nods toward fossil fuels, saying: \u201cThe United States of America states it will endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.\u201dMr. Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Saturday, trying to fortify her delicate political fortunes. He said that they had had \u201ctremendous talks\u201d on trade and were working on a \u201cvery powerful\u201d trade deal for a post-\u201cBrexit\u201d Britain that could be completed \u201cvery, very quickly.\u201dIt is not clear what Mr. Trump meant, since the two sides cannot sign such an agreement until after Britain leaves the European Union, in March 2019 at the soonest.Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington on Saturday night, also confirmed that he would eventually make a state visit to Britain, but the dates continue to be unclear.Also on Saturday, American officials said that Mr. Trump would order the State Department to redirect $50 million from its foreign-aid budget to a new international public-private partnership to aid midsize businesses run by women, a group that his daughter Ivanka Trump helped create.The partnership aims to \u201chelp women in developing countries gain increased access to the finance, markets and networks necessary to start and grow a business,\u201d a spokesman for Ms. Trump said.The contribution comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s administration weighs a drastic scaling-back of foreign aid as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign pledge to target federal funding to create jobs at home.His budget, released in April but largely ignored on Capitol Hill, would include deep cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, a major conduit for foreign assistance.Steven Erlanger, Alison Smale and Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Hamburg, and Lisa Friedman from Washington.

{"Headline": "American Companies Still Make Aluminum. In Iceland.", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREYDARFJORDUR, Iceland \u2014 Where did the United States\u2019 aluminum smelters go?More than 30 of the giant factories once dotted the American landscape, sucking down huge amounts of electricity to produce the metal for car parts, beer cans and aluminum foil. Now there are just five smelters \u2014 all facing an uncertain future.But the jobs, for the most part, didn\u2019t go to China. American aluminum was in decline long before Chinese production began to grow. The more complicated truth is on display here, on Iceland\u2019s remote eastern shore.A generation ago, this hamlet was a herring town, a place where almost everyone made a living from the sea. Today, people work on the flats of the spectacular fjord, where America\u2019s largest aluminum company operates its newest smelter.Alcoa, formerly the Aluminum Company of America, and another American company, Century Aluminum, have opened factories like this in Iceland, and closed factories in the United States, for a simple reason: Electricity is much cheaper here.This year, tiny Iceland is on pace to make more aluminum than the United States. So are its fellow hydropower superpowers, Canada and Norway.This is precisely the kind of globalization that economists have long told us is beneficial. Iceland gets jobs. Alcoa shareholders get higher profits. Shoppers in the United States get lower prices.Of course, there is also a hefty cost: factories closed, jobs gone, communities torn apart. Voters infuriated by the loss of manufacturing jobs helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.But in a curious twist, the American aluminum industry and its workers are now hoping the last round of globalization will help the surviving companies compete against a new rival: China.The dull gray ingots are sometimes described as \u201cpackaged electricity.\u201dIceland\u2019s first smelter sits just south of Reykjavik, the capital city and dominant population center. The second, opened by Century in 1998, sits just to the north.Alcoa arrived in 2007 after Iceland built a giant power plant on the other side of the island, near a sparsely populated region where the fishing industry was in decline.Electricity in Iceland costs about 30 percent less than what Alcoa might pay in the United States. That\u2019s a crucial consideration, because the Alcoa smelter alone uses more than five million megawatt-hours of electricity each year \u2014 about the same as the half-million people and all the businesses in the city of Colorado Springs.Alcoa chose Reydarfjordur also because of its deepwater port, which the United States used as a military base during World War II. Lower shipping costs have played a key role in allowing smelters to be built in the far corners of the earth. It is more difficult to get here by land. The road from the nearest airport is sometimes closed during the winter months.The long smelting sheds are bound together by large, colorful pipes, and, because this is Scandinavia, the company held an architectural competition for the design of the administrative wing. The complex, where 450 people work in two shifts, is probably the largest in Iceland.Olafur Gunnarsson, 33, an Alcoa employee, was raised here. When he was a toddler, herring was king. But then he grew up, the fishing companies left, and nothing else came. He drove a truck, worked briefly at the post office, got a job at the grocery store \u2014 and quickly lost it because there weren\u2019t enough customers.\u201cThis place was going to be a ghost town,\u201d he said.Then Alcoa arrived, and with it, his first steady job. He has worked at the smelter for 10 years and has a 7-year-old daughter. \u201cThat was the best thing that happened to this town,\u201d he said. \u201cNew life and new people.\u201dSandra Thorbjornsdottir, originally from Reykjavik, moved here in 2010 to reopen an old inn, Taergesen, that had closed the previous year. She has prospered as the town has revived. In 2013, she added a second building of guest rooms. Last year, she bought another nearby hotel.And while Iceland is exporting aluminum to the world, she is importing all of her workers. At the moment, her three guesthouse waitresses are Polish, French and Spanish.The factory has also brought people back to their hometown. The population, which had fallen to about 600 from 1,100 by the early 2000s, had now rebounded completely.Thoney Kristin Sveinsdottir arrived in Reydarfjordur at 17, when her father took a job at the fish processing plant. She and her sister both left town as quickly as they could, but now they have both returned. She married a man who works at the factory, and her sister works in Alcoa\u2019s local office.\u201cIf the factory wasn\u2019t here, I wouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Alcoa saved this town.\u201dThis image of Icelandic prosperity, of course, has its negative in the American towns where Alcoa was once the dominant employer. Fewer than a quarter of its 14,000 workers are now based in the United States.Two dozen domestic smelters have completely or partly closed over the last quarter-century, erasing thousands of jobs and punching holes in communities in the Ohio River Valley and in the Pacific Northwest. American smelters were old and less efficient, and energy costs have increased. In Washington State, for example, competition from \u201cserver farms\u201d \u2014 mammoth buildings, stacked with computer servers, which also devour electricity \u2014 drove up the price of hydroelectric power.And in the former factory towns, what comes next is rarely as good. A natural gas power plant is planned for the riverside land in Hannibal, Ohio, where the Ormet Corporation operated a smelter until 2013. The smelter employed about 1,000. The power plant, roughly 20.Alcoa still operates two domestic smelters, but only because New York State is paying $73 million to maintain operations at the smelter in the upstate of town of Massena, on the Canadian border, until 2019. The United States still has plenty of companies that turn raw aluminum into parts or finished products. Last year, Alcoa spun this more profitable line of business into a separate company called Arconic. Among that company\u2019s products are the aluminum-clad panels that are blamed for accelerating the deadly fire in a London high-rise apartment building last month.Robert Smith, the head of the Steelworkers local at the Massena plant, said he recalled the exact moment he heard Alcoa was planning to pull out: He had just made the first payment on a new home. The state\u2019s intervention was a welcome reprieve, but he worries it won\u2019t last.\u201cIf we keep getting rid of our jobs and we don\u2019t make anything here, what kind of economy is that?\u201d Mr. Smith asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have jobs to buy stuff.\u201dThe industry has found a sympathetic audience in Mr. Trump, who has described the decline of domestic smelting as a \u201cdisaster\u201d caused by \u201cunfair foreign trade.\u201dBut the aluminum industry does not want to bring back the jobs that have moved to Canada and Iceland and other countries where American companies now have operations. The domestic industry is increasingly focused on turning aluminum into parts and products, a business that depends on the flow of trade. Bauxite may be mined and refined in Jamaica, shipped to northern Quebec for smelting, then hammered into car parts in Alcoa, Tenn.The industry argues that China is unfairly subsidizing its aluminum industry, allowing Chinese companies to undercut their foreign rivals. Only 10 percent of American aluminum imports last year came from China, but the industry argues that everyone is forced to compete against the Chinese prices \u2014 and Western companies are struggling to turn a profit.American aluminum companies are also nervous that China is just beginning to expand into the still profitable business of turning raw aluminum into finished products.But cheap Chinese aluminum means goods made from aluminum are cheaper, too. And companies that use aluminum warn that any trade restrictions would raise prices.\u201cThat, to me, is a legitimate national security issue,\u201d he said.The industry, in turn, argues that these niche businesses require a broader ecosystem. Heidi Brock, the chief executive of the Aluminum Association, said \u201ca commercially viable and sustainable industry\u201d was necessary to maintain specialized production.The administration has broad authority, under both domestic law and international trade agreements, to impose protectionist measures in the interest of the nation\u2019s security.Past administrations have judged that trade barriers are bad for the domestic economy: While some jobs may be lost, China\u2019s production of low-cost aluminum has also delivered broad benefits to the United States.Bemis, a Wisconsin company that makes packaging from imported aluminum foil, employs 9,000 workers in the United States. If the cost of foil goes up, \u201cthe result would be grave economic consequences to the domestic manufacturing facilities of Bemis, other packaging producers and our customers with no increase in defense security,\u201d said Steve J. Casey, the company\u2019s procurement director.The government of Iceland estimates that it has harnessed only about a quarter of the country\u2019s potential output of hydropower and geothermal energy. And all three of the aluminum companies have floated expansion plans in recent years.Iceland\u2019s ardor for aluminum smelters, however, may be cooling. One concern is that Iceland is not getting a fair deal. The price of electricity is about 30 percent lower in Iceland than in the United States, according to Askja Energy, a consultancy in Reykjavik. Critics argue that Iceland is leaving money on the table.\u201cThe root of all this was the government\u2019s determination to find a way to reduce the economy\u2019s dependence on the volatile fishing industry, and they thought that rolling out the red carpet, that was the way to do it,\u201d said Thorvaldur Gylfason, an economics professor at the University of Iceland. He said Iceland should take advantage of its natural resources, but there was no reason to go begging.A growing environmental movement, backed by local celebrities like Bjork, also opposes the expansion of heavy industry. The Alcoa smelter set off protests that led to the creation of a national park encompassing almost a fifth of the country.Petur Blondal, the managing director of the Icelandic Association of Aluminum Producers, said he did not expect the construction of any new smelters on the island. Instead, he said the domestic industry hoped to grow by making more advanced and valuable products from the raw aluminum \u2014 just like the United States.\u201cYou could say it is like the fishing industry,\u201d Mr. Blondal said. \u201cWe have learned to make things from every part of the fish, and now the fillet is the least valuable part.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beijing Wants A.I. to Be Made in China by 2030", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 If Beijing has its way, the future of artificial intelligence will be made in China.The country laid out a development plan on Thursday to become the world leader in A.I. by 2030, aiming to surpass its rivals technologically and build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion.Released by the State Council, the policy is a statement of intent from the top rungs of China\u2019s government: The world\u2019s second-largest economy will be investing heavily to ensure its companies, government and military leap to the front of the pack in a technology many think will one day form the basis of computing.The plan comes with China preparing a multibillion-dollar national investment initiative to support \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects, start-ups and academic research in A.I., according to two professors who consulted with the government about the effort.China\u2019s capabilities, especially in advanced and new technologies, have long lagged those of its better developed neighbors as well as Europe and America. But a multiple-decade industrial policy to help it catch up has paid dividends.Yet it was a foreign feat of A.I. prowess that provided one of the greatest impetuses for the new plan.As a sort of Sputnik moment for China, the professors said, the event paved the way for a new flow of funds into the discipline.China\u2019s ambitions with A.I. range from the anodyne to the dystopian, according to the new plan. It calls for support for everything from agriculture and medicine to manufacturing.Yet it also calls for the technology to work in concert with the country\u2019s homeland security and surveillance efforts. China wants to integrate A.I. into guided missiles, use it to track people on closed-circuit cameras, censor the internet and even predict crimes.In a timeline laid out within the new policy, the government expects its companies and research facilities to be at the same level as leading countries like the United States by 2020. Five years later, it calls for breakthroughs in select disciplines within A.I. that will become \u201ca key impetus for economic transformation.\u201dIn the final stage, by 2030, China will \u201cbecome the world\u2019s premier artificial intelligence innovation center,\u201d which in turn will \u201cfoster a new national leadership and establish the key fundamentals for an economic great power.\u201dWhile the language in Chinese industrial policy can sound stodgy and the targets overly ambitious, Beijing takes its economic planning seriously. Experts say that even if major spending efforts ultimately waste resources, they can also produce results, bolstering technology capabilities with a flood of resources.Top-level statements like this also work as a signal to local governments and companies across the country.The new plan formalizes a focus that was widely known in China. Following those cues, a large number of local governments have created special plans and built out research centers to focus on A.I.Many are spending hundreds of millions of dollars, but some have earmarked even more. In June, the government of Tianjin, an eastern city near Beijing, said it planned to set up a $5 billion fund to support the A.I. industry. It also set up an \u201cintelligence industry zone\u201d that will sit on more than 20 square kilometers of land.The initiative is also likely to sweep up private Chinese companies. The country\u2019s internet search giant Baidu, which has run an A.I. research center out of Silicon Valley in recent years, announced this year that it would open a new lab in cooperation with the government. The two leaders of that lab have worked on Chinese government programs with military applications.Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loss of Fertile Land Fuels \u2018Looming Crisis\u2019 Across Africa", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "Climate change, soil degradation and rising wealth are shrinking the amount of usable land in Africa. But the number of people who need it is rising fast.Supported byLAIKIPIA, Kenya \u2014 The two elders, wearing weather-beaten cowboy hats with the strings cinched under their chins, stood at the edge of an empty farm, covering their mouths in disbelief.Their homes \u2014 neat wooden cabins \u2014 had been smashed open. All their cattle had been stolen. So had their chickens. House after house stood vacant, without another soul around. It was as if some huge force had barreled into the village and swept away all the life.Sioyia Lesinko Lekisio, one of the elders, had no doubts who did this. Swarms of herders from another county had invaded, attacking any farm or cattle ranch in their path, big or small, stealing livestock, ransacking homes and shooting people with high-powered assault rifles.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want our land.\u201dKenya has a land problem. Africa itself has a land problem. The continent seems so vast and the land so open. The awesome sense of space is an inextricable part of the beauty here \u2014 the unadulterated vistas, the endless land. But in a way, that is an illusion.Population swells, climate change, soil degradation, erosion, poaching, global food prices and even the benefits of affluence are exerting incredible pressure on African land. They are fueling conflicts across the continent, from Nigeria in the west to Kenya in the east \u2014 including here in Laikipia, a wildlife haven and one of Kenya\u2019s most beautiful areas.Large groups of people are on the move, desperate for usable land. Data from NASA satellites reveals an overwhelming degradation of agricultural land throughout Africa, with one recent study showing that more than 40 million Africans are trying to survive off land whose agricultural potential is declining.At the same time, high birthrates and lengthening life spans mean that by the end of this century, there could be as many as four billion people on the continent, about 10 times the population 40 years ago.It is a two-headed problem, scientists and activists say, and it could be one of the gravest challenges Africa faces: The quality of farmland in many areas is getting worse, and the number of people squeezed onto that land is rising fast.\u201cIt\u2019s a looming crisis,\u201d said Odenda Lumumba, head of the Kenya Land Alliance, a group that works on land reform. \u201cWe are basically reaching the end of the road.\u201dMore than in any other region of the world, people in Africa live off the land. There are relatively few industrial or service jobs here. Seventy percent of Africa\u2019s population makes a living through agriculture, higher than on any other continent, the World Bank says.But as the population rises, with more siblings competing for their share of the family farm, the slices are getting thinner. In many parts of Africa, average farm size is just an acre or two, and after repeated divisions of the same property, some people are left trying to subsist on a sliver of a farm that is not much bigger than a tennis court.A changing climate makes things even harder. Scientists say large stretches of Africa are drying up, and they predict more desertification, more drought and more hunger. In a bad year, maybe one country in Africa will be hit by famine. This year, famine is stalking three, pushing more than 10 million people in Somalia, Nigeria and South Sudan to the brink of starvation.But much of Africa\u2019s farmland is in danger for another, perhaps simpler, reason: overuse. Fast-growing populations mean that many African families can\u2019t afford to let land sit fallow and replenish. They have to take every inch of their land and farm or graze it constantly. This steadily lowers the levels of organic matter in the soil, making it difficult to grow crops.In many areas, the soil is so dried out and exhausted that there is little solace even when the prayed-for rains finally come. The ground is as hard as concrete and the rain just splashes off, like a hose spraying a driveway.\u201cThere are going to be some serious food-security issues,\u201d said Zachary Donnenfeld, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. \u201cMore and more countries will be reliant on food imports. You\u2019ll increasingly see the international community come into more rescue-type situations.\u201dThe fact that several of Africa\u2019s biggest economies have grown impressively in the past 10 years may seem like an answer, but analysts say the newfound affluence may actually compound these pressures.As people gain wealth, they consume more \u2014 more energy, more water and usually more meat, all of which intensify the pressures on the environment. In Kenya, a piece of meat is one of the first things people treat themselves to when they get a little extra cash, and as the nation\u2019s economy grows, so does the taste for beef. Cows have always been a traditional form of wealth; now they\u2019re big business. In the past 15 years, the number of cows in Kenya has shot up by more than 60 percent to around 20 million, driving a scramble for grazing lands.Some parts of Kenya are now so overgrazed by cows and goats that all the grass roots have been eaten, leaving large stretches of bare earth, as measured by NASA satellite imagery that tracks net levels of carbon dioxide absorption. Herders from bare-earth zones in Kenya are often the ones invading ranches.Farmland is also rapidly vanishing into housing tracts and shopping centers to serve Africa\u2019s growing and more affluent population. This is happening everywhere: quiet fields\u2019 suddenly being transformed by an army of tractors into a set of neat houses or a colossal mall.But just about every acre set aside for a wildlife reserve takes an acre of potential farmland or grazing land off the table (some wildlife refuges tolerate grazing, but it often gets quickly out of control). Scientists say that there still is fertile unspoken-for land available in Africa, but that it tends to be deep in rain forests, like in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. And that raises another problem. Cutting down all those trees to make way for farms could have serious consequences for the climate of the entire earth, since rain forests soak up carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels.Laikipia County, a few hours\u2019 drive north of Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, is a microcosm of many of these complicated issues. On this one rugged plateau, poor herders, rich landowners, large- and small-scale farmers, commercial cattle ranchers, tour operators, passionate wildlife activists, elephants, lions, hyenas, cows, goats and zebras are all competing for the same space.People have always fought over territory, and Laikipia is no exception, with cattle-rustling and battles over pastureland part of its history. But many residents say this past year has been the bloodiest ever. At least 80 people have been killed, and the violence has not stopped. In mid-July, a large group of herders killed a half-dozen police officers and stole their weapons.One reason is political meddling connected to Kenya\u2019s national and local elections, scheduled for August. But the continentwide land issues seem to be emerging from the background into the foreground, which may explain why Laikipia is becoming more violent.\u201cThese ideas of land-abundant Africa are increasingly outdated,\u201d said Thomas Jayne, a leading agricultural economist based at Michigan State University. \u201cLand disputes are going to become more and more common, and more and more severe.\u201d\u201cLaikipia,\u201d said Dr. Jayne, who conducts research across the continent, \u201cis just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dKenya is one of Africa\u2019s most developed nations, with some of the best infrastructure and a fast-growing middle class. But as long as anyone can remember, Laikipia has been a bit lawless. Many farmers live on isolated properties and have been shot at by armed herdsmen. They\u2019ve had their livestock stolen. They\u2019ve ducked rocks and spears.One farmer said such attacks used to happen from time to time, especially to newcomers, and he called it Laikipia hazing. But this past year has been different. Waves of young pastoralists from neighboring counties, moving in groups armed with AK-47 assault rifles, have invaded dozens of farms and ranches, bringing tens of thousands of skinny, ragged cows from drought-stricken areas.Maria Dodds described an all-out assault on her family\u2019s cattle ranch in January and February. She said gunmen were so close to her house that she could see them raising their weapons and shooting at her. They shot to death one of her employees, Kariwo Lotome, an old cattleman who had been working for her for years.Nancy Nakalee, his widow, now penniless, stared at her feet as she spoke of her dead husband.\u201cI can still see his face,\u201d she whispered.As the ranch fell under siege, dozens of police officers arrived. When some began firing military-grade mortar rounds at the invaders from her garden, Ms. Dodds said, she found herself cheering them on.\u201cI was yelling, \u2018Shoot another, shoot another!\u201d\u2019 she said.She shook her head, laughing but also disgusted with herself. \u201cIt makes you rabid.\u201dIt is not clear how many herders were killed in the firefights. Ms. Dodds said the police were trying to \u201cwing them,\u201d and not actually hit them, because that would only exacerbate the situation.Her son now patrols the family ranch in a flak jacket and operates a new drone they bought for surveillance. The herders throw rocks at it.About an hour away from that ranch lies the small village of Nadungoru, the one where Mr. Lekisio stood on an empty farm in disbelief. It is a stunningly beautiful place of thick green grass, wide-open skies and little wooden cabins, which, on a recent day, stood empty. The invading herders had stolen all of Mr. Lekisio\u2019s cows and ransacked his house.\u201cWe feel bad, bad, bad, bad,\u201d he said.The Kenyan government has deployed hundreds of police officers and soldiers, some in bulletproof cars and Humvees, declaring parts of Laikipia \u201cdangerous and disturbed,\u201d which is like a local state of emergency that gives officers more power to crack down on invaders.But Laikipia\u2019s farmers say they\u2019ve never seen such timid men in uniform. So they sometimes confront the herders themselves.Tristan Voorspuy, a former British military officer, lived on a ranch that was invaded in March. The security forces were doing little to help him, so he rode on horseback to the young trespassers in hopes of asking them to leave.The men shot him in the face. They killed his horse, too.The next month, Kuki Gallmann, the Italian-born author of the best-selling book \u201cI Dreamed of Africa\u201d and one of Kenya\u2019s celebrities, was rumbling across her property, the Laikipia Nature Conservancy. At 88,000 acres, it is one of Kenya\u2019s biggest pieces of privately owned land. Ms. Gallmann, 74, has set aside the expanse for protecting wildlife like elephants, leopards, lions and buffaloes, as well as the rare species of trees and plants that thrive in the gorges and hillsides of her sculpted property.As she drove, with a contingent of armed wildlife rangers behind her, shots rang out. Several bullets flew threw Ms. Gallmann\u2019s car door and tore into her stomach. She remains at her Nairobi home, convalescing, with severe internal damage. She said many of the recent invaders came with no livestock, and she called them a militia.On another Laikipia ranch, Anne Powys, whose hands shook as she sat by a window, surrounded by old pictures and dusty books, said she could not count on anyone protecting her. So she has made a choice: She is trying to make peace with her attackers.She paid the same young men who had burned down her eco-lodge, which she said was part of her soul, to help clean it up.\u201cIsn\u2019t that insane?\u201d she said.A few months ago, a group of tourists staying at a fancy Laikipia lodge had to be airlifted to safety because heavy gunfights between the police and armed herders were coming closer and closer. On social media and in popular gathering spots, when some Kenyans talk about the crisis, one word keeps coming up: \u201cmzungu,\u201d which means \u201cforeigner\u201d or, more commonly, \u201cwhite man.\u201dSome Kenyans see Laikipia\u2019s land problems as a black-white issue because most of the biggest ranches and wildlife conservancies are owned by a handful of families of European descent. Kenyans have complained about the size of the white-owned farms, saying many were stolen or unfairly acquired from Africans during colonial times. Some people in Kenya, black and white, are now making comparisons to Zimbabwe, where the government seized land from wealthy whites and redistributed it, often to well-connected elites. In many cases, the farms were run into the ground.Trespassing pastoralists in Laikipia, who were brazenly grazing their herds on others\u2019 land, said they weren\u2019t necessarily targeting whites. Instead, they said they simply needed grass to keep their herds alive, because their own areas had already dried up.\u201cWe know taking another man\u2019s land is like taking his wife,\u201d said Parashuno Lekadero, a herder who stood on a farm in Laikipia that he had recently invaded. There were no police officers for miles, and he spoke confidently and openly, knowing he had little chance of getting in trouble.\u201cThere\u2019s a drought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have many animals. We need the land.\u201dMuch of eastern Africa is in the grip of an intense drought, with pasturelands drying up, and the white-owned properties in Laikipia tend to have the best grass. This is because the white farmers are relatively wealthy and have invested in their properties, building dams, creating watering holes, pumping from springs and caring for their paddocks. All that keeps the pastures healthy, attracting the invaders.But it\u2019s not like all of the 30 or so white-owned properties are luxurious. Warren Evans, a cattle rancher, lives in a low-slung house with farm machinery rusting on his lawn. The other day, as he sat down for a lunch of hot-dog stew, a muddy wart hog blasted through his living-room door and he jumped up to shoo it out.Mr. Evans said that his family was hardly at the top of Kenya\u2019s socioeconomic pyramid and that \u201cyou can\u2019t pin the burden of history on 30 farmers.\u201dSome white families now have second thoughts about staying.\u201cFor the first time ever, you get that vibe that you\u2019re a mzungu \u2014 what are you doing here?\u201d Ms. Powys said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit grandiose to think we can continue to live like this when thousands of people out there don\u2019t have any land.\u201d\u201cIt is Zimbabwe-esque,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re white people in a black country. If we\u2019re not welcome, what\u2019s the point?\u201dKenya is a democracy, but many describe it as more of an ethnocracy. Kenyans vote overwhelmingly along ethnic lines, and elections stir up ethnic tensions. Several elections have erupted in bloodshed, the worst in 2007 and early 2008, when more than 1,000 people were killed after government agents appeared to have rigged the votes and outrage exploded.Political violence here is fueled by a cocktail of factors, including ethnic grievances, tensions over land ownership, friction between the classes and the quest for power. Firearms in rural areas, especially in northern Kenya, not too far from the Somali border, make matters even worse.The Kenyan authorities say this dangerous mix is brewing in Laikipia. Several politicians have been arrested and questioned over inciting violence against landowners. Mathew Lempurkel, a member of Parliament representing a district here and a midtier figure in the country\u2019s leading opposition party, has been widely portrayed as the chief villain. Regarded as a brilliant mobilizer by even his detractors, he was arrested in March and again in July, accused of instigating herders to storm ranches. Several farmers said he provided the herders with cash, Red Bull and a cheap liquor called Trigger to rile them up.Some contend that Mr. Lempurkel is trying to displace people in Laikipia who are not members of his ethnic group, the Samburu, so that he can bring Samburu into his district and get more votes. Many of the invading herdsmen are young Samburu, and ecologists say that in recent decades, the group\u2019s land has been thoroughly overgrazed, driving the herders to new areas, whether others are already living there or not.Mr. Lempurkel, who declined to comment for this article, has publicly denied any role in the invasions, saying this was a problem of drought and climate change.But it seems there is some larger hand. Many fences have been dismantled with bolt cutters, not equipment the average herdsmen carries. And Ms. Dodds said that during the fighting on her ranch, a mysterious truck brought the herders tea, sugar and other supplies so they could extend their siege. The truck, she said, was later traced to a paramilitary police officer.Africa\u2019s land pressures may seem overwhelming, maybe even unstoppable. But scientists say there are solutions within reach. For example, the continent has the highest fertility rates in the world, but more African governments are pushing contraceptives, saying the best answer for densely populated countries is smaller families.For arid regions, there are proven ways to replenish dry or overgrazed land, including spreading new types of grass seeds by airplane. Another approach would be a national plan letting herders graze certain areas at certain times but forbidding them from others, which would allow ruined pastureland to regrow.But the issue, ecologists say, is that little of this is being done.\u201cThe problem is too many people, too many cattle and too little planning,\u201d said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a wildlife activist in northern Kenya.In the Nadungoru village, just about everybody has given up on the Kenyan government, even government employees.At a new school, two teachers from another part of the country said they had been begging their bosses to transfer them to a safer area.David Mbatia, one of the teachers, said he was afraid that the herdsmen who had invaded farms might kill him. The nearest police station was five miles away.\u201cAt night, what if they knock at your door and you scream?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho will come?\u201dHe said a big part of the problem was that the government was not enforcing a law requiring parents to send their children to school.\u201cI saw a 12-year-old herding cows, and he had been turned into a slave,\u201d said the other teacher, Charles Mwangi. \u201cHe has been denied the right to go to school, to see the light, and so he is uneducated, manipulated and brainwashed.\u201dOutside the school, Mr. Lekisio and his comrade were waiting. They slowly led me around the village one last time, pointing out each smashed padlock, each knocked-down fence. The village was eerily quiet; we were the only ones there.As we were finishing, Mr. Lekisio tilted his head.\u201cWe should go,\u201d he said.There was a pause in the wind, and in it, we could hear the faint tinkling of cowbells.\u201cThat\u2019s the Samburu,\u201d Mr. Lekisio said.The invaders weren\u2019t far away.Advertisement"}

As far as I\u2019m concerned, the only \u201clesson\u201d of Vietnam worth learning is that the United States should not attack foreign countries that pose no risk to our national security. Learning that lesson \u2014 and avoiding the \u201cwars of choice\u201d in which the United States is currently engaged in the Middle East \u2014 would have been the best possible tribute to the brave Americans who died in Hue and elsewhere in that now reunited and independent nation.\u2666To the Editor:In Inside the List (July 9) Gregory Cowles writes that the best-selling novels of Mary Alice Monroe, set in the South Carolina Lowcountry, \u201coften grapple with threats to the region\u2019s environment.\u201d On Dewees Island, Monroe tells Cowles, \u201cthere\u2019s been a 70 percent drop in the number of North American shorebirds since the 1970s.\u201d She adds: \u201cIf I\u2019m the canary in the coal mine, as I\u2019ve been called, I\u2019m singing loudly right now.\u201dBut Monroe has it backward. The coal-mine canary sang loudly when there was no risk or threat. Only when the little bird suddenly fell silent, asphyxiated by poisonous gases gathering near the ceiling of the shaft, did the miners know to flee for their own lives.\u2666To the Editor:Judging from James Kwak\u2019s review (July 9), Jesse Eisinger\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Chickenshit Club,\u201d calls welcome attention to federal prosecutors\u2019 highly questionable failures to seek prison terms for many \u201chighly paid bankers\u201d who \u201cwrecked the economy,\u201d throwing many workers out of their jobs and families out of their homes.Similarly, the Black Lives Matter movement is calling welcome attention to prosecutors\u2019 frequent failures to jail police officers who appear to have criminally killed unarmed blacks. As a former prosecutor, I often wonder, when a grand jury fails to indict or a trial jury fails to convict such an officer, whether the prosecutor proceeded with the vigor that the circumstances warranted.Such refusals by prosecutors to proceed diligently or at all contribute significantly to maintaining our two-tiered system of justice \u2014 one for the privileged and one for the rest. Sadly, this system is deeply entrenched. But books like Eisinger\u2019s and protests like Black Lives Matter, which expose the fiction that we have equal justice for all, may help to dislodge it \u2014 if it can be dislodged.The writer was a New York State special assistant attorney general assigned to the Attica special prosecutor\u2019s office in 1973-74. An updated edition of his 1985 book about Attica, now called \u201cThe Attica Turkey Shoot: Carnage, Cover-Up, and the Pursuit of Justice,\u201d was published in March.\u2666To the Editor:I realize that book reviews are essentially editorials on books, full of opinion, and they don\u2019t have to be balanced, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that means a reviewer should grossly misrepresent a book. I feel that happened in the recent review of my memoir, \u201cLove, Africa\u201d (July 9). It was as if the reviewer, Nadifa Mohamed, hunted through the pages looking for evidence of the broader point she was trying to make \u2014 that outsiders can\u2019t write sensitively about Africa \u2014 and she closed her eyes to anything that didn\u2019t fit this pursuit.Even the moment where I talk about ooga-booga, a degrading term about African stereotypes, was misunderstood. The first time I heard that term was in New York, from a New York Times editor; that point was meant to be a launching pad for a self-critical discussion on how Western journalists cover Africa. I agree that this is a juicy and necessary conversation. What other part of the world has been so laden with stereotypes about power and race as Africa? Is it even possible for an outsider to look at Africa, to see it as it really is, without eyes jaundiced by all that we have read and heard about it? Those last two lines are lifted straight from the book. They are never even hinted at in the review.The result is that the review is like a movie trailer that gives you no idea of what the movie is really about. I have been the longest-serving New York Times correspondent in East Africa and have invested a good chunk of my life reading about that region, traveling through it, thinking about it and writing about it. I feel the review missed the empathy and humanity that seems to have been obvious to many others, including people from Africa, who have read the book.Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "When Will Kabila Go? Congolese Leader Long Overstays His Welcome", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKINSHASA, the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 In Congo, they are calling it \u201cle glissement.\u201dThe deeply unpopular Mr. Kabila, 46, was supposed to step down last Dec. 20 at the end of his second term, as constitutionally mandated. But he refused, setting off a profound political and economic crisis whose resolution could turn chaotic and violent.\u201cThe president needs to go,\u201d Fiston Ntumba, 27, a motorcycle-taxi driver, said in Kinshasa, the capital. \u201cBy not going, he is seeking war. So we\u2019ve decided to go to war, too.\u201dAn implosion of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country almost the size of Western Europe, could spill into and involve some of the nine countries it borders. In the late 1990s, neighboring countries were sucked into what became known as the Great War of Africa, which resulted in several million deaths.A key figure in that conflict was Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, Mr. Kabila\u2019s father, who seized power in 1997. The younger Mr. Kabila became the country\u2019s leader in 2001, after his father\u2019s assassination.In Kinshasa, the mood was tense on a recent day as residents wondered whether Mr. Kabila would honor a pact that allows him to stay in office until the end of the year as the country prepares for elections.\u201cWe are waiting,\u201d said Elys\u00e9e Yenge, 57, a shopkeeper in the capital. \u201cWe are praying to God for something to happen, because God can\u2019t let this suffering just go on.\u201dBut the timetable to hold an election has slipped, badly.In a recent interview with a German newspaper, Mr. Kabila declared he had \u201cpromised nothing\u201d in the December deal. The electoral commission added to the sense of uncertainty by saying it would probably be impossible to hold the election on time because of a lack of funds \u2014 it says the process would cost $1.8 billion \u2014 and because of unrest in the central Kasai region.Diplomats involved in negotiations say that time is running out and that opportunities to broker Mr. Kabila\u2019s peaceful departure are getting smaller by the day.The \u201cglissement\u201d is particularly dangerous because no one knows when and how it will end, said one Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing diplomatic protocol. The resilience of the Congolese people is legendary, the official added, but they\u2019ve already suffered a lot.Congo is extraordinarily rich in natural resources. It is Africa\u2019s biggest copper producer and a vital source of the cobalt used in rechargeable batteries and smartphones. It has large quantities of diamonds, gold, oil, timber and uranium.And yet, the economy is plummeting.Partly because of lower prices for raw materials and partly because of general mismanagement, growth has shrunk from the double digits a few years ago to just below 3 percent. The currency has halved in value over 12 months. Prices are climbing fast, damaging people\u2019s already precarious living standards. Soldiers, teachers, doctors and civil servants have not been paid their official salaries for months.As the economic crisis deepens, the International Monetary Fund recently threatened to withhold desperately needed cash unless Mr. Kabila agreed to elections. The central bank\u2019s coffers are virtually empty. Commercial banks are facing a liquidity crisis as people convert Congolese francs into dollars on the black market instead of putting them in their savings accounts.The list of ills facing Congo, which has never had a peaceful transfer of power, goes far beyond the economic.Mr. Kabila is disliked to such an extent that some of his countrymen now fondly recall Mobutu Sese Seko, the country\u2019s former leader known for his ruthless suppression of opponents and a gargantuan appetite for luxury, paid for with large-scale corruption. Unlike the reclusive Mr. Kabila, Mr. Mobutu showed himself in public and gave rousing speeches.The situation has gotten so bad that rumors of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat are swirling in diplomatic circles and even within Mr. Kabila\u2019s own party, known as the Presidential Majority.So far, Mr. Kabila enjoys the protection of his formidable Presidential Guard, a fiercely loyal personal army of some 40,000 members who carry out brutal crackdowns at his bidding.A few months before Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s death, Mr. Kabila nominated his opponent\u2019s personal doctor to a ministerial post, which, critics say, was a ruse to keep tabs on Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s deteriorating health and devise ways to extend his rule.Despite his measures to stay in power, Mr. Kabila is finding himself increasingly isolated and cornered.Fearing an exodus of refugees across their borders, Congo\u2019s neighbors and traditional allies are also losing patience. In particular, Rwanda and Angola, which have reached some stability after their own civil wars, have little appetite for a return to chaos.The same Catholic bishops who tried to broker a deal, exasperated by Mr. Kabila\u2019s lack of commitment, issued an unprecedented call in June for people to \u201crise up\u201d against the government.Government officials insist it is the economic crisis that is hampering the electoral process.\u201cWhen we don\u2019t have money, priority should be given to resolve the economic crisis, rather than to elections, don\u2019t you think?\u201d said Theophile Mbayo Kifuntwe, Mr. Kabila\u2019s political adviser.According to Mr. Kifuntwe, nearly everyone but the president is to blame for the crisis: foreigners, who are infiltrating the country to stoke popular rebellions; a popular Catholic bishop, part of the group that tried to broker a deal with Mr. Kabila, who secretly wants the top job. The government even accused Belgium of plotting to overthrow Mr. Kabila and recently threatened to oust Bart Ouvry, the European Union ambassador to Congo, who is Belgian.\u201cWe are threatened from all sides,\u201d said Mr. Kifuntwe, who included teachers and doctors in his list of threats.When he assumed the presidency in 2001 after his father\u2019s assassination by his bodyguards, Mr. Kabila was considered a great hope for the country. One of his biggest accomplishments was a peace deal with Congo\u2019s neighbors after the devastating war. He also brought in investment from international mining companies.The country \u201cprovided him with easy money, made him feel invincible,\u201d said Francis Kalombo, who knew Mr. Kabila as a young man and was once one of his closest advisers before a falling out in 2015. \u201cSo why leave?\u201dMr. Kabila and his family have a business network controlling virtually all industry in the country, from mining to a company issuing license plates. The president holds more than 71,000 hectares of farmland, according to the Congo Research Group. Two companies that belong to the family own diamond permits that extend more than 450 miles along Congo\u2019s southern border with Angola.\u201cSomeone who is planning to leave wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Mr. Kalombo, who says he doubts Mr. Kabila will ever hold elections.The Congolese leader is also encouraged by what he sees in the rest of Africa, Mr. Kalombo said. When other African leaders like Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, and Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, have managed to cling on to power using various maneuvers, including changing their Constitutions, Mr. Kabila reasons he can do the same.During his rule, Mr. Kabila, who likes to hole up in his enormous Kinshasa residence or on one of his farms outside the city, has done little to connect with the public. He was largely raised in exile while his father was plotting to overthrow Mr. Mobutu. When he assumed the presidency, he was not fluent in French or Lingala, two of the main languages spoken in Congo.Mr. Kalombo recalled a conversation he once had with Mr. Kabila.\u201c\u2018The Congolese people are cowards,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kabila told him, according to his former friend. \u201c\u2018You just need to fire four or five gunshots for them to scurry back into their homes.\u2019\u201dMr. Kabila was not available for comment in time for publication.Just like King Leopold II of Belgium, who ran the country as a personal fief for more than 20 years until 1908, Mr. Kabila and his family are operating Congo as a giant cash machine, Mr. Kalombo said.Mr. Kabila \u201cis a businessman, and Congo is just about making deals,\u201d he added.\u201cThe Congolese people,\u201d he said, \u201care nothing to him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Push to Overturn Health Law Is Back From the Dead", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican health care push was declared dead Wednesday morning. By afternoon it had a breath of life. Legislation in Washington can assume Frankenstein-like qualities.On the cusp of a humiliating and politically disastrous defeat, President Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, took extraordinary resuscitative measures on Wednesday to pump oxygen back into their badly fading effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act. They somehow managed to stave off its imminent demise.It may be only a temporary reprieve, but a fight that seemed finished just hours earlier was renewed and headed for a pivotal vote next week.With his reputation for being a master of the Senate at grave risk, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, extended a new offer to wavering Senate colleagues leery of scrapping the health care law. He backed away from his earlier insistence that the Senate focus on a plan to repeal much of the existing Obama-era law and allow a two-year window for its replacement \u2014 an iffy proposition given the difficulties that Republicans are currently having coming up with a consensus health care policy.Instead, his new selling point was that senators should simply vote next week on a motion to open a rollicking health care floor debate and then let the amendment chips fall where they may \u2014 a case of creating national health care policy, which makes up about 20 percent of the United States economy, on the fly.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that I, or anybody else, could prevent members from having amendments that any 51 of us can pass and change the bill,\u201d he said by way of encouragement. \u201cBut we cannot have a debate until we get on the bill.\u201dWhether that will be enough to entice Republicans who feared that health insurance proposals crafted by the leadership would do damage to states like Ohio, West Virginia, Maine and Alaska remained to be seen. But there was no rush of outright rejections, and lawmakers planned to assemble with White House staff members to explore options that could win them over.At the lunch, Mr. Trump mixed threats of political retaliation against Republicans who crossed him with pleas to move ahead with a long-promised repeal-and-replace legislation, urging senators to remain through their August recess if necessary. It was a stark change from his earlier promise to let the health care law collapse and let its beneficiaries face the consequences.\u201cMy message today is really simple,\u201d Mr. Trump told them. \u201cWe have to stay here; we shouldn\u2019t leave town, and we should hammer this out and get it done. And not just a repeal,\u201d he said, conceding he had backed that idea before. \u201cI think the people of this country need more than a repeal. They need a repeal and a replace.\u201dThat was good news to Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who had been one of the first Republican senators to balk at moving ahead on an outright repeal plan, along with Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\u201cI\u2019m glad @POTUS agrees that we cannot move to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses the needs of West Virginians,\u201d Ms. Capito said on Twitter.It is difficult to say how much she and other Republicans \u2014 whom Mr. McConnell described as having \u201csome difficulty in getting to yes\u201d \u2014 were persuaded by the president\u2019s appeal. But with several days remaining before a vote, Republicans were finding it hard to resist the call to at least make the effort to find some resolution, though many were very skeptical of the chances for success.The window remaining before the vote also allows both opponents and proponents of the Republican health proposals to step up their pressure on key lawmakers, and they will face an assault.A coalition of conservative advocacy groups took a harsh line against Republicans who were threatening to derail the health care effort, promising to initiate primary campaigns against them. They noted that all Republican senators who were then in office, except for Ms. Collins, had voted for a vetoed 2015 repeal plan that would be on the floor next week and that the party had campaigned endlessly on its promises to kill the Obama health care law.Jason Pye of the group FreedomWorks put Ms. Capito and Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who had expressed reservations about earlier Republican plans, in the \u201cSenate traitor caucus.\u201d\u201cOur activist community in Ohio and West Virginia are not going to take this laying down,\u201d he said.Leaders of the coalition also heaped criticism on Mr. McConnell, questioning his commitment to pushing the health legislation across the finish line. Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to drain the swamp and characterized Mr. McConnell as the \u201chead alligator.\u201dMr. McConnell has regularly feuded with the outside groups and gleefully beat back their electoral challenge to him and other Republicans in past elections. Still, it was striking how much fire Mr. McConnell came under, given his push to get some repeal legislation on the floor as well as delivering a Supreme Court seat filled by a conservative \u2014 a top priority of those on the right.The fate of the Republican effort remained precarious, but Mr. McConnell issued a stern warning to any colleagues hoping to dodge a tough vote: They would not get the chance.\u201cWe\u2019re going to vote on the motion to proceed to the bill next week,\u201d he declared.If it is defeated then, it might be very hard to resurrect.An earlier version of this article misstated how Republican senators voted for a vetoed 2015 repeal plan. Senator Susan Collins of Maine did not vote for the measure, meaning that it was not supported by all Republican senators who were then in office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Sees Foes at Work in Gold Mines, Cafes and \u2018Smurf Village\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Akin Ipek, one of Turkey\u2019s richest men, was staying in the Park Tower Hotel in London when the police raided his television network in Istanbul. The raid was national news, so Mr. Ipek opened his laptop and watched an unnerving spectacle: an attack on his multibillion-dollar empire, in real time.It was an oddly cinematic showdown. Through a combination of shouting and persuasion, the network\u2019s news editor convinced the officers that they should leave, then locked himself in the basement control room with a film crew. For the next seven and a half hours, until the police returned, the news editor spoke into a camera and took calls on his iPhone. One was from Mr. Ipek, who denounced the government\u2019s action as illegal.\u201cI was shocked and angry,\u201d Mr. Ipek said in a recent interview in London. \u201cBut I thought they would leave after a couple days. There was no reason to stay.\u201dThe Turkish lira is crumbling and foreign investment has dropped by half compared with last year. All three of the major rating agencies have downgraded the government\u2019s debt to junk status, citing among other factors the bludgeoning approach to companies suspected of having ties to the Gulen movement.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this new narrative about Turkey as it has taken an authoritarian turn,\u201d said Jonathan Friedman of Stroz Friedberg, a global risk consultancy. \u201cIn boardrooms, the country is now a very hard sell.\u201dTurkey\u2019s war on its \u201cenemies\u201d in business \u2014 and the evolution of Mr. Ipek from revered industrialist to public villain \u2014 illuminates much about the tumultuous events that have so jolted the country in recent years.Mr. Ipek stands accused of being part of a treasonous deep state run by Mr. Gulen, a reclusive 76-year-old who fled Turkey in 1999 and now lives in the Poconos of Pennsylvania.For decades, Mr. Gulen has preached a theology rooted in Islam and focused on peace, science and democracy. The movement he leads is called Hizmet \u2014 service, in English \u2014 and is best known outside of Turkey for building schools across the country and the rest of the world, including 120 charter schools in the United States. Delegations of American politicians have flown to Turkey on trips paid for by Hizmet.To Mr. Gulen\u2019s detractors, his good works have all been all a cunning charade, propaganda camouflaging a vast moneymaking enterprise that sought to overthrow the government. He and his followers indoctrinated youngsters at Hizmet schools in Turkey, then encouraged them to find positions in the government, particularly the justice system \u2014 as police officers, prosecutors and judges.For allies in the corporate realm, Gulenists in the government provided invaluable aid. Licenses were approved, permits issued, rivals thwarted. Entrepreneurs in Mr. Gulen\u2019s favor knew that the levers of the state could make them wealthy, and one of his most successful prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, if the Turkish government is correct, was Mr. Ipek.Soon after the raid, a warrant was issued for Mr. Ipek\u2019s arrest, stating that he laundered vast sums for what officials call the Fethullah Terrorist Organization. His assets were frozen and have gradually been seized, starting last year with his luxury cars and ending with all of his real estate and bank accounts. Prosecutors announced in June that they would seek a 77-year prison sentence for Mr. Ipek, though he has no plans to return to Turkey.Now settled in London, Mr. Ipek spends his days trying to clear his name and somehow reclaim his life. No, he says, he is not a financial backer of Mr. Gulen or a beneficiary of favors from his followers. And no, he says, he didn\u2019t flee Turkey with billions of dollars, as the government has charged. He says his current net worth is less than $10 million.\u201cI have not committed one single crime in my life, not a traffic penalty,\u201d he fumed, during hours of interviews.It isn\u2019t easy to sort fact from fabrication in the government\u2019s case, and parts of Mr. Ipek\u2019s account of his own life sound nearly as far-fetched. Truth is a slippery, elusive concept in today\u2019s Turkey, a place where the definitions of basic words, like \u201cally\u201d and \u201ctraitor,\u201d keep changing.At least one allegation against Mr. Ipek is demonstrably absurd. A judge misconstrued a reference to \u201csmurfs,\u201d a term of art for people who launder tiny amounts of money, in a report by a government investigator. Taking the allusion literally, the judge, in his ruling, wrote that Mr. Ipek and a group of others conspired in \u201cSmurf Village\u201d in Ankara.\u201cFor two years I\u2019ve been trying to prove there is no Smurf Village in Ankara,\u201d Mr. Ipek nearly shouted, \u201cbecause some idiot mentioned Smurfs in a report.\u201dA fit-looking 53-year-old, Mr. Ipek speaks English learned, in part, as an undergraduate in Britain. A black belt in taekwondo and formerly an exercise addict, he has given up workouts since moving to London and has a pack-a-day cigarette habit. He shaved off the mustache he long wore in Turkey, an act with political overtones given that mustaches are de rigueur in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, shortened to A.K.P. in Turkey.\u201cThey copied me,\u201d he said of the A.K.P.\u2019s mustachioed members. \u201cAfter they saw my mustache, they got jealous and started growing their own.\u201dHe paused a moment, smiled, then added, \u201cThat is a joke.\u201dOn some level, it\u2019s not. Mr. Ipek has an ego just healthy enough to believe that he could be a facial-hair trendsetter. He described a luxury hotel he built as \u201cthe world\u2019s best hotel\u201d and the oil he discovered in a southeast province as \u201cthe best oil in Turkey.\u201d He called Koza Ipek a \u201cperfect company.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an exceptional person,\u201d he said, matter of factly.He is also warm and surprisingly unbowed, given the circumstances. He leads a somewhat monastic life compared with his recent years in Turkey, when he flew on the company\u2019s jet. He doesn\u2019t travel anymore, though he lives comfortably enough in a house owned by his company in central London.If anyone aided him on his path to riches, he says, it was his father, Ali Ipek, not Mr. Gulen. The elder Mr. Ipek ran a successful greeting card business, with 500 employees and contracts with Hallmark and others. Akin Ipek took over the company when his father died in 1997 and eventually looked for new opportunities with bigger upsides. He bought a silver mine, then a gold mine.It seems like an improbable jump. But when you point that out to Mr. Ipek, he is unfazed. \u201cIt was something I could afford,\u201d he said, referring to his first acquisition. \u201cThere are a lot of small mines in Turkey. It cost $1 million.\u201dHe went into the media business in 2005, buying the Bugun newspaper. It was a natural step, he said, because environmentalists had raised objections to some of his mining operations and he wanted to get out his side of the story.\u201cIn mining, you need to explain what you are doing, you need to be transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that instead of spending money on P.R., I would buy a newspaper.\u201dIn 2008, he purchased Kanalturk, his first TV network. As a rising media baron, he was contacted and sometimes summoned by Mr. Erdogan. Twice he asked Mr. Ipek to buy other newspapers, deals that didn\u2019t work out.\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind, he wasn\u2019t angry,\u201d Mr. Ipek recalls. \u201cI liked him very much. I saw him as a very reasonable, very logical person. He was trying to do what was right for the country \u2014 trying to join the European Union, talking about human rights.\u201dIn less than 15 years, Mr. Ipek had gone from a greeting card wholesaler to a billionaire tapped for favors by the country\u2019s most powerful leader. It was a dizzyingly fast ride, one he says was engineered by a \u201c100 percent self-made man.\u201dBut there is another version of Mr. Ipek\u2019s life, a counternarrative from people who knew him or followed his career. It starts with an irony: Mr. Ipek\u2019s ascent was made possible by the 2003 election to the prime ministership of the man who would become his nemesis, Mr. Erdogan.Until then, Turkey had for decades been controlled by a secular elite backed by the military, collectively known as Kemalists. Suddenly, a conservative Muslim was the prime minister, and he badly needed to replace Kemalists with bureaucrats, judges and police officers loyal to the new administrationMr. Erdogan struck an alliance with Mr. Gulen \u2014 then regarded not as a rival but as a conservative Muslim with highly educated acolytes. Gulenists slowly began to take jobs in the government. In effect, a new deep state replaced the old one.Businessmen in the good graces of the Erdogan-Gulen entente were marked for greatness. Turkey was entering its expansionary era, and those with the right connections prospered. Mr. Ipek appears to have been one of the period\u2019s biggest winners, starting with the 2005 purchase of the Ovacik gold mine.A few weeks later, locals and environmental activists were physically attacked by Koza Ipek miners during a protest march. Videotape showed Mr. Ipek at the scene of the assault, and former Koza employees said that he had helped orchestrate the violence. He denies that. A lawsuit against the company went nowhere.\u201cAlthough we filed a complaint right after the attack,\u201d said Arif Cangi, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, \u201cprosecutors waited for four and a half years to open the case, and they still haven\u2019t made a decision.\u201dOnly the anointed few, observers say, had this kind of regulatory and legal assistance from the state. And an ambitious executive needed a close relationship with Mr. Gulen, along with a willingness to help underwrite his movement, estimated to be worth at least $15 billion at its peak.\u201cWhat I heard from people in business that I know is, \u2018Never get in a fight with a Gulenist company,\u2019\u201d said James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey. \u201c\u2018They\u2019ll get the case in front of Gulenist judges and you\u2019ll lose no matter what the facts are.\u2019\u201dBeing associated with Mr. Gulen eventually became a toxic liability. By 2009, Mr. Erdogan began to suspect that Mr. Gulen wanted to return and run the country.Initially, the strongest evidence came from leaked sermons, including one in which Mr. Gulen urged his followers to \u201cmove in the veins of the system, without anyone noticing your existence, until you reach all the power centers.\u201d Once ensconced, he went on, wait \u201cuntil you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in Turkey.\u201dThose closest to Mr. Gulen say these exhortations, and his conniving, were no surprise.\u201cHe is a wolf dressed as Little Red Riding Hood,\u201d said Huseyin Gulerce, a former editor in chief of Zaman, the country\u2019s most prominent Gulenist newspaper. \u201cHe is obsessed with the idea that he is going to rule the world.\u201dSuspicions about Mr. Gulen hardened fatefully when a clique of Gulenist police officers, prosecutors and judges began a series of corruption investigations targeting Erdogan loyalists, culminating in late 2013 with accusations of corruption against Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son. After that, the two forces were openly clashing.It was soon clear that businessmen had to choose a side. One school of thought has it that when hostilities began, Mr. Ipek\u2019s fortunes were too interlaced with Mr. Gulen\u2019s for him to break free.\u201cI think of Akin Ipek as one of Gulen\u2019s biggest victims,\u201d Mr. Gulerce said. \u201cHe is to be pitied. Gulen used him.\u201dMr. Ipek says that\u2019s preposterous. He says that he opened the Ovacik mine through determination and the merits of his arguments. While he acknowledges that he visited Mr. Gulen in the Poconos \u201cfive or six times, maybe,\u201d he forswears any emotional or financial link to the man.Of course, even if Mr. Ipek was one of Mr. Gulen\u2019s truest believers, taking companies with scant due process would seem to violate most countries\u2019 legal norms. Many inside and outside Turkey believe that Mr. Erdogan has exploited the failed coup as a pretext to expand his power, tossing people in prison or firing them from jobs for sins as minor as keeping money in a Gulen-connected bank. More than 130,000 people have been suspended or dismissed in the past year, and dozens of hospitals have been closed, along with 1,200 schools and 15 universities.Mr. Ipek may simply have experienced the wrath of the president before everyone else. During their last face-to-face meeting, in 2012, Mr. Erdogan smoldered while reading aloud every word of a column in Bugun, Mr. Ipek\u2019s newspaper, that he found objectionable.\u201cHe was not reasonable anymore,\u201d Mr. Ipek said. \u201cI told him, \u2018Consider me your younger brother and let me tell you some truths. You need to look at the whole wall, not concentrate on one brick. I\u2019ll ask my columnists to be a little more polite, but we want people to be free to express their opinion. We promised them a free press.\u2019\u201dMr. Ipek must have realized that his future in Turkey was not secure. In late 2014, he began the process of relocating to London, forming a holding company here called Ipek Investments that would control all of his assets.The leverage that the government now has over Mr. Ipek includes his younger brother, Tekin, who was imprisoned two years ago without a trial. Mr. Ipek has offered to fly to Turkey and take his brother\u2019s place if the government releases him. Come to Turkey and we\u2019ll talk, the government has countered, in Mr. Ipek\u2019s telling. It is a proposal that he has declined, because he assumes that the government will simply imprison them both.\u201cI\u2019ve seen them do that before,\u201d he said.Finding a government official to speak about the business seizures was not easy. After many phone calls, a high-ranking adviser to Mr. Erdogan agreed to an interview at his office in the presidential complex in Ankara. Opened in 2014, the site has3.2 million square feet of inhumanely scaled buildings \u2014 imagine an Ottoman-themed Las Vegas casino, minus the neon and noise. This is where the president lives, and the immaculate premises contain more than 1,000 rooms, many filled with government employees.To reach their offices, you need to pass through two metal detectors and drive through underground tunnels, then pass through another metal detector. Everything is large, silent and under tight security. It\u2019s like visiting the world\u2019s grandest above-ground bunker.The high-ranking official turned out to be a friendly man who, through a translator, opened by conveying the conditions of the interview: No one else, he said, could be quoted in the article. When I declined that offer, he had another idea. He would provide names of other sources who could be quoted. When I said that wouldn\u2019t work either, he explained that he could not appear in an article that contained negative sentiments about Turkey.When that offer was also rejected, he agreed to share his thoughts only if his name was kept from the story and he was referred to as a \u201chigh-ranking official.\u201dThis pre-interview conversation revealed a lot about the current state of mind of the country\u2019s governing party. The high-ranking official wasn\u2019t just setting these terms because he had little use for independent journalism, though he clearly preferred the pliant variety. He was setting those terms out of fear.\u201cDon\u2019t get me in trouble,\u201d he said several times, with a forced smile. Turkey is now a place where even those in power fret that a false step will harm their careers.\u201cIt was a market-friendly thing that these companies were seized,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cleansed the economy of criminal companies.\u201d\u201cInternational investors aren\u2019t asking if Turkey is safe to invest in,\u201d he added. \u201cOnly journalists are asking.\u201dWhat about the downgrades by the ratings agencies?Their opinions are subjective and unfair to Turkey\u2019s brand, he said, noting that companies like Citigroup and Boeing are investing huge sums in the country. He predicted that gross domestic product would grow by 7 percent in 2018.He referred questions about the 950 seized companies to the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund, the agency that now controls them. In an earlier incarnation, the agency\u2019s mandate was to auction off insolvent companies, which it often did live on television, making the sales both transparent and public.Now, the agency has gone silent. It did not return calls for comment.Learning anything about the current state of a seized company often requires a visit.In many cases, the agency has simply cleared out the corner offices and relied on existing employees. That is true of Aydinli, a seized clothing giant that markets U.S. Polo Assn. and a variety of other brands.\u201cThe only change is we\u2019re getting our paychecks earlier,\u201d said a salesman at a U.S. Polo Assn. store at a mall in Istanbul. The flow of customers has held steady.David Cummings, the chief executive of U.S.P.A. Global Licensing, the West Palm Beach, Fla., company that markets U.S. Polo Assn. clothing, said that aside from a new government-appointed board to oversee Aydinli\u2019s day-to-day operations, nothing had changed. \u201cOf course, everyone gets a little nervous when the government exerts that kind of control,\u201d he said in a phone interview. But the company, he said, has continued to expand.Similar business-as-usual sentiments were heard from a manager at the seized baklava chain, Faruk Gulluoglu, in Taksim Square in Istanbul. It was packed on a recent sunny day, and whoever is running the company\u2019s Twitter account has gone out of the way to say that it hasn\u2019t changed the recipes.Still, critics say that many companies have been sold at deep discounts to friends of Mr. Erdogan, and that others are now run by incompetent loyalists. Inevitably, there have been glitches.After a major construction company called Dumankaya Insaat was seized, work on a number of unfinished apartment complexes came to a halt, leaving some 10,000 people who had purchased units in the lurch.The former home of Bugun TV, the scene of that control booth standoff in 2015, appears abandoned. In May, the only sign of life was a security guard, who said that nobody worked in the building. Asked who paid his salary, the guard said \u201cthe government.\u201dThis was news to Mr. Ipek. Even with a number of lawyers on the case, he knows almost nothing about what has become of his businesses. None of the three publicly traded companies in Koza Ipek has issued an earnings report in roughly a year. During our interview, an aide told him that shares of one of the companies had risen that day by 15 percent. What had caused the jump?Mr. Ipek shrugged as he headed outside for a cigarette break.\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On a Remote Greek Island, Learning to Take a \u2018Real\u2019 Vacation", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySummer FirstsThe first thing I ever heard about the Greek island of Sifnos was that it was not famous. My friend Sabina said this to me when she invited me to join her there in the summer of 2008. I was confused, thinking she had mistaken me for the sort of person who would only want to go someplace famous, but she quickly explained that most tourists were interested in the other islands, which meant Sifnos was affordable, and so she and her husband could afford to vacation for a month there with their two children, and over the years invite a mix of writers and academics and the people who had married or befriended them for a house party set among apartments, all of them renting near each other at the island\u2019s center.I didn\u2019t think about whether Sifnos was famous or not again until I was on the ferry from Athens, when I met a friendly young Greek couple \u2014 a gardener and a social worker, working with refugees. They leaned over and asked if I was Belgian \u2014 their guess, as I\u2019d been quietly drinking beer and reading comics. This was so far off the mark that it charmed me enough to keep chatting. As we bought rounds of beer, we passed the islands and they spoke familiarly of them. Serifos is where the giants mined for iron, they said. It looks big enough, I said. I asked where they were going, and they said Anafi, the island Apollo made for Jason and the Argonauts to rest during a storm, after capturing the Golden Fleece. The ancient gods seemed alive to them, but as if they were friends.When the couple asked where I was going, and I told them, they said, Sifnos is not as famous, just like that. They then told me a story about how it was known for its gold and silver mines, but after the islanders angered Apollo by sending him tribute made from gold plate, he flooded the mines. I imagined Apollo biting the tribute to see if it was real gold, and wondered if it was now famous for not being famous \u2014 some last affliction from the sun god.In any case, the idea of a place famous for being unfamous, that once thought it could fool Apollo, only made me more curious. The ferry arrived just as the sun set, and the lights from a disco visible from the sea welcomed me like a signal fire. I waved goodbye to my new friends and set out to discover the island for myself, amused by the idea of myself as a Belgian tourist reading comics quietly and drinking beer.I hadn\u2019t come to the Cyclades for the famous islands. I was there for me. The invitation to join my friends there had showed me a simple truth about myself: I never took real vacations. Like most Americans, I had accepted the loss of even the idea of a vacation as a fact of what everyone kept calling the new economy. As a freelance writer and a \u201cvisiting writer\u201d at a small liberal arts college \u2014 a sort of high-end adjunct professor, better pay but with all of the uncertainty \u2014 vacations meant working vacations, or, as I liked to call them, \u201creally beautiful places I have freelanced from.\u201d As a writer, the time I don\u2019t work is never very clear; I am as likely to get an idea at 11 p.m. as I am at 11 a.m., and if I ignore them, they tend to go away and not come back, and so I had learned to just go and write, no matter the hour. But I had come to feel a little like an on-call doctor for patients who would never fully explain themselves to me. I was also teaching writing, and that was its own blur of constant tasks, email in particular. I was, then, determined to have my first real vacation, even from writing.In my carry-on was a Moleskine notebook with a set of black pens, for sketching. My brother had given it to me, saying, \u201cI remember when you used to draw all the time.\u201d I did too, and I missed it. The notebook was like a new door to an old place, one I wasn\u2019t sure how to get back to. The gift was several years old by this time, and I had taken it along on trips before and left it empty each time. I hoped this time to fill it.I\u2019d never been to Greece before this, and as I was unsure if I would even like it, I\u2019d set myself up for just 10 days, which, as soon as I arrived felt like not enough time. Because I loved Greece instantly, more or less as soon as I\u2019d exited the plane in Athens. And I loved Sifnos instantly also. That first morning, I woke up in the one-bedroom efficiency I\u2019d rented in the same complex as my friends, in Apollonia, the island\u2019s capital city, and stepped out onto a patio lined in bougainvillea, mimosa and what looked like bearded orchids, which I quickly learned were caper berry blossoms. That air was fragrant with oregano and sage, which grow wild on the surrounding hills. Three adorable tiny kittens and their mother, who all seemed unsure if they would beg for food, were on my lounge chair, and this was how I met the first of the skinny cats of Sifnos.I went for a coffee, and to buy some groceries. As I walked back by the line forming for the bus to the beach, I noticed the busy traffic in scooters and motorcycles zipping by and knew instantly I didn\u2019t want to wait for a bus. I rented a scooter for the rest of my stay, easily the best decision of the trip. After the agent warned me about the speed limits \u2014 20 kilometers per hour in town, 40 pretty much everywhere else \u2014 I put my notebook and pens in my shoulder bag, buckled my helmet on and was off.The routine I quickly established: wake up, get a coffee, drive to a new beach, order breakfast \u2014 typically an omelet, which meant a sort of wide circle of egg batter dotted with tomatoes and cheese, a crinkle of salad as a garnish. After I ate, I drew. That first morning I went to the beach my friends had said they always went to, Platis Gialos, where, after I noticed the pictures I tried to take of the landscapes all seemed to make everything small and dull, I finally took the notebook out, and a pen, and traced out the horizon in front of me without looking at the page, an old drawing class exercise. The outlines were satisfying to me, and so I kept at it, beginning to fill the drawing in. The final result was O.K. \u2014 not amazing, but not terrible. More important, I could sense a new sort of calm.Of my friends there, the one who inspired me most on that trip was a chef who ran a thriving catering business back home. He came every June with a year\u2019s worth of New Yorker magazines in a suitcase, as he didn\u2019t have time to read them during the year, and over the course of the month, he would get caught up. Each day he sat out on his lounge chair in his bathing suit, sunning himself as he read, alternately stern or amused. He was still cooking a little while he was there, usually breakfasts for himself and the children of our mutual friend Sabina. Once breakfast was over, though, he was regimented, on a schedule of enjoying himself, and he looked visibly relaxed in a way I had never seen him back home. This dedication to a regimen of a kind, one entirely alien to his normal life, was what I was after.The next morning, I found Cheronissos, a town on the island\u2019s north side, much smaller than Platis Gialos and with a long cove that leads to the beach. I had breakfast there, and stayed and drew until lunch. By the third day, this was my regimen, and for the rest of the trip I went to a new beach town every morning, had breakfast and made drawings until noon, before leaving to find my friends, who were usually at Platis Gialos. There, with my friend John, Sabina\u2019s husband, I practiced the art of swimming while drinking beer and wearing sunglasses.Drawing is an excellent way to remember a place. In my mind I can still see clearly the towns I drew and the mornings I spent there. Vathi is the luxury resort, the place the yachts tie up, a spectacular cove surrounded by mountains. Heronissos is for the fishermen, the far-flung northernmost town reached only after a long drive braving the winds \u2014 the only time I questioned the wisdom of my scooter rental. Faros has ruins on the hill across from the cove that I drew, brick by brick.The modern reputation of Sifnos is as a place known for its food. A 28-square-mile island with a small year-round population, it is blessed like the rest of the Cyclades with beautiful beaches and coves, mountains and olive trees. Located southwest of the more famous Mykonos, Sifnos was, at this time, not as popular with Americans, more of a weekend trip for Athenians. It is the birthplace of Nicholas Tselementes, the country\u2019s first celebrity chef, who is credited with having either modernized Greek cooking, with the invention of moussaka and pastitsio, or having diluted it with European influences. A copy of his 1932 cookbook is likely still in many Greek homes, and his recipes are still served all over Greece and in most Greek restaurants around the world. Sifnos, though, isn\u2019t known to Greeks for just his food \u2014 the island is full of good restaurants, and even the most modest places do well by you.The famous islands never drew me away. I was more interested in the little mysteries I found here on these mornings. I stopped at a church where visitors came in, prayed and placed a lit candle in a mound of sand, and then I watched, with a little shock, as the solemn attendant got up after they left and blew out the candles, pulling them out of the sand and returning them to the stack where they could be lit by the next new arrivals who donated a euro or two. It seemed to me they would burn on only in the minds of the faithful \u2014 where a candle perhaps burns best and safest. This made it all the more charming to learn there are 360 churches on the island, many of them little chapels built by petitioners who had received the prosperity they had prayed for \u2014 a kind of Greek Orthodox ex voto.Other mysteries included the monster of Sifnos, supposedly a very large bird with a terrifying roar, though we never saw any sign of it except in the drawings Sabina\u2019s sons made of their interpretations. And Kastro, the Venetian settlement, the oldest on the island. From the distance, it is a tiny white cap on a rocky promontory, and yet when you are inside it, it feels vast, easy to get lost in; Venetian towns are designed to fool pirates, each one a little like Venice itself. You think you are headed toward a courtyard, and end up in someone\u2019s backyard. Or you are sure you are headed to the sidewalk, and exit onto the back side of the town, looking down the cliff at the Church of the Seven Martyrs, separated from the town by a rock spit and a chasm created, apparently, when two lovers prayed to God for protection from pirates. A rocky path of steps is the only way to the chapel now.I spent one of my favorite days in the cove village of Seralia, just below Kastro \u2014 maybe 10 buildings, all of which seem to go right into the water, the ocean coming up to their doors. At the Captain Sifakis, a taverna there, I ordered a Mythos beer and picked out a sea bream from the tray of fresh fish caught daily by the owner and prepared by his wife and sons.As I began drawing the views from their second-floor deck, my hostess brought first a salad of hard wine-washed goat cheese, pickled octopus, cucumber and olives, and then the grilled bream, with cucumber and tomato and the island\u2019s oregano and sage. I drew for hours: the side of the cliff, the far rocks and the ocean, the mouth of the cove.I returned the next day and this time ate skari, a local Greek fish, grilled and served doused in olive oil poured onto it at the table. It was delicious, but so full of bones that I decided the name meant it would cut you. I drew a profile of Kastro\u2019s cliff across three pages and then left and walked up to Kastro to make one more, of the chapel of the Seven Martyrs. By now I was near the end of my trip, and I was trying to get as much in as I could. Looking over the drawing again now, I remember that when I finished it, I added the two kestrels fighting the wind that day, but left out the cats all over the hill, moving like arrows in the grass. I\u2019d refrained, as cats typically overwhelm whatever images they are in, with, well, cuteness, but at this distance I miss them.The things I couldn\u2019t draw or replicate: the knack Greek men have for winking at you as they pass on a scooter or motorcycle. The way the islanders, as they enter restaurants, or pass each other on the street, shout, \u201cKalimera!\u201d (\u201cGood day!\u201d) If you don\u2019t return the greeting, they think you\u2019re weird, but to get it right, you really do have to be happy to see the other people, even if they\u2019re strangers.And the best moment of the trip: Late at night after one of our dinners, somewhere between Platis Gialos and Apollonia, the full moon had risen and was casting light down on the Aegean, and the vision of it was so beautiful that I stopped so I wouldn\u2019t drive off the road. The boundary between the sea and the sky had blurred, and the moon had left a path of light, laid out as if for one moment you could walk all that way there.I never did go to the famous islands \u2014 the unfamous one was the one for me. I never drew Apollonia, perhaps because there is no sea there. Apollonia was for eating, or drinking, or gossip, or the disco, but not for drawing. It was where I mostly saw my friends, or ate delicious food, or fell asleep.When I left on the ferry home, I could feel I had in fact relaxed, deep down, in some way that was entirely new to me. But also, drawing had opened that new door to the old place. It had brought me back to the pleasure of the art you make just for yourself, where all art begins, easy to lose track of when you become a professional writer. Your own private conversation about ideas and aesthetics.Vacation is so often cast as a luxury now in America, a bourgeois game of Instagram tagging and food photos. But for me, in Sifnos, I came to know it as the time in the year when you find not only rest, but also the strength you need to meet your work and your life when you return to them. In the years since, it\u2019s been hard to be an American writer and take vacations like this. But I would never want to live the other way \u2014 without them \u2014 again.Alexander Chee is the author of \u201cThe Queen of the Night\u201d and teaches creative writing at Dartmouth College.Advertisement"}

But the Lichtentaler Allee, the lovely, tree-lined promenade that adjoins it, is a perfect way to acclimate yourself to the town. Start at the G\u00f6nneranlage rose garden, a jewel box of a park that features more than 400 varieties that bloom from May to October. Then exit on the avenue, turn right and keep going until you hit the imposing Festspielhaus, or concert hall, a little more than a mile away. The entire stretch can probably be done in a brisk 20-minute walk. But this is Baden-Baden. No one does anything briskly.In the Middle Ages, the Marktplatz, or marketplace, was the vibrant center of daily life in Baden-Baden. Now, it is mostly a quiet area of cobblestone streets, a few cafes, a historic church (the Stiftskirche, whose original structure on this site is said to date back to about 1200) and a lushly landscaped, terraced garden that, from its upper levels, offers sweeping views of the city below. After a calorie-burning stroll, indulge in a bit of afternoon tea. Perhaps the most popular spot in Baden-Baden is the Caf\u00e9 K\u00f6nig, serving finger sandwiches, cakes and cream-filled pastries.

{"Headline": "How a Pageant Led to a Trump Son\u2019s Meeting With a Russian Lawyer", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Putin did not make it, but the beauty competition in Moscow brought the Trump family into partnership with Emin Agalarov, a pop star in Russia, and his father, Aras \u2014 a duo that develops major real estate projects in Russia and appears friendly with the Kremlin.Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 who followed through with that meeting last June, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner \u2014 said the lawyer promised information damaging to Hillary Clinton but failed to deliver, and quickly switched to a contentious issue involving United States-Russia relations.The pageant took place at a Crocus Group complex, and it put Mr. Trump in contact with influential people in Russia, as he explained in a September 2015 interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d\u201cI called it my weekend in Moscow,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who had announced his candidacy for president a few months earlier. He added: \u201cI was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people. I can\u2019t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.\u201dEmin Agalarov, who is known for being accompanied by beautiful women, and was once married to the daughter of the president of Azerbaijan, has said his relationship with Mr. Trump began when he requested that Olivia Culpo, the 2012 Miss Universe, star in a music video he was making for a song called \u201cAmor.\u201dIn January 2013, the Agalarovs traveled to Las Vegas to meet with Mr. Trump. The Miss USA pageant was being held there, and at the end of the competition, Mr. Trump announced that the Agalarovs would host the Miss Universe competition in Moscow later that year.While in Russia, some of the contestants were required to film scenes for the \u201cAmor\u201d video, among them Erin Brady, that year\u2019s Miss USA winner. During an interview earlier this year, Ms. Brady said that the women weren\u2019t paid for the work and that it was seen as a requirement.The pop star made an impression.\u201cIf you think of a traditional Russian person, they\u2019re like serious,\u201d Ms. Brady said. \u201cHe was laughing and much more outgoing. He made everyone feel very welcome.\u201dShe added: \u201cHe was excited that all of these women from all over the world were part of his production.\u201dDuring his time in Moscow, Mr. Trump also found time to film a scene for the video.There also was discussion of development deals \u2014 and introductions to other well-connected Russians.Phil Ruffin, Mr. Trump\u2019s partner at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas, who flew to Moscow for the competition, said he and Mr. Trump had lunch with the Agalarovs at the Ritz-Carlton.But after the Miss Universe weekend, his father sounded optimistic and grateful to the Agalarovs.\u201cNow that he ran and was elected, he does not forget his friends,\u201d he told the magazine.Emin Agalarov also said he exchanged messages with Donald Trump Jr. as recently as January.The Miss Universe pageant has been the subject of particular intrigue for months, given the federal investigation into the Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the presidential election, and the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials \u2014 a claim that the president and his associates have denied.Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement on Sunday that Ms. Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, did not provide any information of value about Mrs. Clinton, his father\u2019s opponent in last year\u2019s election, during the June 2016 meeting.

{"Headline": "Only Six Nations Have Evaluated Readiness for Global Pandemic", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal HealthJust three wealthy countries \u2014 Finland, Saudi Arabia and the United States \u2014 have gone through two external evaluations of their readiness to face pandemics, one for human diseases and one for animal outbreaks, the study found.As of last April, only three poor countries \u2014 Eritrea, Pakistan and Tanzania \u2014 had undergone both evaluations and had described how they planned to find the money to rectify their weaknesses.The unusually concise and crisp report, \u201cFrom Panic and Neglect to Investing in Health Security,\u201d was written by experts from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the African and Asian development banks, and finance officials from various governments.The external evaluations are done in cooperation with the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health, a Paris-based United Nations agency. (Even diseases that infect only animals can damage economies by curtailing meat exports, for example, or driving up domestic food prices.)The annual number of disease outbreaks around the globe has more than tripled since 1980, and air travel spreads contagions across oceans far more often.To convince countries that preparedness pays, the report included estimates of the economic damage various epidemics had done. For example, the viral pneumonia SARS \u2014 which ultimately killed only 774 people \u2014 shrank China\u2019s gross domestic product by 0.5 percent in 2003.The report also broke down costs on a per capita basis. A major flu pandemic, for example, would cost Afghanistan only $12 per citizen, but the United States $248.The American government pays 60 percent of the $4 billion disbursed each year to stop pandemics; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation alone is the third-biggest donor, covering 10 percent of the costs. Britain pays 13 percent. Canada, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Norway pay the rest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Herd of \u2018Gray Rhinos\u2019 Threatens Economy", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Let the West worry about so-called black swans, rare and unexpected events that can upset financial markets. China is more concerned about \u201cgray rhinos\u201d \u2014 large and visible problems in the economy that are ignored until they start moving fast.The rhinos are a herd of Chinese tycoons who have used a combination of political connections and raw ambition to create sprawling global conglomerates. Companies like Anbang Insurance Group, Fosun International, HNA Group and Dalian Wanda Group have feasted on cheap debt provided by state banks, spending lavishly to build their empires.Such players are now so big, so complex, so indebted and so enmeshed in the economy that the Chinese government is abruptly bringing them to heel. President Xi Jinping recently warned that financial stability is crucial to national security, while the official newspaper of the Communist Party pointed to the dangers of a \u201cgray rhinoceros,\u201d without naming specific companies.The turnabout for the first generation of post-Mao Chinese capitalists, once seen as exemplars of the country\u2019s ingenuity and economic prowess, has been swift.Fosun, run by a professed \u201cWarren Buffett of China,\u201d made multibillion-dollar deals for Club Med, Cirque du Soleil and other brands. The company was recently forced to deny speculation that its chairman, Guo Guangchang, who was briefly held by officials in 2015 for unknown reasons, was in custody again.\u201cThe downside of these new companies is that there was no one with the political or regulatory strength who could control these companies,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a boutique investment banking advisory service in Shanghai.The gray rhinos have a common characteristic: a lot of debt and many deals.For years, China\u2019s banks readily doled out loans, eager to keep pumping money into the economy. They doubled down after the global financial crisis in 2008, to prop up growth and push down the value of the currency.The conglomerates, with their stellar reputations and strong profits, were at the front of the lending line. HNA has secured a $90 billion credit line from state-controlled banks. Anbang spent more than $10 billion in three years, deals that were financed mostly by selling so-called wealth management products \u2014 opaque investments promising high rates and low risk.With state money in hand, companies looked beyond their borders, at the urging of the government. Over the past five years, Wanda, Anbang, HNA Group and Fosun have made at least $41 billion of overseas acquisitions, according to Dealogic, a research firm.The country\u2019s debt levels soared. In 2011, total credit extended to private, nonfinancial companies was about 120 percent of economic output in China. It is now 166 percent.\u201cThe Chinese government played the role of an indispensable enabler,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics. \u201cIf you look at how they got so big, it\u2019s all through taking on debt.\u201dBy 2015, China\u2019s economy was losing steam. And the government, which had been looking for ways to reinvest all the dollars pouring into the country, suddenly needed to prevent all the money from flowing out. Beijing had to dip deep into its pockets to keep the currency from sinking.The government started taking a closer look at the most prolific deal makers. In December, four big Chinese regulators, in a rare joint statement, warned about \u201cirrational\u201d investments in overseas real estate, entertainment and sports, calling the areas rife with \u201crisks and hidden dangers.\u201dSome of the conglomerates\u2019 purchases appeared to fit that description.Fosun bought Britain\u2019s Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club. It was among a number of Chinese deals for soccer teams, including AC Milan, Inter Milan and FC Sochaux.Anbang was in a protracted battle for the Starwood hotel chain, bidding up the price and drawing scrutiny. It eventually walked away from Starwood, which Marriott purchased for $13 billion.In recent months, the political and regulatory environment has quickly shifted. Chinese officials have also become preoccupied with preventing any disruption to the Communist Party\u2019s next congress, where the leadership is selected every five years. In the lead-up to the event this fall, the government is putting a premium on stability.The climate has put a chill on big deal makers. Fosun has nearly stopped its frenetic deal making.

Policy that will affect the lives of millions of Americans (and may ruin many of those lives), that will shape a sixth of the economy, is being rushed through a process that is both chaotic and cynical.And later that day, he voted for that very bill, even though, you guessed it, it hadn\u2019t changed in any significant way.You might ask, why not just vote no and try to come up with actually good policy? Because, as they also know, Republicans don\u2019t have any good policies to offer, so a bum\u2019s rush is the only way they can pass anything. And, until that last-minute vote, McCain, who has demanded a return to \u201cregular order\u201d in the Senate, turns out to be perfectly willing to help the bums get rushed.When we look at the degeneration of American politics, it\u2019s natural to blame the naked partisans \u2014 people like Mitch McConnell, with his principle-free will to power, or Ted Cruz, with his ideological rigidity. And Trump has, of course, done more to degrade his office than any previous occupant of the White House.But none of what is happening right now would be possible without the acquiescence of politicians who pretend to be open-minded, decry partisanship, tut-tut about incivility and act as enablers for the extremists again and again.I started with McCain because so many journalists still fall for his pose as an independent-minded maverick, ignoring the reality that he has almost always been a reliable partisan yes-man whenever it matters. Incredibly, some commentators actually praised his performance earlier this week, focusing on his noble-sounding words and ignoring his utterly craven actions.Credit where credit is due: two senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have stood up against the effort to betray every promise Republicans have made \u2014 and McCain did something right in the end. But every other supposed moderate in the Senate has offered a profile in cowardice.And let\u2019s be clear: This story didn\u2019t start in the last few weeks, or the past few months. Republicans have been denouncing Obamacare and pledging to repeal and replace it for seven years, only to be caught flat-footed when given the chance to come up with an alternative. Shouldn\u2019t someone in the G.O.P. have asked, \u201cHey, guys, what is our plan, anyway? If we don\u2019t have one, shouldn\u2019t we consider helping make this law work?\u201d But nobody did.So will the Senate pass something awful? If it does, will the House pass it, too, or try to use it as a Trojan horse for something even worse? I don\u2019t know. But whatever happens, every Senate Republican besides Collins and Murkowski should be deeply ashamed.This column has been updated to reflect news developments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Offers \u2018Great Repeal Bill,\u2019 and Opponents Promise \u2018Hell\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter her gamble in calling an early general election backfired last month, Mrs. May now faces the formidable task of negotiating with the other 27 European Union member countries while knowing that she could be undercut by her own Parliament at any time as she pushes ahead on British withdrawal, known as Brexit.Amid open speculation about her political longevity, Mrs. May had little to celebrate on her anniversary in Downing Street, and on Thursday she told the BBC that she had shed a \u201clittle tear\u201d when she first learned of exit polls indicating that her decision to hold a general election had deprived her Conservative Party of its majority.Her mood may not have been lifted by colorful criticism from Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, a respected spending watchdog. He compared the government\u2019s approach to Brexit to a chocolate orange, a treat popular in Britain, in that it might fall apart \u201cat the first tap.\u201dYet, Mrs. May\u2019s problems are likely to be just beginning with the introduction of the 66-page bill, designed to transfer European Union law onto the British statute book. The bill, once seen as largely technocratic, seems likely to pitch her into battle with opposition parties and could draw her government into a political quagmire.Introducing the document, David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, said it would allow Britain to quit the bloc \u201cwith maximum certainty, continuity and control.\u201dAlthough Mrs. May has the support of 10 Northern Irish lawmakers from the ultraconservative Democratic Unionist Party, she can lose a vote with the defection of as few as seven of her own Conservative Party lawmakers. There are thought to be 20 to 30 such potential rebels who are alarmed at Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit plans, which put the control of immigration ahead of economic considerations and reject any post-Brexit role for the European Court of Justice.The Labour Party says it accepts the result of last year\u2019s referendum in which 52 percent of those who voted opted to leave the European Union. However, it is campaigning to maintain closer economic ties with the bloc than Mrs. May wants, a message that with anti-austerity themes seemed to resonate with voters in last month\u2019s election.Labour has yet to explain how this could be achieved, in line with its other objectives, such as controlling immigration. But it senses the opportunity to harass the government, further undermine the prime minister\u2019s diminished authority and possibly force her from power.One option for the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could be to ally with those in the Conservative Party who want a \u201csofter\u201d Brexit than Mrs. May \u2014 one that prioritizes the economy \u2014 exposing the government divisions and possibly defeating it.Mrs. May also has no majority in the House of the Lords, the unelected chamber of the British Parliament, which many analysts expect to cause her trouble, too.The government is delaying any vote on the repeal bill until the autumn, with Mrs. May hoping for some respite over the summer months when lawmakers head for their vacations.There is also controversy over plans to deploy so-called Henry VIII clauses that gained their name from the Statute of Proclamations in 1539, which gave the king power to legislate by proclamation. The use of the mechanism is intended to speed the legislative process by avoiding full scrutiny of each law and directive by Parliament.Despite the fragility of Mrs. May\u2019s position, her party seems to have little appetite to replace her, partly because that would awaken deep divisions over the type of Brexit that should be pursued.However, Mrs. May\u2019s recent efforts to relaunch her premiership, by appealing for dialogue among all parties, seem to have fallen flat among opposition politicians who know she called the snap election with the idea of crushing the Labour Party, which at the start of the campaign trailed badly in opinion polls.In a statement, Mr. Corbyn said Mrs. May \u201cnow heads a zombie government, with no ideas, no answers and no leadership.\u201d\u201cThis is a government in name only, having to ask other parties to \u2018clarify and improve\u2019 its policies and delaying most parliamentary business until the autumn,\u201d he added.In an indication of the emotions the Brexit debate has raised in some quarters, Rhodri Philipps, the fourth Viscount St. Davids, was sentenced Thursday to 12 weeks in jail for what prosecutors called a \u201cvicious hate campaign\u201d directed at Gina Miller, a lawyer who won a case forcing the government to consult Parliament on the issue.In a social media rant, the viscount, a resident of London\u2019s Knightsbridge district, offered 5,000 pounds, about $6,500, to anyone who \u201caccidentally\u201d ran over \u201cthis troublesome first-generation immigrant\u201d and \u201cboat jumper.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just. Cut. Taxes.", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the world is what it is, and a party that offers nothing, whose ideological sclerosis and internal contradictions allow it to offer nothing, might as well just go pass a tax cut and call it a day.It is no secret that this is what President Trump desires. The only reason we have spent so many months wandering the dark wood of Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that the Republican leadership in Congress persuaded itself that it could pull off a complicated fiscal maneuver, using health care reform to change the budget baseline in anticipation of a tax reform more comprehensive and enduring than George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts 15 years ago.It couldn\u2019t, because there was never anything close to a Republican consensus about what health care reform should do. But this grand strategy\u2019s failure still leaves the party with a simpler option, one that would satisfy the yearning for tax cuts that remains a divided conservatism\u2019s only certain common ground. Republicans could just go ahead and cut taxes the way Bush did \u2014 without major offsets but with a 10-year expiration date, so that all you would need is 50 votes plus Mike Pence to do it.I\u2019m not saying that Republicans couldn\u2019t still do a comprehensive and permanent tax reform in theory. Set health care aside entirely and there are still lots of clever and plausible ways to overhaul and improve the tax code without sacrificing revenue.But Republicans don\u2019t seem equipped to pull off anything complicated, they don\u2019t look united enough to take political risks, and they aren\u2019t ideologically ready to pass anything heretical. So barring a sudden transformation in the party and its leadership, a temporary, deficit-financed tax cut is the only thing that has a decent chance of happening.And while it\u2019s not the greatest idea, neither is it a terrible one. One reason among many that Obamacare repeal has run aground is that the deficit picture doesn\u2019t look as dire as it did when the health care law was passed \u2014 and Obamacare itself is not driving the kind of spending surge that many of its critics (myself included) feared.Meanwhile, economic growth is still sluggish, wage growth is tepid, and the work force participation rate is still below pre-recession levels. The best time for right-wing Keynesianism was probably four years ago \u2014 ah, for the Romney administration. But the economy is stagnant enough that you can make a decent tax-cuts-as-stimulus case, especially if Republicans were to focus on corporate and payroll taxes, on business and workers, instead of just aiming for the lowest possible top income tax rate.And if the tax cuts are pegged to expire in a decade, you\u2019ll have a built-in opportunity to negotiate deficit reduction in 2027, when the Rock is president, Kid Rock is running the Senate, and the speaker of the House is an as-yet-undiscovered YouTube star.Sorry, slipped into nihilism for a minute there. Back to deficit-financed tax cuts: They\u2019re suboptimal and risky, but they have a basic appeal to Republican politicians, they\u2019re more politically marketable than what the party was trying (I use that word loosely) to accomplish with health care, and they might actually give the Trump economy a still-needed boost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron\u2019s Shaky Embrace of de Gaulle", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs the first president of the Fifth Republic, de Gaulle wished to impose on the nation \u2014 and on its military \u2014 an executive authority so powerful that France would regain not just stability, but also its former glory in world affairs. Military spending was key to this ambition.De Gaulle did not hold back. By 1960, France was spending 5.4 percent of its gross domestic product on the armed forces. In the decade that followed, the foundation was laid for the country\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet and aircraft carriers, allowing France to project power far and wide.De Gaulle\u2019s vision could not have been realized without a flourishing economy. During the decade he was in power, France\u2019s annual G.D.P. growth was a 5.7 percent, outpacing that of every other European nation except West Germany.Mr. Macron, a political neophyte who rose to the nation\u2019s top office in May, has taken control of a much different country, one dismissed in many quarters as \u201cthe sick man of Europe.\u201d And not only has France\u2019s economy long been stagnant, but its sense of identity has also been shaken.Mr. Macron\u2019s neoliberalism is offered as part of the antidote to the economic woes: He seems determined to loosen workplace rules and lighten corporate tax burdens. He is also promising to make substantial state investments in infrastructure and innovative industries in order to lift the economy and lower unemployment.Enter General de Villiers. Reappointed to his post last month by the president, the general has been vocal about the depleted state of the armed forces. \u201cI have a fine army,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is doing 130 percent of what it was meant to do.\u201dFor the past two years, France has had some 20,000 men and women active in operational theaters \u2014 a strain on any army \u2014 the majority committed to regions in Africa and the Middle East once under French control. Moreover, several thousand soldiers have been called up to reinforce the police since the wave of terrorist attacks began in 2015.Crucially, it is not just a matter of material, but also morale. How to attract and retain recruits if the services are battered by years of budget cuts?General de Villiers told the French media that Mr. Macron had promised he would fulfill his campaign pledge to increase military spending to 2 percent of G.D.P. from around 1.78 percent. And Mr. Macron has seemed sympathetic, making several visits with military personnel during his first days in office.Mr. Macron was not amused. Following General de Villiers comments to the parliamentary committee, he reminded an audience of top military brass (including General de Villiers) who their boss was \u2014 \u201cJe suis votre chef\u201d \u2014 and warned them against engaging in public pressure or commentary. He insisted he would keep his word and begin the military buildup in 2018. Moreover, if the military command does not agree with the president, he said to the French media, it is the former that must change or be changed.On Wednesday, General de Villiers took Mr. Macron\u2019s words to heart, declaring in his resignation letter that he no longer believed he could guarantee the French Army\u2019s ability to both protect France and support the nation\u2019s global ambitions. On Thursday, as unease deepened in the ranks of military leaders, Mr. Macron made an unscheduled visit to a military base to announce that, come 2018, the defense budget will be increased by nearly 1.8 billion euros.Mr. Macron\u2019s rhetoric and theatrics reveal that he is committed to the Gaullist projection of hard power, but his experience in finance and government show that he is wedded to budgetary restraint.In his speech at the military base, he told the soldiers that he knows \u201cwhat France owes\u201d them. But he has also told the French what his government owes them: a 50 billion euro investment in training programs and infrastructure, all the while offering tax relief and keeping the national deficit at the European Union-imposed 3 percent of G.D.P.The coming months will reveal how Mr. Macron will balance these priorities. As another of his political heroes, Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France, observed, \u201cTo govern means to choose.\u201dRobert Zaretsky teaches at the University of Houston and is at work on a book on Catherine the Great and the French Enlightenment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Texas Bathroom Bill Has Emotions, and Stakes, Running High", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "Supported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Amid conflicting pressures from gay rights groups, social conservatives, corporations and the state\u2019s Republican leadership, the Texas Senate on Friday waded back into the volatile issue of restricting bathroom use by transgender people in government buildings and schools.The issue, which roiled North Carolina for more than a year and led to boycotts and other economic blowback, has become one of the most heated and high-stakes political dramas in Texas. It has deepened the divide between moderate Republicans and social conservatives and caused widespread fears that a wave of boycotts and protests would do serious damage to the Texas economy, which is still feeling the effects of a drop in the price of oil.Given the presence in Texas, the second most populous state, of three of the nation\u2019s 10 largest cities, the economic stakes from boycotts or cancellations of concerts and athletic events could dwarf what played out in North Carolina.The so-called bathroom bill was approved by a Republican-dominated Senate committee on Friday evening and now heads to the full Senate for a vote, part of a fast-paced push by social conservatives to try to pass the measure into law in the coming weeks.Earlier on Friday, more than 250 supporters and opponents of the bill signed up to testify before the Senate Committee on State Affairs. The testimony began in the morning and continued into the evening. The hearing centered on two bills requiring transgender people to use the bathroom, locker room or shower that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity, in public buildings, including schools. The version that the committee ultimately approved passed by a vote of 8 to 1.The newly elected mayor of San Antonio, Ron Nirenberg, told the senators in opposing the bill that the mere filing of it has already cost his city millions of dollars in lost conventions. A number of transgender Texans testified against it, including Sierra Jane Davis, 22, a transgender woman from Austin and a former Marine.Ms. Davis, who has the Marine Corps emblem tattooed on her left arm, said in an interview outside the hearing that the bill would \u201copen the floodgates to more and more legislation, and lets the public see that we are allowed to be discriminated against.\u201dAlisa Miller, an Austin resident who is the mother of a 15-year-old transgender girl, prepared to testify wearing a gray T-shirt reading, \u201cDon\u2019t Discriminate in the Lone Star State.\u201d Her daughter, Maeve, who transitioned to a girl when she was 14, now uses the girls\u2019 room at her Austin high school and worries about being bullied if she is forced to use a boys\u2019 room.\u201cShe\u2019s very concerned,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially not a safe situation for her.\u201dSocial conservatives, led by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have denied that the bill discriminates against anyone and have accused critics of exaggerating the potential economic damage. They said the issue is about public safety and women\u2019s privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s not about transgender,\u201d Trayce Bradford, the president of a conservative group called the Texas Eagle Forum, told the Senate committee. \u201cIt\u2019s about feeling safe. There has to be some boundaries.\u201dMs. Bradford, who said she was stalked and sexually assaulted in college, said conservative activists have been unfairly accused of spreading hate by backing the legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any conservative who wants to serve as the potty police,\u201d she said.Terry Holcomb, a leader of the Republican Party of Texas who testified in support of the bill, described it as a common-sense issue that has been \u201cdeliberately misconstrued and mischaracterized.\u201d Charles Flowers, the senior pastor of Faith Outreach Center International in San Antonio, who was planning to testify but ultimately did not, said he and other ministers have urged their congregations to tell lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill, which he said would leave women and girls \u201cat risk\u201d without its protections.\u201cIt\u2019s not a Democratic or Republican issue,\u201d Mr. Flowers said.On Sunday, IBM took out full-page ads in major Texas newspapers, saying that the company \u201cfirmly opposes\u201d any measure that would harm the state\u2019s gay, lesbian and transgender community and make it harder for businesses to recruit and retain talent.The next day, the chief executives of 14 Dallas-based companies \u2014 including corporate giants like American Airlines, AT&T Inc., Southwest Airlines and Texas Instruments \u2014 sent a letter to the governor expressing concern that the bill \u201cwould seriously hurt the state\u2019s ability to attract new businesses, investment and jobs.\u201dAnd on Wednesday, the presiding officers of the Episcopal Church wrote to the speaker of the Texas House and suggested that if the bill passed, the church would cancel its nine-day General Convention in Austin scheduled for July 2018.\u201cIn 1955, we were forced to move a General Convention from Houston to another state because Texas laws prohibited black and white Episcopalians from being treated equally,\u201d read the letter from Bishop Michael B. Curry and another leader. \u201cWe would not stand then for Episcopalians to be discriminated against, and we cannot countenance it now.\u201dJeff Moseley, chief executive of the Texas Association of Business, the state\u2019s most influential business lobby, announced that the group was taking its opposition to the bill to the airwaves by making a \u201cseven-figure media buy.\u201d The group has long aligned itself with the state\u2019s conservative causes and issues, and has rarely taken public stands on social issues.\u201cThe bathroom bill distracts from the real challenges we face and would result in terrible economic consequences \u2014 on talent, on tourism, on investment, on growth, and on small businesses,\u201d Mr. Moseley said in a statement.The Legislature failed to pass a bathroom bill during the regular legislative session that ended in May, with moderate Republicans in the House clashing with social conservatives in the Senate. Several Republicans in the House, led by Joe Straus, the speaker, worry that a North Carolina-style series of boycotts, canceled conventions and negative national attention would hit Texas if the bill passed.The lieutenant governor, Mr. Patrick, who has been the driving force behind the bill, effectively forced Gov. Greg Abbott to call lawmakers back for a 30-day special session to give the bathroom bill another shot at passage. Mr. Patrick used legislation that was vital to keeping a few government agencies operating as a tool to get Mr. Abbott to order lawmakers back to Austin.The bathroom bill was expected to easily win approval in the Senate during the special session, which began on Tuesday, but its chances are less assured in the House, and it was unclear whether moderate Republicans will be successful in stalling, killing or watering down the bill.The measure was filed by State Senator Lois W. Kolkhorst, a Republican, and requires all multiple-occupancy restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public buildings to be designated for and used only by \u201cpersons of the same sex as stated on a person\u2019s birth certificate.\u201d The bill applies to multiple-occupancy restrooms in local government buildings and public schools.It also prohibits localities and schools from adopting anti-discrimination policies that allow transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Will Service Work Look Like Under Amazon?", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyMackey\u2019s was perhaps the clearest articulation of a species of corporate messaging that emerged in the \u201990s and took hold in the 2000s: that of the reluctant captain of industry, the community-minded national chain and the compassionate employer. (Think Trader Joe\u2019s, the Container Store, Panera Bread, Starbucks or Jamba Juice.) It was accompanied by the rise of the conscientious \u2014 and typically affluent \u2014 consumer, for whom purchases could be not just ma\u00adteri\u00adally but also morally aspirational. The food was ethically sourced, but crucially, the labor was, too.Lately this moment in the American service industry feels somewhat distant. It was a response to a different time: Retail and service jobs were on the rise, both in objective terms and in their share of the total work force. From 1989 to 1999, while the economy lost more than 1.4 million manufacturing jobs, it gained more than twice as many in retail alone. Back then, some said that with a few twists of the dial and a better-educated class of consumers, service work could be remade into something more careerlike, offering employees structure, predictability and dignity \u2014 and wealthier customers a form of absolution.It was, mainly, good marketing \u2014 triumphant liberal ideals expressed in the language of the heart. The economy of the late \u201990s was characterized by exuberant consumerism; companies like Whole Foods had devised a way to make people feel better about the products they were buying as well as the people they were interacting with. Whole Foods employees, customers were informed, earned a \u2018\u2018fair\u2019\u2019 wage; they had a say in how stores were managed and in what products they stocked; they were voluntarily given benefits; they were not regarded as employees but as \u2018\u2018team members,\u2019\u2019 working for their employer\u2019s profit while keeping an eye on the health and betterment of their communities.Amazon\u2019s plans for Whole Foods are the subject of plenty of speculation. But one thing is certain: The Mackey marketing playbook \u2014 bringing labor to the fore in order to assure customers that they are A-O.K. and in good hands \u2014 has little to offer Amazon, which can and does regard labor as a simple commodity. In contrast to Whole Foods, which focuses in its marketing on fair-trade and locally sourced offerings, Amazon is made up of a dizzying array of supply chains that are effectively invisible: not hidden, just easily omitted from the consumer experience.I didn\u2019t lay eyes on a single Amazon employee during Prime Day, except for the home-shopping-marathon talent, leaving the onus on me to wonder what was going on behind the scenes. Aside from the \u2018\u2018origin scan\u2019\u2019 on my track-your-shipment page, I won\u2019t know a thing about where my package came from, or be reminded of how it got to me. I will be told nothing about Hulislem. Amazon need not bother to tell a story; in fact, its goal is to reduce the retail story to a single button, an instant, an unprecedentedly complex process taken for granted.Mackey sought to build a more ethical company, and to herald a more ethical mode of consumption. He sought to take the politics out of labor and the labor out of politics. Amazon, by contrast, doesn\u2019t try to tell you yet another story about what it does and who it pays to do it. It bets \u2014 rightly, ruthlessly \u2014 that you\u2019d be more comfortable with no story at all.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

In this medieval city at the foot of the Apennines, it\u2019s all about trains.A stimulus program by the European Central Bank helped revive the train factory that is the largest employer in Pistoia, hauling the city out of a deep economic slump and putting people back to work.But the bank is now preparing to take away that stimulus, raising an existential question for Pistoia, a case study in what central bank largess has achieved, and in what might happen when it is no longer there.But analysts agree that the day is not far away when places like Pistoia will have to stand on their own.Only a few years ago Pistoia, which has a population of 92,000, was mired in economic gloom. The local factory, then owned by the Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, had produced trains for more than a century, but the downturn was taking its toll.The factory was short of orders and in danger of closing. It laid off hundreds of workers and put others on reduced hours. Dozens of companies that supplied it went out of business. Young people emigrated to Australia in search of better opportunities, while right-wing and populist parties exploited the insecurity to increase their influence in the local government.\u201cThere was a lot of fear,\u201d said Jury Citera, secretary of the main union representing workers at the plant. \u201cNo one thought there was a future at the company.\u201dAll told, the bank has spent 2 trillion newly conjured euros, or $2.3 trillion, buying bonds in a bid to push down market interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and easier.Among the bonds it bought were those issued by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, the government-owned company that manages the Italian rail network. It, in turn, used the money to order 39 trains for regional services.Suddenly there was work in Pistoia again.\u201cA few years ago we felt like we were on a stationary bicycle, pedaling but going nowhere,\u201d said Antonella Nannetti, another union official. \u201cNow we are moving again.\u201dFerrovie dello Stato Italiane had been planning to buy new trains anyway, said Stefano Pierini, its finance director. But lower interest rates helped speed up the investment and allowed a bigger order. The same principle, writ large, has helped the eurozone achieve its most solid growth in a decade.The European Central Bank says its bond buying program does not target specific countries, let alone individual communities.But by buying public sector and corporate bonds in grand style, the bank creates more demand and allows governments and companies to issue debt with lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case. The program\u2019s ultimate aim is to lower the cost of credit, stimulate growth and raise annual inflation closer to the official target of nearly 2 percent.If central bank bond buying is helping companies in places like Pistoia to invest and expand, \u201cit is definitely a positive,\u201d Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview.The purchases of corporate bonds have covered a broad range of industries across the 19 nations of the eurozone. They include debt issued by the brewers Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken, by the pharmaceutical makers Novartis and Roche, by the fashion eyewear maker Luxottica, and by consumer products companies including Nestl\u00e9, Unilever and a Belgian unit of Coca-Cola.But an examination by The New York Times of the purchases, which the central bank identifies only by bond serial numbers, reveals one clear theme: infrastructure.That is especially true in Italy.In addition to the railroad company, the central bank has bought debt issued by Autostrade per l\u2019Italia, which builds and manages Italian roads, as well as by utilities and energy companies. One is Hera, a waste and water management company in Bologna, which is using part of the money it raised to build a plant that will convert organic waste into natural gas.Effectively, the European Central Bank is financing an enormous public works program in Italy.Despite sunny weather, Pistoia\u2019s pedestrian zone was practically empty on Monday. Edda Iozzini was still in a good mood. \u201cMoney is in circulation again,\u201d the 66-year-old, who owns a newsstand, said between drags of a cigarette. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy in Pistoia.\u201dWhether that feeling remains once the stimulus punch bowl is removed is an open question. After a slump that lasted a decade, growth in the eurozone has surpassed the United States\u2019, and unemployment is falling. For all intents and purposes, the credit crunch is over, analysts say.But there remain trouble spots \u2014 notably Italy. The country\u2019s banks are still working off an enormous backlog of problem loans, and credit remains tight.\u201cQuantitative easing has been very important,\u201d Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian oil and gas giant Eni, said in an interview. \u201cWithout it, Italy would have had a lot of problems.\u201dBut Ms. Marcegaglia said she thought the Italian economy was improving and could withstand a gradual decline in central bank stimulus.Pistoia\u2019s prospects appear good because money flowing into the area since 2015 has been used to improve the region\u2019s competitiveness.The Japanese industrial conglomerate Hitachi bought the train factory from Finmeccanica just as the European Central Bank released its gusher of cheap credit. Workers in Pistoia say Hitachi brought technological know-how as well as a willingness to modernize the plant. (Hitachi declined to comment for this article.)The revival of the factory has restored not only the workers\u2019 livelihoods but also their pride.\u201cNow we feel we can show what we can do,\u201d said Marco Fontana, who represents administrative employees at the factory. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show we are real members of the European Union and not some little province.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Excerpts From The Times\u2019s Interview With Trump", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump spoke on Wednesday with three New York Times reporters \u2014 Peter Baker, Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman \u2014 in an exclusive interview in the Oval Office. Also in attendance was Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman. At one point, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump appeared at the door, and her daughter, Arabella, entered the room. The following are excerpts from that conversation, transcribed by The Times. They have been lightly edited for content and clarity, and omit several off-the-record comments and asides. Read more coverage and analysis of the interview \u00bb_________TRUMP: Hi fellas, how you doing?BAKER: Good. Good. How was your lunch [with Republican senators]?TRUMP: It was good. We are very close. It\u2019s a tough \u2014 you know, health care. Look, Hillary Clinton worked eight years in the White House with her husband as president and having majorities and couldn\u2019t get it done. Smart people, tough people \u2014 couldn\u2019t get it done. Obama worked so hard. They had 60 in the Senate. They had big majorities and had the White House. I mean, ended up giving away the state of Nebraska. They owned the state of Nebraska. Right. Gave it away. Their best senator did one of the greatest deals in the history of politics. What happened to him?But I think we are going to do O.K. I think we are going to see. I mean, one of my ideas was repeal. But I certainly rather would get repeal and replace, because the next last thing I want to do is start working tomorrow morning on replace. And it is time. It is tough. It\u2019s a very narrow path, winding this way. You think you have it, and then you lose four on the other side because you gave. It is a brutal process. And it was for Democrats, in all fairness.I mean, you think of Hillary Clinton, and you look, she went eight years \u2014 very capable \u2014 went eight years as the first lady, and could not get health care. So this is not an easy crack. The one thing I\u2019ll say about myself, so, Obama was in there for eight years and got Obamacare. Hillary Clinton was in there eight years and they never got Hillarycare, whatever they called it at the time. I am not in here six months, and they\u2019ll say, \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t fulfilled his agenda.\u201d I say to myself, wait a minute, I\u2019m only here a very short period of time compared to Obama. How long did it take to get Obamacare?BAKER: March, March 2010.TRUMP: So he was there for more than a year.HABERMAN: Fourteen months.TRUMP: And I\u2019m here less than six months, so, ah, you know. Something to think about.BAKER: We wrote the same stories, though, in August of 2009. \u201cObama can\u2019t get it.\u201dSCHMIDT: It died several times.HABERMAN: Several times.TRUMP: Well, it was a tough one. That was a very tough one.BAKER: He lost that election [the 2010 midterms].TRUMP: Nothing changes. Nothing changes. Once you get something for pre-existing conditions, etc., etc. Once you get something, it\u2019s awfully tough to take it away.HABERMAN: That\u2019s been the thing for four years. When you win an entitlement, you can\u2019t take it back.TRUMP: But what it does, Maggie, it means it gets tougher and tougher. As they get something, it gets tougher. Because politically, you can\u2019t give it away. So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you\u2019re 21 years old, you start working and you\u2019re paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you\u2019re 70, you get a nice plan. Here\u2019s something where you walk up and say, \u201cI want my insurance.\u201d It\u2019s a very tough deal, but it is something that we\u2019re doing a good job of.HABERMAN: Am I wrong in thinking \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to you a bunch of times about this over the last couple years, but you are generally of the view that people should have health care, right? I mean, I think that you come at it from the view of \u2026TRUMP: Yes, yes. [garbled]_________TRUMP: So I told them today, I don\u2019t want to do that. I want to either get it done or not get it done. If we don\u2019t get it done, we are going to watch Obamacare go down the tubes, and we\u2019ll blame the Democrats. And at some point, they are going to come and say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help us.\u201dBAKER: Did the senators want to try again?TRUMP: I think so. We had a great meeting. Was I late?[crosstalk]TRUMP: It was a great meeting. We had 51 show up, other than John.BAKER: Senator McCain.TRUMP: That\u2019s a lot. Normally when they call for a meeting, you have like 20.HABERMAN: How about the last one in June? Do you guys remember how many came?TRUMP: Ah, 49. It was actually 48, but John McCain was there. But I guess we had 51 today, so that counts. That shows the spirit.BAKER: Who is the key guy?TRUMP: Well, they are all key. The problem is we have 52 votes. Don\u2019t forget, you look at Obama, he had 60. That\u2019s a big difference. So, we have 52 votes. Now, I guess we lose Susan Collins. I guess we lose Rand Paul. Then we can\u2019t lose any votes. That is a very tough standard. Statistically, you want to bet on that all day long. With that being said, I think we had a great meeting. I think we had a great meeting.HABERMAN: Where does it go from here, do you think?TRUMP: Well, I say, let\u2019s not vote on repeal. Let\u2019s just vote on this. So first, they vote on the vote. And that happens sometime Friday?HABERMAN: Next week.TRUMP: Or Monday? Monday. And then they\u2019ll vote on this, and we\u2019ll see. We have some meetings scheduled today. I think we have six people who are really sort of O.K. They are all good people. We don\u2019t have bad people. I know the bad people. Believe me, do I know bad people.And we have a very good group of people, and I think they want to get there. So we\u2019ll see what happens. But it\u2019s tough.SCHMIDT: How\u2019s [Mitch] McConnell to work with?TRUMP: I like him. I mean, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s good. It\u2019s been a tough process for him.HABERMAN: He\u2019s taken on some water.TRUMP: Yeah. It\u2019s been a tough process for him. This health care is a tough deal. I said it from the beginning. No. 1, you know, a lot of the papers were saying \u2014 actually, these guys couldn\u2019t believe it, how much I know about it. I know a lot about health care. [garbled] This is a very tough time for him, in a sense, because of the importance. And I believe we get there.This is a very tough time for them, in a sense, because of the importance. And I believe that it\u2019s [garbled], that makes it a lot easier. It\u2019s a mess. One of the things you get out of this, you get major tax cuts, and reform. And if you add what the people are going to save in the middle income brackets, if you add that to what they\u2019re saving with health care, this is like a windfall for the country, for the people. So, I don\u2019t know, I thought it was a great meeting. I bet the number\u2019s \u2014 I bet the real number\u2019s four. But let\u2019s say six or eight. And everyone\u2019s [garbled], so statistically, that\u2019s a little dangerous, right?BAKER: Pretty tight.TRUMP: I hope we don\u2019t have any grandstanders. I don\u2019t think we do.[garbled]TRUMP: I think it will be pretty bad for them if they did. I don\u2019t think we have any \u2014 I think it would be very bad for \u2014 I think this is something the people want. They\u2019ve been promised it._________HABERMAN: [In Paris], I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you look like you were enjoying yourself that much since the convention, really.TRUMP: I have had the best reviews on foreign land. So I go to Poland and make a speech. Enemies of mine in the media, enemies of mine are saying it was the greatest speech ever made on foreign soil by a president. I\u2019m saying, man, they cover [garbled]. You saw the reviews I got on that speech. Poland was beautiful and wonderful, and the reception was incredible.And then, went to France the following week, because it was the 100th year. [inaudible] The Paris Accord \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to get along with France for a little while, because people forget, because it is a very unfair agreement to us. China doesn\u2019t get [garbled] until 2030. Russia goes back to 1994 as a standard \u2014 a much, much lower standard. India has things that are [garbled]. I want to do the same thing as everyone else. We can\u2019t do that? We can\u2019t do that? That\u2019s O.K. Let me get out. Frankly, the people that like me, love that I got out.After that, it was fairly surprising. He [President Emmanuel Macron of France] called me and said, \u201cI\u2019d love to have you there and honor you in France,\u201d having to do with Bastille Day. Plus, it\u2019s the 100th year of the First World War. That\u2019s big. And I said yes. I mean, I have a great relationship with him. He\u2019s a great guy.HABERMAN: He was very deferential to you. Very.TRUMP: He\u2019s a great guy. Smart. Strong. Loves holding my hand.HABERMAN: I\u2019ve noticed.TRUMP: People don\u2019t realize he loves holding my hand. And that\u2019s good, as far as that goes._________TRUMP: I mean, really. He\u2019s a very good person. And a tough guy, but look, he has to be. I think he is going to be a terrific president of France. But he does love holding my hand.[crosstalk]TRUMP: At that note, the cameras are gone. I was standing there with him, with probably hundreds of thousands of people.HABERMAN: It was a very crowded [garbled].TRUMP: And it was one of the most beautiful parades I have ever seen. And in fact, we should do one one day down Pennsylvania Ave.HABERMAN: I wondered if you were going to say that.TRUMP: I\u2019ve always thought of that.HABERMAN: Really?TRUMP: I\u2019ve always thought of that. I\u2019ve thought of it long before.TRUMP: But the Bastille Day parade was \u2014 now that was a super-duper \u2014 O.K. I mean, that was very much more than normal. They must have had 200 planes over our heads. Normally you have the planes and that\u2019s it, like the Super Bowl parade. And everyone goes crazy, and that\u2019s it. That happened for \u2014 and you know what else that was nice? It was limited. You know, it was two hours, and the parade ended. It didn\u2019t go a whole day. They didn\u2019t go crazy. You don\u2019t want to leave, but you have to. Or you want to leave, really.These things are going on all day. It was a two-hour parade. They had so many different zones. Maybe 100,000 different uniforms, different divisions, different bands. Then we had the retired, the older, the ones who were badly injured. The whole thing, it was an incredible thing.HABERMAN: It was beautiful.TRUMP: And you are looking at the Arc [de Triomphe]. So we are standing in the most beautiful buildings, and we are looking down the road, and like three miles in, and then you had the Arc. And then you have these soldiers. Everyone was so proud. Honestly, it was a beautiful thing. I was glad I did it.People were surprised because I\u2019d just come back from Hamburg. So I was back for three days, and then I had to go out again. But when he [Mr. Macron] invited me, he and I have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with Merkel [Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany]. Do you know what happened with Merkel? So I am sitting in the chair. We\u2019d been sitting there for two hours. So it\u2019s not like, \u201cNice to see ya.\u201d So the press comes in. So I guess someone screamed out, \u201cShake her hand, shake her hand!\u201d I didn\u2019t even hear. So I didn\u2019t shake her hand, because I\u2019d been with her for so long. I\u2019d been with her for a long period of time. So I didn\u2019t shake her \u2014 the next day, \u201cTrump refused to shake\u2026\u201d [garbled]_________TRUMP: She actually called me, and she said, um, \u201cYou know, I think we get along very well.\u201d I said we do, we really do. I said, \u201cYou gotta put more money into NATO,\u201d No. 1. And No. 2 is like, our trade imbalance is ridiculous. You know, it\u2019s a money machine._________TRUMP: It\u2019s been a long time. Nothing changes. Wait till you see what we\u2019re going to do on trade.HABERMAN: Sounds like it\u2019s going to be very interesting.TRUMP: Much more interesting than anybody would understand.HABERMAN: O.K._________BAKER: Will you go to Britain? Are you going to make a state visit to Britain? Are you going to be able to do that?TRUMP: As to Britain?BAKER: Yeah.HABERMAN: Will you go there?[crosstalk]TRUMP: Ah, they\u2019ve asked me. What was interesting \u2014 so, when Macron asked, I said: \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a good thing for me to go to Paris? I just ended the Paris Accord last week. Is this a good thing?\u201d He said, \u201cThey love you in France.\u201d I said, \u201cO.K., I just don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d_________TRUMP: We had dinner at the Eiffel Tower, and the bottom of the Eiffel Tower looked like they could have never had a bigger celebration ever in the history of the Eiffel Tower. I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people, \u2019cause they heard we were having dinner.[crosstalk/garbled]HABERMAN: You must have been so tired at, by that point.TRUMP: Yeah. It was beautiful. We toured the museum, we went to Napoleon\u2019s tomb \u2026[crosstalk]TRUMP: Well, Napoleon finished a little bit bad. But I asked that. So I asked the president, so what about Napoleon? He said: \u201cNo, no, no. What he did was incredible. He designed Paris.\u201d [garbled] The street grid, the way they work, you know, the spokes. He did so many things even beyond. And his one problem is he didn\u2019t go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather? [garbled][crosstalk/unintelligible]TRUMP: Same thing happened to Hitler. Not for that reason, though. Hitler wanted to consolidate. He was all set to walk in. But he wanted to consolidate, and it went and dropped to 35 degrees below zero, and that was the end of that army.[crosstalk]But the Russians have great fighters in the cold. They use the cold to their advantage. I mean, they\u2019ve won five wars where the armies that went against them froze to death. [crosstalk] It\u2019s pretty amazing.So, we\u2019re having a good time. The economy is doing great.SCHMIDT: The markets are doing great.TRUMP: They\u2019re going to really go up if we do what we\u2019re doing. I mean, cut regulations tremendously. Sometimes \u2014 you know, one thing they hadn\u2019t thought about at The Times, where they said I didn\u2019t really cut regulations as much. I heard that because I said \u2014 it could have been a little slip-up in terms of what I said \u2014 I meant, for the time in office, five months and couple of weeks, I think I\u2019ve done more than anyone else. They may have taken it as more than anyone else, period.[crosstalk]But I\u2019m talking about for my time. I heard that Harry Truman was first, and then we beat him. These are approved by Congress. These are not just executive orders. On the executive orders, we cut regulations tremendously. By the way, I want regulations, but, you know, some of the \u2014 you have to get nine different regulations, and you could never do anything. I\u2019ve given the farmers back their farms. I\u2019ve given the builders back their land to build houses and to build other things.The energy stuff is going really well. We\u2019re going to be an exporter \u2014 we already are an exporter of energy. We\u2019re doing well. I mean, the banks, you look at rules and regulations, you look at Dodd-Frank, Dodd-Frank is going to be, you know, modified, and again, I want rules and regulations. But you don\u2019t want to choke, right? People can\u2019t get loans to buy a pizza parlor, to buy a \u2014 you know, I saw out on the trail \u2014 people say, Mr. Trump, we\u2019ve dealt with banks, my own bank, and they can\u2019t loan me anymore. I\u2019ve never had a bad day with a bank. You know? So we\u2019ll put \u2014 yeah, because of statutory [garbled], they can\u2019t loan to that kind of a business. And they\u2019re good businesses to loan to. So I think we\u2019ve \u2014 I think we\u2019re set to really go [garbled]._________BAKER: As long as we\u2019re on the record, a lot of people are curious about your conversation with President [Vladimir V.] Putin at dinner. Not surprising. But what did you all talk about, and\u2014\u2014TRUMP: So, that dinner was a very long time planned dinner. And what it was was an evening at the opera. It was a final night goodbye from Germany and from Chancellor Merkel. It was her dinner. It was, you know, everybody knew about it. It was well-known._________TRUMP: So when we got there, it was with spouses, and when we got there, there were a thousand media. You guys know, were you guys there?BAKER: No, it was Julie [Hirschfeld Davis] and Glenn Thrush.TRUMP: So, it was tremendous media. And we took a picture of everybody, the wives and the leaders, and then the leaders, and, you know, numerous pictures outside on the river. Then everybody walked in to see the opera. Then the opera ended. Then we walked into a big room where they had dinner for not only the leaders \u2014 Lagarde [Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund] was there, who I think is terrific, and various others. You had the E.U. people there, people other than just the leaders, but quite a few people. I would say you have 20 times two, so you had 40, and then you probably had another 10 or 15 people, you had Christine Lagarde, you had some others also.So, I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe [Shinzo Abe of Japan], who I think is a terrific guy, and she\u2019s a terrific woman, but doesn\u2019t speak English.HABERMAN: Like, nothing, right? Like zero?TRUMP: Like, not \u201chello.\u201dHABERMAN: That must make for an awkward seating.TRUMP: Well, it\u2019s hard, because you know, you\u2019re sitting there for\u2014\u2014HABERMAN: Hours.TRUMP: So the dinner was probably an hour and 45 minutes._________TRUMP: You had an opera, and then you had a cocktail party for the people at the opera, and then you had the leaders with the spouses, and other leaders in Europe and maybe other places, go in. We sat at this really long table, which held, has to be at least 60, 65 people with room. O.K., it\u2019s a very big table, big room. But there was nothing secretive about it.It was like, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. And I think it even said on the list, at the request of the German chancellor and Germany, it\u2019s going to be the opera, it\u2019s going to be cocktails, it\u2019s going to be dinner. I think the crowd thinned out for the dinner \u2014 you know, it was the leaders, primarily. But the leaders and Lagarde. And [inaudible].O.K., so we\u2019re sitting at this massive table. And the wives are separated from their husbands, which sometimes they do, sometimes they don\u2019t. But they did. It\u2019s always easier when they don\u2019t do it, because you always have somebody to talk to, right? And I was sitting next to the president of Argentina \u2014 his wife \u2014 [Mauricio] Macri \u2014 nice woman, who speaks English. And the prime minister of Japan\u2019s wife, Prime Minister Abe. Great relationships. So I\u2019m sitting there. There was one interpreter for Japanese, \u2019cause otherwise it would have been even tougher. But I enjoyed the evening with her, and she\u2019s really a lovely woman, and I enjoyed \u2014 the whole thing was good.And now Melania was sitting on the other side of the table, way down on the other end, very far away. She was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, I don\u2019t know. She was sitting next to Putin.HABERMAN: She had been the whole time?TRUMP: Yes. She was sitting next to Putin.BAKER: Does she speak Russian at all?TRUMP: No. She speaks other languages.TRUMP: She was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that\u2019s the way it is. So the meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about \u2014 things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.HABERMAN: You did?TRUMP: We talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s son] had in that meeting. As I\u2019ve said \u2014 most other people, you know, when they call up and say, \u201cBy the way, we have information on your opponent,\u201d I think most politicians \u2014 I was just with a lot of people, they said [inaudible], \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t have taken a meeting like that?\u201d They just said\u2014\u2014HABERMAN: The senators downstairs?TRUMP: A lot of them. They said, \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t have taken a meeting like that?\u201dBAKER: You asked them about it at lunch?TRUMP: Nah, a couple of them. They \u2014 now, that was before Russia was hot, don\u2019t forget. You know, Russia wasn\u2019t hot then. That was almost a year and a half ago. It wasn\u2019t like it is, like it is radioactive, then. Russia was Russia.HABERMAN: Then can I ask you\u2014\u2014BAKER: Sorry to interrupt. The email, though, said something I thought was really interesting, and I wonder what you thought of it. It said this \u201cis part of Russia and its government\u2019s support of Mr. Trump.\u201d So whatever actually happened at the meeting\u2014\u2014TRUMP: Well, I never saw the email. I never saw the email until, you know\u2014\u2014BAKER: Right, but now you have. So, what do you interpret that to mean, now that you have seen it?_________TRUMP: Well, Hillary did the reset. Somebody was saying today, and then I read, where Hillary Clinton was dying to get back with Russia. Her husband made a speech, got half a million bucks while she was secretary of state. She did the uranium deal, which is a horrible thing, while she was secretary of state, and got a lot of money._________TRUMP: She was opposing sanctions. She was totally opposed to any sanctions for Russia.BAKER: When was that?HABERMAN: Do you remember when that was? I don\u2019t remember that._________TRUMP: I just saw it. I just saw it. She was opposed to sanctions, strongly opposed to sanctions on Russia.HABERMAN: This is post-Crimea, I\u2019m assuming? Is that what we would be talking about?TRUMP: I don\u2019t really know. \u2026 But in that time. And don\u2019t forget, Crimea was given away during Obama. Not during Trump. In fact, I was on one of the shows, I said they\u2019re exactly right, they didn\u2019t have it as it exactly. But he was \u2014 this \u2014 Crimea was gone during the Obama administration, and he gave, he allowed it to get away. You know, he can talk tough all he wants, in the meantime he talked tough to North Korea. And he didn\u2019t actually. He didn\u2019t talk tough to North Korea. You know, we have a big problem with North Korea. Big. Big, big. You look at all of the things, you look at the line in the sand. The red line in the sand in Syria. He didn\u2019t do the shot. I did the shot. Had he done that shot, he wouldn\u2019t have had \u2014 had he done something dramatic, because if you remember, they had a tremendous gas attack after he made that statement. Much bigger than the one they had with me.HABERMAN: It was sarin as well?TRUMP: Sarin. And, and tremendous numbers of people were killed, young people, children. And he didn\u2019t do anything. That was a famous weekend where they were all asking him to do it, do it, do it. They thought they had it, and then he \u2014 not easy to do, I will say this, \u2019cause when I had to make that decision, I was with the president of China, and General Mattis [Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] said, \u201cWe\u2019re locked and loaded, sir,\u201d and I\u2019m saying [mumbles], you know. [mumbles] Look, you\u2019re killing people.HABERMAN: Yes.TRUMP: You hate it, it\u2019s tough. Obama \u2014 you know, I can understand it in a way, but some things you have to do. But it\u2019s, it\u2019s a tough, it\u2019s a tough decision to make.BAKER: I do want to come out, on the email, now that you have seen that email that said Russia\u2019s government \u2014 I mean, how did you \u2014 did you interpret it that way?TRUMP: Well, I thought originally it might have had to do something with the payment by Russia of the D.N.C. Somewhere I heard that. Like, it was an illegal act done by the D.N.C., or the Democrats. That\u2019s what I had heard. Now, I don\u2019t know where I heard it, but I had heard that it had to do something with illegal acts with respect to the D.N.C. Now, you know, when you look at the kind of stuff that came out, that was, that was some pretty horrific things came out of that. But that\u2019s what I had heard. But I don\u2019t know what it means. All I know is this: When somebody calls up and they say, \u201cWe have infor\u2014\u201d Look what they did to me with Russia, and it was totally phony stuff.HABERMAN: Which, which one?SCHMIDT: The dossier.TRUMP: The dossier.HABERMAN: The dossier. Oh, yes._________TRUMP: Now, that was totally made-up stuff, and in fact, that guy\u2019s being sued by somebody. \u2026 And he\u2019s dying with the lawsuit. I know a lot about those guys, they\u2019re phony guys. They make up whatever they want. Just not my thing \u2014 plus, I have witnesses, because I went there with a group of people. You know, I went there with Phil Ruffin\u2014\u2014HABERMAN: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that._________TRUMP: I had a group of bodyguards, including Keith [Schiller] \u2014HABERMAN: Keith was there, right?TRUMP: Keith was there. He said, \u201cWhat kind of crap is this?\u201d I went there for one day for the Miss Universe contest, I turned around, I went back. It was so disgraceful. It was so disgraceful._________TRUMP: When he [James B. Comey] brought it [the dossier] to me, I said this is really made-up junk. I didn\u2019t think about anything. I just thought about, man, this is such a phony deal.HABERMAN: You said that to him?TRUMP: Yeah, don\u2019t forget\u2014\u2014_________TRUMP: I said, this is \u2014 honestly, it was so wrong, and they didn\u2019t know I was just there for a very short period of time. It was so wrong, and I was with groups of people. It was so wrong that I really didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t think about motive. I didn\u2019t know what to think other than, this is really phony stuff.SCHMIDT: Why do you think \u2014 why do you think he shared it?TRUMP: I think he shared it so that I would \u2014 because the other three people left, and he showed it to me._________TRUMP: So anyway, in my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there.SCHMIDT: As leverage?TRUMP: Yeah, I think so. In retrospect. In retrospect. You know, when he wrote me the letter, he said, \u201cYou have every right to fire me,\u201d blah blah blah. Right? He said, \u201cYou have every right to fire me.\u201d I said, that\u2019s a very strange \u2014 you know, over the years, I\u2019ve hired a lot of people, I\u2019ve fired a lot of people. Nobody has ever written me a letter back that you have every right to fire me.[crosstalk]BAKER: Do you think in hindsight, because of what\u2019s happened since then\u2014\u2014TRUMP: Comey wrote a letter.HABERMAN: Which letter?SCHMIDT: To you? To the F.B.I. staff or to you?TRUMP: I thought it was to me, right?BAKER: I think he wrote it to the staff, saying\u2014\u2014TRUMP: It might have been\u2014\u2014BAKER: That \u201cthe president has every right to fire me.\u201dTRUMP: It might have been. It was just a very strange letter to say that.BAKER: But do you think in hindsight, given that\u2014\u2014TRUMP: What was the purpose in repeating that?BAKER: Do you think what\u2019s given that\u2014\u2014TRUMP: Do you understand what I mean? Why would somebody say, \u201cHe has every right to fire me,\u201d bah bah bah. Why wouldn\u2019t you just say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve retired \u2026\u201d[crosstalk]TRUMP: It was very \u2014 a lot of people have commented that.BAKER: Given what\u2019s happened since then, though, was it a political mistake to have fired him, given what\u2019s happened?TRUMP: I think I did a great thing for the American people._________SCHMIDT: But look at the headache it\u2019s caused, you know?TRUMP: It\u2019s okay. I have headaches, that\u2019s what I have, I have headaches. \u2026 But you know what, I think I did a great thing for the American people.HABERMAN: Do you wish you had done it on Day 1? When you got in? Because I honestly had assumed that you, if you were going to do it, that\u2019s when you would do it.TRUMP: Well, it could\u2019ve been. It could\u2019ve been. I feel like it was very dishonest when he wouldn\u2019t say what he knew he said to the public. I thought that was very honest. And I thought that he did that for the reason I just said._________SCHMIDT: What do you understand to be the four corners of what Mueller [Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation] can look at, if he steps\u2014\u2014 [crosstalk]TRUMP: I don\u2019t know. Nobody has contacted me about anything._________TRUMP: Because I have done nothing wrong. A special counsel should never have been appointed in this case.BAKER: Can we put that on the record?TRUMP: Because so far, the only \u2014 yeah, you can put it down.SCHMIDT: Was that [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions\u2019s mistake or [Deputy Attorney General Rod J.] Rosenstein\u2019s mistake?________TRUMP: Look, Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself.BAKER: Was that a mistake?TRUMP: Well, Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.HABERMAN: He gave you no heads up at all, in any sense?TRUMP: Zero. So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have \u2014 which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, \u201cThanks, Jeff, but I can\u2019t, you know, I\u2019m not going to take you.\u201d It\u2019s extremely unfair, and that\u2019s a mild word, to the president. So he recuses himself. I then end up with a second man, who\u2019s a deputy.HABERMAN: Rosenstein.TRUMP: Who is he? And Jeff hardly knew. He\u2019s from Baltimore.________TRUMP: Yeah, what Jeff Sessions did was he recused himself right after, right after he became attorney general. And I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d I would have \u2014 then I said, \u201cWho\u2019s your deputy?\u201d So his deputy he hardly knew, and that\u2019s Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he\u2019s from Baltimore. Now, he, we went through a lot of things. We were interviewing replacements at the F.B.I. Did you know Mueller was one of the people that was being interviewed?HABERMAN: I did, actually.TRUMP: He was sitting in that chair. We had a wonderful meeting.HABERMAN: Day before, right?SCHMIDT: Did he want the job?TRUMP: The day before! Of course, he was up here, and he wanted the job.HABERMAN: And he made that clear to you? He would have\u2014\u2014________TRUMP: So, now what happens is, he leaves the office. Rosenstein leaves the office. The next day, he is appointed special counsel. I said, what the hell is this all about? Talk about conflicts? But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven\u2019t said, but I will at some point. So Jeff Sessions, Jeff Sessions gave some bad answers.HABERMAN: You mean at the hearing?TRUMP: Yeah, he gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren\u2019t. He then becomes attorney general, and he then announces he\u2019s going to recuse himself. Why wouldn\u2019t he have told me that before?HABERMAN: Why do you think it was? What do you think it was?TRUMP: I don\u2019t know.BAKER: What would cause you \u2014 what would be the line beyond which if Mueller went, you would say, \u201cThat\u2019s too far, we would need to dismiss him\u201d?TRUMP: Look, there are so many conflicts that everybody has. Then Rosenstein becomes extremely angry because of Comey\u2019s Wednesday press conference, where he said that he would do the same thing he did a year ago with Hillary Clinton, and Rosenstein became extremely angry at that because, as a prosecutor, he knows that Comey did the wrong thing. Totally wrong thing. And he gives me a letter, O.K., he gives me a letter about Comey. And by the way, that was a tough letter, O.K. Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn\u2019t hurt to have the letter, O.K. But he gives me a very strong letter, and now he\u2019s involved in the case. Well, that\u2019s a conflict of interest. Do you know how many conflicts of interests there are? But then, then Comey also says that he did something in order to get the special prose\u2014 special counsel. He leaked. The reason he leaked. So, he illegally leaked.________TRUMP: He said I said \u201chope\u201d \u2014 \u201cI hope you can treat Flynn good\u201d or something like that. I didn\u2019t say anything.But even if he did \u2014 like I said at the news conference on the, you know, Rose Garden \u2014 even if I did, that\u2019s not \u2014 other people go a step further. I could have ended that whole thing just by saying \u2014 they say it can\u2019t be obstruction because you can say: \u201cIt\u2019s ended. It\u2019s over. Period.\u201d________TRUMP: And nothing was changed other than Richard Nixon came along. And when Nixon came along [inaudible] was pretty brutal, and out of courtesy, the F.B.I. started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress. There was nothing \u2014 anything. But the F.B.I. person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting. You know, which is interesting. And I think we\u2019re going to have a great new F.B.I. director.HABERMAN: Chris Wray.TRUMP: He\u2019s highly thought of by everybody. I think I did the country a great service with respect to Comey.BAKER: Did you shoo other people out of the room when you talked to Comey?TRUMP: No, no.BAKER: That time [inaudible] [Michael T.] Flynn \u2014TRUMP: No. That was the other thing. I told people to get out of the room. Why would I do that?SCHMIDT: Did you actually have a one-on-one with Comey then?TRUMP: Not much. Not even that I remember. He was sitting, and I don\u2019t remember even talking to him about any of this stuff. He said I asked people to go. Look, you look at his testimony. His testimony is loaded up with lies, O.K.? But people didn\u2019t \u2014 we had a couple people that said \u2014 Hi baby, how are you?ARABELLA KUSHNER: [enters room] Hi, Grandpa.TRUMP: My granddaughter Arabella, who speaks \u2014 say hello to them in Chinese.KUSHNER: Ni hao.[laughter]TRUMP: This is Ivanka. You know Ivanka.IVANKA TRUMP: [from doorway] Hi, how are you? See you later, just wanted to come say hi.TRUMP: She\u2019s great. She speaks fluent Chinese. She\u2019s amazing.BAKER: That\u2019s very impressive.TRUMP: She spoke with President Xi [Jinping of China]. Honey? Can you say a few words in Chinese? Say, like, \u201cI love you, Grandpa\u201d \u2014KUSHNER: Wo ai ni, Grandpa.BAKER: That\u2019s great.TRUMP: She\u2019s unbelievable, huh?[crosstalk]TRUMP: Good, smart genes.[laughter]TRUMP: So the bottom line is this. The country\u2019s doing well. We are, we are moving forward with a lot of great things. The unemployment is the lowest it\u2019s been in 16 years. The stock market is the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s up almost 20 percent since I took office. And we\u2019re working hard on health care. Um, the Russian investigation \u2014 it\u2019s not an investigation, it\u2019s not on me \u2014 you know, they\u2019re looking at a lot of things.HABERMAN: It\u2019s a broad \u2014TRUMP: They\u2019re looking at a big picture.BAKER: This is why I want to come back to that email, because, like \u2014 does it concern you? Let\u2019s say that the election didn\u2019t change because of anything Russia did, which has been your point, right? You point \u2014TRUMP: By the way, it\u2019s everybody.BAKER: Right, your point is that Democrats are trying to use this as an excuse, fine. But did that email concern you, that the Russian government was trying something to compromise\u2014\u2014TRUMP: You know, Peter, I didn\u2019t look into it very closely, to be honest with you.BAKER: O.K.TRUMP: I just heard there was an email requesting a meeting or something \u2014 yeah, requesting a meeting. That they have information on Hillary Clinton, and I said \u2014 I mean, this was standard political stuff.SCHMIDT: Did you know at the time that they had the meeting?TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t know anything about the meeting.SCHMIDT: But you didn\u2019t\u2014\u2014TRUMP: It must have been a very important \u2014 must have been a very unimportant meeting, because I never even heard about it.HABERMAN: No one told you a word, nothing? I know we talked about this on the plane a little bit.TRUMP: No, nobody told me. I didn\u2019t know noth\u2014\u2014 It\u2019s a very unimportant \u2014 sounded like a very unimportant meeting.BAKER: But on the date you clinched the nominations with New Jersey and California and the primaries, when you give the speech that night, saying you\u2019re going to give a speech about Hillary Clinton\u2019s corrupt dealings with Russia and other countries, and that comes just three hours after Don Jr. \u2014TRUMP: Number one, remember, I made many of those speeches.BAKER: People wondered about the timing.TRUMP: Many of those speeches. I\u2019d go after her all the time.BAKER: Yeah, I know, but\u2014\u2014TRUMP: But there was something about the book, \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d came out.BAKER: Yeah, a year earlier, though. But you were talking about\u2014\u2014TRUMP: But we were developing a whole thing. There was something about \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d________TRUMP: Peter, that\u2019s all I did, was make those speeches about her. \u2026 I don\u2019t think I added anything much different than I had been doing. \u2026 I\u2019ve made some very strong speeches about the corrupt emails. The 33,000 emails being deleted and bleached, and all of the things she was doing. I would make those speeches routinely. \u2026 There wasn\u2019t much I could say about Hillary Clinton that was worse than what I was already saying.HABERMAN: [laughs] I\u2019m sorry.TRUMP: I mean, I was talking about, she deleted and bleached, which nobody does because of the cost. How she got away with that one, I have no idea. 33,000 emails. I talked about the back of the plane, I talked about the uranium deal, I talked about the speech that Russia gave Clinton \u2014 $500,000 while she was secretary of state \u2014 the husband. I talked about the back of the plane \u2014 honestly, Peter, I mean, unless somebody said that she shot somebody in the back, there wasn\u2019t much I could add to my repertoire.HABERMAN: On Fifth Avenue\u2014\u2014TRUMP: I mean, look at what we have now. We have a director of the F.B.I., acting, who received $700,000, whose wife received $700,000 from, essentially, Hillary Clinton. \u2019Cause it was through Terry. Which is Hillary Clinton.HABERMAN: This is [Andrew] McCabe\u2019s wife, you mean?TRUMP: McCabe\u2019s wife. She got $700,000, and he\u2019s at the F.B.I. I mean, how do you think that? But when you say that \u2014 and think about this for a second. I don\u2019t think \u2014 you could give me a whole string of new information. I don\u2019t think I could really have \u2014 there\u2019s only so much. You know, you can only say many things. After that it gets boring, O.K.? How can it be better than deleting emails after you get a subpoena from the United States Congress? Guys go to jail for that, when they delete an email from a civil case. Here, she gets an email from the United States Congress \u2014________BAKER: Should she be prosecuted now?TRUMP: What?BAKER: Should she be prosecuted now? Why, then, should she not be prosecuted now\u2014\u2014TRUMP: I don\u2019t want to say that. I mean, I don\u2019t want to say.SCHMIDT: Last thing.TRUMP: You understand what I mean, Peter.BAKER: I know.TRUMP: I mean, supposing they were able to give me additional \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t have helped me. I had so much stuff\u2014\u2014SCHMIDT: Last thing, if Mueller\u2014\u2014TRUMP: And I couldn\u2019t have been better than the stuff I had. Obviously, because I won.SCHMIDT: Last thing, if Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia \u2014 is that a red line?HABERMAN: Would that be a breach of what his actual charge is?TRUMP: I would say yeah. I would say yes. By the way, I would say, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows? I don\u2019t make money from Russia. In fact, I put out a letter saying that I don\u2019t make \u2014 from one of the most highly respected law firms, accounting firms. I don\u2019t have buildings in Russia. They said I own buildings in Russia. I don\u2019t. They said I made money from Russia. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s not my thing. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t do that. Over the years, I\u2019ve looked at maybe doing a deal in Russia, but I never did one. Other than I held the Miss Universe pageant there eight, nine years [crosstalk].SCHMIDT: But if he was outside that lane, would that mean he\u2019d have to go?[crosstalk]HABERMAN: Would you consider\u2014\u2014TRUMP: No, I think that\u2019s a violation. Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company. And actually, when I do my filings, peoples say, \u201cMan.\u201d People have no idea how successful this is. It\u2019s a great company. But I don\u2019t even think about the company anymore. I think about this. \u2019Cause one thing, when you do this, companies seem very trivial. O.K.? I really mean that. They seem very trivial. But I have no income from Russia. I don\u2019t do business with Russia. The gentleman that you mentioned, with his son, two nice people. But basically, they brought the Miss Universe pageant to Russia to open up, you know, one of their jobs. Perhaps the convention center where it was held. It was a nice evening, and I left. I left, you know, I left Moscow. It wasn\u2019t Moscow, it was outside of Moscow.HABERMAN: Would you fire Mueller if he went outside of certain parameters of what his charge is? [crosstalk]SCHMIDT: What would you do?[crosstalk]Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As E.U. and Japan Strengthen Trade Ties, U.S. Risks Losing Its Voice", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 In the master plan advanced by President Trump, an unabashedly aggressive United States is supposed to reclaim its rightful perch as the center of the commercial universe, wielding its economic dominance to dictate the rules of global trade.As it turns out, the rest of the planet has its own ideas.These two trading powers, both bedrock American allies, are effectively proceeding with plans to bolster globalization just as the United States is turning to protectionism. Large areas of the global economy are now on divergent paths, creating more uncertainty for multinational companies.\u201cWe were able to demonstrate a strong political will to the effect that Japan and the E.U. will hoist the flag of free trade high amidst protectionist trends,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said at a news conference in Brussels announcing the agreement. \u201cThis is an achievement we should be proud of which also sends a strong message to the world.\u201dThe European Union and Japan are placing a bet on global integration as a source of enhanced prosperity \u2014 economic ties that come with geopolitical benefits.For the European Union, the deal reinforces the power of its single marketplace stretching from Ireland to Greece while delivering proof of its global aspirations. This, just as Europe contends with Britain abandoning the bloc in a step that will diminish its size.It is expected to bolster sales in Europe for Japanese carmakers like Honda and Toyota, while enabling European agricultural industries to sell more products in Japan. Tokyo is also likely to make it easier for European companies to bid for major government contracts, potentially giving an edge to industrial giants like Siemens of Germany and Alstom of France.The deal \u201csends a very powerful signal to the rest of the world that Japan and the E.U. are partners, are friends, are allies and we want to stand up together to defend free and fair and sustainable trade in a climate where that is not taken for granted,\u201d said Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner.This week, Mr. Trump deployed his favorite bully pulpit, Twitter, to issue a broadside against American trade deals.To the Trump administration, the United States is best served by striking bilateral trade arrangements, which are confined to two participants. With the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States owns the advantage in any such deal, enabling Washington to demand favorable terms.\u201cThey see bilateral deals as a way for us to bully other countries,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.In taking this approach, the United States risks having less of a voice in the global trade discussion as other economies take their own paths.Japan, for example, has long lavished extraordinary protections on its farmers, walling off dairy in particular from international competition.The Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 the giant trade deal that Mr. Trump renounced \u2014 would have forced Japan to open its market to agricultural imports, probably increasing sales of American goods in Japan. Now, Europe will have the edge, since Japan is expected to lower tariffs on European cheese like Gouda from the Netherlands.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that they understand that when two other countries have a free-trade agreement and we don\u2019t have one with either country, that\u2019s bad for us,\u201d said Mr. Bown, the trade expert. \u201cOur companies are now discriminated against.\u201dIf Mr. Trump makes good on his protectionist threats, the United States could also find itself on difficult geopolitical ground.As Europe and Japan were working on their deal, the Trump administration was weighing plans to slap punitive tariffs on imports of steel by citing a threat to national security.But much of the steel China sends to the United States is already limited by tariffs and other barriers invoked under W.T.O. rules, which allow countries to protect their industries from a surge of low-cost imports. The real impact of across-the-board tariffs would be likely to hit other nations that export steel, among them Germany, Japan and South Korea.In citing threats to national security to justify tariffs \u2014 widely viewed as a nuclear option within the context of trade \u2014 the Trump administration heightens the sense that it does not respect rules or international agreements.Not that the rest of the world is waiting for Mr. Trump to gain an appreciation for global commerce. Other nations are going about their business to the exclusion of the United States.In Asia, China is advocating the formation of a regional trade bloc that has been positioned as a competitor to the Trans-Pacific deal. The deal would encompass 16 countries, including Japan, a group accounting for around 40 percent of the world\u2019s population.In Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany appears increasingly receptive to overtures from the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, for coordinated economic policies aimed at accelerating the integration of Europe. This process is gaining momentum as Europe absorbs Mr. Trump\u2019s recasting of American policy with a singular focus on its own interests.\u201cWe, as the European Union, firmly believe in the political purpose of a world which is built on openness, cooperation and trade,\u201d Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Thursday.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Punish Putin, Economic Sanctions Are Unlikely to Do the Trick", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAnnoying Vladimir V. Putin could be considered in and of itself a worthy goal. Or, as Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics noted, \u201ca big part of the bill is a slap to President Trump for his close association with Russia.\u201d Whatever the case, legislators might want to explain what they are after.If there are members of Congress who believe that the package will change Mr. Putin\u2019s behavior \u2014 convince him of the merits of returning Crimea to Ukraine, perhaps, or persuade him to stop his hacker friends from tinkering with foreign elections \u2014 they might be interested in a decommissioned North Korean reactor I have for sale.When sanctions \u201chave modest objectives and are aimed at countries that are not terribly powerful but have tasted a little flavor of democracy and have close economic connections to the sanctioning coalition,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer told me, they succeed in changing countries\u2019 behavior about half the time.But when the goal is ambitious, the economic ties not overwhelming, the target country powerful, and the target government autocratic \u2014 think Russia, Ukraine, hacking \u2014 their track record is not particularly good. \u201cA very small fraction of those end in success,\u201d he added.But the haul is meager. On the other end, Bashar al-Assad is still in power in Syria, as is Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe \u2014 despite more than a decade\u2019s worth of economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union. Then there is the tale of Cuba, in which a half-century embargo has failed to bring about regime change in a tiny, economically fragile country only 100 miles off the coast of Florida.Sanctions have proved powerless to push Turkey out of Cyprus; to move Colombia, Venezuela or Nigeria to comply with Washington\u2019s war on drugs; to persuade India or Pakistan to abandon their nuclear arsenals.Even the ostensible \u201csuccesses\u201d of sanctions should be scrutinized with some skepticism. Supporters like to argue that sanctions were instrumental in bringing Iran to the negotiating table. Even if sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama in 2014 did not compel Russia to leave Crimea, they add, without them Mr. Putin might have felt emboldened to send Russian forces across the Baltic republics.And yet one could argue that Mr. Putin hasn\u2019t moved on the Baltics because they are not as critical to Russia as Ukraine, a country through which it pumps 80 percent of the natural gas it sells to Western Europe; which was home to its Black Sea fleet before the move on Crimea; and which was flirting with moving out of the Russian orbit into the hostile arms of NATO.Crediting sanctions with bringing Iran to the negotiating table also overlooks Iran\u2019s choices. Leaders in Tehran knew that if the country developed a nuclear weapon, it faced a decent chance of a military strike by Israel, the United States or both. Coming to the negotiating table would not forestall its nuclear ambitions forever. And it might actually set the stage for what could prove to be a productive relationship with Washington.As Mr. Hufbauer and his colleagues point out, American presidents impose sanctions to \u201cdramatize their opposition to foreign misdeeds, even when the likelihood of changing the target country\u2019s behavior is remote.\u201d The action may be ineffectual, but it\u2019s better than inaction.And, of course, there are domestic politics to consider.But the law still served a purpose: to signal to politically powerful Cuban-American constituencies in Florida and New Jersey that Congress stood behind them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Letter: Mortgages on the Rise and a Massive Ice Chunk", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past few years, house prices that provoke disbelief have dislodged weather as the favorite subject of small talk in parts of Canada, particularly Vancouver, British Columbia and Toronto. Given how much Canadians talk about weather, that\u2019s a notable achievement.Everyone agrees that the oxygen fueling the home-price fires has been record-low interest rates. But for the first time in seven years, the Bank of Canada this week raised its benchmark lending rate. The rise was modest: a quarter of a percentage point, bringing the rate to 0.75 percent.Will his rate increase slow housing prices? Shortly after it was announced, my inbox was flooded with takes from economists. In his note, David Madani, the chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, argued that Toronto\u2019s real estate market was already heading for a fall before Wednesday\u2019s announcement. More expensive debt, he added, will only accelerate that drop \u2014 and if that happens, it will drag down the rest of the economy. The result, Mr. Madani said, is that the rate increase may be a \u201cgamble that might have to be reversed before long.\u201dLike most things in economics, however, others disagree. Several economists predicted further increases, perhaps as soon as September. Either way, anxious days could await householders holding large mortgages with variable interest rates or anyone currently house hunting.Canadians know all about vast areas that are sparsely populated and rarely visited. Australia\u2019s equivalent of the north is the outback or the bush. Adam Ferguson, an Australian photojournalist, spent three months traveling 12,000 miles through a part of his country that was largely unknown to him. The result is a dazzling array of photos and an essay on the limits of conventional or easy explanations.Many of you may know that a chunk of ice bigger than Prince Edward Island broke away from the Antarctic Peninsula. In a rich and sweeping package with helpful graphics, Jugal K. Patel and Justin Gillis explain the consequences of the break and what it portends.Daniel Victor also surveyed how news media around the world expressed its scale: anyone for \u201chalf the size of Qatar\u201d?Warren Buffett recently came to the rescue of the Home Capital Group, a struggling Canadian mortgage company. His move was seen as a general recommendation to invest in Canada. Mr. Buffet\u2019s investment decisions are not usually challenged. But Al Rosen, a forensic accountant and stock analyst in Toronto, suggested to Gretchen Morgenson, a financial columnist for The New York Times, that others may not want to follow the so-called sage of Omaha by putting their money into Canada. In Mr. Rosen\u2019s view, Canadian accounting rules make it far too easy for executives here to hide bad news from investors.\u201cHatred can rot a person\u2019s wisdom and conscience. An enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a nation and inflame brutal life and death struggles, destroy a society\u2019s tolerance and humanity, and hinder a country\u2019s advance toward freedom and democracy.\u201dFor his final \u201cDriven\u201d auto review for The Times, Tom Voelk took the latest version of the Equinox out for a spin. He came away impressed.\u201cThe all-new third generation Chevrolet Equinox crossover is more proof that under Mary Barra, General Motors has found its footing,\u201d Mr. Voelk wrote. \u201cThe Equinox takes care of five people, does the chores, doesn\u2019t drink to excess and looks good.\u201dThe Times opens many of its stories to comments from readers, and here we introduce a new occasional feature of the Canada Letter: top Canadian comment.

{"Headline": "California\u2019s Far North Deplores \u2018Tyranny\u2019 of the Urban Majority", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREDDING, Calif. \u2014 The deer heads mounted on the walls of Eric Johnson\u2019s church office are testament to his passion for hunting, a lifestyle enjoyed by many in the northernmost reaches of California but one that Mr. Johnson says surprises people he meets on his travels around America and abroad.\u201cWhen people see you\u2019re from California, they instantly think of \u2018Baywatch,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Johnson, the associate pastor of Bethel Redding, a megachurch in this small city a three-and-a-half-hour drive north of San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s very different here from the rest of California.\u201dMr. Johnson lives in what might be described as California\u2019s Great Red North, a bloc of 13 counties that voted for President Trump in November and that make up more than a fifth of the state\u2019s land mass but only 3 percent of its population.From Hollywood to Silicon Valley, California projects an image as an economically thriving, politically liberal, sun-kissed El Dorado. It is a multiethnic experiment with a rising population, where the percentage of whites has fallen to 38 percent.California\u2019s Great Red North is the opposite, a vast, rural, mountainous tract of forests with a political ethos that bears more resemblance to Texas than to Los Angeles. Two-thirds of the north is white, the population is shrinking and the region struggles economically, with median household incomes at $45,000, less than half that of San Francisco.Jim Cook, former supervisor of Siskiyou County, which includes cattle ranches and the majestic slopes of Mount Shasta, calls it \u201cthe forgotten part of California.\u201dIn the same state that is developing self-driving cars, there\u2019s the rugged landscape of Trinity County, where a large share of residents heat their homes with wood, plaques commemorate stagecoach routes and the county seat, Weaverville, is an old gold-mining town with a lone blinking stop-and-go traffic light.The residents of this region argue that their political voice is drowned out in a system that has only one state senator for every million residents.This sentiment resonates in other traditionally conservative parts of California, including large swaths of the Central Valley, which runs down the state, and it mirrors red and blue tensions felt in areas across the country. But perhaps nowhere else in California is the alienation felt more keenly than in the far north, an arresting panorama of fields filled with wildflowers and depopulated one-street towns that have never recovered from the gold rush.\u201cPeople up here for a very long time have felt a sense that we don\u2019t matter,\u201d said James Gallagher, a state assemblyman for the Third District, which is a shorter drive from the forests of Mount Hood in Oregon than from the beaches of San Diego. \u201cWe run this state like it\u2019s one size fits all. You can\u2019t do that.\u201dMany liberals in California describe themselves as the resistance to Mr. Trump. Residents of the north say they are the resistance to the resistance, politically invisible to the Democratic governor and Legislature. California\u2019s strict regulations on the environment, gun control and hunting impinge on a rural lifestyle, they say, that urban politicians do not understand.The state\u2019s stringent air quality and climate change regulations may be appropriate for technology workers, Mr. Gallagher said, but they are onerous for people living in rural areas.\u201cIn the rural parts of the state we drive more miles, we drive older cars, our economy is an agriculture- and resource-based economy that relies on tractors and trucks,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said. \u201cYou can\u2019t move an 80,000-pound load in an electric truck.\u201dA recently passed gas tax, pushed through by the Democratic majority, will disproportionately hurt rural voters, he said.Taxation and hunting are two issues northerners are quick to seize upon when criticizing laws they feel are unfairly imposed by the state. But there are also more fundamental issues related to incomes and job opportunities that split California into a two-speed economy.In the San Francisco Bay Area, unemployment rates hover around 3 percent. In the far north, where many timber mills have shut down in recent years, unemployment is as high as 6 percent in Shasta County and 16.2 percent in Colusa County.Despite a go-it-alone ethos, residents of the 13 counties in the northern bloc are much more likely to receive government medical assistance than those in the Bay Area. In the north, 31 percent take part in Medi-Cal, the California Medicaid program, while the Bay Area rate is 19 percent, and California\u2019s overall figure 28 percent.United States Representative Doug LaMalfa, a Republican representing Northern California\u2019s First District, blames regulations that have shut down industries for the economic disparities.\u201cThey\u2019ve devastated ag jobs, timber jobs, mining jobs with their environmental regulations, so, yes, we have a harder time sustaining the economy, and therefore there\u2019s more people that are in a poorer situation.\u201dBecause incomes are significantly lower than the state average and the region is so thinly populated, tax revenue from the far north is a fraction of what urban areas contribute. In 2014, the 13 northern counties had a combined state income tax assessment of $1 billion, compared with $4 billion from San Francisco County.Resentment toward the rest of California has a long history here \u2014 there have been numerous efforts to split the state since its founding in 1850. After the presidential election, a proposal to secede from the union, driven by liberals and known as Calexit, gained attention.Residents here have long backed a different proposal for a separate state, one that would be carved out of Northern California and the southern reaches of Oregon. Flags of the so-called State of Jefferson, which was first proposed in the 19th century, fly on farms and ranches around the region.Jefferson, named after the president who once envisioned establishing an independent nation in the western section of North America, is more a state of mind than a practicable proposal. Many see it as unrealistic for a region that has plenty of water and timber but perhaps not enough wealth to wean itself away from engines of the California economy.However, two recent initiatives have channeled the deep feeling of underrepresentation.In May, a loose coalition of northern activists and residents, including an Indian tribe and the small northern city of Fort Jones, joined forces to file a federal lawsuit arguing that California\u2019s legislative system is unconstitutional because the Legislature has not expanded with the population.The suit, filed against the California secretary of state, Alex Padilla, who oversees election laws in California, calls for an increase in the membership of the bicameral Legislature, which since 1862 has capped the number of lawmakers at 120.The lawsuit argues that California now has the least representative system of any state in the nation. Each State Assembly member represents nearly 500,000 people and each state senator twice that.\u201cThis arbitrary cap has created an oligarchy,\u201d the lawsuit says.By contrast, each member of the New York State Assembly represents on average 130,000 people; in New Hampshire, it\u2019s 3,330 people for each representative.Mark Baird, one of the plaintiffs, says residents of California\u2019s far north feel as though they are being governed by an urbanized elite.\u201cI wake up in the morning and think, \u2018What is California going to do to me today?\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Baird, a former airline pilot who owns a ranch about an hour\u2019s drive from the Oregon border. In a grass valley framed by low-lying hills, Mr. Baird\u2019s pastures are filled with his small herd of buffalo and a few pens of horses and donkeys.Mr. Baird complains of restrictions on the types of guns he can own. \u201cIt\u2019s tyranny by the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority should never be able to deprive the minority of their inalienable rights.\u201dScott Wiener, a state senator representing San Francisco, says he has sympathy for the concerns of rural voters but rejects the proposal for a larger legislative body.\u201cWhen you have a state as big and diverse as California, decisions are made that we don\u2019t all agree with,\u201d he said.The second initiative is a proposed amendment to California\u2019s Constitution that would change the method for dividing districts of the Legislature\u2019s upper house, the Senate. Instead of being based on population as they are now, Senate seats would be tied to regions, giving a larger voice to rural areas in the same way the federal Senate does.\u201cI am asking the people with power to give up some of their power in order to allow all the voices in the state to have a little bit more strength than they do right now,\u201d said Mr. Gallagher, the assemblyman.Northern Californians point out that the United States House of Representatives and Senate are based on the compromise between population and geography.\u201cWhat I can\u2019t get over is that a court can rule that it\u2019s not good for the state but it stands up at the federal level,\u201d said Mr. LaMalfa, the congressman. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have a union if we hadn\u2019t come up with that compromise.\u201dMr. LaMalfa, who lives on a farm, says California\u2019s urban denizens think of the rural areas as their \u201cpark,\u201d and deplores what he describes as trophy legislation to protect animal species.\u201cYou have idealists from the cities who say, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to reintroduce wolves to rural California?\u2019\u201d Mr. LaMalfa said. He has a half-serious counterproposal: \u201cLet\u2019s introduce some wolves into Golden Gate Park and the Santa Monica Pier.\u201dA photo caption with an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for Mount Shasta.

For business travelers, in particular, talking to someone knowledgeable about a city can lead to a good restaurant. And it can also help expand business leads.As Mr. Aquino put it, \u201cWe have to be ambassadors for the city,\u201d adding that the small size of Grand Rapids means \u201cwe\u2019re one degree away from the person that you need to meet.\u201dAndrew Hampe of Chicago, who previously worked for Amarr, a manufacturer of industrial overhead doors, spoke of one particularly social bartender at the JW Marriott Grand Rapids, who knew local business leaders.The bartender had told him that members of the Lacks family who own Lacks Enterprises \u2014 which made automotive and other industrial products, including garage doors \u2014 would be dining at the hotel that evening and made an introduction. \u201cThe atmosphere created by the staff translated into an instant rapport between us,\u201d Mr. Hampe said. As a result, he said, he made \u201ca complete career change, where I am now acting as a business consultant for Lacks Enterprise.\u201dPhiladelphia saw similar value in training programs as its convention center expanded in 2011. Julie Coker Graham, the president and chief executive of the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the city wanted meeting planners to know \u201cwe were working very closely with our hospitality community to ensure that customer service was top of mind.\u201dCalled PHL Welcomes U, the online video training program, which consists of hospitality topics and itinerary recommendations, is also open to ordinary Philadelphians. Ms. Coker Graham said this allowed \u201call Philadelphians to feel empowered and to use these tools to create a more meaningful and positive experience.\u201d She said the program \u201creally created ambassadors throughout our city and in different industry segments.\u201dThe program is run by Temple University\u2019s School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management. In an email, Elizabeth H. Barber, an associate professor and executive director of business development and partnerships, said about 260 people had recently enrolled in the program, which also offers certificates. \u201cPeople interested are from the hospitality industry, restaurants, recreation centers, parking services, and a variety of other industries,\u201d she wrote.Philadelphia\u2019s training was developed by Treat \u2019em Right in St. Louis, founded by Phil Bruno in 2000. Mr. Bruno, who had previously worked for Anheuser-Busch\u2019s amusement parks, said he had found that better training led to higher employee satisfaction and higher visitor ratings. \u201cImprove the experience for guests and exceed their expectations,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019ll be back and they\u2019ll bring others with them.\u201dMr. Bruno said that the state of Pennsylvania, which owns of the city\u2019s convention center, called the Pennsylvania Convention Center, had initially hired him in 2010 to develop training to make staff members more hospitable and informed. He trained about 1,000 workers over a two-year period.The convention bureau then asked him to develop a video training program for workers across various hospitality industries. One issue, he said, was that workers did not understand that they are part of a tourism landscape. \u201cThat\u2019s a revelation to people, that they are part of a hospitality community in their own cities,\u201d he said.Some cities hire Treat \u2019em Right, Mr. Bruno said, because of what he called \u201cself-esteem issues,\u201d helping workers believe their city is worth visiting.Generational differences also create a need, Mr. Bruno said. \u201cMillennials just want information,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of going to people and their filters to get it,\u201d preferring kiosks over clerks, while veteran business travelers still want personal encounters.\u201cThe flip side of this is the millennial working in a guest-facing position\u201d who may not be well versed in personal communication, Mr. Bruno said, \u201cbecause they have been engaging through other means, through the phone, or through their tablet.\u201dBut what remains important, he said, are \u201cfeelings, since we have recognized we are in the experience economy. Service and hospitality are two different things. Service is the things that you do for people. Hospitality is how you make them feel while you\u2019re doing those things.\u201dSome cities and regions have developed their own programs aimed at increasing the number of conventions and ensuring that visitors have a positive experience. Among them is the Destination Champions program developed by the marketing organization Discover the Palm Beaches to increase convention activity in Palm Beach County, Fla. The program encourages local business leaders to promote the county as a convention destination whenever they are traveling on business.Other places developed programs for specific time periods, then continued them. Detroit created \u201cThe World Is Coming to Detroit\u201d when the city was the host of Super Bowl XL in 2006, then used a version of the program for several years. According to Michael O\u2019Callaghan, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau, the program began as a hospitality training program for the bureau\u2019s 800 members but eventually became a seminar series that has recently focused on social media and other topics.A consulting program based in Tucson, Certified Tourism Ambassadors, trains hospitality workers. Mickey Schaefer, the chief executive and founder, said she had developed the idea in 2006 while working for the American Academy of Family Physicians to plan its conventions. Hospitality workers sometimes did not know their own cities, leading to bad experiences, she said.Ms. Schaefer said she and a colleague developed the program, which includes workshops that look at hypothetical itineraries.The program, she said, \u201cis more than just helping the customer. It is helping them find the richness of whatever they are interested in.\u201d She added that the program also instills civic pride. \u201cIf you have pride and passion for where you are, that will come out in any interaction.\u201dClifford Steward, a bellman at the Hampton Inn and Suites Columbus-Downtown in Ohio, participated in the program. He said he had people skills but wanted to know the city better.The program \u201cmade me more aware of the activities around the city that people can experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a guest is pleased, and when they return from any event, they greatly appreciate it and it makes us look good and the city look good.\u201dChuck Gose, the vice president for business development and partnerships for the business communication app StaffConnect, said Mr. Steward was the reason he stays at Hampton Inn and Suites. \u201cWhen I think of somebody being a true ambassador of a city, he comes to mind, because whether I go back for business or whether I go back with my family, that\u2019s where I am going to go stay,\u201d Mr. Gose said.Citing Mr. Steward\u2019s precise restaurant advice, Mr. Gose said: \u201cHaving well-trained staff helps a business traveler break out of a rut. I think as business travelers you can become very habitual in your travels and not really take the time to embrace the unique elements of certain cities.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about hotels that are training workers to improve their hospitality skills misstated the name of Philadelphia\u2019s tourist bureau.

{"Headline": "Mysterious Document Is Latest Blow for Dalian Wanda", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 A mysterious document circulating on Chinese social media purported that regulators had warned state-run banks against financing several overseas deals by the conglomerate, Dalian Wanda Group. Then a credit-rating agency expressed skepticism about the company\u2019s debt.The market reaction was swift on Monday, with shares and debt issued by several subsidiaries of Wanda falling sharply.The mounting pressure on Wanda reflects the challenges facing large Chinese companies that borrowed heavily to finance their breathtaking growth over the last few years.The mysterious document that went viral, before being blocked by Chinese censors, appeared to be a cellphone photo of the first page of an internal document from the Agricultural Bank of China. The document described two supposed meetings about Dalian Wanda, one involving a National Development and Reform Commission official, Zheng Chiping, and the other with China Banking Regulatory Commission officials.The bank, the document said, was told by regulators that it was forbidden to lend to six of Wanda\u2019s overseas acquisitions even if those ventures ran into difficulty raising money abroad. The regulators, the document said, also told the bank that it could not help the overseas projects with foreign currency or financial registrations.The reform commission and the Agricultural Bank of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"Headline": "Trump May Find Some Allies on Climate Change at G-20 Meeting", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWestern European efforts to isolate President Trump for rejecting the Paris climate change agreement appear to be faltering as leaders gather for a summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, at the end of the week.The gulf between Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview and that of most European leaders on topics from trade to immigration will be on display in the coming days. But nowhere is the difference as stark as it is on climate change, which Mr. Trump has mocked as a hoax.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has cast the agenda of the Group of 20 summit meeting as a stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s America First approach, particularly on climate change. She has called the Paris accord \u201cirreversible,\u201d and diplomats have expressed hope that the 19 other countries would make it clear that their support is unwavering. Environmental activists, hoping to highlight America\u2019s status as an outlier, also are pushing hard for a united front against Mr. Trump.In recent days, however, those aiming to isolate the United States on climate issues have softened their language to say they hope an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d embrace the Paris agreement. Saudi Arabia has indicated it is unlikely to climb on board and Russia, Turkey and Indonesia are sending mixed signals about how forcefully they will declare their support for the Paris deal.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Mr. Snower said. \u201cIt does not look like we are going to have 19 countries and the United States against.\u201dThe Group of 20 meeting is the first high-level diplomatic gathering since Mr. Trump announced last month that America would exit the Paris agreement. How full-throated a case other rich nations are willing to make for the climate deal now could set the tone for years to come.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Some fear the future of the Paris agreement itself could be at stake. At a minimum, a weak statement or one that fails to clearly cast the United States as a renegade on climate change would signal that leaders are reluctant to jeopardize deals on trade or security by antagonizing the Trump administration over climate issues.Climate change policy is playing out in two places at the Group of 20. The first is in a document currently titled \u201cG20 Action Plan on Climate and Energy for Growth,\u201d which tells how nations can make good on their pledges. A May 5 draft obtained by The New York Times calls for nations to meet the emissions goals they set as part of the Paris agreement. A footnote explains the United States is reviewing its policies.An important second place is the Group of 20 communiqu\u00e9, the leaders\u2019 official report of the summit meeting, and how it will address the Paris agreement. The Trump administration clearly will not accept language that commits the Group of 20 nations to the Paris agreement, but France and Germany are indicating they will not accept anything less.Four virtual-reality films take you on, above and below the Antarctic ice.A proposal by Germany says leaders \u201ctake note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement. The United States affirms its strong commitment to a global approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.\u201d The other countries, it says, agree that the Paris accord is \u201cirreversible.\u201dA Trump administration official declined to say whether that language would be accepted, but maintained the United States was not trying to pull other countries away from the Paris agreement.\u201cFrom a high level, what we\u2019re looking for is a positive outcome, one in which the chancellor and the president can walk away happy,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re very much committed to a unity document.\u201dThe Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.That is a way of saying the administration would prefer not to be left as a footnote again the way it was in the recent statement by the Group of 7\u2019s environment ministers. The Trump administration refused to support language calling the Paris agreement \u201cirreversible\u201d and central to the \u201csecurity and prosperity of our planet.\u201d If the Trump administration and other leaders cannot agree on a way to sum up their divergent opinions on climate change, trade and other issues, Ms. Merkel might be forced to simply write a summary of where various countries stand.\u201cA collision course is unavoidable, but the chancellor is doing her very best to avoid one,\u201d Mr. Snower said.It is not at all clear at this point what will emerge. Tensions are high between Turkey and several European nations, including Germany, where officials have refused to allow a demonstration of ethnic Turks at the summit meeting. Indonesia has ratified the Paris agreement but has been silent in more recent discussions, one diplomat said. Russia is similarly not showing its hand.Saudi Arabia is a wild card. Fresh off a $500 million arms deal with the United States that narrowly escaped Senate opposition, the Saudis are eager to keep Mr. Trump\u2019s support for the kingdom\u2019s crackdown against Qatar. Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s largest per capita emitters of planet-warming emissions, has always been a reluctant participant in climate discussions.Conservatives in the United States say Europeans should know by now that goading Mr. Trump is likely to fail.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Seeks Reunions for Families Split by Korean War", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, made the proposal during an address in Germany, where he was scheduled to attend a Group of 20 summit meeting this week. In his first speech since North Korea\u2019s missile test on Tuesday, Mr. Moon reaffirmed his policy of seeking to engage the North through negotiations even as his government vowed to join Washington in tightening sanctions against the North after its ICBM test.\u201cWhat the North chose to do this time was reckless,\u201d Mr. Moon said in a speech delivered at the K\u00f6rber Foundation, a nonprofit research group based in Berlin. \u201cIt asked for punishment from the international community.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf the North doesn\u2019t stop its nuclear pursuit, there is no other option but to enforce even stronger sanctions and pressure.\u201dBut Mr. Moon also reiterated that he was willing to meet Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, \u201cat any time and any place\u201d if the circumstances were right and if he saw an opportunity to reverse the military standoff on the Korean Peninsula.He said North Korea should return to the negotiating table to discuss a \u201ccomplete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d If the North chooses that path, he said, great benefits wait for it: security guarantees like a peace treaty for Mr. Kim\u2019s regime, as well as joint economic projects and other assistance that would help rebuild the North Korean economy.As one of the first steps toward easing tensions, Mr. Moon said the two Koreas should start Red Cross talks to arrange temporary reunions of relatives in the North and South who have not seen each other since they were separated during the chaos of the 1950-53 Korean War.He suggested that such reunions could be held in time for the Korean Thanksgiving holiday in October.The reunions of so-called separated families remain a highly emotional affair and are widely viewed as a barometer of relations. For more than six decades, the family members have been forbidden to exchange letters, phone calls or emails, much less meet.Only 18,800 Koreans have been allowed to participate in 19 rounds of face-to-face reunions since 1985, when the first gatherings were held. About 60,000 South Koreans are still waiting for a chance to meet their wives, siblings and parents across the border; more than half are in their 80s or older.There was no immediate response from North Korea.After the ICBM test, Mr. Kim said he would never put his nuclear weapons and missiles on the negotiating table unless Washington\u2019s \u201chostile policy and nuclear threat\u201d are \u201cdefinitely terminated.\u201dSince taking office in May, Mr. Moon has vowed a more active role for his government in international efforts to defuse the crisis surrounding North Korea\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. In their summit meeting in Washington last month, Mr. Moon and President Trump agreed to keep the door open for dialogue with the North while tightening sanctions and pressure.Mr. Moon\u2019s approach met its first serious challenge when the North conducted its ICBM test. On Wednesday, South Korea and the United States conducted a rare joint missile exercise. In a continued show of force, South Korea\u2019s warships and fighter jets fired more guide missiles in a drill on Thursday.\u201cThey are behaving in a very, very serious manner, and something will have to be done about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference.In the past, North Korea and the United States engaged in negotiations aimed at dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program in return for economic and diplomatic benefits, including a peace treaty. Such talks produced agreements to freeze the North\u2019s nuclear program, but those deals did not last long as both sides accused each other of breaking terms of their agreements.Some American officials doubt that North Korea will ever give up its nuclear weapons unless China, its only major trading partner, uses its economic leverage to rein in its neighbor. In South Korea, some policy makers and analysts say that the North\u2019s nuclear program was driven by its sense of insecurity and that the country might still bargain it away for right incentives.\u201cI will make it very clear now,\u201d Mr. Moon said on Thursday, addressing the North Korean regime\u2019s reported fear for survival. \u201cWe do not want North Korea to collapse, and we will not seek any form of reunification that would absorb the North into our system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea and Its Weapons Programs Are Now a Fact of Life", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterNorth Korea\u2019s once-unthinkable nuclear and missile capabilities are, as long as the country wants, here to stay.But the best that Washington can hope for, analysts and former officials increasingly say, may be to freeze the program in place. Even this would most likely come at a steep cost, a grim recognition both that the threat is severe and that American leverage is limited.\u201cThe window for denuclearization closed a long time ago,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in a column this week.The threat can be managed, he continued, only by \u201caccepting the unacceptable\u201d as a hard fact of life.North Korea has achieved this through more than just missiles and bombs. By exploiting the dynamics of nuclear warfare and diplomacy, this otherwise weak country, whose economy is estimated to be smaller than that of Birmingham, Ala., can dictate terms to the world\u2019s most powerful country.The United States now faces the hostile end of a nuclear deterrence model it was the first to develop.In the early years of the Cold War, with American-allied West Germany facing down an overwhelming Soviet threat, the United States promised any attack would prompt nuclear retaliation.It worked, deterring the Soviets even from an invasion of West Berlin that it could have completed in a matter of hours.North Korea may have achieved a similarly effective deterrent. Though it would quickly lose any war, it could impose unacceptable costs on South Korea, Japan and potentially the United States.Its medium-range missiles can hold South Korea and Japan, where tens of thousands of American troops are based, at risk. Special canisters allow the missiles to remain pre-fueled, shortening launch time. Track-driven mobile launchers can hide in remote locations, forcing American war planners to doubt that strikes could eliminate all such missiles before they are launched.A missile submarine, while believed to be the only such vehicle in North Korea\u2019s modest navy, increases the country\u2019s odds of landing at least one retaliatory strike.Clues from a single propaganda photo reveal details about North Korea\u2019s expanding weapons programs and internal politics.As a result, any conflict, even limited, would require the United States to be willing to sacrifice thousands of American lives and far more South Korean lives. Both countries are prosperous democracies \u2014 normally strengths that, up against the more risk-willing North Korea, become weaknesses.The country\u2019s recent test of an intercontinental ballistic missile could put parts of Alaska in range as well.While analysts are unsure whether to believe North Korea\u2019s claim that it has miniaturized nuclear bombs, allowing them to be placed on missiles, any American president would have to weigh the potential risk to Anchorage\u2019s population of 300,000, roughly equivalent to all American military casualties in World War II.There is another force working in North Korea\u2019s favor, known as \u201cfirst-strike instability,\u201d in which both sides must fear that any exchange, however small, will escalate to nuclear launches.In the Cold War, this kept the United States and the Soviet Union locked in a comparable balance of power. On the Korean Peninsula, it does something otherwise impossible: It puts North Korea on equal footing with the United States.North Korea\u2019s strategy makes clear that even a limited strike, either to eliminate its weapons or its leadership, would prompt a full retaliation.Because North Korea sees the weapons as its only hope for survival, losing them risks provoking the country\u2019s fears of a full invasion or an effort to topple the government. And because Pyongyang believes it can survive such a threat only by retaliating, its incentive is to do so before it is too late.The United States\u2019 overwhelming strength is, paradoxically, also a weakness. North Korean leaders must consider even a limited strike or accidental escalation as the start of a war they could lose within hours, virtually forcing them to immediately execute their full war plan.This constrains American options. Even a single strike \u2014 for example, to destroy a missile or merely to punish the government \u2014 risks provoking a full war.This has held for decades. In 1969, when North Korea shot down a United States Navy plane, killing 31, the Nixon administration chose not to respond, fearing that North Korea would misperceive any attack as the start of a war. This logic has held as the stakes have grown.Still, United States policy toward North Korea could always shift, particularly under President Trump, who considers unpredictability an asset. While it is difficult to foresee an American option that overcomes these risks, that does not prevent Washington from trying.In other such standoffs, military risks can be reduced by addressing the underlying political causes. Iran, for instance, was persuaded to surrender components of its nuclear program in exchange for integration into the global economy, which it saw as a more desirable way to secure its future.North Korea\u2019s political problems may be beyond amelioration.The country\u2019s greatest threat is not American power but South Korean prosperity. Pyongyang\u2019s official ideology of race-based nationalism requires describing the Korean people as one nation, temporarily divided.But South Korea\u2019s stronger economy and freer society leave the Pyongyang government with little reason to exist. Ending hostilities would risk a German-style reunification that would subsume the North under South Korean rule.Only a perpetual state of near-war can stave off reunification while justifying the North Korean state. And only nuclear-armed missiles can make that standoff survivable.No amount of American power or will could impose a threat that North Korea will see as costlier than destruction nor offer an incentive more valuable than survival.Rather, he said, the United States should aim to \u201clessen the danger\u201d by seeking an end to missile tests.There has been a broader shift toward such thinking. The ambition is no longer to roll back North Korea\u2019s programs, but to mitigate the risk they pose day to day.This is a tacit acknowledgment that North Korea\u2019s preferred negotiations model \u2014 in which the United States takes steps away from the Korean Peninsula in exchange for peace \u2014 is increasingly accepted.Even if North Korea never achieves its vision of full victory, it has shifted the conversation to its terms.Mr. Fitzpatrick and others say that the United States should pursue such steps only if they point toward North Korean disarmament, but some consider this optimistic.Any viable deal with the North Koreans, they suggested, \u201cwould require explicit acceptance of their nuclear state status and significant rollbacks to the U.S. conventional military presence in the Northeast Asian theater, both of which are nonstarters for the United States.\u201dThe likeliest outcome, they concluded, is that the world\u2019s nations \u201clearn to live with an ICBM-armed North Korea.\u201dIn theory, this could mean a tenuous nuclear stability, much as in the Cold War. But historians say the Cold War\u2019s pattern of near misses, given enough time, could eventually have sparked an unintended war.Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico governor and occasional mediator between the United States and North Korea, was asked this week on the BBC program \u201cNewsnight\u201d to rate his optimism on a scale of one to 10.\u201cI\u2019m at about a three right now, and it\u2019s dwindling,\u201d Mr. Richardson said. \u201cI\u2019m worried. I\u2019m really worried.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Votes Down Broad Obamacare Repeal", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted narrowly on Tuesday to begin debate on a bill to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but hours later, Republican leaders suffered a setback when their most comprehensive plan to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health law fell far short of the votes it needed.The Tuesday night tally needed to reach 60 votes to overcome a parliamentary objection. Instead, it fell 43-57. The fact that the comprehensive replacement plan came up well short of even 50 votes was an ominous sign for Republican leaders still seeking a formula to pass final health care legislation this week.But the victory could be fleeting: Senate Republicans still have no agreement on a repeal bill that they can ultimately pass to uproot the law that has provided health insurance to millions of Americans.The Senate is now moving ahead with debate, amendments and ultimately a final vote in the coming days on legislation that would have a profound effect on the American health care system \u2014 roughly one-sixth of the United States\u2019 economy. But it is entirely possible that by week\u2019s end, the senators will have passed nothing.\u201cNow we move forward towards truly great health care for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said from the White House Rose Garden, where he was holding a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Lebanon. \u201cThis was a big step.\u201dOnly two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted against the procedural motion, though at least several other Republicans had been seen as possible holdouts. No Democrats voted in favor of the motion.The Senate failed to pass three amendments to repeal the health care law.The Tuesday night vote was on a comprehensive amendment that included disparate proposals calculated to appeal to conservatives and moderates in the Republican caucus.One proposal, offered by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, would have allowed insurers to sell stripped-down health plans, without maternity care or other benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, if they also sold plans that included such benefits.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to buy what the federal government mandates you must buy,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cYou should choose what meets the needs for you and your family.\u201dThe amendment also included money to help pay out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income people, including those who buy private insurance after losing Medicaid coverage as a result of the Senate bill. This proposal was devised by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and other senators from states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.Three Republican proposals were considered.But nine Republicans, spanning the party\u2019s ideological spectrum, voted against the package.The debate to come will have broad implications for health care and households in every state, and emotions are high.Before senators voted to start the debate in midafternoon, protesters in the Senate gallery chanted, \u201cKill the bill, don\u2019t kill us!\u201d and \u201cShame, shame, shame!\u201dDespite his vote to move ahead, Mr. McCain offered harsh words for the secretive process by which Senate Republican leaders came up with their bill to repeal and replace the health law, and he delivered a pessimistic take on its chances.\u201cAsking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work in the end, and probably shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. McCain said, adding that it \u201cseems likely\u201d that the current repeal effort would end in failure. Still, Mr. McCain voted with Republican leaders in favor of the comprehensive replacement plan on Tuesday night.Arizona is one of the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and Mr. McCain\u2019s remarks could reflect concerns of other senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including the junior Republican senator from his state, Jeff Flake.\u201cWe are ground zero for the failure of the exchanges, but we are also an expansion state,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cI think all of us are concerned that we don\u2019t pull the rug out from people.\u201dJust before the Senate vote, the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, made an impassioned plea to Republicans.\u201cWe know that A.C.A. is not perfect,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cBut we also know what you\u2019ve proposed is much worse. We can work together to improve health care in this country. Turn back now before it\u2019s too late and millions and millions and millions of Americans are hurt so badly in ways from which they will never, ever recover.\u201dGiven the divisions within their caucus, Senate Republican leaders were considering a new approach to keeping their repeal quest alive: They could try to reach agreement on a slimmed-down bill that would repeal a few major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, like the penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and businesses that do not offer insurance to their employees. Republican leaders would not intend such a bill to become law, but they believe that it could win approval in the Senate.That \u201cskinny\u201d bill could then be a basis for negotiations with the House.Mr. Trump kept up pressure on the Senate on Tuesday with Twitter posts. After the procedural vote, he applauded the Senate, but was cutting toward Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski: \u201cWe had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think. It\u2019s very, very sad for them.\u201dThe successful procedural vote was also a moment of redemption, at least temporarily, for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who just last week appeared to have failed in his effort to put together a health bill that could squeak through the narrowly divided Senate.That said, it remained far from certain whether Republicans would be able to agree on a bill in the days to come \u2014 and what exactly the contents of that bill would be. Mr. McConnell promised an \u201copen amendment process\u201d in which members of both parties could propose changes.\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not out here to spike the football.\u201dFor weeks, Mr. McConnell has been promoting and revising a comprehensive bill that would repeal the health law while also replacing it, but he has struggled to nail down the support needed to pass that measure. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has yet to assess the most complete version of that legislation, which includes the proposals by Mr. Cruz and Mr. Portman.Without that assessment, the measure needed 60 Senate votes, and it failed that test on Tuesday night.The Senate is also expected to vote on a measure that would repeal the health law without putting in place any replacement, but that approach does not appear to have enough support to pass, either.That proposal resembles a bill passed by the Senate in 2015 and vetoed by Mr. Obama in early 2016. But it would increase the number of people who are uninsured by 32 million in 2026, the budget office said.Mr. Portman had anguished for weeks over provisions of Mr. McConnell\u2019s repeal bill that would make deep cuts in projected Medicaid spending and roll back the expansion of the program under the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Portman voted to move ahead with the debate on Tuesday after being assured that the Senate would vote on his plan to provide financial assistance to people moving from an expanded state Medicaid program to private health insurance.States could have used the money, totaling $100 billion, to help low-income people pay deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs when they receive medical care.Mr. Portman worked on the plan with the Trump administration and with several other Republican senators from states that have expanded Medicaid, including Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada.Mr. Heller voted Tuesday to open the debate, but he made no commitment to vote for the repeal bill itself.\u201cIf the final product isn\u2019t improved for the state of Nevada, then I will not vote for it,\u201d Mr. Heller said. \u201cIf it is improved, I will support it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Avantika Chilkoti, Emily Cochrane, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Jennifer Steinhauer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "England\u2019s Mental Health Experiment: No-Cost Talk Therapy", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 England is in the midst of a unique national experiment, the world\u2019s most ambitious effort to treat depression, anxiety and other common mental illnesses.The rapidly growing initiative, which has gotten little publicity outside the country, offers virtually open-ended talk therapy free of charge at clinics throughout the country: in remote farming villages, industrial suburbs, isolated immigrant communities and high-end enclaves. The goal is to eventually create a system of primary care for mental health not just for England but for all of Britain.At a time when many nations are debating large-scale reforms to mental health care, researchers and policy makers are looking hard at England\u2019s experience, sizing up both its popularity and its limitations. Mental health care systems vary widely across the Western world, but none have gone nearly so far to provide open-ended access to talk therapies backed by hard evidence. Experts say the English program is the first broad real-world test of treatments that have been studied mostly in carefully controlled lab conditions.The demand in the first several years has been so strong it has strained the program\u2019s resources. According to the latest figures, the program now screens nearly a million people a year, and the number of adults with common mental disorders who have recently received some mental health treatment has jumped to one in three from one in four and is expected to continue to grow. Mental health professionals also say the program has gone a long way to shrink the stigma of psychotherapy in a nation culturally steeped in stoicism.\u201cYou now actually hear young people say, \u2018I might go and get some therapy for this,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Tim Kendall, the clinical director for mental health for the National Health Service. \u201cYou\u2019d never, ever hear people in this country say that out in public before.\u201dThe enormous amount of data collected through the program has shown the importance of a quick response after a person\u2019s initial call and of a triage-like screening system in deciding a course of treatment. It will potentially help researchers and policy makers around the world to determine which reforms can work \u2014 and which most likely will not.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that they\u2019re enhancing access to care, but that they\u2019re being accountable for the care that\u2019s delivered,\u201d said Karen Cohen, chief executive of the Canadian Psychological Association, which has been advocating a similar system in Canada. \u201cThat is what makes the effort so innovative and extraordinary.\u201dOliver is the just the type of person the program\u2019s two creators had in mind when they first proposed that the government fund it, a decade ago.At 30, he was scrambling to manage a job and a young family \u2014 and unraveling fast. After nights out with friends, he would wake up the next morning with a visceral sense that he had done something awful.\u201cI knew I\u2019d done nothing wrong, I knew it, but I would start to think, \u2018O.K., I better check to make sure \u2014 that, like, I hadn\u2019t hit somebody, or something,\u2019\u201d said Oliver, now 32 and a graphic designer outside London, who asked that his last name be omitted to protect his privacy. By the spring of 2015, after the birth of Oliver\u2019s second child, the anxiety had so infiltrated his life that he had trouble leaving the house. \u201cI was broken,\u201d he said.In 2005 David Clark, a professor of psychology at Oxford University, and the economist Richard Layard, a member of the House of Lords, concluded that providing therapy to people like Oliver made economic sense.\u201cWe made the case that, just on lost work alone, the program would pay for itself,\u201d Dr. Layard said in an interview in his office at the London School of Economics.Dr. Clark, in his university office, said: \u201cIf someone has a broken leg, he or she immediately gets treatment. If the person has a broken soul, they usually do not.\u201dThe program began three years later, in 2008, with $40 million from Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government. It set up 35 clinics covering about a fifth of England and trained 1,000 working therapists, social workers, graduates in psychology and others. The program has continued to expand through three governments, both ideologically left and right leaning, with a current budget of about $500 million that is expected to double over the coming few years.Under the old system, Oliver might have gotten a drug and, possibly, some general psychological guidance and support. But he had never sought mental health treatment before, and he most likely would have gone years before getting any talk therapy because he had no idea it was available. The area where he lives had scores of practicing therapists but no centralized system for ensuring that people got scientifically backed approaches tailored to their specific problem.Oliver learned from his doctor about Healthy Minds, the program\u2019s local center, and he immediately called. He got a call back the next day.The promptness of that initial reply appears to be crucially important, data collected by the program suggest. If patients don\u2019t hear back in the first few days, many of them can be lost for good because the courage it took to make the call can dissipate fast.Andrew Prinsloo, 43, a graphic designer living in Feltham who had anxieties similar to Oliver\u2019s, said he got a call back minutes after sending an email to Healthy Minds in late 2015. \u201cI was having these terrible thoughts about what I might do and, honestly, I was very reluctant to talk to anyone because I thought they\u2019d lock me up,\u201d he said in an interview.This first call is more than a scheduling exercise. It is an initiation of therapy, a partly scripted, hourlong evaluation to determine how safe the new client is, how desperate and why. The staff members, known as psychological well-being practitioners, decide in that initial call if low-intensity phone therapy is appropriate, or if the person should be moved up the ladder, to group or individual therapy.In one such call at the center in High Wycombe, a city near London, a young man named Patrick confessed, in a barely audible voice, that he had thought about suicide and that \u201cthings are not good\u201d at work or at home.\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m not very smart, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. He was on guard, a little rushed, talking on his lunch break.After the conversation, Rochelle Joseph, the practitioner, explained in an interview: \u201cThat is someone, you can hear it, who probably never talked to anyone about this. It may be the first time he\u2019s said those things out loud. This is someone we would recommend\u201d for more intensive follow-up.This so-called stepped care approach is similar to the triage most clinics traditionally do, only it is more rigorously standardized and monitored, saving the high-intensity, face-to-face treatments for more severe problems \u2014 a system intended to contain costs.Oliver\u2019s condition was judged serious enough that he got in to see a therapist face to face fairly quickly, within a few weeks. He learned he had obsessive-compulsive disorder. People with O.C.D. have a consuming fear \u2014 of germs, say, or, in Oliver\u2019s case, of misbehavior. They escalate that fear by repetitively trying to soothe it, for example by washing their hands or checking that they\u2019ve done nothing wrong.The gold standard treatment for O.C.D. is cognitive behavior therapy, the most commonly studied psychotherapy for mood problems. In this treatment, usually delivered in weekly hourlong sessions over three to six months, people learn techniques to defuse the automatic thoughts and habits that feed their anxiety or depression. The therapy has been available in England for decades, but typically in cities and with long waiting lists.In one exercise, for instance, Oliver wrote down what he thought might have happened after a night out, followed by what he subsequently knew had happened \u2014 in different-colored ink. That cognitive, or thought-based, process provided some instantaneous relief, he said.Patients also do simple, real-world experiments, to see if feared consequences materialize. Gemma Szucs, 41, engaged in online sessions of cognitive behavior therapy over 14 weeks through the program in Oxford, for social anxiety so severe that she couldn\u2019t bear boarding a bus because it meant attracting momentary stares from other passengers. She was referred to the program by her general practitioner.One of the behavior experiments she tried was to carry on a loud, pretend conversation on her cellphone in the grocery store, saying things like, \u201cI just got a call from David Cameron, and he wants to talk to you!\u201d she said, referring to the then prime minister.\u201cI had to really build myself up to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then when I finally did it, no one batted an eyelid. Nothing. I felt ridiculous for worrying about it at all.\u201dOliver\u2019s challenge was to work his way through a list of previously routine activities that had become terrifying, like driving (lowest on the list) and jogging in a remote area of the woods (at the top).\u201cIt was hard, but I got through it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe therapy worked \u2014 I came out of the box I was living in.\u201dThe program\u2019s services closely track people\u2019s conditions using two standard questionnaires filled out each week of treatment \u2014 one for depression and one for anxiety \u2014 and log the findings in a government database (clients are anonymous in those reports).This data gathering does not amount to a \u201ccontrolled\u201d experiment in that there is no matched group of people getting a placebo treatment, or no treatment at all, for comparison. But the data collected show that the recovery rate of those who engage in at least two sessions of therapy has increased to 50 percent today, from an average of about 45 percent a few years back, as high as the most positive lab studies of the therapies, which often have idealized conditions. How long that recovery lasts, and for whom, are unknowns; the program intends to build in longer-term follow-up measures.The projected cost savings countrywide have been difficult to determine, given all the other economic factors in a $3 trillion, diversified economy. But the recovery numbers have given Dr. Clark and Dr. Layard enough ammunition to argue for, and receive, funding from three governments in a row.Psychotherapy-for-all has some limitations, and no shortage of critics willing to name them.For instance, the program has delivered mostly one kind of therapy, cognitive behavior therapy. The National Health Service\u2019s guidelines include other treatments, however, including interpersonal therapy, which focuses on improving relationships, and a short-term form of analysis rooted in Freudian ideas.\u201cIf you think C.B.T. is the end-all, then you don\u2019t understand mental health,\u201d said Peter Kinderman, president of the British Psychological Society. \u201cSo if the program turns into a C.B.T. monopoly, that\u2019s bad. But I\u2019m an optimist; I think we\u2019ll begin to see multifactorial approaches as the program matures.\u201dSome critics say the program has already altered how general practitioners operate. The services have become so popular that most clients now make an appointment on their own, bypassing G.P.s as the traditional gatekeepers.The trade-off, said Dr. Rachel Jenkins, a professor emeritus at King\u2019s College London, is that primary care doctors \u201cknow less about mental health than they did 20 years ago; they\u2019ve become de-skilled.\u201dThe biggest challenges may be those created by runaway demand. Therapists are booked solid; some are juggling 25 clients at a time, and the line to get in the door is long, creating the same complaints about waiting lists that the National Health Service has for many medical services and procedures. The average wait is 31 days for a course of therapy, typically shorter for the online variety and longer for face-to-face treatment.Directors of the local centers have managed this caseload with the tools they have, in part by seeing to it that would-be clients get educational materials or online resources right away, to give them something to study while they wait for an appointment.Sarah Norman, 45, a pediatric nurse who sought help from the Oxford center last year for depression, said she was referred to group therapy because the waiting list for individual therapy was so long. When the group therapy ended after four sessions, she remembered: \u201cI was a bit frustrated. I thought I could have used a couple more sessions.\u201dShe did, in time, improve, and is very grateful for the treatment. The same cannot be said with any certainty about the 40 percent of people who the data show were lost to the program after the initial assessment phone call. About two-thirds of them were not depressed or anxious enough to qualify for the therapy, or decided it wasn\u2019t for them, Dr. Clark\u2019s data shows.That leaves about 125,000 men and women who may have needed help but didn\u2019t get it. \u201cThese are people we\u2019d like to reach, and we are pushing the services hard to do that,\u201d Dr. Clark said.John Pimm, the psychologist who directs the Buckinghamshire center, found in 2013 that he could strikingly raise recovery rates by having his therapists give some patients two or three extra sessions; and by extending call times for phone therapy, working more carefully at the critical junctures, when people begin, or end, therapy.\u201cWe have created this program, and now we are playing catch-up,\u201d Dr. Pimm said in an interview in his office in High Wycombe. \u201cWe cannot train therapists fast enough, and the low-intensity phone therapists turn over pretty quickly. We have to figure out how to keep them in the job longer.\u201dThis is where the online therapy software programs, still relatively new, may play a crucial role. Young men in particular, who can be difficult to bring in for face-to-face therapy, are often willing to work diligently on the computer and by phone. \u201cThe online and low-intensity options have been absolutely crucial for us,\u201d said Judith Chapman, who runs the Berkshire service. \u201cAnd we have gotten good recovery rates with them.\u201dFor those outside England trying to improve access to mental health care, these problems pale in the face of untreated emotional problems, which are most common in young people. Oliver is back to work; Andrew Prinsloo is doing well, also working, as are Gemma Szucs and hundreds of thousands more \u2014 in most cases, without having to start or increase medications.\u201cFor me, honestly, I\u2019m the last person who would try talk therapy,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it worked.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about England\u2019s ambitious effort to treat depression, anxiety and other common mental illnesses misstated the name of one type of therapy included in the National Health Services\u2019 guidelines. It is interpersonal therapy, not intrapersonal therapy.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a woman who participated in a program in England offering free talk therapy. She is Gemma Szucs, not Szuc.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the portion of adults in England who received treatment through the country\u2019s free talk therapy program. One in three adults with common mental disorders have recently received treatment through the program, not one third of all adults. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Closing of the Republican Mind", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a recent survey showing a fundamental shift in the attitude of Republicans toward the value of higher education.From 2010 to 2015, solid majorities of Republicans and Democrats agreed that institutions of higher learning had a positive effect on America. In 2010, Republicans were 58-32 positive and Democrats 65-22. For Democrats, this pattern grew stronger over time, reaching 72-19 in the most recent polling in June.At a time when countries around the world are doing all they can to attract and retain talented individuals to come to their shores to build and grow innovative companies, the Trump Administration is signaling its intent to do the exact opposite.Imagine if we had sent half of Silicon Valley\u2019s immigrant entrepreneurs away. The 44 immigrant-founded billion-dollar start-ups now in the U.S. have created an average of 760 American jobs per company. Without these immigrant entrepreneurs, it is unlikely America would stand as the beacon of innovation that it is today.Countless analyses have demonstrated that Trump won the election by combining support from traditional Republican voters with a surge in backing from constituencies that contemporary economic and cultural developments have left behind.In recent decades, this class has become increasingly influential in setting cultural standards and in shaping contemporary values. Its success has provoked deepening resentment, to say the least.Far from spending their college years in a meritocratic melting pot, the New Elite spend school with people who are mostly just like them \u2014 which might not be so bad, except that so many of them have been ensconced in affluent suburbs from birth and have never been outside the bubble of privilege.hardworking, highly educated, jet-setting meritocrats who feel they are the deserving winners of a tough, worldwide economic competition \u2014 and many of them, as a result, have an ambivalent attitude toward those of us who didn\u2019t succeed so spectacularly. Perhaps most noteworthy, they are becoming a trans-global community of peers who have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back home.Picture a coffee shop in a big city almost anywhere on earth. It is filled with stylish, firm-bodied people aged under 50 drinking $5 coffees. Fresh from yoga class, they are reading New Yorker magazine articles about inequality before returning to their tiny $1.5 million apartments. This is the cultural elite.Trump, Kuper explains, labels this constituency\u201cthe elite\u201d but not all class members are rich. Adjunct professors, NGO workers and unemployed screenwriters belong alongside Mark Zuckerberg. Rather, what defines the cultural elite is education. Most of its members went to brand-name universities, and consider themselves deserving rather than entitled. They believe in facts and experts. Most grew up comfortably off in the post-1970s boom. Their education is their insurance policy and, so almost whatever their income, they suffer less economic anxiety than older or lesser educated people. Their political utopia is high-tax, egalitarian, feminist and green.The reaction against this class, which found expression in the 2016 election, has proved deeply troubling in some quarters.Richard Florida, in an email to me, was harsh in his assessment of consequences of the current anti-elite reaction:The United States is the first advanced nation since Japan and Germany during World War II to turn its back on progress and liberalism.In doing so, the United States threatens its status as \u201cthe most innovative, most knowledge driven, most powerful nation on earth,\u201d according to Florida:The political backlash from this divide can kill us. It is the only thing that can hold back our cities and stop talented and ambitious people from coming here.Such people have portable \u201cachieved\u201d identities, based on educational and career success which makes them generally comfortable and confident with new places and people.The anywhere voter values \u201cautonomy, mobility and novelty\u201d while giving much lower priority to group identity, tradition and patriotic expression. They view globalization, immigration, self-realization and meritocracy as positive concepts.Somewhere voters, in Goodhart\u2019s description, aremore rooted and have \u201cascribed\u201d identities \u2014 Scottish farmer, working class Geordie, Cornish housewife \u2014 based on group belonging and particular places, which is why they find rapid change more unsettling. One core group of Somewheres have been the so-called \u2018left behind\u2019 \u2013 mainly older white working class men with little education.Most are neither bigots nor xenophobes, according to Goodhart, and they generally accept the liberalization of \u201cattitudes to race, gender and sexuality,\u201d but this acceptance hasbeen more selective and tentative, and has not extended to enthusiasm for mass immigration or European integration.Among voters for Clinton, 27 percent lived in their hometown and 43 percent lived 2 hours or more away from their hometown; among Trump supporters, 36 percent lived in their hometown and 37 percent lived 2 or more hours away.James Stimson, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, sent me his own critical assessment of this phenomenon:Give a randomly selected group the choice, stay or go, and those who choose to go will be profoundly different from those who stay. And thus when we observe the behavior of those who live in distressed areas, we are not observing the effect of economic decline on the working class, we are observing a highly selected group of people who faced economic adversity and choose to stay at home and accept it when others sought and found opportunity elsewhere.Those who choose to leave such communities and find their fortune elsewhere are, in Stimson\u2019s view,ambitious and confident in their abilities. Those who are fearful, conservative, in the social sense, and lack ambition stay and accept decline.Given that, Stimson says:I don\u2019t see them as once proud workers, now dispossessed, but rather as people of limited ambition who might have sought better opportunity elsewhere and did not. I see their social problems more as explanations of why they didn\u2019t seek out opportunity when they might have than as the result of lost employment.Stimson then poses another question: \u201cShould the Democratic Party cater to these voters?\u201d His answer is an unequivocal no:The [rural] working class was once mainstream America, the most common and typical of all of us. It is now the residue of failed social mobility, when most have been mobile. After decades of social mobility, that residue is now more distinctive, it is those who are not willing to grab the ring, but rather to remain in the hometown and fear change and others. These people should be Trump voters.While Stimson\u2019s analysis is harsh \u2014 criticizing as it does many hardworking men and women whose loyalties to family, friend, community and church may supersede personal ambition \u2014 he captures a crucial element of contemporary politics. This is the potential of an angry electorate to provide a key base of support to a politician like Trump who capitalizes on resentment, intensifies racial and ethnic hostility and lies with abandon as a means to his ends.While Trump pulled out an Electoral College victory by mobilizing resentful voters and turning out more traditional Republicans, there are significant questions about the continuing viability of his coalition.\u201cI think that \u2018somewhere people\u2019 are a fast shrinking sliver of the American population.\u201d As the economy changes, Frey argued,younger people, millennials and upcoming generations are increasingly moving to where the jobs are, and are more comfortable with diversity and global connectivity.If Democrats have one thing to be grateful for, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s failure to live up to his campaign promises on health care and taxes, at least so far.In practice, Trump is going in the opposite direction, pressing for a radical alteration of health care policy that directly conflicts with the interests of millions of his supporters, and for legislation catering to the demands of the wealthiest Republicans for reduced tax burdens.We will massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country.American politics has become fluid and volatile. Income differences have been supplanted by cultural and social practices closely linked to levels of educational attainment. Political partisanship is now firmly linked to race, with whiteness defining one of the two major political parties. Religiosity has taken on new meaning \u2014 if one can call it that \u2014 with devout churchgoers supporting an avowed libertine. In that sense, both sides agree that morality has become a matter of personal discretion. Partisans impute evil to their adversaries, and the meritocratic elect have barred the gates.Trump has intuitively exploited this chaos. He is not at the end of his string, not by a long shot. His life demonstrates his will to win. His vulnerabilities and his pathologies are also astoundingly clear. While his critics are convinced that Trump the chameleon is masquerading as the protector of the left behind, he has in fact tapped into vast anger over immigration, which has shot up over the past 50 years \u2014 and there is no good reason to believe that this anger will dissipate by 2020.The question that remains is whether President Trump can continue to exploit the fissures he opened as candidate Trump. The answers history provides are not altogether reassuring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Dunkirk Spirit Can Save Britain From Brexit Defeat", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 How I wish that Christopher Nolan\u2019s new film, \u201cDunkirk,\u201d had not been released at this moment in history. The reviewers have been near unanimous in their praise: searing, complex, uncompromising about the savagery of war and death. Yet the essential message of the film, with its narrative of heroic retreat in order to fight another day, cannot help but feed the national pride in Britain\u2019s capacity to triumph eventually, no matter what the odds.Nothing could be less helpful to our collective psyche as the country blunders toward Brexit. We hear much about American exceptionalism, but Britain feels it, too. We are the nation of empire, whose ancestors once controlled a quarter of the globe; we are the mother of parliaments; we stood alone against Hitler; we have not been conquered for a thousand years. We feel remarkable.The Brexit vote was driven by the belief that Britain was hobbled by being shackled to a moribund, bureaucratic group of nations. The Brexiteers convinced enough of the electorate that we needed only to be set free from Europe, with its tiresome regulations, restrictions and pesky immigrants, to become a proud, swashbuckling, dominant and richer country again.The trouble with that statistic is that it obscures all the weaknesses that lie beneath the surface. We don\u2019t have the skills, the manufacturing base, the drive or the productivity we would need to take off as an independent nation. For years, Britain\u2019s inadequacies have been compensated for by its membership in the European Union. Now, they are about to become painfully apparent.All this is before we take into account the expense, complication and bureaucratic replication involved in leaving the union; the years of negotiating with countries around the globe; the dozens of European regulatory agencies, overseeing everything from medicines to nuclear power, that Britain would now have to set up equivalents for; the need to recruit thousands of people to manage new and more extensive customs and immigration systems.Britons are not remotely prepared for this reality. The country is sick of low living standards, and polls show that people are fed up with austerity cuts to public spending. Voters wanted and expected Brexit to make them richer. They were told that negative forecasts of Brexit\u2019s effects were just scaremongering by the elite and its experts; they didn\u2019t anticipate the downsides.Rather like an unhappy spouse contemplating a divorce in favor of marriage to a charming new amour, most voters expected Brexit to get rid of everything they didn\u2019t like about the European Union (immigration, regulation), while blindly assuming that they would keep everything they did enjoy (prosperity, subsidies for poorer industries and regions, retirement beside the Mediterranean, free health care abroad). They hoped, in short, to have their cake and eat it, too.The paradox is summed up by two women I interviewed recently. Both were single mothers living on benefits they denounced as far too low. Both had voted for Brexit. Both believed there were too many foreigners here. And both were scandalized when I asked whether they would take vacant jobs in cafes or shops.\u201cThey\u2019re immigrants\u2019 jobs,\u201d one said.A senior ex-diplomat, a man who has spent a professional lifetime building up Britain\u2019s trade and its credibility with investors, is aghast at what the Brexit chaos is doing to our reputation. \u201cThe core narrative of the country for the past 40 years has been that we\u2019re stable and politically predictable; the ideal platform for investing into the single market,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re rudderless and in a mess.\u201dBritain is not an economic powerhouse waiting to be liberated. We are a country of mediocre education and limited skills, whose preening vanity has prevented us from seeing our failings. Our membership in the European Union is not a set of restraints; it is what has been propping us up. If we insist on cutting ourselves off, parts of our economy will start to die.Dunkirk is remembered so fondly only because, in the end, Britain was on the winning side. That wasn\u2019t down to our plucky spirit. It was because America, with its overwhelming resources, entered the war. There is no such ally waiting to rescue us now, as we start down the dangerous path of methodically shredding our links with our neighbors and friends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Depressing Summers in Belize", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWhen summer arrives, my friends and family inevitably roll their eyes when I tell them I\u2019m packing for my fieldwork in the Caribbean. They picture a book and a white-sand beach. I do get a tan. But it\u2019s no vacation.I study ocean ecosystems. The work is chronically underfunded, so food and housing is basic or worse. When we\u2019re in Belize monitoring the health of coral reefs, about half the nights we sleep under the stars on a dock. When I can afford a roach- and gecko-infested room, it\u2019s often so rustic that it\u2019s preferable to sleep outside.There are also the tropical diseases we acquire (dengue, for instance), the insects that lay eggs under our skin (bot flies), stinging jellyfish, scorpions hiding in our shoes and, of course, feisty sea turtles (on one trip an enormous loggerhead turtle bit one of my graduate students on the rear). It\u2019s also physical work, made harder by the intense heat and humidity. One former undergrad in my lab was in the National Guard. After she was deployed to Kuwait, she emailed us to say that the assignment was easier than fieldwork with us.Still, I love all of it. One of the big rewards is the wonders you stumble into by just spending so much time in nature, the kind of things you see in BBC documentaries narrated by David Attenborough. Last summer I woke up in the middle of the night, looked over the dock and saw a dozen spotted eagle rays slowly circling beneath me. It looked like a mobile you\u2019d hang over a baby\u2019s crib. We\u2019ve also come across mating leatherback turtles (awesome, but not so sexy), orcas and manta rays in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, a huge tiger shark in Moorea and fields of tiny eels peeking out of their holes on the sandy seafloor in Palau.Like many of my peers, I\u2019ve walked away from the type of purely basic academic science I was trained to do to focus on trying to understand and slow the rapid changes underway in ocean ecosystems. My team has been working on determining whether protection from fishing and pollution in well-policed marine reserves can moderate or reverse the loss of Caribbean corals, the small invertebrate animals that build up reefs over thousands of years.Since 2009 we\u2019ve been annually surveying 16 reefs across the Belizean Barrier Reef, half of which are inside a protected reserve. We typically survey two reefs a day, filming the seafloor with video cameras and counting and identifying every fish in 100-foot-long bands.The Caribbean has warmed by about two degrees Fahrenheit during my lifetime. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases act as a sort of blanket around the earth, trapping heat that would otherwise be lost to space. Incredibly, 94 percent of this extra heat is going into the oceans, and it\u2019s not just coral reefs that are being affected. Thousands of species are rapidly migrating away from the Equator, trying to stay cool. This is creating new mixtures of plants and animals that are interacting in new and unpredictable ways.Our goal as scientists isn\u2019t to save only endangered invertebrates like coral but to preserve the reefs that hundreds of millions of people depend on. Food, jobs, tourism revenue, recreation and buffers from coastal storms are just some of the value coastal communities get from healthy reefs.I grew up in South Florida in the 1970s, when the reefs of the Florida Keys were still relatively healthy. Snorkeling just a foot or two above acres of golden elkhorn corals was like flying over golden fields of wheat. That is what inspired me to spend my life learning and teaching about the oceans. I was about 10 years old then.By the time I graduated from high school, most of that coral splendor was gone. A disease linked to ocean warming wiped out about 99 percent of elkhorn coral colonies across the entire Caribbean \u2014 literally hundreds of millions of corals disappeared in a matter of months. This species and closely related staghorn corals had dominated Caribbean coral reefs for at least 5,000 years.Things aren\u2019t getting any better. A few days ago, a colleague, Bill Precht, a coral reef scientist with an environmental consulting firm, sent me a note describing what he saw on a recent dive at Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It\u2019s typical of my summer correspondence from fellow scientists. Depressing.\u201cThis reef is a coral graveyard,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLots of recently dead colonies now covered with a thin veil or sediment and turf algae.\u201dDespite all the loss and the looming threats, there is still so much left to conserve. Like the amazingly healthy Orbicella coral reefs I saw in the crystal-clear waters of the Bay of Pigs, Cuba, a few years ago, and the staghorn coral reefs within swimming distance of the beachfront hotels of Fort Lauderdale that are now threatened by an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project. There are also a few reefs at higher latitudes or in other lucky locations that are warming much more slowly and could hold out for decades or centuries.I really don\u2019t know how this will all turn out. Corals and other creatures could adapt to their changing environments. People could radically reduce their carbon emissions. Yet both outcomes are unlikely, and reality is draining my ocean optimism. It isn\u2019t too late, but we need to act very soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Villages, and Their Way of Life, Are \u2018Melting Away\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARUTA, Russia \u2014 With its winding dirt lanes framed by lilacs, quaint wooden houses and graceful onion-domed church, the tiny farming hamlet of Baruta was once a veritable postcard of Russian bucolic bliss.No longer. More people lie in the tightly packed church cemetery than inhabit the village. Agriculture is slowly withering, too \u2014 the roofs of handsome stone barns have collapsed, while untamed forests invade the surrounding fields.With Russia\u2019s natural population growth entering an extended period of decline, villages like Baruta are disappearing from across the country\u2019s continental expanse.\u201cWe have not had a wedding or a baptism for quite some time \u2014 we mostly have funerals,\u201d said a grizzled resident, Alexander Fyodorov, 59, one of just 17 men left in what was a thriving collective of some 500 farmers.President Vladimir V. Putin frequently cites hardy population growth as a pillar of restoring Russia\u2019s place atop the global order. \u201cDemography is a vital issue that will influence our country\u2019s development for decades to come,\u201d he said at a recent economic conference, also calling it an important gauge of social and economic well-being.There is a pronounced gap, however, between the positive terms in which Mr. Putin and his advisers habitually discuss demographic trends and the reality of the numbers.Basically, Russians are dying faster than they are being born, demographers said. Given the general hostility toward immigration, the question is to what degree the population of 146 million, including annexed Crimea, might shrink.The number of deaths exceeded the number of births in 2016 by a few thousand, and the prognosis for the years ahead is poor. From 2013 to 2015, extremely modest natural growth peaked in 2015 with just 32,038 more births than deaths. By comparison, Mexico, with a population approximately 10 percent smaller, recorded some 1.7 million more births than deaths in 2015.\u201cThe statistics and the propaganda are very different things,\u201d said Natalya V. Zubarevich, an expert in social and political geography at Moscow State University.On the world stage, Russia is flexing its newly restored military and political might in places like Syria and Ukraine, and is using cyberwarfare to distort politics in the United States and Europe. But it often seems far less robust at home.In particular, its rural areas \u2014 long considered the wellspring of Russian culture and identity \u2014 are dying.Valentin Kurbatov, a specialist in village prose, moved to the Pskov region in northwest Russia in 1964. At that time, the entire region was known for cultivating flax, from which linen is made.\u201cLinen has this heavenly blue color, and when I came here the skies were reflected in the linen fields,\u201d Mr. Kurbatov said over a long discussion that finally ended because he said it was too distressing. \u201cNow the brush and swamps have returned. Even when you ride the train to Moscow, all you see is this black forest with nothing in it.\u201dSimilar to a tire with a slow leak, villages like Baruta, 375 miles northwest of Moscow in Pskov, began to deflate after the end of the Soviet Union.The Freedom Collective Farm, the glue that held the village together, disbanded. No longer bound by strict Soviet residency rules, the young fled to big cities with better prospects.The school closed, and the church stopped holding regular services. The only gathering point left for the 160 year-round residents is a small general store that stocks plenty of vodka and a little bit of everything else.\u201cJust as fish seek deeper water, so people seek better places to live,\u201d said Mr. Fyodorov, the farmer, showing the pithy rural wisdom that Russians hold dear.Russia\u2019s demographic problem dates back at least 100 years, to the upheaval of the 1917 revolution, followed by Stalin\u2019s purges in the 1930s. Both events curbed population growth, foreshadowing the devastating impact of World War II, when the Societ Union lost some 20 million people. More recently, birthrates plunged in the years after the chaotic 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.In terms of population loss, Pskov, which borders Latvia and parts of Estonia, is among the worst hit regions in Russia. The population peaked at around 1.8 million in the 1920s, said Andrei Manakov, a demographer at Pskov State University. It is down to 642,000, and projected to drop to about 513,000 by 2033.Researchers estimate that out of 8,300 area villages in 1910, 2,000 no longer have permanent residents.The region\u2019s defense industry factories closed in the 1990s, but residents anticipated the area would become a gateway to Europe as the newly independent Baltic States next door joined the European Union.The region failed to become a hub, however, and then came the 2014 crisis over Ukraine, which brought tense relations and interrupted trade.\u201cThe border has become very unfriendly,\u201d said Lev M. Shlosberg, an opposition politician in the local legislature. \u201cBecause of the politics, the region is turning into the boondocks.\u201dIn Baruta, Dmitri Mikhailov, 40, is among the youngest full-time residents. Asked what life was like, he said, \u201cBread, but no butter,\u201d adding, \u201cIt is not completely awful, and there is not much good.\u201dA few well-maintained wooden houses dot the village, painted bright colors and surrounded by small orchards. These belong to dachniki, descendants of village inhabitants who moved to St. Petersburg or Moscow and turned their family homes into summer homes, or dachas. They keep countless villages on life support.Some of Baruta\u2019s satellite hamlets are deserted, or almost. Trees grow up through the old roads, rendering them impassable. Even local taxi drivers have trouble navigating, and mobile phone signals fade.In the cemetery of Baruta\u2019s 18th-century church, headstones are heaped with mostly faded plastic flowers. Antonia M. Levedova, 73, worked surrounded by a cloud of mosquitoes, sweeping a winter\u2019s worth of accumulated debris off the graves of her husband, grandmother, aunt and sister.Of 50 houses in the neighboring village of Seletskoe, where she was born, Ms. Levedova said, just three are inhabited all year, and a few more in the summer. It will soon disappear, she predicted.\u201cThe young left, and the old die,\u201d she said, shrugging with resignation.Her own daughter and grown grandchildren no longer visit. \u201cShe is very well educated. She does not need a village,\u201d Ms. Levedova said of her daughter. \u201cShe prefers to travel abroad.\u201dThe Pskov region has four maternity hospitals, down from 26 a decade ago, with the wealthy now usually giving birth in specialized, Russian-speaking clinics across the border in Estonia, Mr. Shlosberg said. Closing hospitals pushes people to leave even faster than closing schools, he said, adding, \u201cWe understand that the Pskov region is melting away.\u201dThe trend is similar across Russia. Under the most optimistic projections by demographers, the population by 2050 will stay the same, about 146 million, if immigration from Central Asia \u2014 which has also been dropping \u2014 balances out low birthrates. Less optimistic figures put the population around 130 million by 2050, and the most pessimistic say fewer than 100 million.\u201cWe understand that if the population is going to be small, Russia will not be able to play a role in world politics, in the economy,\u201d said Professor Manakov at Pskov State. \u201cThat is why the authorities want the birthrate to increase.\u201dAside from fewer births, problems at the other end of life also hold down the population. Mortality rates in Russia have improved markedly in the last decade, yet remain stubbornly higher than in most Western countries. Average life expectancy just reached 72, a record for Russia, yet in the developed world it is often about 76 for men and 85 or higher for women.High vodka consumption and uneven health care still cut life short. Alexander N. Tkachev, the agriculture minister, caused a stir this summer by saying that the trend toward drinking more wine and less vodka would improve the demographic situation.The government created various incentives to have more children, in particular a one-time payment of about $7,500 for a second child. It also established a medal, the Order of Parental Glory, for seven or more children, which Mr. Putin awards to parents at a nationally televised Kremlin ceremony. But such measures have not spurred sufficient change.The Pskov region has the worst ratio of births to deaths in the nation, Professor Manakov said, with 18 people per 1,000 dying every year and just 11 per 1,000 being born.Another demographer, Sergei V. Zakharov of Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics, said the military adventures and economic problems of the last two years undermined the confidence people need to reproduce, similar to what happened in the 1990s.\u201cLife is unpredictable, so people have fewer children,\u201d Mr. Zakharov said.While birthrates are declining in much of the developed world, most Western states replenish their populations with immigration. But even many of the most liberal Russians balk at welcoming immigrants from beyond the former Soviet states.Some Russians lament that something deeper, an essential part of Russian culture, will ebb along with the rural population.Baruta sits close to the string of rural estates where Alexander Pushkin, the author credited with inventing the modern Russian language, wrote some of his most famous works.Mr. Kurbatov, the specialist in village writing, said he mourned the demise of rural Russia as the very death of the roots of the language and the unique Russian soul.\u201cRussia herself is a village from birth,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything that was best \u2014 the national way of thinking, the national economy \u2014 everything was rooted in our existence on the land.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She was released a few hours later after questioning, and was not charged with a crime, according to a statement released Wednesday by the Saudi Information Ministry.

{"Headline": "Sensing Weakness, Uber\u2019s Asian Rivals Make $2.5 Billion Play", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 In East Asia, Uber\u2019s biggest rivals smell blood.Grab, the Singapore-based ride-sharing company competing with Uber for dominance in Southeast Asia, said on Monday that it expected to raise $2.5 billion in a new fund-raising round, in part with the help of the onetime major Uber competitor Didi Chuxing, which outmaneuvered its American rival in China.The round will include a combined $2 billion from Didi and the Japanese tech investment giant SoftBank that would value Grab at more than $6 billion, according to a person familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak on the record.With a big, young, tech-savvy population, Southeast Asia has been an enticing market for tech companies, though large cultural and language differences across the region complicate matters. Analysts generally point to Grab as the market leader, but Uber remains competitive in several markets. In some places, local rivals have also mounted challenges.The investment also raises questions about Uber\u2019s partnership with Didi. While the two are now partners in China, the investment announced Monday makes it clear that elsewhere, Didi still views Uber as a competitor. In the statement, Didi\u2019s founder and chief executive, Cheng Wei, pointedly showed which side he was on, saying Grab had established \u201cclear leadership in Southeast Asia\u2019s internet economy.\u201dStill, Uber is not Grab\u2019s only rival in Southeast Asia. In one of the region\u2019s most important markets, Indonesia, Grab is also squaring off against local rival Go-Jek in a competition that can be intensely local. Both companies make use of motorcycle taxis as well as cars and trucks.The new fund-raising is a significant jump from the $750 million that Grab raised last autumn. But the new $6 billion valuation shows that Grab is still tiny compared to Didi and Uber. Didi is valued at about $50 billion, while Uber is valued at almost $70 billion.Advertisement"}

That would be particularly significant for luxury carmakers like BMW, Mercedes and Toyota\u2019s Lexus brand, said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany who focuses on the auto industry.The pact to be announced on Thursday offers both Japan and the European Union an attractive alternative.The Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.\u201cWith Brexit, a huge chunk of European trade is under uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Lee-Makiyama said. \u201cThe commission is struggling for a win,\u201d he added, referring to the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc.For Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, the deal also looks like a much-needed win.Though key issues must still be ironed out, the two sides have reached agreement on several contentious issues, including cars and cheese.European negotiators had insisted that Japan lower import duties on a range of agricultural goods, in particular dairy products, an area that Tokyo has staunchly protected.In return, the Europeans offered to lower duties on vehicles from Japan, a change that could benefit Toyota and Honda, which have claimed a smaller market share than in other markets, including the United States.Still, history shows that political opposition can derail trade pacts even after the parties reach a broad agreement. The Obama administration was unable to conclude a trade deal with the European Union, even though both sides wanted one. The talks stalled largely because of opposition from the food industry and environmental activists.The proposed deal between Europe and Japan could founder for the same reasons. Environmental groups have expressed worry that drafts of the pact fall short on several issues, including curbing the illegal timber trade and tackling overfishing.European automakers said on Tuesday that they wanted assurances that the pact would truly give them access to Japan, which is notorious for tax policies and other measures that effectively exclude foreign manufacturers.\u201cJapan should resolve the remaining nontariff measures facing E.U. vehicle exports,\u201d Erik Jonnaert, secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rahm Emanuel: In Chicago, the Trains Actually Run on Time", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCHICAGO \u2014 On Thursday, in the wake of a subway derailment and an epidemic of train delays, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York declared a state of emergency for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the busiest mass transit system in America. That same day, the nation\u2019s third-busiest system \u2014 the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \u2014 handed out coupons for free coffee to riders stuck in the second year of slowdowns caused by repairs to prevent chronic fires.Meanwhile, in Chicago, a recent survey found that 85 percent of passengers are satisfied with service on our transit system, the nation\u2019s second most used.The L, Chicago\u2019s system, turned 125 this year. The elevated railway began as four wooden cars powered by coal and steam. Last year, more than 238 million rides were taken on the system, which, unlike the ones in New York and Washington, has not been troubled by systemic failures, breakdowns and delays. Even during a 28-day stretch of arctic temperatures in 2014, the L was never interrupted.How have we done it? First, we put reliability ahead of expansion. We focused relentlessly on modernizing tracks, signals, switches, stations and cars before extending lines to new destinations. Unlike New York, which has spent billions to reach Hudson Yards, or Washington, which has concentrated on trying to reach Dulles Airport (both laudable projects), Chicago has improved the existing system.Today, four of our seven rail lines are being completely rebuilt. By 2019, 40 stations will be reconstructed or brand new, and half of our tracks will be new. Chicago is the largest city in North America to offer 4G wireless throughout its system, and last month we broke ground on a factory that will manufacture the most modern fleet of rail cars in the country, the first cars to be built in Chicago since the historic Pullman factory closed in 1982.When the L\u2019s $8.5 billion modernization is complete, Chicago will be able to run about 15 more trains every hour on our busiest lines, cut 10 minutes off a trip from downtown to O\u2019Hare Airport and have trains run as fast as 55 m.p.h.Second, our management structure works. Chicago riders have closer contact with the person whose job it is to make the trains run on time: the mayor. In New York City, it is the governor in Albany. In Washington, it is an agency consisting of officials from the city, two states and the federal government.While there is no one-size-fits-all model, I am confident local control is essential to Chicago\u2019s transit success. It strengthens accountability, focuses priorities and ensures the people most directly affected by decisions have more of a voice in making those tough decisions.But even though we\u2019re doing our best, Chicago \u2014 like every municipal transit authority \u2014 needs federal support.Rather than tweeting about violence in Chicago, President Trump should be looking to Chicago as a model for the infrastructure investments and economic growth he wants to replicate across the country. Instead of embarking on his wrongheaded plan to privatize infrastructure construction, he should expand existing programs that have used local-federal partnerships to build transportation systems.Chicago has modernized its system thanks in part to the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s Core Capacity Improvement Program, which funds upgrades to existing corridors that are at or over capacity today, or will be in five years. Congress should double funding for the program to allow America\u2019s busiest mass transit systems to meet rising demand. It should also expand the low-interest federal infrastructure loans that have helped Chicago to rebuild rail lines and airports, and to create the downtown Riverwalk.And Washington should increase the portion of the Highway Trust Fund that supports mass transit to 25 percent, while also raising the gas tax by 10 cents. Yes, Americans would pay more at the pump, but it is a smarter alternative than the Trump administration\u2019s privatization plan, under which we will all pay more in tolls and fees to the private investors who would own our roads and bridges.Finally, local governments should look to innovative financing mechanisms like special taxing districts, known as TIFs \u2014 an idea Chicago borrowed from New York \u2014 to use growth in property taxes to finance transit improvements. Today we are using TIFs to match federal resources and modernize Chicago\u2019s busiest rail lines.Cities with reliable, modern mass transit are more economically competitive, have higher productivity, fewer carbon emissions and a better quality of life. And as we have seen in Chicago, mass transit not only connects people to opportunities, it also fuels growth. Modernizing our existing mass transit is one reason Chicago\u2019s economy has expanded faster than the economies of New York and Washington, and faster than the national average for the last five years.When Chicago\u2019s elevated train first soared above the streets and between the skyscrapers 125 years ago, it captured the imagination of Americans and visitors from around the world who rode its wooden cars to the 1893 World\u2019s Fair. It\u2019s a lesson for us all: The only way to keep a city moving is to invest in its future.Rahm Emanuel is the mayor of Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haitian Immigrants With Temporary Status Await Trump\u2019s Next Move", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJean Jubens Jeanty, a Haitian Uber driver who lives in Brooklyn, has his future mapped out. After completing a high school diploma program at Brooklyn College next month, he plans to start college next year. He would then seek further schooling to become a nurse or pediatrician. But the clock is ticking on his plans.Mr. Jeanty, 29, came to the United States from Port-au-Prince in September 2006 with his eldest brother and stayed after his tourist visa expired. He has what is known as temporary protected status, or T.P.S., which was granted to Haitians who were visiting the United States or living here illegally when a devastating earthquake struck their homeland in 2010. T.P.S. allows him and other Haitians to live and work legally in this country, until conditions in Haiti have improved enough to return home safely.That advice has left Haitian T.P.S. holders \u2014 as many as 58,000 in the United States, with 20,000 in New York \u2014 mired in fear. Some who have established lives here said they feared losing their dreams. Others who have lived in the United States for many years may find it difficult to adjust to life in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere\u2019s poorest country. And those with American-born children could be parted from them.\u201cI basically grew up here,\u201d said Bianca, 22, a senior at Queens College, part of the City University of New York, who asked to be identified by her middle name because of her uncertain immigration status. \u201cIt\u2019s very nerve-racking in a way. It\u2019s very unsettling to know that you\u2019re here and you don\u2019t know what tomorrow is going to bring, or what is going to happen in the next couple of months.\u201dBianca came to the country in 1998 with her mother and brother on a tourist visa, and they overstayed their time. Her father, who also has T.P.S., later joined them. She has two siblings, 14 and 18, who are United States citizens. Bianca, an aspiring educator, studies English literature and expects to graduate in December. At CUNY, the country\u2019s largest urban public university system, there were 60 students with T.P.S. last school year, the university said.Congress created the T.P.S. program in 1990 to aid countries ravaged by war, natural disasters or catastrophic events that make it too dangerous for citizens to return. Their status is renewed periodically, and recipients have to keep their permits updated to avoid deportation, at a cost of $495. Under the Obama administration, Haiti\u2019s T.P.S. permits were reviewed every 18 months, with the current extension ending today. In May, the Trump administration said the next extension would be for six months, ending on Jan. 22, 2018.\u201cHaiti just got a president in 2017,\u201d Mr. Depas said, noting that the country had had months of political instability. \u201cTo say that the country is ready to take its people back is asinine.\u201dMr. Depas said some T.P.S. recipients have decided not to renew their status for fear of giving immigration authorities information that could locate them should the program end.But Ira Mehlman, a spokesman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter immigration controls, said the decision on whether to extend the program should not center on subsequent misfortunes. Mr. Mehlman argued that T.P.S. was intended only to \u201cgive some people a ride out of the circumstances in their countries\u201d temporarily.\u201cAt some point, we expect you to go home,\u201d Mr. Mehlman added. \u201cTo simply say we are going to keep expanding it, then it\u2019s no longer temporary. It\u2019s a backdoor immigration system. There seem to be some expectations that the countries have to be a paradise before we send people back home.\u201dThough the Trump administration has taken a hard line on illegal immigration, Nisha Agarwal, commissioner of the New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, said \u201cthere\u2019s still time and ability to influence\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. But the \u201cpack your bag type of messaging immigrants are hearing from the federal government\u201d is discouraging, she added. Ms. Agarwal said her office was assisting T.P.S. holders with legal support and urged them to prepare regardless of their expectations.Support for extending the program for Haitians crosses party lines: Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican and Trump ally, also wants to see their T.P.S. eligibility extended. Florida has a large Haitian population.As for Mr. Jeanty, he is hoping that immigration authorities will grant a longer extension in January. \u201cA person like me who is working and paying taxes, going to school and have nothing on my record \u2014 why not keep me here?\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing to go back to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Predictably, China\u2019s Year-on-Year Growth Maintains Its Steady Pace", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Leave it to other countries to soar and swoon in their quarterly economic performance. China prefers a steady pace, at least in its officially reported data.On Monday, the country announced that its economy had expanded 6.9 percent in the second quarter, unchanged from the year-on-year growth rate in the first quarter.What keeps the growth rate of the Chinese economy so smooth? Accounting sleight of hand may play some role. Studies over the years have found that China\u2019s national statisticians appear to overstate growth during periods of economic weakness and understate growth when the economy is booming. A series of recent scandals, particularly in China\u2019s northeast, have also indicated that local officials may overreport economic activity to Beijing when local industries like coal mining and steel production run into difficulty.China said on Friday afternoon that it was revising its economic output data to take better account of fast-growing sectors like intellectual property, health care, tourism and so-called emerging industries. But Xing Zhihong, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said on Monday morning that this was a continuing project that had not been applied to the second-quarter growth statistics.China\u2019s consistent growth also reflects the government\u2019s constant intervention as officials try to reach predetermined targets for the country\u2019s economy \u2014 currently 6.5 percent growth or better.The biggest reason the Chinese economy keeps growing quickly is that the state-controlled banking system keeps pouring in loans, although the government began tapering the flow slightly during the second quarter.Total social financing plus bonds, the broadest measure of credit, expanded 14.7 percent in June compared with the same month a year earlier. In most countries, that would be a breathtaking pace. But in China, it was actually a slight slowdown: Credit was up 15.3 percent in May from a year earlier.The Communist Party Congress, which is held once every five years and chooses the country\u2019s top leadership, will be in midautumn. So China\u2019s leaders have been eager to keep the economy growing briskly at least until then.While a sizable chunk of China\u2019s economy may depend these days on building roads and rail lines into the desert using borrowed money, industrial production and services are also strong.Steel demand has been vigorous, especially in residential construction. Housing prices have surged in the past 15 months, ever since the government decided during a period of economic weakness in early 2016 to make it much easier for families to borrow for home buying. Some of the biggest cities, like Beijing, have recently tried to curb real estate speculation with administrative limits, but these rules have had limited effect, as credit has stayed plentiful. Overall industrial production rose 7.6 percent in June from a year earlier, the government announced on Monday morning, an unexpectedly faster tempo than May\u2019s 6.5 percent.Year-on-year growth in retail sales accelerated to 11 percent in June from 10.7 percent in May, while fixed-asset investment also picked up speed in June.Part of China\u2019s economic health in the second quarter reflected robust exports, with demand beginning to recover in Europe and particularly the United States after a long period of depressed growth. But what counts in the overall economy is not the value of the exports but whether the trade surplus narrows or widens. In that respect, there were a few clouds on China\u2019s horizon.China\u2019s imports rose 14.5 percent in the second quarter from the same period last year as prices soared for iron ore and other raw materials essential to Chinese manufacturing. Chinese exports rose only 9.1 percent in the second quarter.The composition of Chinese exports also changed in ways that could intensify trade friction and affect China\u2019s trade surplus. China is becoming even more dependent on exports to the United States, with sales reaching their second-highest level ever last month, trailing only September 2015.Chinese imports from the United States have also risen, but most of the extra purchases have been oil and other raw materials, which create many fewer jobs than manufacturing.President Trump promised during his campaign to create more American jobs through a more confrontational approach on trade toward China. But since taking office, he has focused more heavily on addressing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and on very narrow trade talks involving industries like steel manufacturing and beef production.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pop-Up Employer: Build a Team, Do the Job, Say Goodbye", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the organization chart for the maker of True Story, a card game and mobile app in which players trade stories from their daily lives, resembled that of any company. There was a content division to churn out copy for game cards; graphic designers to devise the logo and the packaging; developers to build the mobile app and the website. There was even a play-testing division to catch potential hiccups.Upon closer inspection, the producer of True Story wasn\u2019t really a firm: The workers were all freelancers who typically had never met and, perhaps more striking, the entire organization existed solely to create the game and then disbanded.True Story was a case study in what two Stanford professors call \u201cflash organizations\u201d \u2014 ephemeral setups to execute a single, complex project in ways traditionally associated with corporations, nonprofit groups or governments.And, in fact, intermediaries are already springing up across industries like software and pharmaceuticals to assemble such organizations. They rely heavily on data and algorithms to determine which workers are best suited to one another, and also on decidedly lower-tech innovations, like middle management.But to the extent that temporary organizations replace permanent ones, they have the potential to add to the economic uncertainty that workers must increasingly contend with.Temporary organizations capable of taking on complicated projects have existed for decades, of course, perhaps nowhere more prominently than in Hollywood, where producers assemble teams of directors, writers, actors, costume and set designers and a variety of other craftsmen and technicians to execute projects with budgets in the tens if not hundreds of millions.In principle, many companies would find it more cost-effective to increase staff members as needed than to maintain a permanent presence. The reason they do not, economists have long argued, is that the mechanics of hiring, training and monitoring workers separately for each project can be prohibitively expensive.But Ms. Valentine, who studies management science, and Mr. Bernstein, a computer scientist, note that technology is sharply lowering these costs. \u201cComputation, we think, has an opportunity to dramatically shift several costs in a way that traditional organizations haven\u2019t realized,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s way easier to search for people, bargain and contract with them.\u201dThere is some evidence that the corporate world, which has spent decades outsourcing work to contractors and consulting firms, is embracing temporary organizations. In 2007, Jody Miller, a former media executive and venture capitalist, was a co-founder of the Business Talent Group, which sets up temporary teams of freelancers for corporations.\u201cWe\u2019re the producers,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cWe understand how to evaluate talent, pick the team.\u201dSome of Ms. Miller\u2019s biggest clients are in the pharmaceutical industry, whose economics are not unlike Hollywood\u2019s in that it is heavily project-based and a small handful of blockbusters drive most of the profits. Business Talent Group teams frequently work on the kickoff of a new drug \u2014 devising the strategy for reaching out to patient groups, journalists, doctors and insurers \u2014 and help pry open new markets for existing drugs.Similar intermediaries have sprouted in other industries. In the tech world, there is Gigster, a platform founded in 2014 that knits freelancers together into software-building teams, so that an entrepreneur with no technical know-how can hand off an idea and get back a fully functional app in months or a prototype in weeks.In entertainment, there is Artella, a platform that helps freelance animators, sound designers and other talent form teams that produce animated features. Artella, by also providing the costly technical tools that support animation, may one day allow freelancers to compete with the major studios.Ms. Valentine and Mr. Bernstein wanted to take the concept further. They created a platform, Foundry, in which the process of assembling and running a temporary organization could be automated, without so much as a phone call.Each project began with a project leader and an organization chart. To fill each role, Foundry emailed a group of qualified workers on Upwork, a huge freelancer site, which generated pools of candidates. Once the workers were hired, something Foundry could do automatically, they were assigned tasks and communicated through Slack, the messaging software. The organization chart could be altered as needed, generating new roles and new workers.The professors recently presented their research at a prestigious computer-science conference.Three lessons stand out across the flash-type models. First is that the platforms tend to be highly dependent on data and computing power. Roger Dickey, a co-founder of Gigster, says every member of each team assembled by the company reviews every other member, generating 20 to 30 data points per person per project. Artificial intelligence then looks for patterns and helps the company figure out how best to build future teams.Second is the importance of well-established roles. Sociologists and organizational theorists have marveled for decades at the way disaster response teams or emergency room trauma units pull off complex tasks, even if they have never met before, because the division of labor is understood.The same goes for flash teams. Dave Summa, who worked on a team that the Business Talent Group assembled to advise a major agribusiness company on which markets to compete in, said it fell to him to define the questions that needed answering and the mode of analysis, while a colleague oversaw teams of workers who produced specific plans.\u201cHe was very detail-oriented and meticulous,\u201d Mr. Summa said. \u201cHe let me do what I was good at. I let him do what he was good at.\u201dThen there is perhaps the least likely of innovations: middle management. The typical freelancer performs worker-bee tasks. Flash-like organizations tend to combine both workers and managers.True Story, according to Daniel Steinbock, one of the game\u2019s inventors, would have been lost without its managers. When the writers, who composed short poems for each game card, first submitted their work, he and his business partner had one overriding impression: \u201cMost of the content was really bad,\u201d he said.\u201cBut some of it was less bad,\u201d he added. What followed was a long, tortured cycle of identifying the poems that had some redeeming value and asking the writers to try again and again. The key to the process was another freelancer they hired to oversee this work, who later became jokingly known as the chief poetry officer. \u201cSomewhere along the way they got hired to manage the process of deciding what was good and what was not,\u201d Mr. Steinbock said. \u201cThat worked well.\u201dThe flash organization has obvious limits. It tends to work best for projects with well-defined life spans, not continuing engagements. Microsoft probably would not set up one to build Windows given that it releases a new version every few years.Yet the flash model appears to have revolutionary potential. If nothing else, millions of middle-management jobs that fell by the wayside in recent decades might one day be reincarnated as freelance project-manager positions. \u201cThe bottleneck now is project managers,\u201d Ms. Valentine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough position to fill.\u201dAnd while traditional white-collar freelancing \u2014 and certainly its gig-economy equivalent on platforms like Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk \u2014 can be isolating, being part of an organization tends to be emotionally satisfying.\u201cOne thing that was really surprising and exciting about what we saw was how quickly flash organizations developed solidarity and collective behavior,\u201d Ms. Valentine said. Flash organizations may even promote upward mobility \u2014 if, say, the person brought in to crank out one-line poems can ascend to a supervisory position.Still, even while fostering flexibility, the model could easily compound insecurity. Temporary firms are not likely to provide health or retirement benefits. And even if high-skilled workers like project managers and web developers find they are well compensated on the open market, said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, low-skilled workers tend to fare worse outside firms.Mr. Bernstein concedes that the anxiety is legitimate, though he says platforms could eventually dampen insecurity by playing a role that companies have historically played: providing benefits, topping off earnings if workers\u2019 freelance income is too low or too spotty, even allowing workers to organize.\u201cThis could be a potent force among many in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a policy perspective, we have to figure out how to empower labor when contracts last a few minutes or a few weeks.\u201dFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Businesses Split Over Republican Health Plans", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall-business owners have been some of the most vocal opponents of the Affordable Care Act. One trade group fought the overhaul all the way to the Supreme Court.But for many solo entrepreneurs and freelancers, the seeming collapse of the Senate\u2019s efforts to repeal and replace the law came as a relief.She fears that the health care law\u2019s elimination would force her or her husband, a self-employed photographer, to work at a large company to gain affordable health coverage for them and their two daughters.\u201cBeing able to buy health insurance that didn\u2019t completely break us financially was key to our ability to take the risk and become entrepreneurs,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said.With so many forces aligned in opposition to the Senate\u2019s proposed changes, the views of small-business owners have not been a decisive factor. But the enthusiasm that a growing number are voicing for the health care law weakened the argument, often cited by Republicans, that small businesses had been harmed by it and need a rollback.Business owners with a few dozen or more workers often resent the cost and regulatory burden of complying with the law\u2019s mandates, and many have backed the Republican efforts. For those who employ only themselves, however, some of the features of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 like coverage for existing conditions and curbs on prices \u2014 opened up coverage unavailable to them before the law.In addition, there is a vocal group of self-employed workers who are, like many people, paying higher premiums and deductibles because of the law. But some of them want lawmakers to adjust the law to address those higher costs, instead of repealing and replacing it entirely.As the Senate took up its overhaul proposals, the trade group pressed hard for a full repeal \u2014 and then criticized lawmakers for not getting it done.\u201cSmall-business owners are deeply disappointed,\u201d Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the group, said. \u201cThe high cost of health care has been the No. 1 concern for small-business owners for more than three decades. Obamacare made that problem worse, driving up costs and shrinking choices. The Senate had a chance to address the problem, and they blew it.\u201dSmall-business owners generally face higher per-person insurance costs for themselves and their employees than large employers, because individuals and smaller groups are inherently more risky to insure \u2014 and, therefore, more expensive \u2014 than the larger pools that big employers can assemble. The Affordable Care Act tried to address some of those problems by requiring insurers to set level premiums for all individual policyholders by age and by prohibiting insurers from dropping policyholders if they got sick.Joel Schaubert, 51, a software consultant in Minneapolis, said that before the law, he worried about what would happen if he harmed his left arm, which he broke a decade ago in a biking accident. It became a pre-existing condition, and as he navigated the individual insurance market, the policies he bought explicitly excluded it from coverage, he said. That changed only after the health law took effect.\u201cI can finally get insurance that covers my entire body,\u201d Mr. Schaubert said.But to expand coverage and bring in enough healthy customers to keep various insurance pools afloat, the government also forced some trade-offs. To put more people into the individual insurance market, it stopped allowing sole proprietors to join small-group pools and required them to instead buy individual coverage.\u201cIt\u2019s just sucking the life out of us financially,\u201d Ms. Gomberg said.\u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to be without coverage \u2014 it\u2019s a scary thing \u2014 I\u2019ve got to support myself,\u201d Ms. Petrocelli said.Both Ms. Gomberg and Ms. Petrocelli said that they broadly supported the Affordable Care Act, but they would like to see its benefits spread around more evenly. They like the safety net it provides but are frustrated at the often high individual costs involved in making the system work.He had hoped for a full repeal. Failing that, he hopes lawmakers will put aside their partisan differences and work together on fixes.\u201cI\u2019m in the bracket that got hit the hardest: I\u2019m young, relatively healthy, and my employer doesn\u2019t provide health care,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cI would like to see something, anything, happen to bring down premiums.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pilot in the Cockpit? In Japan, He Might Be a Retiree", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAGASAKI, Japan \u2014 Shigekazu Miyazaki is spending what should have been his retirement 25,000 feet in the air.Mr. Miyazaki, a pilot with nearly four decades\u2019 experience at All Nippon Airways, Japan\u2019s largest airline, left the carrier last year at its mandatory retirement age of 65. But rather than take up golf or fishing, Mr. Miyazaki since April has been piloting 39-seat propeller planes for Oriental Air Bridge, a tiny airline that connects the southwestern city of Nagasaki to a group of remote islands.\u201cI never would have thought I\u2019d still be flying at 65,\u201d Mr. Miyazaki, who is trim and has a deep voice and a full head of gray hair, said before a recent flight. \u201cBut I\u2019m still healthy, and I love to fly, so why not do it as long as I can?\u201dA man in his seventh decade extending his commercial flying career still qualifies as a novelty in Japan \u2014 but maybe not for long.All of that makes older workers more crucial to the economy. More than half of Japanese men over the age of 65 do some kind of paid work, according to government surveys, compared with a third of American men and as little as 10 percent in parts of Europe.Japan may offer a peek into the near future for other developed countries with aging work forces, including the United States.\u201cIf places like Germany and the United States are raising the age where people can collect pensions to 67, there\u2019s no reason Japan shouldn\u2019t go to 70,\u201d said Atsushi Seike, an expert on labor economics at Keio University in Tokyo. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a point where a 40-year career is just half the average life span, and having people become inactive too early is unsustainable.\u201dOlder workers may also partly explain the puzzle of Japan\u2019s stagnant wages, which have barely budged despite low unemployment. Older workers generally earn much less than at the peak of their careers, offsetting increases among the young and middle-aged.Oriental Air Bridge had never hired a pilot Mr. Miyazaki\u2019s age before, but, with skilled pilots in short supply nationwide, it has been expanding its recruiting.For Mr. Miyazaki, the choice to keep flying was a luxury. As a captain at All Nippon, where he flew Boeing 767s, primarily to Southeast Asia, he earned the equivalent of several hundred thousand dollars a year plus a generous pension. Oriental Air Bridge pays him only about a third of his peak salary, but he says he does not mind.\u201cThe jets I used to fly were highly automated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, with the propeller planes, I can enjoy a freer, more visual kind of flying. It means getting back to the basics as a pilot.\u201dIn the cockpit of Mr. Miyazaki\u2019s Bombardier Dash 8, flying still looks plenty complicated.During a recent flight back to Nagasaki from Tsushima, a rugged island of 30,000 residents, Mr. Miyazaki scanned a dashboard crammed with instruments and went over checklists with a co-pilot 20 years his junior.He acknowledged having been \u201ca little uneasy\u201d about studying for the new license that he needed to fly the Dash 8s, a process that took eight months. Mastering each new routine or procedure, he estimated, required 50 percent more repetitions than it would have when he attended flight school in the 1970s.\u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you can pull an all-nighter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read the textbooks in half-hour chunks. At my age, you have to manage your time.\u201dMr. Miyazaki left his wife behind in Tokyo when he took the job in Nagasaki, but he said she supported his choice. \u201cShe wants me to work as long as I\u2019m physically able.\u201dSome jobs in Japan are becoming distinctly gray. More than half of Japanese taxi drivers are over the age of 60, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, while less than 10 percent are under 40.Morimasa Mizunoya, a retired jeweler, recently signed up for work at a Tokyo seniors\u2019 center, under a government-sponsored program that matches older workers with employers offering short-term and part-time jobs. It is a \u201cgig economy\u201d platform without the smartphone app: Seniors register in person, while would-be employers call or email the center with offers.\u201cMy eyes started going, so that was the end of jewelry,\u201d Mr. Mizunoya, 69, said as he pasted a sheet of fresh white paper onto a traditional Japanese sliding door. A building owner needed 60 extra-large doors repapered, a job Mr. Mizunoya and another retiree hoped to finish in about two weeks. Normally they made 1,400 yen a door, or about $13, but the bigger ones paid more.\u201cThe money\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s something to do,\u201d said Mr. Mizunoya, who said he spent most of his nonwork days playing Go, the ancient board game, and lived off money from a real estate investment and the extra he earned with the doors.Yoshimitsu Hori, who runs the job program at the seniors\u2019 center, said demand for workers exceeded supply. Not all jobs were popular, though. The most numerous requests were for people to clean apartments and offices, which few wanted to do. Stuffing envelopes, affixing labels to empty bento boxes and taking tickets at museums were viewed as better gigs.At Oriental Air Bridge, snagging a pilot of any age from a big international airline is a coup. The company\u2019s office is a corrugated tin building at the edge of Nagasaki Airport, and its outdated hangars are too small for its two planes to fit completely inside. It is planning to expand, with new routes and a sharper focus on tourism.Mr. Miyazaki said he swam twice a week to maintain his health, and he underwent more physical testing than younger pilots \u2014 MRIs, electrocardiograms, treadmill tests for stamina. Under current Japanese regulations, he will have to stop flying commercially at 68, but the government has started examining whether to extend the maximum age to 70.\u201cI have at least three years left, maybe five,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I have my health, I want to make the most of them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But to President Trump, the real chatter was about the 2016 presidential election in the United States \u2014 or, specifically, John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.In the middle of one of the most important annual summits for world leaders \u2014 and his first \u2014 Mr. Trump made time to tweet that Mr. Podesta didn\u2019t hand over a computer server to the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. as part of the federal investigation into the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s emails.Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!The server was never in Mr. Podesta\u2019s possession, and at first, it appeared that perhaps only Mr. Trump was publicly talking about it.That is, until Mr. Podesta chimed in.In a series of pit stops during a cross-country road trip with his wife, Mr. Podesta tweeted back to call Mr. Trump a \u201cwhack job\u201d and to tell him to \u201cget a grip\u201d and \u201cget your head in the game.\u201d Mr. Podesta reminded Mr. Trump that he was representing the United States at the forum in Hamburg, Germany, for the leaders of the world\u2019s largest economies.If the White House was hoping to avoid bringing attention to ongoing Washington investigations into whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates colluded with Moscow, the president\u2019s tweet thrust the saga back into spotlight. It was the latest example of his history of writing incendiary tweets that seize attention.The F.B.I. has been investigating the hacks and possible coordination between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s associates since last summer, a probe that has dogged his presidency and, in doing so, infuriated the commander-in-chief.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet on Friday came hours before his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a much-anticipated encounter after the American leader had for months praised the longtime adversary of the United States.Secretary of State Rex W.

{"Headline": "Trump Says He Has Signed More Bills Than Any President, Ever. He Hasn\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To hear President Trump tell it, his first six months in the White House should be judged in part by the legislation he has signed into law.On Monday, he went even further, claiming to have bested all of his predecessors in turning bills into law.\u201cWe\u2019ve signed more bills \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about through the legislature \u2014 than any president, ever,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a \u201cMade in America\u201d event at the White House. \u201cFor a while, Harry Truman had us. And now, I think, we have everybody.\u201dTurning to Vice President Mike Pence, he added an aside about news media fact-checkers: \u201cI better say \u2018think\u2019; otherwise they will give you a Pinocchio. And I don\u2019t like Pinocchios.\u201dIn fact, as he approaches six months in office on Thursday, Mr. Trump is slightly behind the\u00a0lawmaking\u00a0pace for the\u00a0past six presidents, who as a group\u00a0signed an\u00a0average\u00a0of\u00a043 bills during the same period. And an analysis of the bills Mr. Trump\u00a0signed shows that about half were minor and inconsequential, passed by Congress with little debate.\u00a0Among recent presidents, both the total number of bills he signed and the legislation\u2019s substance make Mr. Trump about average.President Jimmy Carter signed 70 bills in the first six months, according to an analysis of bills signed by previous White House occupants. Bill Clinton signed 50. George W. Bush signed 20 bills into law. Barack Obama signed 39 bills during the period, including an $800 billion stimulus program to confront an economic disaster, legislation to make it easier for women to sue for equal pay, a bill to give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco and an expansion of the federal health insurance program for children.Mr. Trump has signed several significant bills, many in the works on Capitol Hill since well before he arrived in the Oval Office, as is often the case for new presidents. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies point to a\u00a0bill\u00a0he\u00a0signed\u00a0to improve accountability and overhaul services at the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department. They note that the president signed into law spending plans that will significantly raise federal expenditures on the military and border security. And they say Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress worked to methodically reduce the burden of government regulation.\u201cThese repeal bills are now law, which means those Obama regulations have been struck from the books\u00a0\u2014\u00a0forever,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said recently.And legislation is not the only tool presidents can wield to enact their agendas. His aides note that Mr. Trump has used executive orders, such as his ban on travel to the United States for refugees and those living in some Muslim countries, to get around what they say is unprecedented obstruction by Democrats. And he successfully won confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.But almost half the other bills Mr. Trump has signed into law are ceremonial or routine.\u00a0The president includes in his count laws like the one to rename the federal courthouse in Nashville after\u00a0Fred Thompson, the\u00a0actor and former senator who died in 2015. Even the Republican leadership in the Senate does not count those kinds\u00a0of bills when they tally their legislative achievements.By contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s tally\u00a0includes three laws to appoint members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents, another\u00a0to seek research into better weather reports, and one to require the Department of Homeland Security to manage its fleet of\u00a0vehicles\u00a0more efficiently.Marc Short, the president\u2019s top legislative adviser, acknowledged that no one would try to claim that renaming a building should be considered \u201clandmark legislation.\u201d But he defended the president\u2019s repeated promotion of the bills he has signed into law.\u201cIt\u2019s a response to a lot of media coverage that has tried to downplay what he\u2019s accomplished,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cThere\u2019s an overarching coverage about what\u2019s not been accomplished. The president is trying to point out what we actually have done.\u201dMr. Trump has\u00a0signed two budget bills\u00a0that would be required of any president. He signed a law largely endorsing the budget for NASA that Mr. Obama had laid out. And Mr. Trump temporarily extended Mr. Obama\u2019s program that gives veterans a choice of seeing a private doctor in certain cases.Mr. Trump may yet assemble a more far-reaching legislative record. Getting comprehensive legislation through Congress and to the president\u2019s desk takes time, even when the president\u2019s party controls both chambers of Congress. By the end of his tenure, Mr. Bush had signed major tax cuts, expanded surveillance with the Patriot Act,\u00a0authorized votes to wage war,\u00a0overhauled federal education laws, established free-trade deals\u00a0and expanded Medicare to include prescription drugs. Mr. Obama eventually passed the Affordable Care Act and imposed new rules on financial services firms. Roosevelt created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority,\u00a0enacted\u00a0Social Security and\u00a0started public works projects in response to the Great Depression,\u00a0and began farm subsidies.But for him to compile major legislative achievements will take time, said David R. Mayhew, a professor of political science at Yale who tracks the legislative achievements of American presidents.\u201cGenerally speaking, Congress needs many months to do something big,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump frequently points to his work on behalf of veterans, who supported him by almost two to one over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, as evidence of his legislative success. At a recent rally on behalf of military families, Mr. Trump bragged that he had signed legislation that \u201cwent through the House, went through the Senate, and I signed it really fast.\u201dJohn Hoellwarth, the\u00a0national\u00a0communications\u00a0director for Amvets, called the new law \u201ca positive step\u201d but said it was a small part of overall improvements at the department that had been put in place, slowly, for years.\u201cA lot of the things that are moving the Department of Veterans Affairs in the right direction actually got underway before the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Hoellwarth said, noting that Mr. Trump had appointed a former Obama administration official to be his secretary of veterans affairs.Another bill that Mr. Trump signed extended an Obama-era program that allows some veterans to see private doctors, and streamlined the way their deductibles and co-pays get processed. The law is essentially an accounting maneuver intended to give lawmakers more time to debate more substantive changes.A third new law allows community policing grants to be used to hire and train veterans to be officers.Since\u00a0becoming\u00a0law in 1996, the Congressional Review Act has allowed presidents to use legislation to roll back his predecessor\u2019s regulations. But until Mr. Trump took office, that power had been used only once \u2014 by Mr. Bush, who reversed a rule on workplace injuries.\u00a0Working with the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Trump has used it 15 times to unravel what he said were overly burdensome regulations imposed on Americans and businesses.Collectively, the 15 regulatory laws may represent the president\u2019s broadest legislative impact, though they are less about doing things and more about undoing them. Signing the bills into law allowed the president, with the flick of a pen, to erase rules on the environment, labor, financial protections, internet privacy, abortion, education and gun rights.\u201cThat\u2019s saving about $18 billion a year in compliance costs,\u201d Mr. Short said, including the impact of the president\u2019s executive orders that seek to reverse regulations. \u201cWe think they are a huge part of the economic success of the first six months.\u201dBut Mr. Trump can no longer use the tool.The review act gives presidents and lawmakers 60 legislative days to rapidly roll back major regulations put in place by a previous administration. That deadline has passed. If Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers want to overturn any more Obama-era regulations, they will have to do it through the normal\u00a0lawmaking\u00a0or regulatory processes, which can take years.Mr. Trump signed legislation that approved nearly $20 billion in spending for NASA, keeping its financing level almost unchanged from Mr. Obama\u2019s budget. The budget would allow NASA to pursue sending\u00a0humans to Mars during the next two decades, and would continue work on rockets that have long been in development.As a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to wage an all-out assault on the federal bureaucracy. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s senior strategist, has promised a daily fight for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative assault\u00a0has moved slowly. The four bills designed to improve government functions that he has signed into law since taking office have made only\u00a0small\u00a0tweaks.In addition to signing two budget bills, Mr. Trump signed a bill to improve processing of pension benefits for police officers. And he signed a dozen routine or ceremonial bills that attracted little attention.When Mr. Trump nominated\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Jim Mattis to be secretary of defense, he needed Congress to pass a law waiving the prohibition against appointing a defense secretary within seven years of\u00a0the nominee\u2019s retirement\u00a0from\u00a0active duty in the military.Mr. Trump signed that bill into law, too.Michael D.

A South Korean group, the Korea International Trade Association, said on Monday that North Korea had exported as much iron to China in the first five months of 2017 as it did in all of 2016.But the group also said that North Korea\u2019s exports of coal to China remained frozen.

Look at Paramount\u2019s \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight.\u201d That sequel managed only $45 million in its opening weekend in North America, but it took in $120 million in China.On closer look, however, the rosy picture doesn\u2019t quite hold up, underscoring why Hollywood has recently been pushing so hard for film-related concessions from the Chinese government.New data from comScore, a Virginia-based analytics firm, indicates that Hollywood is having a tough time in China. From Jan. 1 to June 30, Chinese cinemas played 24 movies from Hollywood, generating $1.76 billion in ticket sales. In the same period a year earlier, the country let in 22 Hollywood movies, which collected about $1.73 billion.So as they scratch for growth, studios like 20th Century Fox and Universal have been scrambling to position themselves as bigger players in China, where the number of movie screens has increased to more than 40,600 from 12,407 in 2012. The accounting firm PwC recently estimated that China would have roughly 80,377 screens by 2021 \u2014 double the number in the United States.But analysts say studios are facing systemic challenges in the country, including a slowing overall economy. Chinese moviegoers are also growing more discerning; film quality is increasingly important. Movie theaters in China may also be hurt as streaming services proliferate. More than 80 million people in the country now pay to watch video online, a 32 percent increase from last year, according to Analysys, a Beijing research firm.American movie executives are also pushing for shorter blackout periods, which China uses to promote local films, and longer marketing windows; under the current setup, Hollywood studios are given only about a month to mount advertising campaigns for their movies.\u201cThat\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d Mr. Rosen said, referring to more advance notice. (China controls the release dates.)Hollywood also wants to receive a bigger portion of ticket sales. Studios receive about 50 percent of box-office revenue in the United States, but China allows foreign companies to receive only a 25 percent cut. Studios have asked for closer to 40 percent.Mr. Rosen said negotiations over revised film terms, taking place between Chinese officials and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, could drag into next year. He noted that the Communist Party\u2019s 19th Party Congress will take place in Beijing in the fall.\u201cI would be very, very surprised if anything was in place related to Hollywood before that,\u201d Mr. Rosen said.Advertisement"}

Where is money actually being invested?\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt she must be deeply concerned by the turn we have taken in Washington but there is no advantage to her in using inflammatory language,\u201d said Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cAt the end, she is a servant of the shareholders and of course, one in particular has overwhelming power with the organization, so the best she can do is prod.\u201dIt revised its forecasts downward for Britain, given the risks around Brexit, and for the United States, given what Ms. Lagarde labeled \u201cless obvious fiscal development and less rapid infrastructure investment than we had initially thought.\u201dShe identified the major medium-term risks to the world economy as inequality, the \u201cbacklash\u201d against globalization, international trade and technological breakthroughs.She warned of those who feel left behind by globalization \u2014 those who feel \u201cthere is nothing there for them, as a result of which, populist voices can actually carry the day and prevail over other forces\u201d \u2014 a group political analysts have identified as driving Mr. Trump\u2019s win in November.Having joked about the possibility of the I.M.F. headquarters relocating to Beijing in ten years, she also flagged concerns around China\u2019s commitments to the Paris accord.\u201cIt will be critically important in order to secure staff eagerness to travel that the climate change commitments made by China be actually respected and acted upon,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Modern World Made Cowards of Us All", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBACK in the late 1980s, Dana Carvey of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d used to do a funny impression of President George H. W. Bush, in which the character would justify his own supposed timidity by muttering \u201cwouldn\u2019t be prudent\u201d to himself about every small risk. The impression neatly captured the contemporary notion of prudence: faintheartedness, caution and a general bias against action.So perhaps it seems odd that this is my advice for young people heading out of school and into the world: Be prudent.Yes, it sounds boring, but it may turn out to be a more radical suggestion than most graduates hear.Then I had an epiphany. When I finally read the German philosopher Josef Pieper\u2019s \u201cThe Four Cardinal Virtues,\u201d which had sat unread on my shelf for years, I was shocked to learn that I didn\u2019t hate prudence; what I hated was its current \u2014 and incorrect \u2014 definition.The connotation of prudence as caution, or aversion to risk, is a modern invention. \u201cPrudence\u201d comes from the Latin \u201cprudentia,\u201d meaning sagacity or expertise. The earliest English uses from the 14th century had little to do with fearfulness or habitual reluctance. Rather, it signified righteous decision making that is rooted in acuity and practical wisdom.Mr. Pieper argued that we have bastardized this classical concept. We have refashioned prudence into an excuse for cowardice, hiding behind the language of virtue to avoid what he calls \u201cthe embarrassing situation of having to be brave.\u201d The correct definition, Mr. Pieper argued, is the willingness to do the right thing, even if that involves fear and risk.In other words, to be rash is only one breach of true prudence. It is also a breach to be timid. So which offense is more common today?A new study by the University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt helps answer this question. He started with the premise that people who agonize over important choices may systematically make wrong decisions, defaulting to either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d with too much regularity. To investigate, Mr. Levitt found several thousand people in the throes of a difficult decision, weighing choices like job offers and marriage proposals, who volunteered to let him make the decision for them \u2014 with the flip of a coin.Heads meant to decide in the affirmative; tails meant to decline. (Let it sink in that thousands of people agreed to have their most important decisions made by a stranger \u2014 worse, an economist \u2014 flipping a coin.) When given heads, Mr. Levitt found people were much more likely to take the decision affirmatively than they would be if left to their devices, so the experiment was effective.But the really interesting result concerned the participants\u2019 happiness. In follow-up interviews six months later, Mr. Levitt found that the average \u201cheads\u201d person was significantly happier than the average \u201ctails\u201d person.Here\u2019s what all this means: Our sin tends to be timidity, not rashness. On average, we say \u201cno\u201d too much when faced with an opportunity or dilemma.Once you start looking for this imprudently risk-averse behavior, you see it everywhere, particularly among young people. According to data from the General Social Survey collected by NORC at the University of Chicago, people under age 30 today are almost a third less willing than under-30s in 1996 to relocate for their careers. And as the economist Tyler Cowen observes in his new book \u201cThe Complacent Class,\u201d the fraction of people in this age group who own their own businesses has plummeted by about 65 percent since the 1980s.Economic changes have contributed to both trends, to be sure. But there is another culprit: a diminishing frontier spirit and an increasing paranoia about taking big leaps.Family formation, perhaps the ultimate personal leap of faith, looks to be another victim of this imprudent hesitation. Census Bureau demographers recently reported that while only a quarter of 24- to 29-year-olds were unmarried in the 1980s, almost half of that age group is unmarried today. And delaying the jump to adulthood has real social consequences. Last August, the Centers for Disease Control announced that the United States fertility rate had fallen to its lowest point since they began calculating it in 1909.My checkered past, it turns out, may not be a litany of imprudent decisions. True prudence means eschewing safety and familiarity in favor of entrepreneurial living. It requires clear eyes, a courageous heart and an adventurous spirit.So take a risk. Be prudent. Don\u2019t wait for social scientists to flip a coin on your behalf. Choose heads.Arthur C. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

American officials claim he pressed Putin on Russia\u2019s messing in our presidential election. Putin\u2019s people insist Trump accepted Russia\u2019s assurances that nothing happened.We will now explain how this outcome was inevitable.Our president, as you know, has ever-changing personas, ranging from statesmanlike Reader-of-Speeches to Nearly Unhinged Trump, a version frequently seen on Twitter.And Diplomacy Don, who seemed to fall head over heels for Putin.\u201cPresident Putin and I have been discussing various things and I think it\u2019s going very well. We\u2019ve had some very, very good talks,\u201d Trump said. This was before the meeting even began. What do you think he was referring to? A late night pajama party? The two had never met in person before, even though, as a candidate, Trump seemed to nurse memories of an imaginary encounter.Then off they went, for a meeting that went on for more than two hours. Halfway through, Melania came in to remind Trump they had other things to do. Naturally, he ignored her.The two presidents agreed to a prearranged limited Syrian cease-fire. And they did talk about Russian meddling in the American election. But which Trump do you think brought the subject up? The day before, a version who took a few questions from reporters in Poland seemed to regard the whole matter as the sort of moral equivalent of jaywalking. (\u201cA lot of people interfere. I think it\u2019s been happening for a long time.\u201d)That was Ad Lib Trump, who is always \u2026 interesting. Then Nearly Unhinged emerged overnight and took to Twitter, blaming the election hacking scandal on the Democrats: \u201cEveryone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!\u201dSeveral questions arose, the chief one being why the leaders of the most important nations in the world would be talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, whose current occupation was taking a cross-country drive with his wife.Nearly Unhinged disappeared before the big sit-down and was replaced by a Trump version we\u2019ll call Good At Meetings. GAM sits there nodding a lot, leading the other side to think he\u2019s in agreement when in fact he\u2019s just wondering what he\u2019s going to have for dinner. Across from him was Putin, the guy who assumes that he\u2019s won every debate unless the other side makes resistance so clear that they have to be arrested.Perfect match! No wonder Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there was \u201ca very clear positive chemistry between the two.\u201dPreviously, Europe had gotten a look at a number of other variations of our president. Speechreading Trump, who usually makes a good impression, went on a Crusader kick in Poland, calling for a defense of Western civilization from \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cthe steady creep of government bureaucracy.\u201dAt around the same time, Japan and the European Union announced a big trade deal, which will be great news for Japanese automakers and European farmers. People, would you rather have a big speech or a big trade deal? Or a tweet about John Podesta? The various Trumps have already given you two out of three. What are you complaining about?In Poland, people also got quality time with Ad Lib Trump, who popped up at a gathering of Eastern European countries. After complimenting his hosts (\u201cBeautiful nations, by the way\u201d) the president then went on to brag about the American economy (\u201cOur stock market just hit an all-time high \u2026\u201d), and to complain that he isn\u2019t personally making any money off it. (\u201cEveryone else is getting rich. That\u2019s O.K. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d)This is presumably because he has to spend all his time being president. But his business empire is being run by his sons. Did they manage to lose money in this stock market? If so, it\u2019s time to have a very serious talk with Eric.Then Trump bragged in general about the United States. (\u201cWe make the best technology and we make the best, best technology for fighter jets and ships and equipment, military weapons. There\u2019s nobody even close.\u201d) At this point, he had begun to resemble a dinner guest who does nothing but talk about his superior tennis skills, better car and more interesting vacations.Later in the day, Trump took part in a very, very short press conference during which he bragged that Polish-Americans \u201ccame out in droves. They voted in the last election and I was very happy with that result.\u201dBy Trumpian standards, this barely even counted as boasting. However, it\u2019s getting embarrassing when the rest of the world watches him go on like that. Maybe on future foreign trips they could arrange for him to be introduced as \u201cthe president of the United States who won the election and got better ratings than Arnold Schwarzenegger on \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019 \u201d That would at least get it over with at the beginning.So Europe, we sent you an entire fleet of Trumps.

{"Headline": "After Backing Trump, Christians Who Fled Iraq Fall Into His Dragnet", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. \u2014 A few Sundays ago, federal immigration agents walked through the doors of handsome houses here in the Detroit suburbs, brushing past tearful children, stunned wives and statuettes of the Virgin Mary in search of men whose time was up.If the Trump administration prevails, more than 100 of these men may soon be deported, like the tens of thousands of other people rounded up this year as part of a national clampdown on illegal immigration.But the arrests may have stunned this community more than most.They are Christians from Iraq \u2014 a land that they and their families fled decades ago because, they say, to live as a Christian in Iraq is no life at all, and sometimes means death. They settled in Detroit and its suburbs, accumulating into what may now be the largest population of Chaldean Christians in the world. They opened businesses, founded a dozen Chaldean Catholic churches and rose in numbers and wealth.Even so, they, too, are subject to American immigration law \u2014 despite what the Chaldean community took to be an ironclad promise from a president whose election many of them saw as a miracle from God, helped along by their donations, their prayers and blessings from religious leaders.\u201cChristians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter in January, returning to a campaign-trail refrain that had captured Chaldean hearts and ballots across this stretch of Macomb and Oakland Counties. As the Chaldeans like to say, once with pride, now with fury, the area helped tip Michigan to Mr. Trump in November.Soon after the June 11 immigration raids, a local Chaldean noted the disconnect between tweet and deed. \u201cThen why are you deporting them?\u201d he wrote on Twitter, bracketing the question with a snarl of English, Aramaic and Arabic that would be unprintable in any language.\u201cEveryone thought this could not apply to us,\u201d said Nadine Yousif, a lawyer with CODE Legal Aid, a local organization coordinating the community\u2019s response to the raids.The immigration authorities give the same explanation they have given for the arrests of tens of thousands of Latinos and other immigrants without legal status since Mr. Trump took office: These people, too, are what the government refers to as \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201dThough most of them came here legally, as refugees or through relatives who were American citizens, their green cards were revoked after criminal convictions on charges including theft, drug possession, rape and murder.\u201cThe operation in this region was specifically conducted to address the very real public safety threat represented by the criminal aliens arrested,\u201d said Rebecca Adducci, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in Detroit.The men had been allowed to stay, in some cases for decades, because the Iraqi government had refused to issue travel documents for them to return.That changed in March, when Iraq agreed to begin accepting deportees in exchange for being dropped from the list of countries affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, which barred citizens of several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.Mr. Trump \u201cbroke his promise,\u201d said Nahrain Hamama, 54, whose husband has been detained.If the administration reverses course, however, \u201cthen I would consider voting for him again,\u201d she added.Besides the 114 Iraqis arrested around Detroit, immigration agents have also picked up 85 Iraqis in other parts of the country since May, including Shiite Muslims and members of other religious and ethnic groups, such as Kurds and Yazidis.The Iraqis argue that near-certain torture or even death awaits them in Iraq, where the Islamic State has targeted Christians, Shiites and other religious groups. Arabic-language news channels and social media regularly bring word of ancestral villages razed, Christian cemeteries shattered and Chaldean churches shuttered. Though their villages were recently liberated, most Christians have stayed away out of fear, taking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.Chaldeans, who practice Eastern Rite Catholicism, descend from the ancient Assyrians of what is now northern Iraq, where they are increasingly rare. Since 2007, nearly 30,000 Chaldeans have poured into the Detroit area, following waves of Iraqi Christian arrivals that began early in the last century and intensified after Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. The number of Christians in Iraq has tumbled from about 1.4 million in 1987 to an estimated 250,000 last year, leaders of the community in the Detroit area said.Many of the Michigan Chaldeans speak little or no Arabic. Tattoos of the Virgin Mary and crosses stipple their shoulders and wrists.\u201cThe second they step foot out of the airport,\u201d after deportation to Iraq, \u201cthey\u2019re targets,\u201d said Wisam Naoum, a lawyer turned community activist.Chaldeans had written off the Obama administration because of what they saw as its failure to accept more Iraqi Christian refugees. But Mr. Trump\u2019s original travel ban, issued in January, offered an implicit exception for Christians in the Middle East, allowing persecuted religious minorities to enter as refugees even as it barred people from Muslim-majority countries.It took only a day of arrests for Detroit\u2019s Chaldeans to lurch from security to panic.\u201cWe anticipated they\u2019d be picking up the worst of the worst,\u201d said Martin Manna, the president of the Chaldean Community Foundation, a social services organization, where even citizens and green card holders are calling to ask if they should worry. \u201cNot people like Sam Hamama.\u201dUsama Hamama, 54, a partner in a local supermarket who goes by Sam, was getting ready for church with his wife and four children when immigration agents knocked on the door of his spacious home in a quiet West Bloomfield subdivision. He had just enough time to collect his medications and say goodbye before being taken into custody.Mr. Hamama, who arrived in the United States from Baghdad when he was 11, was convicted of a weapons possession charge after he flashed an unloaded gun during a road-rage confrontation with another driver in 1988. He was ordered deported in 1994.His children view him differently. \u201cI would never use the word \u2018felon\u2019 or \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018alien\u2019 for my dad,\u201d said Britanny Hamama, 20, his eldest child.Like many other Chaldeans, his wife was drawn to Mr. Trump by his opposition to abortion, his economic message and his promises of succor for Christians in the Middle East. But she could not bring herself to vote after Mr. Hamama warned her that their family could be snarled in Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.Another detainee, Najah Konja, was checking his emails over a cup of coffee on his back porch, looking out over the pond out back, when the doorbell sounded on June 11.Mr. Konja, who goes by Nick, fled Iraq with his family at age 15, and later served 22 years in federal prison for selling cocaine. His green card was revoked, but since he could not be deported, he was able to stay, rise up the ranks at a chain of tobacco stores called Wild Bill\u2019s, become engaged and buy a house.Unlike some other ex-felons, he said, he had bettered himself and contributed to the local economy. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, but I\u2019m more American than them,\u201d said Mr. Konja, 55, speaking by phone from a jail in Port Huron, Mich.Still, Mr. Konja and his family do not blame Mr. Trump. \u201cA lot of this stuff, it probably doesn\u2019t even get to his desk,\u201d he said.For other families, the separation from fathers and husbands has forced them into a rueful reckoning: The immigration crackdown they had always associated with other people had, somehow, leapt from the southern border to their subdivisions.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a Mexican and a Chaldean?\u201d said Nicole Sabatine, whose husband, Atheer Fawzi Ali, 41, was detained in June. \u201cWhen people, Mexicans, whatever, have kids here, taking their parent away is not the answer.\u201dMr. Ali\u2019s family fled Iraq in the early 1990s after his father, an army officer, defied an order from Saddam Hussein. He lost his green card after breaking into a car as a teenager.That Sunday in June, he had just enough time to say goodbye to his 12-year-old daughter, Natalia, before turning himself in.\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you,\u201d he told her. \u201cEven if I\u2019m in Iraq.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "TPP, the Trade Deal Trump Killed, Is Back in Talks Without U.S.", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week, those countries indicated that they wanted to press ahead with the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a sweeping multinational trade agreement that had originally been sold as a way to tether the United States more closely to East Asia and to create an economic bloc capable of standing against an increasingly muscular China.At a meeting in Hakone, a resort town south of Tokyo, Japan led trade negotiators from the 11 countries \u2014 including Australia, Canada, Malaysia and Vietnam \u2014 in discussions about reviving rules that would improve labor conditions and increase protections for intellectual property in some countries, while opening more markets to free trade in agricultural products and digital services around the region.Japan\u2019s effort to salvage the deal reflects a growing recognition that countries that have previously counted on American leadership will have to forge ahead on their own.Kazuyoshi Umemoto, Japan\u2019s chief negotiator, told reporters that the group of 11 \u201cachieved mutual understanding on a path forward\u201d without the United States.\u201cWe need a new international agreement,\u201d Mr. Umemoto said. \u201cI think we have reached a rough picture of what it will be like.\u201dMomentum for such deals has built in recent weeks, as big American allies have pledged their commitment to globalization.If Japan and the 10 other signatories are to keep the TPP alive, they would need, at the very least, to revise a clause that says the deal will come into effect only when ratified by six countries representing 85 percent of the combined economic value of the 12 original members. Without the United States, that threshold cannot be reached.Japan, which has the largest economy among the remaining trade partners, is pushing to preserve most of the ambitious rules that negotiators originally hammered out, as are Australia and New Zealand.\u201cThe hope, of course, of Japan is to maintain the status quo of the already agreed framework, including the details,\u201d said Tomohiko Taniguchi, a foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.While optimistic that Japan could lead the group toward consensus, Mr. Taniguchi, who referred to the remaining TPP countries as the \u201cOcean\u2019s 11,\u201d acknowledged that the discussions would be challenging.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.\u201cNegotiations, once started, could turn in all sorts of different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gathering of 11, after all, self-centered, even selfish countries. All sorts of negotiations are likely happening.\u201dDeveloping countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam may want to renegotiate some of the tougher requirements that they accepted in exchange for the promise of access to American markets.The agreement, for example, requires developing nations to reform child-labor laws as well as to improve the transparency of state-owned companies, and it permits drug makers in the large economies to extend patent protection on many pharmaceuticals that the smaller countries want to manufacture. Some of the developing countries may protest that such requirements are too onerous without the incentive of being able to export to American consumers.\u201cThe problem is, when you take the United States out, the United States is two-thirds of the TPP,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson, a research fellow at the Perth U.S.-Asia Center at the University of Western Australia. For developing countries being asked to make expensive overhauls, Mr. Wilson said, \u201cWhat is the point of the deal anymore?\u201dJapan\u2019s goal is to preserve as much of the original deal as possible in the hope that the United States will eventually rejoin.\u201cWe should welcome the United States when the United States decides to come back at some time in the future,\u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington.Some observers see those hopes as na\u00efve. \u201cI think it\u2019s simply wishful thinking that the Trump administration will change its mind about the TPP,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors. \u201cSo long as he remains the president, I don\u2019t think he will actually make that turnaround.\u201dOthers suggested that advisers to Mr. Trump might try to change his mind once he sees how difficult it can be to negotiate bilateral trade agreements. But in that case, they say, the 11 remaining countries should not alter the TPP.\u201cIf they try to renegotiate the rules or lower the standards, it will make it harder for the U.S. to rejoin the agreement down the road,\u201d said Bruce H. Andrews, deputy secretary of the Commerce Department in the Obama administration and now a managing director at Rock Creek Global Advisors, a consulting firm.And there is another reason the TPP countries should maintain the tough trade rules, Mr. Andrews said: to push China toward reform.\u201cIf TPP had gone into force, the Chinese, by necessity, would eventually have wanted to be part of it to enjoy its benefits,\u201d Mr. Andrews said. \u201cIn order to get into TPP, China would have had to do some serious economic reform and open their market from their current closed state. If TPP does not go forward as the model, China will likely get better terms from other countries without having to open its market.\u201dIn Japan, Mr. Abe has his own political reasons for wanting to push ahead with the TPP. Mr. Abe expended considerable political capital for the deal, going up against farmers who have traditionally supported his Liberal Democratic Party. The agreement would require Japan\u2019s closed agricultural sector to accept imports of rice, pork and other products.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep that momentum,\u201d said Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research.Japan has indicated that it wants to secure an agreement between the remaining 11 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership by November, when many of them will gather at a summit meeting in Vietnam.Most analysts say any agreement is unlikely to be completed that quickly. Still, said Shumpei Takemori, a professor of economics at Keio University, the reopening of negotiations allows Japan and its allies to \u201cshow the U.S. administration that we have alternatives.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Cross Country starts with the handsome V90, adds rugged body cladding and exterior trim, and lifts the ride height by some 2.5 inches. Think Ranger Rick dressing for success.A standard panoramic glass roof makes it easy to spot Woodsy Owl in the wild. The dark ebony wood in the cabin and the special seat stitching reflect Volvo\u2019s Scandinavian sensibility.Based on the same architecture as the XC90 S.U.V., the 2017 Cross Country has one powertrain, designated T6. Its two-liter four-cylinder engine is turbocharged and supercharged, turning out a healthy 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The gearbox has eight speeds. All-wheel drive is standard. Drive modes noticeably change the vehicle\u2019s dynamics, and the Cross Country\u2019s suspension gets extra range of motion for smoothing out forest service roads.This 4,220-pound machine moves from a standstill to 60 miles an hour in a robust six seconds. For hikers in less of a hurry, the 2018 models will be available with a less expensive T5 engine (basically the T6 without the supercharger).For highway trekking, the quiet, comfortable and composed Cross Country lives up to its name. A wagon typically has a lower center of gravity than an S.U.V., giving the Cross Country confidence in corners even with a suspension properly tuned for comfort.The Cross Country is higher than a standard V90. But it\u2019s more aerodynamic than the XC90 so the wagon\u2019s fuel economy is five miles per gallon better on the highway (the government rates it at 22 miles per gallon in the city, 30 highway).Fully describing the standard safety equipment would exceed this article\u2019s allotted length. It includes automatic emergency braking for cars, bicyclists, pedestrians and large animals. Pilot Assist, also standard, is Volvo\u2019s semiautonomous driving technology, which can handle steering, braking and acceleration, in many cases. After about 10 seconds of hands-free driving, though, it wants your hands back on the steering wheel (which is heated). Pilot Assist works at speeds up to 80 miles an hour but is best at reducing the stress of tedious stop-and-go commuting.Unlike urbanites dressing in expensive technical outdoor clothing, the Cross County is no poser. I\u2019ve confidently driven this Volvo on unimproved access roads at speeds that would scare most passengers (purely for research, mind you). The Cross Country glides over tree roots and dirt heaves on the way to remote trailheads. Hill descent control automatically applies the throttle and braking on extremely steep grades \u2014 drivers only have to steer. Will it challenge a Jeep Wrangler\u2019s abilities? Nope. But few owners will challenge the Cross Country\u2019s capabilities.Modern Volvo interiors have a warm, rich Scandinavian ambience that sets them apart from Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Hefty interior door releases are shaped so fingers slide inside them in a soul-satisfying manner. Poke fun at me now, but you\u2019ll understand when you try them. Volvo seats are often held up as the best in the business and these don\u2019t disappoint. A $4,500 package that was not on my tester adds seemingly infinite adjustments and a massage feature to the front seats.User interfaces are important in modern cars, and the LCD screen Volvo uses is as large and responsive as an iPad. Swipe left and right to get to different pages. Easy? Yes, but the graphics can be small and tough to read or accurately hit on bumpy roads. A few more dedicated hard buttons would be nice. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto help.Back-seat room is generous and the outboard seating positions (with an integrated child booster seat option) are as comfortable as the front seats. Middle passengers must deal with a drive shaft tunnel and a seat back that\u2019s a little lumpy. The package that adds massaging seats upfront includes a climate zone, heated cushions and full sunshade treatment for the rear. Everyone\u2019s happy.Volvo eliminated the rear-facing third row years ago. So if your children like to wave at the cars following behind (my kids called it \u201csweet and sour,\u201d depending on the engagement of the driver), the Mercedes E Class wagon is the way to go.The Volvo\u2019s cargo space has all sorts of elastic bands that keep things from rolling around. Obviously, the space doesn\u2019t have the depth of the XC90 S.U.V.\u2019s space, but it will easily swallow the luggage of five poorly packed people. Drop the split rear seats and two mountain bikes should easily slide in. I advise a tarp to keep things clean \u2014 speaking from experience.Volvo has been turning out attractive designs lately. The svelte V90 may be the best-looking of the bunch. (But hey, the automotive journalist brain sees things that way.) Chances are, station wagons aren\u2019t going to become wildly popular again. But the stylish V90 Cross Country does nearly everything an S.U.V. does, only in a sleeker package.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes of \u2018Trump Bump\u2019 for U.S. Economy Shrink as Growth Forecasts Fade", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe promise of faster economic growth has become a study in the triumph of hope over experience.While the June jobs report, coming on Friday, is expected to show that hiring continued at a healthy pace last month, other recent indicators in areas like consumer spending, construction and auto sales have been decidedly less robust.As a result, Wall Street forecasters have been busy lowering their growth estimates for the second quarter, which ended last Friday, much as they were forced to do over the first three months of the year. Economic expansion for the full year now appears unlikely to be much greater than 2 percent \u2014 about the average for the current recovery, which celebrates its eighth year this month.While hardly terrible, it is not the burst of growth \u2014 a \u201cTrump bump\u201d \u2014 that many expected to result from an upturn in consumer and business sentiment after President Trump\u2019s election.\u201cWe never seem to have the rebound that people anticipate,\u201d said Stephanie Pomboy, an independent economist in New York who has been skeptical about initially rosy forecasts favored by many of her colleagues in recent quarters.The fading expectations for the current quarter are only the latest example of how faster economic growth seems perpetually out of reach.Far from living up to expectations of a lift after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the growth rate in the first quarter turned out to be an anemic 1.4 percent. Some of the weakness stemmed from seasonal factors and calendar quirks that have repeatedly produced soft annual starts during the current recovery.The diminishing expectations are reflected in the dollar\u2019s recent slump. That is not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 a weaker dollar makes exports more competitive in foreign markets. It is, however, a sign of the world\u2019s take on the American economy, as well as an indication of improving prospects abroad, especially in Europe.Experts say that without a meaningful change in government policies \u2014 greater infrastructure investment, an overhaul of the corporate tax code, a new commitment to improve the skills of American workers \u2014 there is no reason to expect the domestic outlook to change.And with deep party divisions in Washington \u2014 and the inability of Republicans so far to capitalize on control of Congress and the White House \u2014 the odds of passing a major infrastructure bill or sweeping tax legislation are growing longer by the day.\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason we will veer from a 2 percent growth rate,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \u201cThe safe bet is to expect more of the same. Unless we do things to boost productivity, this is the economy we are going to see.\u201dGrowth of 2 percent is not horrible, especially given that the recovery is now the third longest on record and that the unemployment rate is at 4.3 percent, the lowest in 16 years.Mr. Anderson said much of the deceleration could be linked to forces beyond the control of politicians and policy makers: an aging population in the United States and a work force that is growing much more slowly than in past decades.\u201cWashington seems tone deaf to this reality,\u201d he said. \u201cEconomists have been talking about these things for years, but getting the political will together to address them has been difficult with the gridlock in Washington.\u201dWith higher borrowing costs practically inevitable in the future, Mr. Anderson said, \u201cthe real tragedy is that the price tag for any future infrastructure spending will be a lot higher.\u201dMs. Pomboy pointed out that changing consumer habits in the wake of the financial crisis and the recession \u2014 notably an increased wariness about spending and taking on debt \u2014 also explain what is looking more and more like a long-term downshift.\u201cThe post-crisis consumer is fundamentally different from the consumer we knew and loved before the crisis,\u201d she said. The household savings rate, which bottomed out at 2.2 percent amid the housing bubble in 2005, now stands at 5.5 percent.In addition to being more cautious about spending in general and about borrowing against their homes in particular, Ms. Pomboy said, consumers are holding back on discretionary purchases because of the rising health insurance premiums and medical costs as well as onerous student debt payments.Another warning sign: After rising steadily from 2011 to 2015, federal tax payments from individuals are down slightly this year compared with the previous 12 months, suggesting that personal income is faltering.\u201cDespite lip service about the \u2018new normal,\u2019 economists continue to forecast growth of 3 to 3.5 percent,\u201d Ms. Pomboy said. \u201cWe\u2019re eight years into the recovery \u2014 that\u2019s not when things accelerate. It\u2019s when they die.\u201dTo be sure, most mainstream economists do not foresee an imminent recession.Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, goes so far as to say, \u201cwe\u2019re chugging along here,\u201d citing healthy income growth and hiring, as well as a strong housing market.Nor is everyone prepared to give up on growth.Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis research firm whose crystal ball is highly regarded among forecasters, began the second quarter by calling for 3.6 percent growth but now estimates the rate will be more like 2.5 percent. But Ben Herzon, a senior economist there, said the rebound is delayed, not dead, especially as businesses restock warehouses and shelves after drawing on inventories in the first half of the year.\u201cGodot has to show up at same point,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe models are showing that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Neomi Rao, the Scholar Who Will Help Lead Trump\u2019s Regulatory Overhaul", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump RulesWASHINGTON \u2014 When George Mason University changed the name of its law school last year to honor Antonin Scalia, the late conservative Supreme Court justice, the tribute rankled many liberal faculty members and students. That the naming was tied to a multimillion-dollar donation from the conservative Charles Koch Foundation only heightened concerns.But quietly, Ms. Rao also worked to win over liberal critics.In a public relations coup, she helped secure an endorsement for the name change from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the Supreme Court\u2019s most liberal justices and a longtime friend of Mr. Scalia. Justice Ginsburg described the school\u2019s renaming as \u201caltogether fitting.\u201dMs. Rao\u2019s ability to work both sides of the ideological divide, emblematic of her career in academia and government, is about to be tested anew. On Monday, the Senate is expected to approve Ms. Rao\u2019s nomination to lead an obscure but powerful White House agency called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \u2014 placing her at the heart of President Trump\u2019s politically contentious agenda to overhaul government rules and regulations.The office, created during the Carter administration, approves government data collections and determines whether agencies have sufficiently addressed problems during rule-making. In the end, the administrator accepts regulations or sends them back to be reworked, a decision that can expedite rules or effectively neutralize them by imposing extensive delays.Ms. Rao, 44, who has served in all three branches of the federal government, brings to the position knowledge of Washington, a lengthy Republican contacts list and scholarly credentials from the ideologically charged field of regulatory study.Regulatory decisions under President Barack Obama, who was among the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history, heightened the interest among conservative academics, who questioned whether agencies had overstepped their constitutional bounds.\u201cI have a lot of concerns about what this administration is going to do in regulatory areas,\u201d said one of them, John Spotila, who led the office during the Clinton administration. But, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t start with the conviction that Neomi is bad, and anybody Trump picks is going to be horrible and we are doomed.\u201dHe added, \u201cMaybe Neomi will surprise us.\u201dA sizable part of Ms. Rao\u2019s new job might involve helping the Trump administration stay within the law as it pursues the changes. \u201cTrump has made some big claims about what he will do, and I think he needs a good lawyer,\u201d said Susan Dudley, who headed the regulatory office under President George W. Bush and now directs the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center.Some progressive advocates are skeptical Ms. Rao will intervene to curb deregulation.\u201cI don\u2019t think her background should lead anybody to expect her to stand up to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon and the \u2018deconstruction of the administrative state,\u2019\u201d said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate with the liberal-leaning organization Public Citizen. \u201cHer background makes me think she\u2019s going to fast-track all of that.\u201dThe White House and Ms. Rao declined to comment for this article, as her nomination was still pending.Neomi Rao\u2019s rise to the most influential regulatory post in the Trump administration followed a path that took her to the Supreme Court, Capitol Hill and the White House.In addition to clerking for Justice Thomas, she was counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee under Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and associate counsel and special assistant to President George W. Bush during his second term.Ms. Rao\u2019s year with the Supreme Court gave her proximity to some of the leading conservative legal minds, including Justice Scalia, who took her and other clerks to A. V. Ristorante Italiano in Washington, where she found common ground with him on legal interpretation \u2014 and also on anchovies as a pizza topping.She has also taught courses on constitutional law, as well as legislation and statutory interpretation, while recently pairing with Justice Thomas to teach a class that was listed in the school\u2019s course schedule as History and Foundation of the Administrative State.At the law school, Ms. Rao has a reputation for her earnestness, said David Rehr, senior associate dean. Her approach was not typical to Washington, where there is \u201ca lot of ideological fencing going on,\u201d Mr. Rehr said. \u201cWith Neomi, it\u2019s a real, \u2018Let\u2019s hear each other out and figure out where we can work together.\u2019 And it\u2019s authentic.\u201d\u201cIn our constitutional democracy,\u201d she said, \u201cthe rule of law should prevail over the rule of what the judge thinks is best.\u201dIn recent years, Ms. Rao\u2019s leadership of the Center for the Study of the Administrative State gave her a particularly strong voice in the growing conservative movement looking to curb the regulatory powers of federal agencies.The center opened in 2015 as pockets of George Mason\u2019s campus were becoming increasingly conservative, in large part because of donations from Charles G. Koch, the billionaire businessman who contributes to many Republican causes, and his influence as a board member on various programs at the university.Foundations affiliated with Mr. Koch have donated at least $50 million to George Mason, a public university, over the past decade, helping to fund his favored projects and underwrite scholarships at a time when the university\u2019s growth has outpaced state funding increases.Ms. Rao\u2019s center benefited from those contributions.Mr. Rehr said that Ms. Rao\u2019s center was \u201cgoing to happen anyway\u201d as there was already considerable intellectual interest in the administrative state and the regulatory process. But the donation \u201cmade it easier.\u201d\u201cIt accelerated the viability and visibility of the center,\u201d Mr. Rehr said, adding that Mr. Koch has not exerted any influence over the center.Ms. Rao\u2019s center, one of a number of such programs at universities, has tapped into a heightened interest in the administrative state. Conservatives say the concern goes well beyond the regulatory offensive of the Obama administration, and follows a series of opinions from conservative members of the Supreme Court, as well as other significant writings \u2014 like Philip Hamburger\u2019s book, \u201cIs Administrative Law Unlawful?\u201d \u2014 that raise questions about whether too much power has been given over to federal agencies.Liberal scholars have actively engaged in the debate, too, arguing that federal agencies need the authority to regulate and enforce rules that protect against health and environmental hazards that the bottom-line interests of businesses and industries often minimize or ignore.At the center of the debate is a legal principle known as Chevron deference, named for the legal case in a 1984 Supreme Court decision that held that federal judges should defer to the expertise of federal agencies. The newest member of the Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, expressed opposition to that doctrine during his confirmation process.\u201cIt is the most interesting time in administrative law in a generation,\u201d said Adam White, a fellow at the conservative-leaning Hoover Institution, who has worked closely with Ms. Rao and will succeed her as director at the George Mason center. He described the center\u2019s work as an \u201ceffort to consider how we regulate the regulators.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that means shutting down the government,\u201d he said. \u201cAdministrative agencies are inventing new rules every day for businesses or people. We just want to impose some rules and order on them.\u201dLisa Heinzerling, who served at the Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration and spoke on a panel at Ms. Rao\u2019s center this year, said that the center and others like it \u201ccan sound like an echo chamber\u201d in a conservative campaign against government oversight.\u201cThere is a palpable hostility to regulation,\u201d said Ms. Heinzerling, now a law professor at Georgetown.The first substantive question Ms. Rao faced during a Senate confirmation hearing last month struck at a hot topic on Capitol Hill: How did she view an order by Mr. Trump to eliminate two regulations for every new one, and how should it be carried out?As she answered, Ms. Rao measured her words, calling the policy \u201can important step\u201d in broadly reducing regulatory burden. \u201cIt can work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way I think it will work in practice is that agencies will identify regulations to eliminate. And those regulations might be ineffective ones or excessively burdensome. And those regulations will have to meet a cost-benefit analysis for deregulation before they\u2019re going to impose any new regulatory burdens.\u201dAs her testimony continued, she went so far as to give Democrats a nod that her cost-benefit analysis would go beyond simply calculating financial costs to industry \u2014 agreeing that non-monetary benefits, to health and the environment, for example, \u201ccan play a role.\u201dOne fact working in Ms. Rao\u2019s favor, as she begins her new job, is that there is consensus among politicians and voters of all political stripes that Washington should do a better job streamlining regulations.But the divide is deeply partisan once the discussion moves to how much regulation is necessary to keep things orderly, safe and fair \u2014 and what is deemed a reasonable cost to make that happen. In simple terms, conservatives say the price of red tape has grown too steep, citing a study suggesting that rules cost the economy more than $2 trillion. Liberals say the figures ignore benefits to society.\u201cMost people do not appreciate the benefits of regulation,\u201d said Sally Katzen, a former administrator of the regulatory office under Mr. Clinton and professor at New York University School of Law. \u201cWhen asked, they may say they want to get rid of regulations. But which regulations? The stoplight at the intersection? Airbags? Safety barriers at subway stations?\u201dThe regulatory office, commonly known in Washington as OIRA, was created in 1980 as a check on the rules set by regulatory agencies and as a safeguard against ill-conceived regulation. It has usually been staffed with administrators from various corners of academia and the law.During Mr. Obama\u2019s time in office, some liberals became so infuriated at the slow pace at which regulations moved through the office that they urged abolishing it, calling it the place where \u201cregulations go to die.\u201dAn administrator under President Ronald Reagan, Christopher DeMuth, said special care was needed in weighing regulations, given that there are often \u201cfew facts\u201d that decisively predict outcomes. \u201cThere are huge uncertainties about what we are doing,\u201d said Mr. DeMuth, now a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank.\u201cYou think you know what good policy is, but you have to be careful how you do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be there ripping out the wiring willy-nilly, or you won\u2019t succeed. You lose the public.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Try to Find Economic Message After Railing Against Trump", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERRYVILLE, Va. \u2014 For more than a year, Democrats have raged against now-President Trump, projecting their opposition as the party\u2019s central message. In so doing, they have maintained their minority status in Congress, sustained the most stunning loss in modern presidential history and left voters with little sense of what they represent.On Monday, Democratic leaders gathered 70 miles from Washington \u2014 in a town of some 4,000, in a district represented by a Republican, in a county carried easily by Mr. Trump \u2014 to try something else.\u201cToo many Americans don\u2019t know what we stand for,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told a sweat-soaked crowd of about 100 at a park here off Main Street. \u201cNot after today.\u201dLabeled collectively as \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d the policies combine left-leaning doctrine old and new \u2014 a $15-an-hour minimum wage, a crusade against monopolies, and efforts to lower prescription drug costs \u2014 elevating issues that Democrats expect to animate next year\u2019s midterm elections and supplying an answer to critics who accuse them of offering nothing but obstruction. Not coincidentally, Democrats latched onto two policies that Mr. Trump campaigned on but has done little to combat as president \u2014 the power of big-business monopolies and surging drug prices.And so, one after another, the Democrats stepped into this small-town painting: the Senate firebrand from Massachusetts, two Brooklynites, the House leader from San Francisco, in her dark sunglasses, assembling in front of a swing set and a row of minivans and telling the people why they should listen this time.\u201cWe\u2019re here today because the economy is broken,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the event\u2019s most celebrated draw, revving up as residents snapped to attention for cellphone photographs. \u201cAmericans know that this economy is rigged.\u201dFor all the fanfare on Monday, Democrats acknowledged that the message might serve more as a flexible skeleton for their 2018 campaigns than a precise ideological or political road map. The \u201cBetter Deal\u201d concept appeared designed to satisfy as many factions of the party as possible \u2014 populist liberals, suburban moderates, social justice activists \u2014 while attaching the Democratic Party in formal fashion to a few broad economic themes.But the themes did aim at issues familiar to struggling Americans. Soaring drug prices are cutting into middle-class wallets, and the consolidation of industries, from airlines to cable companies to banks, are raising prices, reducing competition and holding down wages. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has not been raised since 2009.\u201cThe question is: Does it appear to people to be simply a poll-driven document offered by a bunch of Washington politicians, or is there a persistent, disciplined attempt to follow through on these issues?\u201d said Mr. Axelrod, noting that Hillary Clinton\u2019s myriad economic policy prescriptions failed to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s battering-ram nationalist message. \u201cAnd do the candidates of the party, running throughout the country, embrace them?\u201dMore optimistic Democrats said they hoped it would allow the party to sidle past some of the messy internal conflicts of the last eight months.Mr. Trump\u2019s election touched off bitter arguments among Democrats over just how politically combative the party should be, and how much it should seek to compete with Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-edged version of economic populism.Mr. Schumer suggested, in fact, that Mr. Trump\u2019s success had demonstrated the potency of this kind of economic strategy.\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on a populist platform, talking to working people. That\u2019s why he won,\u201d the senator said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to often outsource policy making to hard-line conservatives had created a vacuum on economic issues. \u201cWe Democrats are going to fill that vacuum. Democrats will show the country we are the party on the side of working people.\u201dThe effort comes as the party confronts a mood of mounting urgency around its messaging, particularly on economic matters. For all of the Clinton campaign\u2019s white papers and round-table discussions last year \u2014 proposals, in many cases, that were equivalent to what Democrats embraced on Monday \u2014 the candidate\u2019s closing argument registered often as anti-Trump above all else.The problem has persisted. Lacking a pointed national sales pitch in the first half of this year, Democratic candidates were shut out in a series of special congressional elections in conservative-leaning districts \u2014 in Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Kansas \u2014 with each defeat fueling new recriminations and deepening existing disagreements about the party\u2019s future.Several Democrats were heartened that Monday\u2019s display seemed at least to reflect a consensus that the party needed to be more attentive to voters\u2019 close-to-home concerns, without lurching too precipitously toward the left or the center.The event was ostensibly hosted by Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist, business-friendly Democrat who reached the governor\u2019s mansion in 2002 in part by finding unlikely success with the kinds of rural voters who have since gravitated toward Mr. Trump.\u201cIn that way, it\u2019s an important step,\u201d said former Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a moderate Democrat and former chairman of the National Governors Association. \u201cI think this really appeals to everybody, from Mark Warner to Elizabeth Warren.\u201dAs with most any political messaging rollout, there were halting moments: ham-fisted baseball banter, time-filling riffs about the weather and \u2014 to the delight of Republicans in Washington \u2014 a slogan that echoed both a tagline from Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s \u201cA Better Way\u201d agenda and the Papa John\u2019s pizza creed, \u201cBetter Ingredients, Better Pizza.\u201dOn Monday, a small group of protesters, who refused to say if they belonged to an organization, held aloft pizza boxes with the face of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. \u201cStill Pelosi,\u201d the boxes read.Yet if Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer were plainly a long way from her home cities on Monday, Democrats were careful to line up other party ambassadors with more down-home appeal.Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, whose district is largely rural, cheered an attendee for wearing a hat for a seed company. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, my kind of peeps,\u201d she said.Others leaned into their urban ZIP codes.\u201cI\u2019m from a small town up north,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York. \u201cBrooklyn.\u201dAnd Mr. Schumer became perhaps the first elected official in Virginia political history to begin an attempt at anecdotal folksiness with, \u201cLast month, I went to a Yankees game.\u201d He spoke of encountering two Trump voters there who worried about the president\u2019s approach so far.Such pangs rang familiar to some attendees on Monday.Maria Esparolini, 61, said she had supported Mr. Trump last year after twice voting for Mr. Obama. While she believes Mr. Trump has successfully frightened some of America\u2019s enemies abroad into submission, she appeared unsettled by his tenure.\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me that,\u201d Ms. Esparolini said with a laugh, when asked to appraise the Trump presidency.She added, \u201cI\u2019m personally tired of all the twitters and the twotters.\u201dKate Petranech, 72, overheard.\u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cyou speak for all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Power Authority Effectively Files for Bankruptcy", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rico\u2019s troubled power company defaulted on a deal to restructure roughly $9 billion in bond debt and sought court protection from its creditors, the government said on Sunday.Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, which announced the move, said it did not expect any disruption of service to Prepa\u2019s residential or commercial customers on the island.Bondholders had hoped that Prepa\u2019s debt could be reduced consensually, as planned. Some questioned the legality of moving into federal court to redo the deal.Bill Fallon, the chief executive of National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, a bond insurer, called the move \u201cimproper\u201d and warned that it \u201cwould leave Prepa years away from attracting the private investment necessary to modernize.\u201dElectrical power has long been a drag on the island\u2019s economy. Prepa\u2019s antiquated generating plants burn imported oil to produce electricity. Efforts to modernize the plants and shift to clean and renewable fuels have been delayed repeatedly. Customers pay rates that follow oil prices up and down, and while the rates are relatively low at the moment, they are vulnerable to rising again.In addition, there are longstanding accusations that Prepa\u2019s fuel-purchasing office for many years bought dirty oil sludge as fuel, charged consumers the much higher price of cleaner distillates, and then created a slush fund with the difference. The Puerto Rican senate held a series of hearings on Prepa\u2019s fuel-purchasing irregularities, and has referred its findings to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Prepa got into severe financial trouble before the rest of the Puerto Rican government, when it was unable to pay for fuel in 2014. Its creditors extended fuel-purchasing credit that year, and subsequently negotiated a deal to restructure about $5.7 billion of Prepa\u2019s $9 billion in total debt.The deal was held up as a model at the time, because it was achieved without the sort of leverage that can be exerted in bankruptcy. In addition to taking a 15 percent loss, the bondholders had agreed that Prepa could put a portion of the savings toward its long-promised modernization and conversion to cleaner sources of power.But the agreement also called for Prepa to continue paying down its remaining debt by adding an unpopular increase in power customers\u2019 monthly bills. It also required the restructured debt to be secured to an investment-grade rating, an insurmountable challenge with the island\u2019s central government itself effectively bankrupt, and its economy in a painful decline.Last week, the federal oversight board that is guiding Puerto Rico\u2019s finances voted to authorize Prepa to seek debt relief under Title III of Promesa, which is similar to Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy. Natalie Jaresko, the board\u2019s executive director, said then that talks could continue, and the utility\u2019s bondholders said they still hoped to pursue the consensual deal. They also offered to cover a $170 million interest payment that Prepa was required to make to bondholders on Saturday.But Prepa declined that offer, defaulting on the payment and paving the way for the move on Sunday for court protection.Advertisement"}

In reality, it is a Goldilocks-like search by Republicans for a bill that can get the bare minimum number of votes needed for the party to claim victory.Up next, and hoping that the third time is a charm, Republicans are expected to offer a bill that they are calling \u201cskinny repeal.\u201d It would increase the number of uninsured people up to 15 million. If that legislation passes, the House could be asked to accept it, or it could be sent to a conference committee where Republican lawmakers from both chambers can try to hash out a compromise.It is hard to analyze the skinny repeal proposal, because Republicans have provided few details about it. Presumably, it would still provide government subsidies to lower-income families, as the A.C.A. does. But many middle-class families who do not get coverage through employers would be left bearing the full cost of their now much more expensive policies.Republicans say they need to pass something to live up to the promises of repealing the A.C.A. that they have been making for the last seven years. But senators who vote for skinny repeal would be breaking a far more substantive pledge they made to voters \u2014 that they would work to lower health care costs.Advertisement"}

We have tried turning on the screws, joint military exercises, sanctions and relying on China, and this finely tuned strategy has failed.Talking to Kim Jong-un\u2019s government is, and has long been, the only reasonable solution. Otherwise, the options are narrow: continuation of an outdated policy or war.ROBERT CAMBRIA, NEW YORKThe writer is former coordinator of the Committee for a New Korea Policy.To the Editor:This editorial rightly points out that relying on China and sanctions have not worked with regard to North Korea. But diplomatic measures simply will not work.To the Editor:To date, no expert in geostrategic policy has devised a surefire way to thwart North Korea from single-mindedly developing its nuclear program, all the way to an intercontinental capability. The same putative \u201csolutions\u201d get recycled: negotiations, economic sanctions, rhetorical bluster, pressure by China and Russia, United Nations intervention. Alas, none of these or other measures have checked the regime; denuclearization likely won\u2019t happen.Perhaps returning to a former realpolitik is called for: a variant of the Cold War\u2019s mutual assured destruction. That worked for about half a century to sober the Soviet Union, deterring capricious leaders. It\u2019s the same risk that keeps other nations of the nuclear-armed club from dueling with one another. A similarly unambiguous existential risk \u2014 in the presence of overwhelming asymmetry between the United States and North Korean nuclear arsenals, and despite an unpredictable regime \u2014 may give North Korea equal pause.KEITH TIDMAN, BETHESDA, MD.To the Editor:The solution to North Korea lies in forcing China to choose between it and the worldwide economy. Short of starting a war, the United States does not have sufficient leverage to force North Korea to dispense with nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles. However, regardless of its leadership\u2019s claim, China does have that ability.An American president could defang North Korea simply by persuading our allies not only to embargo North Korea, but also to stop trading with any nation that continues that trade. Unfortunately, by tearing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership and putting NATO\u2019s future at risk, President Trump has already forfeited the leadership position and the political capital that an American president would need to accomplish this.Advertisement"}

Spurred by the actions of Patagonia, a company with a history of vocally tying its morals to its bottom line, they are publicly putting their positions where their polypropylene pants are.\u201cWe realized somebody had to start making their voice heard,\u201d said Greg Thomsen, managing director of Adidas Outdoor USA. \u201cIn my 40 years in the industry I have never seen the industry galvanized in such a way before.\u201d\u201cIt was like a fuse to a Molotov cocktail,\u201d said Christian Beckwith, the founder of Shift, an annual outdoor conference in Jackson, Wyo., which will focus on the case for advocacy during its next incarnation in November.The review is being framed as a federal vs. state issue. \u201cThe land was federal land before the monument designation and if the boundaries of the monument are modified, the land would still be public land, managed by the agency that previously managed it,\u201d Heather Swift, press secretary for the Department of the Interior, wrote in an email. Nonetheless, lifting the monument status would open the land up to other possible uses. To Patagonia and similar businesses, this poses an existential threat to the thing they hold most \u201csacred,\u201d in the words of its chief executive, Rose Marcario, with the potential for the land to be leased or sold for mineral and fracking exploitation.After the order was issued, \u201cI called Jerry and Arne,\u201d said Ms. Marcario, referring to Jerry Stritzke and Arne Arens, the chief executives of REI and North Face, respectively, \u201cto say we were in an unprecedented situation.\u201dSince then, Mr. Arens said, \u201cwe are in touch on a weekly basis.\u201dThe fleece crowd, like most retailers, has shied away from overtly taking sides \u2014 land, like fashion, being seen as a bipartisan issue.\u201cPolitics has traditionally been the third rail,\u201d said Dan Nordstrom, the chief executive of Outdoor Research, a member of the department store family and a former chief executive of Nordstrom.com. \u201cMy grandfather and father always said, \u2018We don\u2019t take political positions because we have to appeal to consumers on both sides of the aisle.\u2019\u201dThat followed Patagonia\u2019s announcement that it would drop out of the Outdoor Retailer trade show unless Utah\u2019s leadership changed its position on Bears Ears. (The company will not be at the march on Thursday.) For its part, the show decided that as the contract for the twice-yearly event, which is worth $40 million to $50 million to the local economy annually, came up for renewal, Salt Lake City, after 20 years, would not be allowed to bid. Next January, the trade show will move to Denver and Patagonia will be back. Depending on whom you talk to, Thursday\u2019s march is meant in part as an expression of thanks to Salt Lake City for being host to the community for so long, or as a protest against the governor and his supporters.Indeed, Mr. Thomsen of Adidas said of the march: \u201cIt\u2019s being billed as a celebration, but from my personal point of view, it\u2019s a statement. Hopefully politicians will realize the outdoor industry also votes with its pocketbook.\u201d (According to the Outdoor Industry Association, the industry is worth $887 billion in consumer spending a year, employs 7.6 million people and generates $124.5 billion in federal, state and local taxes.)Most organizations involved are still careful to couch their actions in the language of inclusiveness and positivity; it\u2019s about \u201cvalues,\u201d not \u201ctaking sides;\u201d about \u201cpolicy,\u201d not \u201cpolitics;\u201d \u201cpro-public lands,\u201d not \u201canti-Trump.\u201d But as with the Woman\u2019s March, which was pro-women\u2019s rights but broadly construed as a statement against the incoming president and his priorities, it\u2019s hard to deny that, to the watching world, there are politics involved.Especially because Patagonia has gone so far as to join nonprofits it worked with over the years in a lawsuit that has been prepared in the event that protections for monuments like Bears Ears are rescinded.Among the defendants? President Trump.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been directly involved in a legal action before,\u201d Ms. Marcario said.It may not come to that. Mr. Stritzke said he was optimistic because Secretary Zinke had referred to Theodore Roosevelt, the conservationist president who signed the Antiquities Act into law, several times during the May group meeting in Washington (though Mr. Thomsen, who was at the meeting, said he felt the secretary\u2019s mind was already made up). Ms. Swift pointed out that Mr. Zinke had spoken to numerous stakeholders and \u201cthe one thing that everyone agrees with the secretary on is that public access and outdoor recreation is a top priority.\u201d\u201cI know there may be some people who won\u2019t want to buy our products because of this, but it is a risk we are willing to take,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cWe are woke, we are fighting and we are going to keep doing it.\u201dAs Mr. Beckwith of Shift said: \u201cWe\u2019re all activists now.

An administrative court in Paris ruled that the Irish unit was not taxable in France.Google has faced a series of legal challenges across Europe, with many of them focused on the company\u2019s tax and competitive practices.Google employs 700 people in France through its subsidiary there, but the company used a division based in Ireland to sell French customers digital services like its well-known advertising platform AdWords, according to court filings. The case hinged on whether Google owed various taxes in France, even though it sold services from Ireland.French tax authorities argued that Google\u2019s French employees were instrumental in selling the ad space, even if the contracts were made with the Irish subsidiary.In its rulings on Wednesday, the court agreed with Google. It found that the Irish unit did not have a \u201cstable\u201d presence in France, meaning that the French tax authorities could not collect corporate income and withholding taxes from it.

{"Headline": "The Cost of a Hot Economy in California: A Severe Housing Crisis", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Los Angeles, booming with construction and signs of prosperity, some people have given up on finding a place and have moved into vans with makeshift kitchens, hidden away in quiet neighborhoods. In Silicon Valley \u2014 an international symbol of wealth and technology \u2014 lines of parked recreational vehicles are a daily testimony to the challenges of finding an affordable place to call home.Heather Lile, a nurse who makes $180,000 a year, commutes two hours from her home in Manteca to the San Francisco hospital where she works, 80 miles away. \u201cI make really good money and it\u2019s frustrating to me that I can\u2019t afford to live close to my job,\u201d said Ms. Lile.Now here in Sacramento, lawmakers are considering extraordinary legislation to, in effect, crack down on communities that have, in their view, systematically delayed or derailed housing construction proposals, often at the behest of local neighborhood groups.The bill was passed by the Senate last month and is now part of a broad package of housing proposals under negotiation that Gov. Jerry Brown and Democratic legislative leaders announced Monday was likely to be voted on in some form later this summer.\u201cThe explosive costs of housing have spread like wildfire around the state,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a Democratic senator from San Francisco who sponsored the bill. \u201cThis is no longer a coastal, elite housing problem. This is a problem in big swaths of the state. It is damaging the economy. It is damaging the environment, as people get pushed into longer commutes.\u201dFor California, this crisis is a price of this state\u2019s economic boom. Tax revenue is up and unemployment is down. But the churning economy has run up against 30 years of resistance to the kind of development experts say is urgently needed. California has always been a desirable place to live and over the decades has gone through periodic spasms of high housing costs, but officials say the combination of a booming economy and the lack of construction of homes and apartments have combined to make this the worst housing crisis here in memory.Housing prices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego have jumped as much as 75 percent over the past five years.This is not the first time this state has sought to prod recalcitrant local governments to build housing. Mr. Brown tried to push through a measure to force communities to build more affordable housing around a year ago. That effort, like most in recent years, faltered in the face of opposition from local officials, homeowners and environmentalists, who often see these kinds of measures as enriching developers while threatening the character of some of the most visually striking parts of this state, along the coast and in the mountains.\u201cIt\u2019s giving developers a great gift and not giving residents and voters a chance to cast their opinions about what happens in their own neighborhood,\u201d Helene Schneider, the mayor of Santa Barbara, said of Mr. Wiener\u2019s new bill.But the worsening housing crisis here has created a political environment where prospects for a state housing intervention appear more likely than ever.\u201cThere is a consensus that there is a crisis and we have to address it,\u201d said David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat who leads the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee. Mr. Wiener compared the political atmosphere now to how Californians embraced mandatory water-rationing in response to the five-year drought here.\u201cWe\u2019re at a breaking point in California,\u201d Mr. Wiener said. \u201cThe drought created opportunities to push forward water policy that would have been impossible before. Given the breadth and depth of the housing crisis in many parts of California, it creates opportunities in the Legislature that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201dThe debate is forcing California to consider the forces that have long shaped this state. Many people were drawn here by its natural beauty and the prospect of low-density, open-sky living. They have done what they could to protect that life. That has now run up against a growing generational tide of anger and resentment, from younger people struggling to find an affordable place to live as well as from younger elected officials, such as Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles, who argue that communities have been failing in what they argue is a shared obligation.For the past several decades, California has had a process that sets a number of housing units, including low-income units, that each city should build over the next several years based on projected growth. Mr. Wiener\u2019s bill targets cities that have lagged on building by allowing developers who propose projects in those places to bypass the various local design and environmental reviews that slow down construction because they can be appealed and litigated for years.The bill applies only to projects that are already within a city\u2019s plans: If the project were higher or denser than current zoning laws allow, it would still have to go through the City Council. But by taking much of the review power away from local governments, the bill aims to ramp up housing production by making it harder to kill, delay or shrink projects in places that have built the fewest.It is hard to say exactly which projects might benefit if the various bills were passed, since it\u2019s impossible to know which projects local governments might reject in the future. But there are various examples where it might have pushed a development along.\u201cCalifornia is a beautiful place with great weather and a terrific economy,\u201d said Issi Romem, the chief economist with BuildZoom, a San Francisco company that helps homeowners find contractors. \u201cTo accommodate all those people you need to build a lot, and the state\u2019s big metro areas haven\u2019t since the early \u201970s. To catch up, cities would need to build housing in a way that they haven\u2019t in two generations.\u201dCoastal cities \u2014 which tend to have the worst housing problems \u2014 have the most scarce land. Still, economists say, the high cost of all housing is first and foremost the result of a failure to build. The state has added about 311,000 housing units over the past decade, far short of what economists say is needed.\u201cCities have proven time and time again that they will not follow their own zoning rules,\u201d said Brian Hanlon, policy director of the San Francisco Yimby Party, a housing advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the state to strengthen their own laws so that advocates can hold cities accountable.\u201dStill, few elected officials are eager to risk community anger by forcing through construction that would, say, put a 10-story apartment building at the edge of a neighborhood of single-family homes. That has turned California into a state of isolated and arguably self-interested islands.The situation has been aggravated by places such as Brisbane, just south of San Francisco, which has encouraged extensive office development while failing to build housing.\u201cWe have cities around California that are happy to welcome thousands of workers in gleaming new tech and innovation campuses, and are turning a blind eye to their housing need,\u201d said Mr. Chiu.In the Bay Area, the explosive growth of the tech industry has led to escalating rents, opening a tough debate over gentrification and brutal commutes for workers. \u201cCities that deny housing are contributing to skyrocketing rents, unfair evictions and homelessness,\u201d said Lori Droste, a member of the Berkeley City Council.The measure has raised considerable opposition as well, including from lawmakers who argued that letting state take power away from local governments strips communities of the ability to control the fundamental character of their own neighborhoods.\u201cPeople here feel like this is a special place, like people in any town or city do,\u201d said Chris Coursey, the mayor of Santa Rosa. \u201cAnd they want decisions about the future of the community to be made by people in the community who they can actually talk to about this.\u201dRichard Bloom, a Democratic state assemblyman and a former mayor of Santa Monica, said even communities like his were no longer reflexively trying to derail housing projects.\u201cMore and more people are becoming well aware that we have a housing affordability crisis on our hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is just reaching critical mass with the Legislature and the public.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Decline of the Dollar Means", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe value of the dollar has fallen steadily since the beginning of 2017, erasing a sharp rise immediately after President Trump\u2019s election.To take one example, the number of euros that can be obtained for one dollar has declined to the lowest level in more than a year. The dollar has also declined against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi.Is that bad? It sounds bad.The exchange rate is a price \u2014 the price of money. When the price of milk goes down, that is good for families and bad for dairy farmers. When gas prices fall, commuters are happy and Exxon Mobil is sad. When the dollar drops, there are also winners and losers.The winners are American companies that sell goods and services to foreigners \u2014 manufacturers like Caterpillar; tourist attractions like Disney World; technology companies like Facebook \u2014 because those customers can exchange their currencies for more dollars.The losers are American consumers who now must pay more dollars to obtain foreign goods and services.Of course, many Americans are in both categories. They may benefit at work and suffer at the supermarket.Why is the dollar losing value?The dollar strengthened after the presidential election because investors expected Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans to increase domestic growth by fulfilling campaign promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations, among other measures. The reversal of those gains reflects diminished confidence that Mr. Trump will be able to deliver.So we\u2019re back where we started?The climb started in 2011 as the American economy began to recover more quickly than the economies of the rest of the developed world. Domestic growth was sluggish by historical standards, but things were worse everywhere else. The United States was \u201cthe cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry basket,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis investment firm.There was also a rush into dollar-denominated assets. At the beginning of 2011, Mr. Paulsen noted recently, the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was a little lower than the available return on a portfolio of debt issued by other major nations, including Britain, Germany and Japan. By 2016, the Treasury rate was as much as five times as high as the global portfolio.The rest of the world now appears to be doing a little better. The International Monetary Fund said in June that it was cutting its forecast for the growth of the United States economy, but stronger growth elsewhere would offset the impact on the world economy.Should the United States push down the dollar?Mr. Trump has said that he would like the dollar to decline in value.Some economists think he is right.The value of the dollar, relative to other currencies, is supposed to reflect the strength of the American economy, relative to other countries. But exchange rates can be distorted by investors, which in turn can distort patterns of economic growth. And there is some evidence the price of the dollar remains above its actual value, which tends to encourage imports and discourage exports.Could the United States push down the dollar?Exchange rates are determined by open trading on financial markets. Some governments actively participate in those markets to influence the value of their currencies. The United States in recent decades has mostly stayed on the sidelines.Recent administrations have focused instead on pressing other nations to stay out of the market. The Bush and Obama administrations, for example, made progress in persuading China to allow the value of the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar.The Trump administration has not articulated a consistent policy on these issues.How is the value of the dollar measured?The dollar can be exchanged for a wide range of currencies. At last count, the United Nations recognized about 180. The Federal Reserve calculates an average of exchange rates by weighting rates based on the volume of trade with the United States, so the price of dollars in Japanese yen is more important than in Icelandic kronur.Advertisement"}

Salt Lake City played host to the last Games in the country, the Winter Olympics in 2002.The I.O.C. is expected to formally announce the hosts for the Games at a meeting in Lima, Peru, on Sept. 13.From the start, Los Angeles had made it clear that while it preferred to have the Olympics in 2024, it would be willing to accommodate the 2028 Games.Under the agreement, the I.O.C. said it would give at least $1.8 billion to the Los Angeles organizing committee and would make advance payments of $180 million to compensate the local committee for the extra four years it must work and $160 million for youth sports programs, a payout that typically comes after the Games.Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., had previously balked at such a perk, saying the Games themselves were a gift, but apparently came around to it.As part of the deal, the I.O.C. also agreed to forfeit its usual 20 percent share of any potential surplus revenue from the event to the local organizing committee, according to the bid\u2019s spokesman, Jeff Millman.The Los Angeles City Council and the United States Olympic Committee will consider the agreement in August and, if it is approved, send it on to the I.O.C. for its vote in September.The agreement is not without risks for Los Angeles.The cost and logistical estimates that Los Angeles prepared in making its bid for the Games \u2014 and selling the idea to local officials and voters \u2014 were based on the event taking place in seven years. As officials here began contemplating the probability that Los Angeles would get the Games in 2028, they expressed concern about the entailing uncertainties; costs are likely to be higher than they would be in 2024.Los Angeles\u2019s plan depended on its sprawling system of stadiums and arenas \u2014 some left over from the 1984 Olympics, others belonging to major sports teams and university campuses \u2014 that in theory would keep construction costs low. The estimated cost is $5.3 billion, though city officials expected the funding to come from private sources and ticket sales.There has been minimal opposition in Los Angeles to the Olympics coming \u2014 at least as compared with other cities \u2014 reflecting, in part, the successful experience in 1984. Yet there was some opposition from a late-emerging group called NOlympics LA. The group denounced the decision.\u201cThis is a complete miscarriage of anything remotely resembling democracy,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe insist that the local media acknowledge the lack of transparency and accountability there is in this last-minute, hastily thrown together \u2018plan.\u2019 The council, mayor, bid committee, Donald Trump and I.O.C. are all colluding to thrust an unvetted plan onto the second-largest city in America.\u201dGetting the Games will be a triumph for Paris, which failed in bids for the 1992, 2008 and 2012 Olympics. This time, it presented a streamlined bid and emphasized staging events at postcard venues, such as open-water swimming in the Seine and beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\u201cParis and Los Angeles are two amazing global cities that are united in their support of the Olympic cause and we stand together now to help the Games thrive in 2024 and 2028,\u201d Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris said in a statement.The dual award to Paris and Los Angeles is seen as a chance to stabilize an Olympic movement besieged by staggering costs and declining interest in hosting by cities in democratic nations. Aside from Boston, the cities of Rome, Budapest and Hamburg, Germany, withdrew their candidacies for the 2024 Games. By naming two host cities at once, the I.O.C. will not have to worry about cities losing bids for the Summer Olympics and declining to bid again.In getting the 2024 Olympics, Paris can celebrate the centennial anniversary of the last time it hosted the Summer Games. By bestowing the Games, the I.O.C. can also pat itself on the back for helping Paris recover from recent terrorist attacks.Paris, like Los Angeles, carries some risk in its bid.An athletes\u2019 village must still be built, at an estimated cost of $2 billion. If there are severe cost overruns in Paris, they could further discourage other cities from bidding on Games.On the other hand, Los Angeles had sold itself as better prepared than competitors. Instead of building an athletes\u2019 village, it plans to use existing dorm rooms at U.C.L.A. And, at this point, no permanent arenas need to be built.The 2028 Games in Los Angeles will inspire a generation of American athletes and bring an infusion of cash to the United States Olympic Committee, and they could motivate more American companies to become global corporate sponsors for the Olympics in the wake of McDonald\u2019s withdrawal, said Rick Burton, a professor of sports management at Syracuse and a former chief marketing officer of the United States Olympic Committee.\u201cThe biggest pro is, L.A. is a winner again,\u201d Mr. Burton said in a telephone interview.At the same time, he said, there could be a change in the city\u2019s political and Olympic leadership by 2028. Arenas may need updating for the latest technology. And it is possible that new construction will be needed if additional sports are added to the Games. In addition, Mr. Burton said, there is no way to predict what the city\u2019s economy or social mood will be in 2028 or whether a severe natural disaster like an earthquake will occur.By waiting four additional years, \u201cyou\u2019re rolling the dice a few more times,\u201d Mr. Burton said. \u201cAll of that has to be planned for. My guess is, it will be.\u201dAdam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles, and Jer\u00e9 Longman from Philadelphia.

There were copies of Ebony, Essence and Jet that my dad brought home from work so that we could be in touch with our blackness in magazine form, and the union newsletters that explained why his job was worth having.He worked on the assembly line at a car plant in southern Wisconsin, work that regularly sent him to the hospital for surgeries to drain extra fluid from his knees. But those procedures were covered by union-negotiated medical insurance, and the time he had to miss work for them was handled by union-negotiated contractual provisions. Each time he healed, he could go right back to the job he loved in order to provide for our family.Workers are being deprived of the advantages my dad\u2019s labor union negotiated for my family: wages that helped us save for a down payment on a house after years of moving from apartment to apartment; health care that covered, in addition to Dad\u2019s knee surgeries, treatment for my sister\u2019s asthma, my brother\u2019s autism, my mother\u2019s high blood pressure and Dad\u2019s early-onset prostate cancer.After years of studying our bathroom\u2019s stack of union publications, I grew enthralled with the existence of union negotiator guys who looked just like my dad, dressed in the Midwestern anti-fashion of workboots and fleeces to guard against our seemingly eternal winters. Though they dressed like my dad, they had knowledge he didn\u2019t, until they shared it with him: how to negotiate fair wages for his physically challenging job and how to avoid illegal and unreasonable work hours and conditions.I belong to a union myself these days: the Writers Guild of America East, which recently avoided a strike and negotiated more favorable health care coverage for its members. That success was a particularly noteworthy accomplishment in this era when millions of people \u2014 many with employer-based plans \u2014 are rightly afraid of losing their health coverage.The last big boom for American unions came during a period that resembles the present one: The Great Depression, like the \u201908 recession, left workers deeply unsatisfied with wages and working conditions. Thanks to the New Deal\u2019s favorable collective bargaining legislation, Americans felt free to organize unions and petition their employers for labor rights; there were 12 million labor union members by the end of World War II.The union newsletters my father kept in our bathroom magazine rack may have faded, but their message \u2014 about the value of jobs that provide a fair wage, reasonable conditions and the ability to care for a family \u2014 is as timely now as it ever was.Kashana Cauley is a writer for \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chuck Schumer: A Better Deal for American Workers", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAmericans are clamoring for bold changes to our politics and our economy. They feel, rightfully, that both systems are rigged against them, and they made that clear in last year\u2019s election. American families deserve a better deal so that this country works for everyone again, not just the elites and special interests. Today, Democrats will start presenting that better deal to the American people.There used to be a basic bargain in this country that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you could own a home, afford a car, put your kids through college and take a modest vacation every year while putting enough away for a comfortable retirement. In the second half of the 20th century, millions of Americans achieved this solid middle-class lifestyle. I should know \u2014 I grew up in that America.But things have changed.Today\u2019s working Americans and the young are justified in having greater doubts about the future than any generation since the Depression. Americans believe they\u2019re getting a raw deal from both the economic and political systems in our country. And they are right. The wealthiest special interests can spend an unlimited, undisclosed amount of money to influence elections and protect their special deals in Washington. As a result, our system favors short-term gains for shareholders instead of long-term benefits for workers.And for far too long, government has gone along, tilting the economic playing field in favor of the wealthy and powerful while putting new burdens on the backs of hard-working Americans.Democrats have too often hesitated from taking on those misguided policies directly and unflinchingly \u2014 so much so that many Americans don\u2019t know what we stand for. Not after today. Democrats will show the country that we\u2019re the party on the side of working people \u2014 and that we stand for three simple things.First, we\u2019re going to increase people\u2019s pay. Second, we\u2019re going to reduce their everyday expenses. And third, we\u2019re going to provide workers with the tools they need for the 21st-century economy.Over the next several months, Democrats will lay out a series of policies that, if enacted, will make these three things a reality. We\u2019ve already proposed creating jobs with a $1 trillion infrastructure plan; increasing workers\u2019 incomes by lifting the minimum wage to $15; and lowering household costs by providing paid family and sick leave.On Monday we are announcing three new policies to advance our goals.Right now, there is nothing to stop vulture capitalists from egregiously raising the price of lifesaving drugs without justification. We\u2019re going to fight for rules to stop prescription drug price gouging and demand that drug companies justify price increases to the public. And we\u2019re going to push for empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for older Americans.Right now our antitrust laws are designed to allow huge corporations to merge, padding the pockets of investors but sending costs skyrocketing for everything from cable bills and airline tickets to food and health care. We are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they\u2019re hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition.Right now millions of unemployed or underemployed people, particularly those without a college degree, could be brought back into the labor force or retrained to secure full-time, higher-paying work. We propose giving employers, particularly small businesses, a large tax credit to train workers for unfilled jobs. This will have particular resonance in smaller cities and rural areas, which have experienced an exodus of young people who aren\u2019t trained for the jobs in those areas.In the coming months, we\u2019ll offer additional ideas, from rebuilding rural America to fundamentally changing our trade laws to benefit workers, not multinational corporations.We are in the minority in both houses of Congress; we cannot promise anyone that this Congress will begin passing our priorities tomorrow. But we have to start raising our voices to present our vision for the country\u2019s future. We will seek the support of any Republicans willing to work with us, but more important, we must start rallying the American people to support our ideas.In the last two elections, Democrats, including in the Senate, failed to articulate a strong, bold economic program for the middle class and those working hard to get there. We also failed to communicate our values to show that we were on the side of working people, not the special interests. We will not repeat the same mistake. This is the start of a new vision for the party, one strongly supported by House and Senate Democrats.Our better deal is not about expanding the government, or moving our party in one direction or another along the political spectrum. Nor is it about tearing down government agencies that work, that effectively protect consumers and promote the health and well-being of the country. It\u2019s about reorienting government to work on behalf of people and families.Americans from every corner of this country know that the economy isn\u2019t working for them the way that it should, and they wonder if it ever will again. One party says the answer is that special interests should continue to write the rules and that government ought to make things easier for an already-favored few.Democrats will offer a better deal.Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, is the Senate minority leader.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Deep Industry Ties of Trump\u2019s Deregulation Teams", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump RulesWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump entered office pledging to cut red tape, and within weeks, he ordered his administration to assemble teams to aggressively scale back government regulations.But the effort \u2014 a signature theme in Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign for the White House \u2014 is being conducted in large part out of public view and often by political appointees with deep industry ties and potential conflicts.Most government agencies have declined to disclose information about their deregulation teams. But The New York Times and ProPublica identified 71 appointees, including 28 with potential conflicts, through interviews, public records and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.Some appointees are reviewing rules their previous employers sought to weaken or kill, and at least two may be positioned to profit if certain regulations are undone.The appointees include lawyers who have represented businesses in cases against government regulators, staff members of political dark money groups, employees of industry-funded organizations opposed to environmental rules and at least three people who were registered to lobby the agencies they now work for.At the Education Department alone, two members of the deregulation team were most recently employed by pro-charter advocacy groups or operators, and one appointee was an executive handling regulatory issues at a for-profit college operator.So far, the process has been scattershot. Some agencies have been soliciting public feedback, while others refuse even to disclose who is in charge of the review. In many cases, responses to public records requests have been denied, delayed or severely redacted.The Interior Department has not disclosed the correspondence or calendars for its team. But a review of more than 1,300 pages of handwritten sign-in sheets for guests visiting the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington found that appointees had met regularly with industry representatives.Over a four-month period, from February through May, at least 58 representatives of the oil and gas industry signed their names on the agency\u2019s visitor logs before meeting with appointees.The Environmental Protection Agency also rejected requests to release the appointment calendar of the official leading its team \u2014 a former top executive for an industry-funded political group \u2014 even as she met privately with industry representatives.And the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security provided the titles for most appointees to their review teams, but not names.When asked for comment about the activities of the deregulation teams, the White House referred reporters to the Office of Management and Budget.Meghan Burris, a spokeswoman there, said: \u201cAs previous administrations have recognized, it\u2019s good government to periodically reassess existing regulations. Past regulatory review efforts, however, have not taken a consistent enough look at regulations on the books.\u201dWith billions of dollars at stake in the push to deregulate, corporations and other industry groups are hiring lawyers, lobbyists and economists to help navigate this new avenue for influence. Getting to the front of the line is crucial, as it can take years to effect regulatory changes.\u201cCompetition will be fierce,\u201d the law firm Clark Hill, which represents businesses pitching the E.P.A., said in a marketing memo. \u201cIn all likelihood, interested parties will need to develop a multipronged strategy to expand support and win pre-eminence over competing regulatory rollback candidates.\u201dAn examination of the Trump administration\u2019s deregulation teams has revealed a string of possible conflicts, including some appointees who may be reviewing rules their previous employers tried to weaken or kill.Jane Luxton, a lawyer at the firm, said she advised clients to pay for economic and legal analyses that government agencies, short on staff, could use to expedite changes. She declined to identify the clients.\u201cYou may say this is an agency\u2019s job, but the agencies are totally overloaded,\u201d Ms. Luxton said.Her company, a top pesticide maker based in Switzerland, had spent eight years and millions of dollars lobbying the Obama administration on environmental rules, with limited success.But Ms. Peterson had an in with the new administration.Scott Cameron, newly installed at the Interior Department and a member of its deregulation team, had just left a nonprofit he founded. He had advocated getting pesticides approved and out to market faster. His group counted Syngenta as a financial partner.The meeting with Ms. Peterson was one of the first Mr. Cameron took as a new government official.Neither side would reveal what was discussed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s reporting information I have to give you,\u201d Ms. Peterson said.But lobbying records offered clues.Syngenta has been one of several pesticide manufacturers pushing for changes to the Endangered Species Act. When federal agencies take actions that may jeopardize endangered animals or plants, they are generally supposed to consult with the Interior Department, which could raise objections.For decades, the E.P.A. largely ignored this provision when approving new pesticides. But recently, a legal challenge from environmental groups forced its hand \u2014 a change that affected Syngenta.Pesticide lobbyists have been working behind the scenes at agencies and on Capitol Hill to change the provision. Companies have argued that they should be exempt from consulting with the Interior Department because they already undergo E.P.A. approval.Along with spending millions of dollars on lobbying, they have funded advocacy groups aligned with their cause. Mr. Cameron\u2019s nonprofit, the Reduce Risks From Invasive Species Coalition, was one such group for Syngenta.The organization says on its website that its goals include reducing \u201cthe regulatory burden of the Endangered Species Act on American society by addressing invasive species.\u201d One way to do that is to use pesticides. The nonprofit\u2019s mission includes creating \u201cbusiness opportunities for commercial products and services used to control invasive species.\u201dMr. Cameron also served on a committee of experts and stakeholders, including Syngenta, that advised the federal government on decisions related to invasive species. At a committee event last July, he said that one of his priorities was \u201cgetting biocontrol agents to market faster,\u201d according to meeting minutes.Paul Minehart, a Syngenta spokesman, said: \u201cEmployees regularly engage with those in government that relate to agriculture and our business. Our purpose is to balance serving the public health and environment with enabling farmers\u2019 access to innovation.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Interior Department did not respond to questions about how Mr. Cameron\u2019s relationship with Syngenta might influence his review of regulations.Under the law, members of the Trump administration can seek ethics waivers to work on issues that overlap with their past business careers. They can also formally recuse themselves when potential conflicts arise.In many cases, the administration has refused to say whether appointees to Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulation teams have done either.One such appointee is Samantha Dravis, the chairwoman of the deregulation team at the E.P.A., who was a top official at the Republican Attorneys General Association. Ms. Dravis was also president of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which brought together energy companies and Republican attorneys general to file lawsuits against the federal government over Obama-era environmental regulations.Liz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to say whether Ms. Dravis had recused herself from issues dealing with previous employers or their backers, or had discussed regulations with any of them.\u201cAs you will find when you receive Samantha\u2019s calendar, she has met with a range of stakeholders, including nonprofits, industry groups and others, on a wide range of issues,\u201d Ms. Bowman said.Ms. Bowman said the calendar could be obtained through a public records request. ProPublica and The Times had already filed a request for records including calendars, but the agency\u2019s response did not include those documents. (An appeal was filed, but the calendar has not yet been released.)\u201cWe take our ethics responsibilities seriously,\u201d Ms. Bowman said. \u201cAll political staff have had an ethics briefing and know their obligations.\u201dAddressing the agency\u2019s regulatory efforts, she said, \u201cWe are here to enact a positive environmental agenda that provides real results to the American people, without unnecessarily hamstringing our economy.\u201dAt the Agriculture Department, the only known appointee to the deregulation team is Rebeckah Adcock. She previously lobbied the department as a top executive both at CropLife America, a trade association for pesticide makers, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group for farmers.The department deals with many issues involving farmers, including crop insurance and land conservation rules, but it would not disclose whether Ms. Adcock had recused herself from discussions affecting her past employers.At the Energy Department, a member of the deregulation team is Brian McCormack, who formerly handled political and external affairs for Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electrical utilities.Though the Energy Department does not directly regulate electrical utilities, it does help oversee international electricity trade, the promotion of renewable energy and the security of domestic energy production. After joining the department, Mr. McCormack helped start a review of the nation\u2019s electrical grid, according to an agency memo.Clean-energy advocates fear the inquiry will cast solar energy, which can fluctuate, as a threat to grid reliability. Such a finding could scare off state public utility commissions considering solar policies and serve as a boon for electrical utilities, said Matt Kasper, research director at the Energy and Policy Institute, an environmental group.Disclosure records show that while Mr. McCormack was at Edison, the trade group lobbied the federal government, including the Energy Department, on issues including grid reliability.The department would not answer questions about Mr. McCormack\u2019s involvement with those issues.Some of the recusals involve appointees at the Small Business Administration and the Education Department, including Bob Eitel, who leads the education team and was vice president for regulatory legal services at an operator of for-profit colleges.Another recusal involves Byron Brown, an E.P.A. appointee who is married to a senior government affairs manager for the Hess Corporation, the oil and gas company.Hess was fined and ordered to spend more than $45 million on pollution controls by the E.P.A. during the Obama administration because of alleged Clean Air Act violations at its refinery in Port Reading, N.J. Disclosure records show that Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Lesley Schaaff, lobbied the E.P.A. last year on behalf of the company.An E.P.A. spokeswoman declined to say whether Mr. Brown or Ms. Schaaff owned Hess stock, though an agency ethics official said Mr. Brown had recused himself from evaluating regulations affecting the company.The agency declined to say whether Mr. Brown would also recuse himself from issues affecting the American Petroleum Institute, where his wife\u2019s company is a member. The association has lobbied to ease Obama-era natural gas rules, complaining in a recent letter to Mr. Brown\u2019s team about an \u201cunprecedented level of federal regulatory actions targeting our industry.\u201dBefore being selected to lead the deregulation team at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Maren Kasper was a director at Roofstock, an online marketplace for investors in single-family rental properties. Financial disclosure records show that Ms. Kasper owned a stake in the company worth up to $50,000.Changes at HUD could increase investor interest in rental homes, affecting a company like Roofstock. The agency, for example, oversees the federal government\u2019s Section 8 subsidies program for low-income renters.Ethics officials allowed Ms. Kasper to keep her stake, but she pledged not to take actions that would affect it. (A spokesman for HUD said Ms. Kasper\u2019s tenure on the deregulation task force had since ended.)One by one, scientists, educators and environmental activists approached the microphone and urged government officials not to weaken regulations intended to protect children from lead.The forum, run by the E.P.A. in a drab basement meeting room in Washington, was part of the agency\u2019s push to identify regulations that were excessive and burdensome to businesses.Few businesspeople showed up. As public hearings on regulations have played out in recent weeks, many industry and corporate representatives have instead met with Trump administration officials behind closed doors.Still, the E.P.A. has asked for written comments and held about a dozen public meetings. The agency has received more than 467,000 comments, many of them critical of potential rollbacks, but also some from businesses large and small pleading for relief from regulatory costs or confusion.After a quiet moment at the meeting to discuss lead regulations, the owner of a local painting company, Brian McCracken, moved to the microphone.Mr. McCracken was frustrated by what he described as costly rules that forced him to test for lead-based paint in homes before he could begin painting. Each test kit costs about $2, and he may need six per room. If a family then declines to hire him, those costs come out of his pocket.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is sitting here saying that lead-based dust does not hurt children,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we are talking about. What the contractor needs is a better way to test.\u201dHis voice quavered: \u201cWhy do I have to educate the general public about the hazards that generations before me created? It doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201dMr. Trump is not the first president to take on such frustrations.President Bill Clinton declared that the federal government was failing to regulate \u201cwithout imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society.\u201d He assigned Vice President Al Gore to collect agencies\u2019 suggestions for rules that should go. One rule dictated how to measure the consistency of grits.President George W. Bush\u2019s regulatory overhaul focused more on how new regulations were created. The administration installed a political appointee inside each agency who generally had to sign off before any significant new rule could be initiated. At the E.P.A. for a time, that official came from an industry-funded think tank.President Barack Obama ordered regular updates from each agency about the effectiveness of rules already on the books.\u201cWhen you raise the profile, when it\u2019s clearly an executive priority, it gets attention,\u201d said Heather Krause, director of strategic issues at the Government Accountability Office, the main auditor of the federal government. According to the auditor\u2019s analysis, the effect under Mr. Obama was mostly to clarify and streamline rules, not eliminate them.Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Trump has empowered political appointees. Though some agencies have included career staff members on their review teams, an executive order from Mr. Trump creating the teams does not require it \u2014 nonpolitical employees are generally believed to be more wedded to existing rules. And like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has imposed regular reporting requirements.But Mr. Trump, who spent his business career on the other side of government regulations, has put an emphasis on cutting old rules.The same day he signed the executive order initiating the review, he addressed a large crowd of conservative activists at a Maryland convention center.\u201cWe have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy \u2014 crushing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the regulations industry out of work and out of business.\u201dAmit Narang, a regulatory expert at the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to create teams of political appointees \u2014 formally known as regulatory reform task forces \u2014 should make it easier for the White House to overcome bureaucratic resistance to his rollback plans.\u201cTo the extent there\u2019s a deep state effect in this administration,\u201d Mr. Narang said, \u201cthe task force will be more effective in trying to get the agenda in place.\u201dDanielle Ivory reported from Washington, and Robert Faturechi from New York.

{"Headline": "As Relations Worsen, Iran Says U.S. Sanctions May Violate Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, charged on Tuesday that the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to reimpose sanctions on his country was a violation of the accord signed two years ago that sharply limited Iran\u2019s ability to produce nuclear material in return for its reintegration into the world economy.\u201cIt is not clear what the administration is trying to do,\u201d said Mr. Zarif, the urbane, American-educated diplomat who negotiated the agreement with John Kerry, then the secretary of state.\u201cThey have been talking about \u2018scrapping the deal,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen they came to realize that would not be globally welcome. So now they are trying to make it impossible for Iran to benefit.\u201dThe new sanctions were intended, administration officials say, to emphasize the administration\u2019s determination to find new ways to penalize Tehran for activities not covered by the nuclear accord, which Mr. Trump regularly assailed during last year\u2019s campaign and threatened to tear up at various moments.Iran\u2019s adherence to its commitments within the accord prompted heated arguments inside the administration that continued on Monday before Mr. Trump finally agreed to certify that Iran was in compliance with its obligations.The sanctions announced the next day cited continued Iranian development and testing of missiles, the country\u2019s support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and its escalating cyberactivity, including the theft of software.Mr. Zarif said Iran would \u201creciprocate,\u201d but made the promise in a weary way, saying that Iran\u2019s sanctions on Americans would be no more effective than American efforts to block travel or financial transactions with 18 Iranian individuals and entities.But the bigger casualty, Mr. Zarif acknowledged in a 90-minute conversation with an invited group of journalists, was the prospect that the deal would mark a shift in more than three decades of antagonism between Washington and Tehran that dated to the Islamic Revolution and the overthrow of the Shah.Two years ago there was talk of whether, with the nuclear dispute behind them, the United States and Iran might cooperate against the Islamic State and strike a deal over Syria. Traditional Sunni allies of the United States like Saudi Arabia wondered if Washington was about to pivot toward Iran, which has a predominantly Shiite population, for the first time since the Shah\u2019s fall.Indeed, the deal was seen as a major gamble by the Obama administration. Over time, many officials thought, the two countries would use it as a foundation for building a larger relationship.Today that foundation is crumbling. Administration officials say the debate over whether to ultimately scrap the accord continues, though they acknowledge that doing that would free Iran to resume enrichment of uranium and reprocessing of plutonium, the exact activities the deal sharply limits.The reception Mr. Zarif receives now in Washington could not be more different than it was 24 months ago. He and Mr. Kerry developed a close rapport, even if it was often punctuated by shouting matches. But Mr. Zarif said he had never spoken with Mr. Kerry\u2019s successor, Rex W. Tillerson.\u201cI haven\u2019t asked for a meeting, and I don\u2019t think I will,\u201d he said.Mr. Zarif said that if conversations do begin anew with the United States, they will be limited to the nuclear deal \u2014 and American compliance. But he did not sound hopeful, adding that Iran had no intention of renegotiating.His emphasis on shoring up the existing agreement runs counter to the Trump White House\u2019s strategy, which is to de-emphasize the nuclear accord and focus on Iran\u2019s other behaviors.The benefits of the nuclear deal have been slow to come to Iran. At one point Mr. Kerry met with European bankers to encourage them to reopen their dealings with Tehran, fearing that a backlash against the deal would occur if the West did not seem to be living up to its side of the accord.Whether the Trump administration is actively violating the agreement by reimposing sanctions under a different rationale is a debatable legal point, though a number of American experts said that Mr. Zarif had a plausible case. The agreement has a mechanism in place to resolve both small and large disputes, which Mr. Zarif suggested Iran was about to become the first to invoke.The accord specifies that the United States, and other partners in what is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \u201cwill refrain from any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran inconsistent with their commitments not to undermine the successful implementation\u201d of the agreement.The Trump administration insists \u2014 as the Obama administration did \u2014 that such wording allows for sanctions to counter human rights violations, weapons proliferation or support of terrorism. In fact, Mr. Obama imposed some sanctions the same day the accord went into effect in 2016.The sanctions announced on Tuesday are similar to those Mr. Obama invoked. But the intent may be different. Last week Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, told reporters that at the Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, Mr. Trump actively argued for isolating Iran, telling \u201cmore than a dozen foreign leaders\u201d that they needed to \u201cstrip terrorists of their funding, territory and ideological support, and stop doing business with nations that sponsor terrorism, especially Iran.\u201dMr. Zarif said he was philosophical about the change in tone. He had allowed for that during the negotiations, he said, noting that the document \u201cwas negotiated and drafted based on mutual distrust.\u201d\u201cYou will see that mistrust every sentence,\u201d he added.Mr. Zarif dodged questions about Iran\u2019s activities in the Middle East, saying he did not know how many Iranian or Shiite militias were in Syria, and he declined to criticize Mr. Assad. He questioned whether Mr. Assad\u2019s government was responsible for the chemical attack that led to American retaliation in April.\u201cWhy would he do something\u201d like the chemical weapons attack, Mr. Zarif asked about Mr. Assad, \u201cthe day after the president indicates removing Assad is not an American priority?\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Zarif was defensive about Iran\u2019s continued missile testing, saying it needed accurate missiles as a deterrent against the Sunni Arab states that the United States arms with its \u201cbeautiful American military equipment\u201d sold to the region.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Pharma Spends on Share Buybacks, but R&D? Not So Much", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameUnder fire for skyrocketing drug prices, pharmaceutical companies often offer this response: The high costs of their products are justified because the proceeds generate money for crucial research on new cures and treatments.The paper\u2019s five authors concluded that from 2006 through 2015, the 18 drug companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index spent a combined $516 billion on buybacks and dividends. This exceeded by 11 percent the companies\u2019 research and development spending of $465 billion during these years.The authors contend that many big pharmaceutical companies are living off patents that are decades-old and have little to show in the way of new blockbuster drugs. But their share buybacks and dividend payments inoculate them against shareholders who might be concerned about lackluster research and development.A few companies have spent more money repurchasing shares than they allocated to research over the period, the study found. They included Gilead Sciences, which spent $27 billion on buybacks versus $17 billion on research, and Biogen Idec, which repurchased $14.6 billion in stock and spent $13.8 billion on research and development.\u201cThe key cause of high drug prices, restricted access to medicines and stifled innovation, we submit, is a social disease called \u2018maximizing shareholder value,\u2019\u201d the study\u2019s authors concluded.This concept, the authors said, is actually \u201can ideology of value extraction.\u201d And chief among the beneficiaries of the extraction are drug company executives, whose pay packages, based in part on stock prices, are among the lushest in corporate America.\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of spending on R&D in the U.S. economy, and no shortage of spending on life sciences, even though it has declined somewhat in real terms,\u201d one of the authors, William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said in an interview. \u201cBut there really is very little drug development going on in companies showing the highest profits and capturing much of the gains.\u201dWhile stock buybacks appear to be particularly troublesome among drugmakers, big companies in other industries \u2014 in sectors like banking, retail, technology and consumer goods, among others \u2014 are also buying back boatloads of their shares. Through May, some $390 billion in buybacks have been announced this year, $13 billion more than at this time in 2016, according to figures compiled by Jeffrey Yale Rubin at Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm.Many companies contend that stock buybacks are a great way to return value to their shareholders. Investors often agree. By reducing the equity outstanding at a company, the repurchases increase its per-share earnings, often giving a boost to its stock.Buybacks made at low cost can be a fine use of a company\u2019s capital. But when share repurchases replace a company\u2019s research-and-development spending, that indicates its management is unable or unwilling to spend on innovation that could generate future earnings to shareholders.As the buyback binge continues, another new academic study shows, a heavy reliance on them actually hurts corporate performance over the long haul. These researchers found that the more capital a business invests in stock repurchases based on its current market capitalization, \u201cthe less likely that company is to experience long-term growth in overall market value.\u201d\u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d is by Robert U. Ayres, emeritus professor of economics, political science and technology management at the global business school Insead, and Michael Olenick, a research fellow there. It compares the performance of companies that lean heavily on buybacks with those that do not.Spending money on buybacks and dividends has increased among United States companies from negligible levels in the 1980s, the researchers said, to 38 percent of earnings in 2000. By 2011, buybacks had grown to 79 percent of earnings, rocketing to 110 percent in 2015.Mr. Ayres and Mr. Olenick found that 199 companies repurchased shares equal to at least half their current value. Some 64 companies spent over 100 percent of their current market capitalization on buybacks.When the academics combined these companies\u2019 current market values with the amounts they had spent on buybacks, the sum showed what the companies should have been worth if they had invested the money in a money-market account instead.Fifty companies have spent more inflation-adjusted capital buying back stock than their businesses are currently worth in market value, the study found. Companies on this list include HP Inc., J. C. Penney and Sears Holdings.By contrast, the research identified 269 strong performers that have repurchased stock worth just 2 percent or less of their current market values. They include Facebook, Xcel Energy, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.Company executives who buy back large numbers of shares instead of investing in their businesses are committing corporate suicide, Mr. Olenick said. \u201cWhen managers can\u2019t create value in the business other than buying their own stock,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cit seems like it\u2019s time for a management change.\u201dHis co-author, Mr. Ayres, said he suspected the buyback craze was rooted in executives\u2019 laser focus on short-term results. \u201cThey have short-term expectations,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re in their jobs for a few years at most; they\u2019re not really interested in the long-term future of the company.\u201dShare buybacks provide immediate gratification, the stock market equivalent of a sugar high. That makes them alluring in the short term. Until the crash that usually follows.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup Said to Open Frankfurt Hub as Banks Consider Post-\u2018Brexit\u2019 Moves", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Score one for Frankfurt.With Britain locked in negotiations with the European Union over their post-\u201cBrexit\u201d relationship, the financial companies that dominate London\u2019s economy have forged ahead, eager to ensure they can continue to serve clients across the Continent. That has set other European cities scrambling to win a slice of the business that the British capital has long kept for itself.The American banking giant Citigroup is taking a step toward reducing its dependence on London and will open a second trading hub in Frankfurt, said a person familiar with the bank\u2019s plans, who was not authorized to speak publicly about them and so spoke anonymously. The bank has had an operation in Frankfurt for decades, but it would expand its business there with this latest decision.The development is largely symbolic, with a relatively small number of staff members in London expected to move to Germany. But it is another trickle of job losses that some British business and political leaders fear could turn into a flood in the coming months and years, as the full picture of the nation\u2019s future trading relationship with the European Union becomes clear.Britain\u2019s membership in the 28-nation bloc has bolstered London\u2019s position as a global financial hub in part because European rules allow \u201cpassporting,\u201d under which a banking license in a single member-state allows a lender to work throughout the European Union.But it is unclear whether Britain will be able to retain that access. Other questions affecting banks also remain unanswered, including whether European citizens will be able to continue to live and work in Britain, and if so, under what sort of visa.While most financial companies have said they would prefer to stay in London \u2014 home to some of the world\u2019s biggest financial markets and a wide variety of support industries like accountants and lawyers \u2014 they also must ensure they can continue to operate across the European Union.Citi\u2019s decision shows how financial services companies are trying to strike that balance.The bank employs about 19,000 people in the European Union, including around 6,000 in London. A vast majority of its investment banking and trading jobs in London will remain in place, according to the person. But the bank will obtain a broker dealer license in Frankfurt so it can continue trading and offering investment banking services across the European Union.The jobs that may shift to Frankfurt form a small percentage of the overall figures. And while other financial companies have announced plans to move employees or to make new hires in Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and even Luxembourg, most of those plans have also involved relatively few people.Still, that has not stopped cities on the Continent \u2014 particularly Frankfurt and Paris \u2014 from making an aggressive sales pitch to business leaders, hoping to eventually lure tens of thousand of workers.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Frankfurt, despite being viewed by some as a sleepier city, has at least one definite advantage: It is the home to the European Central Bank, the region\u2019s chief banking regulator.Frankfurt Main Finance, another lobbying organization, has estimated that as many as 10,000 new jobs could move to the city over the next five years.\u201cNoted for its strong economic and political stability, Frankfurt and the region offer a top infrastructure, competitively priced and plentiful modern office space, a deep talent pool and an extremely high quality of life,\u201d Frankfurt Main Finance said.And while much appears unclear, one thing is certain: Banks in London are pushing ahead with contingency plans.The British lender Barclays said last week that it was in talks with Irish regulators to expand the license of its Barclays Bank Ireland subsidiary to continue to serve European Union clients, while HSBC has said it could move as many as 1,000 people to Paris.The American International Group and other insurers have picked Luxembourg for their European hubs, while the insurance marketplace Lloyd\u2019s of London has settled on Brussels for its new European Union subsidiary.But Citigroup will not find itself alone in Germany.The Japanese companies Daiwa Securities, Nomura and the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have said they will set up outposts in Frankfurt. Standard Chartered, which is based in Britain but generates much of its income in Asia, has said it was in discussions with regulators about opening a subsidiary in Frankfurt.Chad Bray reported from London, and Michael Corkery from New York.Advertisement"}

Lesbians are on the march.These are steps backward. But voters seem to be moving forward: The overwhelming majority of the Victory Fund\u2019s candidates are prevailing. Not at equal rates, though.The Times is the first publication to be provided with these selective snapshots, and they\u2019re just that: snapshots. But they jibe with some politicians\u2019 sense that voters may indeed be more receptive, or at least less resistant, to lesbians than to gay men.\u201cWe\u2019re less threatening, I think,\u201d Annise Parker, the mayor of Houston from 2010 to 2016, told me in a recent telephone interview. She said lesbians don\u2019t deal with anything precisely like \u201cthe long-dispelled shibboleths about gay men being sexual predators.\u201dMore gay men than gay women have been mayors \u2014 including, currently, the mayors of cities as disparate as Santa Fe, N.M., and Lexington, Ky. \u2014 just as more straight men than straight women have. But Parker remains the only openly L.G.B.T. person ever elected to lead one of the nation\u2019s 10 most populous cities.Similarly, the only openly L.G.B.T. person ever elected governor is also a woman, Kate Brown, who won in Oregon last year. She is married to a man but identifies as bisexual. (In 2004, Gov. James McGreevey of New Jersey came out as gay more than two years after his election, announcing his resignation simultaneously.)And there is only one openly L.G.B.T. person ever elected to the United States Senate: Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin, a lesbian, who is in her first term.In the House of Representatives, however, openly L.G.B.T. men have enjoyed the advantage. There are five in the House now while there\u2019s just one openly L.G.B.T. woman, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who identifies as bisexual.Pat Spearman, a state senator in Nevada since 2013, is one of them.\u201cI\u2019m African-American and a woman and a lesbian: I can\u2019t catch a break,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d She laughed, then talked about the many decades when she kept her sexual orientation secret, partly because she was in the United States military and partly because she was an ordained Methodist minister. She\u2019s 62 and came out just seven years ago.I asked her if she\u2019d talked about that journey during her campaign. Yes, she answered, and many voters, regardless of sexual orientation, seemed to hear echoes of their own struggles. \u201cPeople could relate,\u201d she said, adding that they respected \u201cthat I embraced all of these: African-American, woman, lesbian.\u201dOpenly L.G.B.T. politicians sometimes get points from voters for candor and even character. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of the dynamic that if you\u2019re honest about that, you\u2019ll be honest about everything,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of halo effect.\u201dThat accrues to gay women and men equally. But what may well distinguish lesbians and explain the success rates that the Victory Fund observed is how well prepared they are, political analysts told me. As women, they\u2019re more hesitant than men to run, and that, coupled with being lesbian, may make them pause several extra beats to be absolutely sure that their experience and mettle can eclipse any bigotry they confront.\u201cIt might be that lesbians who have made it over all the hurdles to the stage of candidacy are just damn impressive community leaders and thus better candidates,\u201d said Andrew Reynolds, a professor of political science at U.N.C. and the director of its research initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to find a lesbian in elected office who is out of her depth.\u201dParker noted that by the time of her election as the mayor of Houston, she\u2019d worked for many years in the energy industry, a vital part of the city\u2019s economy, and had been a well-known city councilwoman as well as the city controller.When I asked her which sort of discrimination \u2014 sexism or homophobia \u2014 she\u2019d encountered more often along the way, she answered instantly: sexism. \u201cI think at the highest levels,\u201d she said, \u201cthe woman thing kicks in and kicks us in the teeth.\u201dMaybe that toughens a candidate.

{"Headline": "Mitch McConnell, Master Tactician, Faces Daunting Challenge: A Health Bill", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell excels at devising crafty ways for Senate Republicans to avoid paying a high price on politically explosive issues.Take, for instance, his ingenious 2011 plan to clear the way for increases in the federal debt limit without Republican fingerprints. The McConnell maneuver turned the always-contentious process on its head and allowed Republicans to register their opposition to the increases while simultaneously permitting the necessary rise in the debt limit to avoid an economic meltdown. Even critics tipped their hats.Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, is going to need all the creativity he can muster to escape his current predicament.The Senate\u2019s Republican health care plan is in real trouble, and the fight that will be renewed next week on Capitol Hill is exposing the limits of Mr. McConnell\u2019s prowess in bending his colleagues and the Senate to his will. Deep understanding of Senate procedures and shrewd political instincts can only get you so far when many of your colleagues are truly anxious and fear the consequences of taking major action on health care policy.\u201cIt could not be more different from the difficulty of raising the debt limit because it is policy that affects millions of Americans and health care is so personal,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who is among those who have balked at her party\u2019s plan.Mr. McConnell knew his best chance to pass the bill was a quick strike before the Fourth of July recess, and he was right. As expected, the weeklong break has only complicated his already difficult task. Even usually certain Republican votes such as Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Hoeven of North Dakota have joined the cadre of Republicans expressing resistance to the health care proposal, creating more distance between Mr. McConnell and the magic number of 50 votes needed to pass the bill.At the same time, conservative advocacy groups have intensified their demand that Republicans follow through on their repeated promises to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care bill or incur their wrath. They have also gotten behind a proposal by two Republican senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, that would move the health care proposal to the right and potentially drive off more support than it gathers.Mr. McConnell has expressed mounting frustration at the inability of the unified Republican government to make progress on health care and other issues.\u201cThe American people said, \u2018We elected a Republican president, a Republican House and a Republican Senate and we want to see some results,\u2019\u201d he told an audience in Kentucky over the recess. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t say anything other than I agree with you. But it is not easy, and we are going to continue to wrestle with this and try to get it done.\u201d\u201cNo action is not an option,\u201d he emphasized. That remark seemed aimed at quelling calls to simply repeal the law, an alternative that faces steep procedural obstacles because it would require Democratic votes and Democrats will not provide them.On Thursday, Mr. McConnell again suggested that Republicans might find themselves in negotiations with Democrats on a modest plan to shore up the existing health insurance exchanges if they cannot advance their own legislation. His comment both laid the groundwork for a defeat while trying to provide an incentive for Republicans to get behind the leadership plan.The health care fight does not play to Mr. McConnell\u2019s typical strengths. It is an extremely complex policy matter, and Mr. McConnell has often reveled more in tactics and procedure than the arcana of community rating and adverse selection.Even some fellow Republicans acknowledge that Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal to allow hearings on the health care proposal has backfired, denying Republican lawmakers the opportunity to hear from experts, gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the legislation, and discern potential lines of attack as well as the support for any changes.Republicans are finding how constituents respond when Congress tries to take a benefit away. The closest comparison might be the decision in 1989 to repeal a new Medicare catastrophic coverage law.But it was overturned in only about a year with the enthusiastic approval of the people who were supposed to benefit from it. The Affordable Care Act has had much more time to become enmeshed in the health care system, with millions of people relying on it \u2014 especially those receiving guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions. The beneficiaries of the law are now making their sentiments clearly known.\u201cI think it is so difficult for Mitch to thread the needle on this given the narrow majority in the Senate,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how he does it. But I don\u2019t ever underestimate his abilities.\u201dMr. McConnell has had failures in the past, like his inability to prevent the 2013 government shutdown. But he has more often fashioned a way out that few others saw, whether it was cutting a deal on student loans and transportation spending or keeping the Congress and the country from plunging over a fiscal cliff.He has compared the current situation to a Rubik\u2019s cube, where he is busily twisting and turning until he finally lines up the elusive 50 votes. But in this case, he is discovering that there is no solution within easy reach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do We Think Poverty Looks Like?", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSeveral years ago, during a harsh Detroit winter, I swallowed my pride and applied for food stamps. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d qualify, but I knew three things. I had little money in the bank, little chance of quickly earning more and I needed to eat. So I tried my luck with the government.I received $16 a month in benefits. By my cynical calculation, the eight hours I had spent applying would pay for itself, at minimum wage, after four months. I was grateful for the help. Usually, my $4 a week bought bacon, which could stretch several batches of beans.Being broke wasn\u2019t new to me. Food stamps, officially known as SNAP, were. My family had battled medical debt and unemployment when I was a kid, and I started working at 14. When I got a partial college scholarship and left my rural Michigan hometown, I made tuition and rent by juggling up to five jobs at once. I prided myself on never asking for help.At age 34, though, I faced the awkward, privileged dilemma of a working-class journalist: I\u2019d accepted a book contract to write about poverty, but it turned out to be too small to cover my health insurance and rent. I saw two options. Get a job, return my advance and abandon two years\u2019 worth of work \u2014 or somehow continue working on my book without an income.So food stamps it was.I knew I qualified, but it still felt like there was some kind of mistake. After all, I was a college-educated white woman who worked. I wasn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d poor.And that raises a thorny political question: Who, exactly, did I think was poor?It\u2019s tempting to say I thought anyone who worked couldn\u2019t be poor. That\u2019s na\u00efve. Real wages for the two-thirds of Americans without a four-year degree have dropped since 1979, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Meanwhile the cost of a degree has roughly doubled over the past three decades. Today, half of American jobs pay about $37,000 or less each year, a quarter pay about $23,000 or less, and a family of four qualifies for SNAP at $32,000 or less. No wonder just over half of all SNAP families work, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In America, \u201creal\u201d poverty is not about a lack of work, but a lack of compensation.It\u2019s also tempting to say I balked at food stamps because of the culture in which I was raised: rural, white and working class, in a state that went to Donald Trump. Most poor families I knew as a kid avoided food stamps; they believed in bootstraps, not getting help. But to say this was only about independence is to claim an innocence I didn\u2019t entirely possess.The truth is there was a shameful idea woven into my conceit of self-reliance, something so ingrained in American culture I\u2019d never thought to say it out loud: I didn\u2019t really think I was supposed to get food stamps because I was white.Having an implicit belief that poverty didn\u2019t really happen to white people did me more harm than good, and nearly prevented me from seeking help I needed. It also ignored reality. While it\u2019s true that blacks and latinos disproportionately live in poverty, if you analyze who gets food stamps, they are most likely to be white.The year I applied for SNAP, for example, whites were the largest racial group on food stamps and of the poor. As a reporter, I knew this, just as I\u2019d known plenty of poor whites growing up. But when I considered SNAP for myself, I felt keenly that it was not for \u201cpeople like me.\u201d The unspoken corollary was that poverty was normal for everyone else.I want to be clear: These passive assumptions were racist and classist. I am embarrassed to have made them. The qualification for being poor is not race or education, but an insurmountable gap between income and cost of living. But those assumptions, which I think are commonplace, say a lot about who we think is really poor.The best proxy for who we believe is poor is what we see in media. And media professionals tend to portray poverty as if it is rare for anyone but black Americans. In one assessment of three American news magazines between 1950 and 1992, African-Americans were used as subjects in stories about poverty 53 percent of the time, while constituting just 29 percent of the nation\u2019s poor. Martin Gilens, a professor of politics at Princeton and one of the study\u2019s authors, told me that those articles tended to focus on welfare and other \u201cunsympathetic\u201d frameworks that can suggest poverty is caused by personal choice.Poor whites, meanwhile, mostly showed up in stories about hunger and old age \u2014 poverty often considered blameless \u2014 and in fewer than half of stories on poverty, far below their share of the poor. Two later studies found that poverty among Asian- and Hispanic-Americans was consistently underreported, too. The only periods where the proportion of white poverty was accurately represented were economic downturns, when there is more sympathy for the poor, said Professor Gilens. And while those divides have softened today, said Rosalee Clawson, a Purdue political scientist updating the data through 2017, stories of the working poor \u201calways\u201d depict white subjects.None of this is surprising given newsrooms\u2019 demographics and locations. National journalism outlets often have staff that are significantly whiter than the United States population as a whole. Ninety-two percent of journalists hold a college degree, compared with one-third of the population. And today, media jobs are more likely to be in cities, where poverty skews black and brown, than in rural areas, where it skews white.The people who depict the poor, in other words, are unlikely to have much proximity to poverty themselves. What poverty they do see is usually black or brown. And that makes them more likely to repeat stereotypes about the poor than to interrogate them.Covering poverty as if it is predominantly a black issue is a problem. It\u2019s a problem because it can suggest that black suffering is a natural fact rather than a manufactured problem we should correct. It\u2019s a problem because it fosters resentment against communities of color from economically struggling whites, who have some reason to feel their hardship is played down. And this all creates a political problem: the obliteration of the common ground that being poor can help illuminate across racial lines.As last year\u2019s election showed us, losing sight of that really matters. And if my experience on food stamps is any indication, that common ground is easiest to see \u2014 at least for white people \u2014 when you\u2019re poor.For the last seven years, I\u2019ve kept my food stamp card, which I used for a year, on my desk. I put the card there thinking it would remind me how my career has depended on it.But lately, it reminds me of how ingrained racism can be \u2014 and how my understanding of it went from principled-if-abstract to concrete. I\u2019d known for a long time that racism was wrong, but seeing how my own racist assumptions nearly kept food off my table was different. It was as clear a lesson as I\u2019ll ever get that, while racism hurts people of color the most, it ultimately doesn\u2019t do me much good, either. And if we want more white people to see that, we have to be very honest about what, and who, we mean when we talk about the poor.Tracie McMillan is the author of \u201cThe American Way of Eating.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it is, of a sort, in places where white walls, tree boxes and flowering planters have replaced jerry-built, sidewalk-clogging stalls and storefronts.It is also part of a broader campaign \u2014 some say a crackdown \u2014 meant to transform Beijing\u2019s bustling, overcrowded city center into a futuristic capital of government, finance, media and technology. That means ridding it of uncontrolled development and \u201clow end\u201d entrepreneurship, while pushing out millions of migrants from other parts of China.In the Sanlitun neighborhood, Yashow DVD Shop No. 98 survived the destruction that swept through a side street in April, but sales have plummeted since the front entrance facing the street was shuttered. Customers now have to find their way through the grimy courtyard of a six-story apartment block, piled with debris and garbage.Zhu Yi, whose family opened the shop after moving from the southern city Guangzhou in 2008, said they had been given ample warning of the work. He acknowledged that the storefront entrance, which led to a basement shop, had not been erected according to any zoning code, but rents in nearby shopping centers are too exorbitant.\u201cTo this government it is illegal,\u201d he said, but added that a shop like theirs should also be \u201ca part of Beijing\u2019s local color.\u201dAs with most government decisions in China, there was no public debate about the campaign, and those affected said there was little they could do to challenge it.A less explicit goal is to rid the capital of many of the migrants who have poured into Beijing and other principal cities in recent decades. While they were important contributors to China\u2019s economic boom, officials seem to have calculated that they are not as vital to the new phase of development.The most visible sign of that has been a related campaign to close or shrink dozens of bustling wholesale markets, also heavily populated with migrant entrepreneurs. These include the Alien Street Market, which catered to Russian shuttle traders, and a cluster of buildings near the Beijing Zoo that composed the city\u2019s largest and most famous clothing market.As with previous efforts to reshape Beijing, this one has torn the fabric of urban life. Eviction notices at one of the zoo markets prompted daily protests last month, at least one of which ended with scuffles between tenants and guards. Dozens of shopkeepers have been promised refunds on their leases, but those protesting said they had yet to see them.The police, wary as ever of public displays of discontent, moved to stifle the protest before it could draw more attention. (When I showed up the next day, a police officer stopped me within minutes, checked my documents and asked me to leave.)More evictions are coming. The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that the city plans to close or relocate 120 markets this year.\u201cWe want to reveal the dark side of the cleanup,\u201d said Di Yanjie, one of the shopkeepers who protested. She said she had been detained at the local police station for 12 hours.In an interview at a restaurant, beyond the scrutiny of the police, she described the trajectory of her business, one that reflected the extraordinary gains China has made in lifting people into prosperity over the last three decades.A native of Beijing, Ms. Di and her husband first went into business two decades ago, selling women\u2019s clothing from a blanket on the sidewalk. Over the years they gradually expanded, and in 2009 moved into the market building \u2014 which now, according to Xinhua, will be converted into offices for finance and high-tech companies.\u201cThis place is famous all over China \u2014 the Beijing Zoo wholesale market!\u201d Ms. Di said. \u201cYou could say this place is part of China\u2019s history.\u201dSo, too, were many of those \u201choles in the wall\u201d in the narrow alleyways that survived Beijing\u2019s past building booms. Increasingly coveted for their traditional character, the hutongs attracted boutiques and restaurants, cafes and even American-style brew pubs that catered to an expanding consumer class.When the municipal authorities announced plans for this year\u2019s construction work, they pledged that it would make the city greener, remove safety hazards and, above all, \u201cimprove the people\u2019s sense of achievement.\u201dAnd some people interviewed along the affected streets said it had.The work did more than disrupt the night life, though \u2014 it removed part or all of 33 shops. The prospects for the owners appear gloomy.\u201cI think the move failed to take into account the needs of a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of those owners set up their businesses in a legal manner and had invested a lot of money, but now everything they\u2019ve worked for is gone.\u201dOwen Guo, Zoe Mou, Amy Cheng and Tang Yucheng contributed research.Follow Steven Lee Myers on Twitter and Facebook at @stevenleemyersAdvertisement"}

Quite the opposite.\u201dPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said the deal signified the creation of \u201cthe world\u2019s largest free, advanced, industrialized economic zone.\u201dHere\u2019s what you need to know about the deal:The core of the agreement aims to increase the flow of Japanese cars to Europe and of European food to Japan.The Europeans are expected to scrap a 10 percent tariff on passenger cars made in Japan, over a period of seven years. Duties would come down more rapidly for some car components.Those are key concessions: The Japanese automotive giants Toyota and Honda have claimed a smaller market share in Europe than in other major markets like the United States.Europe could still reimpose restrictions if there was a \u201cvery big increase as compared to normal\u201d of imported Japanese cars, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told reporters later Thursday. She did not say, however, what specific level would cause that kind of reaction.The Japanese, in return, are expected to lower duties on European cheeses like Gouda from the Netherlands, while retaining their unusually complex regulations on dairy products.Tokyo is also likely to make it easier for European companies to bid for major government contracts, a move that could benefit train makers like Siemens of Germany and Alstom of France.Accompanying the trade deal is a separate partnership agreement in which both sides pledge greater cooperation on issues like cybercrime and climate protection.The Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.Ms. Malmstrom responded this week by saying organizations like Greenpeace would be opposed to \u201cany trade agreement,\u201d ostensibly a criticism of the group\u2019s stance against trade liberalization.Even without rules on whales and wood, the deal is the biggest bilateral trade agreement ever struck by the European Union, covering about a quarter of the global economy.Not quite. The biggest issue that has not yet been agreed on is how to ensure that investors have a way to resolve disputes arising as a result of the deal.The Europeans want to employ a court system rather than ad hoc arbitration, which has been used for decades but has been heavily criticized by European lawmakers and environmental groups as being too soft on industry interests.The Japanese, however, argue that existing institutions are enough.Negotiations have been proceeding for years, but were accelerated after Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a wide-ranging trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries that had Japan at its core.The new deal was a clear sign that other parts of the world will continue to pursue a liberalizing trade agenda, even without the United States.European and Japanese officials now expect the talks to be completed within months.In June, the Japanese Parliament passed a law that aims to address some of its dairy industry protections, which may make it easier to wrap up negotiations.The main concern, however, is the ratification process in Europe.What would happen if the Walloons \u2014 or another region or country \u2014 were to balk this time? European officials did not have an answer to that this week.Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia, Battle Between Rosneft and Private Firm Stirs Investment Worries", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Sistema and its owner had for years assiduously steered clear of politics in Russia, hoping to avoid the kind of legal issues that often dog high-profile businesses here. But as it has grown into the country\u2019s largest privately owned conglomerate, it has found itself mired in a multi-billion-dollar legal battle.The dispute between Sistema and Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil company, dates back to a 2014 nationalization, pitting two of the country\u2019s most important companies against each other. The latest twist in their back-and-forth came on Monday, as Sistema warned banks about problems it is having repaying $66 million worth of loans.The conflict between the two companies is another worrying sign for the investment climate in Russia. As the overall economy stagnates amid sanctions and low oil prices, the environment has raised the specter of the country\u2019s elite fighting over a smaller pie, with businesses using courts and law enforcement that are widely seen as vulnerable to corruption to gain an advantage.Sistema and its principal owner, Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, have stayed away from politics \u2014 in one case, the company smoothly navigated the ouster of a former mayor, even though many of its assets are in the city of Moscow, staying aloof from the political struggle. It now employs about 150,000 people, and it says its revenues are equivalent to about 1 percent of Russia\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201cThis conflict is causing a lot of harm to the investment attractiveness of Russia,\u201d Aleksander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis case can create a precedent when any activity in the past can be contested, and property rights put in question, for any company.\u201dThe dispute traces its origins to Sistema\u2019s loss of its Bashneft oil subsidiary in the 2014 nationalization. Sistema had accumulated shares in Bashneft from regional elites, who had in turn acquired it years before from a regional government.At the time of the nationalization, officials asserted that Russia\u2019s federal government had erred in the original transfer of Bashneft to the regional government in 1993, and voided all subsequent transactions. The state property agency then sold a controlling stake in Bashneft to Rosneft.The state energy company is now suing Sistema for mismanaging Bashneft, and stripping it of assets, demanding $3 billion in compensation. Sistema denies the allegations.On Monday, Sistema declared a technical default on 3.9 billion rubles, or about $66 million, in loans. The company said the technical default, a formal notice triggered by its failure to comply with some conditions on part of its debt, had occurred because a court overseeing the case had frozen Sistema assets used as collateral for the loans.The privately owned company said that it would repay the loans, and that it did not anticipate banks demanding early repayment.\u201cThe situation is a direct consequence of the plaintiffs, who must have known that freezing our assets would lead to a technical default,\u201d Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema\u2019s director, said in a statement on Monday.In a statement issued on Monday, Rosneft\u2019s press secretary, Michael Leontiev, suggested Sistema was using the case to mislead creditors. \u201cIf Sistema wants to use a wholly formal process, such as freezing assets, to deceive its creditors, that says a lot about the business style of this company,\u201d he said. At Rosneft\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last month, Igor Sechin, the chief executive, said the lawsuit against Sistema is improving Russia\u2019s investment climate by rooting out poor corporate governance.The conflict has rattled investors, with Sistema shares falling about 3 percent on Monday.The company had been trying to attract international investment into the Russian economy. This year, it carried out an initial public offering for one of its subsidiaries, Detsky Mir, which operates a collection of toy stores. The I.P.O. was the first in Russia since crisis.It has also cast a light on the struggles facing Rosneft, which cannot raise money directly from international banks because it was sanctioned after the conflict in Ukraine. The sanctions ban any long-term lending to the energy company.In an interview last month with RBC, a Russian business newspaper, Mr. Shamolin said the case could be easier to understand, if only there was a political context.Sistema might defend itself, he said, \u201cif there was some sort of logic, that was discussed in the press, that the company had behaved improperly \u2014 by the unwritten rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For China\u2019s Global Ambitions, \u2018Iran Is at the Center of Everything\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEYSHABUR, Iran \u2014 When Zuoru Lin, a Beijing entrepreneur, first heard about business opportunities in eastern Iran, he was skeptical. But then he bought a map and began to envision the region without any borders, as one enormous market.\u201cMany countries are close by, even Europe,\u201d Mr. Lin, 49, said while driving his white BMW over the highway connecting Tehran to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad recently. \u201cIran is at the center of everything.\u201dLike pieces of a sprawling geopolitical puzzle, components of China\u2019s infrastructure network are being put in place. In eastern Iran, Chinese workers are busily modernizing one of the country\u2019s major rail routes, standardizing gauge sizes, improving the track bed and rebuilding bridges, with the ultimate goal of connecting Tehran to Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.Much the same is happening in western Iran, where railroad crews are working to link the capital to Turkey and, eventually, to Europe. Other rail projects will connect Tehran and Mashhad with deepwater ports in the country\u2019s south.Once dependent on Beijing during the years of international isolation imposed by the West for its nuclear program, Iran is now critical to China\u2019s ability to realize its grandiose ambitions. Other routes to Western markets are longer and lead through Russia, potentially a competitor of China.\u201cIt is not as if their project is canceled if we don\u2019t participate,\u201d said Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan, the Iranian deputy minister of roads and urban development. \u201cBut if they want to save time and money, they will choose the shortest route.\u201dHe added with a smile: \u201cThere are also political advantages to Iran, compared to Russia. They are highly interested in working with us.\u201dOthers worry that with the large-scale Chinese investment and China\u2019s growing presence in the Iranian economy, Tehran will become more dependent than ever on China, already its biggest trading partner.China is also an important market for Iranian oil, and because of remaining unilateral American sanctions that intimidate global banks, it is the only source of the large amounts of capital Iran needs to finance critical infrastructure projects. But that, apparently, is a risk the leadership is prepared to take.\u201cChina is dominating Iran,\u201d said Mehdi Taghavi, an economics professor at Allameh Tabataba\u2019i University in Tehran, adding that the \u201cIranian authorities do not see any drawbacks to being dependent on China. Together, we are moving ahead.\u201dIt is not just roads and rail lines that Iran is getting from China. Iran is also becoming an increasingly popular destination for Chinese entrepreneurs like Mr. Lin. With a few words of Persian, as well as low-interest loans and tax breaks from the Chinese and Iranian governments, he has built a small empire since moving to Iran in 2002. His eight factories make a wide variety of goods that find markets in Iran and in neighboring countries.\u201cYou can say that I was even more visionary than some of our politicians,\u201d Mr. Lin said with a laugh. Since 2013, when the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan was started, he has had dozens of visitors from China and multiple meetings with the Chinese ambassador in Tehran. \u201cI was a pioneer, and they want to hear my experiences,\u201d he said.Mr. Lin established his factories along what will be a key part of the trade route \u2014 a 575-mile electrified rail line linking Tehran and Mashhad, financed with a $1.6 billion loan from China. When completed and attached to the wider network, the new line will enable Mr. Lin to export his goods as far as northern Europe, Poland and Russia, at much less cost than today.\u201cI am expecting a 50 percent increase in revenue,\u201d Mr. Lin said. He lit another cigarette. \u201cOf course, Iran\u2019s economy will also grow. China will expand. Its power will grow.\u201dHe played Chinese pop music in his car and tapped his fingers on the wheel. \u201cLife is good in Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future is good.\u201dIranians who spotted Mr. Lin driving between his factories waved and smiled. Having mastered a few basic phrases in Persian over the years, he said \u201chi\u201d and \u201cgoodbye\u201d to some of his 2,000 employees. Iranians are hard workers, he said, but he does not like their food. \u201cWe grow our own vegetables and eat Chinese food,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like home.\u201dEven when the boss was out of earshot, workers in his factories said that they were very happy with the Chinese. \u201cThey pay every month on time and only hire people instead of fire them,\u201d Amir Dalilian, a guard, said. \u201cIf more will come, our economy will flourish.\u201dWhen finished, the proposed rail link will stretch nearly 2,000 miles, from Urumqi, the capital of China\u2019s western region of Xinjiang, to Tehran. If all goes according to plan, it will connect Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, China\u2019s state-owned paper, China Daily, wrote. Track sizes need to be adjusted and new connections made, as well as upgrades to the newest trains.In a 2016 test, China and Iran drove a train from the port of Shanghai in eastern China to Tehran in just 12 days, a journey that takes 30 days by sea. In Iran, they used the existing track between Tehran and Mashhad, powered by a slower diesel-powered train. When the new line is opened in 2021, it is expected to accommodate electric trains at speeds up to 125 miles an hour.Mr. Fakhrieh-Kashan, an English speaker who oversees negotiation of most of the larger international state business deals, said the Chinese initiative would do much more than just provide a channel for transporting goods. \u201cThink infrastructure, city planning, cultural exchanges, commercial agreements, investments and tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can pick any project, they are all under this umbrella.\u201dBusiness ties between Iran and China have been growing since the United States and its European allies at the time started pressuring Iran over its nuclear program around 2007. China remains the largest buyer of Iranian crude, even after Western sanctions were lifted in 2016, allowing Iran to again sell oil in European markets.Chinese state companies are active all over the country, building highways, digging mines and making steel. Tehran\u2019s shops are flooded with Chinese products and its streets clogged with Chinese cars.Iran\u2019s leaders hope that the country\u2019s participation in the plan will enable them to piggyback on China\u2019s large economic ambitions.\u201cThe Chinese plan is designed in such a way that it will establish Chinese hegemony across half of the world,\u201d Mr. Fakhrieh-Kashan said. \u201cWhile Iran will put its own interests first, we are creating corridors at the requests of the Chinese. It will give us huge access to new markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hot Spot for Tech Outsourcing: The United States", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "Supported byFor years, American companies have been saving money by \u201coffshoring\u201d jobs \u2014 hiring people in India and other distant cubicle farms.Today, some of those jobs are being outsourced again \u2014 in the United States.Nexient, a software outsourcing company, reflects the evolving geography of technology work. It holds daily video meetings with one of its clients, Bill.com, where team members stand up and say into the camera what they accomplished yesterday for Bill.com, and what they plan to do tomorrow. The difference is, they are phoning in from Michigan, not Mumbai.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been happy outsourcing,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Lacerte, the chief executive of Bill.com, a bill payment-and-collection service based in Palo Alto, Calif.Nexient is a domestic outsourcer, a flourishing niche in the tech world as some American companies pull back from the idea of hiring programmers a world away.Salaries have risen in places like South Asia, making outsourcing there less of a bargain. In addition, as brands pour energy and money into their websites and mobile apps, more of them are deciding that there is value in having developers in the same time zone, or at least on the same continent.Many of these domestic outsourcers are private, little-known companies like Rural Sourcing, Catalyte, Eagle Creek Software Services and Onshore Outsourcing. But IBM, one of the country\u2019s foremost champions of the offshore outsourcing model, has announced plans to hire 25,000 more workers in the United States over the next four years.As a result, the growth of offshore software work is slowing, to nearly half the pace of recent years.\u201cThe nature of work is changing,\u201d said Vishal Sikka, chief executive of Infosys, an Indian outsourcing giant. \u201cIt is very local. And you often need whole teams locally,\u201d a departure from the offshore formula of having a project manager on-site but the work done abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have people offshore in India,\u201d he added.Infosys announced in May that it planned to hire 10,000 workers in the United States over the next two years, starting with centers in Indiana and North Carolina.The offshore industry is not imperiled, analysts say. But from 2016 to 2021, the offshore services industry will have average yearly growth of 8 percent, the research firm IDC estimated. The rate in the previous five years was 15 percent.\u201cDomestic sourcing is here to stay, and it\u2019s going to grow rapidly,\u201d said Helen Huntley, an analyst at the research firm Gartner.The first wave of internet-era digital change in business, starting in the 1990s, focused mainly on automating back-office tasks like payrolls and financial reporting. The software involved was a collection of huge programs maintained by armies of engineers.The internet allowed that work to be sent to low-wage nations, especially India. That brought the rise of the big outsourcing companies like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys.Offshore services companies still excel at maintaining the software that runs the essential back-office systems of corporations. But today, companies in every industry need mobile apps and appealing websites, which can be made smarter with data and constantly updated. That software is best created by small, nimble teams, working closely with businesses and customers \u2014 not shipped to programmers half a world away.Nexient, which has its headquarters in Newark, Calif., has three delivery centers in the Midwest: in Ann Arbor, Mich.; Okemos, Mich.; and Kokomo, Ind. It employs 400 people, up from 250 two years ago, and plans to hire a few hundred more over the next year, Mark Orttung, the company\u2019s chief executive, said.The company\u2019s business model is fairly typical for onshore companies. On projects, it will send members of a team to the client for a couple of weeks to study the business and meet their counterparts. Bill.com even interviewed and shared in the selection of five Nexient engineers who would work on the joint team.Mr. Lacerte of Bill.com had farmed out technology work over the years, but the headaches of navigating time zones, cultures and language often outweighed the cost savings. Those problems went away when he hired a domestic outsourcer.Nexient has set up its centers away from the coastal high-tech hubs, like the Bay Area and New York, to tap skilled people who want jobs in the technology economy without leaving the Midwest, where living costs are far less.Monty Hamilton, a former Accenture consultant, took over Rural Sourcing in 2009, when it had just a dozen employees. Today, the company has 300 workers in four delivery centers: in Albuquerque; Augusta, Ga.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Mobile, Ala. The payroll will reach about 400 people by the end of the year, Mr. Hamilton said.\u201cEvery business now realizes it\u2019s a digital business,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need technical help, and that\u2019s really driven the demand for our U.S.-based talent.\u201dPolitics seem to be playing a role, too. The American onshore companies say they are seeing a postelection spike in client inquiries, as President Trump lobbies businesses to create more jobs in the United States and seeks to curb immigrant work visas.\u201cThe election has brought a lot of attention to these issues and to us,\u201d Mr. Orttung said. \u201cBut nobody buys because of that.\u201dRising labor costs abroad also make domestic sourcing more attractive. A decade ago, Mr. Hamilton said, an American software developer cost five to seven times as much as an Indian developer. Now, he estimates, the gap has shrunk to two times. The standard billing rate for his engineers is $60 to $70 an hour, compared with $30 to $35 in India, Mr. Hamilton said.But the sales pitch made by onshore companies is not about raw labor costs. Instead, they claim the ability to deliver excellent work more efficiently than the offshore providers and less expensively than large technology services companies.Cambia Health Solutions, which has its headquarters in Portland, Ore., is a health insurer with two million members. In recent years, it has moved beyond insurance to provide consumers with online tools to shop for doctors and specialists, for example, and to sort through drug options based on effectiveness, prices and user reviews.In the past two years, Cambia Health has cut its use of an offshore outsourcer in India by half, said Laurent Rotival, the company\u2019s chief information officer. And the insurer has enlisted the help of Catalyte, an onshore outsourcer. \u201cThey can ramp up quickly,\u201d Mr. Rotival said.Catalyte, based in Baltimore, has doubled its work force in the last two years, to 300 people. To accommodate rapid growth, Catalyte is scouting locations for two new centers, which the company hopes to open by the end of this year, said Michael Rosenbaum, founder of Catalyte.Training is a vital capability for all the onshore companies, but few have gone as far as the Techtonic Group in Boulder, Colo. Once a committed offshore outsourcer, Techtonic has made nurturing homegrown talent the centerpiece of its business. In 2014, it set up a training academy that feeds graduates into its Department of Labor-approved apprenticeship program for software engineers.In the past couple of years, 30 people have gone through the program, which lasts six to nine months. Techtonic has hired 90 percent of the graduates, and many later became employees of its corporate customers, starting at salaries between $65,000 and $75,000.Techtonic has an ambitious expansion plan, going to 10 new cities in the next three years and hiring 100 developers in each city, said Heather Terenzio, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cAmerican industry has relied too much on overseas technology workers and neglected the potential talent here,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wider U.S. Sanctions on Venezuela Risk Biting Both Countries", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The United States and Venezuela are on a collision course as President Trump promises to inflict economic pain if President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro goes through with an election intended to enhance his powers.Mr. Maduro has pledged not to back down from the vote on Sunday, so the only question is whether the collision will be a fender-bender or a thundering crash.The two countries\u2019 economies are tightly intertwined through the oil that Venezuela sells to the United States: It accounts for roughly 10 percent of the oil America imports. And Washington has powerful tools at its disposal, including a complete prohibition on Venezuelan oil.Whatever Mr. Trump decides to do next is likely to echo, from the Venezuelan Treasury to the American gasoline pump.Despite nearly two decades of sour relations with Venezuela, the United States has enormous leverage as one of its most important customers and as one the few countries with refineries capable of processing poor-quality heavy crude.The result could be more violent strife or even a military coup. And shock waves across the hemisphere could create more complications for the Trump administration as it tries to focus on Iran and North Korea.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was a top State Department energy envoy in the Obama administration.\u201cTough sanctions could lead to a default on their bonds and a collapse of internal investment and oil production,\u201d he added. \u201cOther impacts could include civil unrest, refugee flows across their borders, and a cutoff of Venezuelan financial support to Cuba and Haiti that could lead to migration flows to the United States.\u201dThere is also the potential for collateral damage to the United States.Any trade embargo could raise gasoline prices, cost jobs in the oil patch and dampen profits for several major refiners. A decrease in Venezuelan exports could raise global oil prices, bolstering the economies of Russia and Iran just as Washington prepares to ratchet up sanctions on those countries.In briefings, administration officials would not speculate on what would come next, but they emphasized a menu of options. Mr. Trump, in a statement last week, said \u201cthe United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\u201dThe immediate concern is over Mr. Maduro\u2019s plan to hold an election this weekend for a Constituent Assembly that would circumvent the opposition-controlled Congress and write a new constitution. The new assembly, which is devised to be dominated by groups that support the regime, would presumably consolidate more control in the hands of the president.The escalating street violence and hunger in Venezuela are threatening to spread. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have already fled the country, heightening social pressures. The country\u2019s plummeting economy has added pressure on a region struggling with low commodity prices.For now, the United States is treading cautiously in its approach to Venezuela.Mr. Maduro has repeatedly said that Mr. Trump\u2019s past sanctions against his government are evidence of American imperialism and that current threats will not be heeded. If Mr. Trump \u201chas dared to say \u2018no\u2019 to the Constituent Assembly, we tell him \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 \u2014 the Constituent Assembly will go ahead \u2014 Constituent Assembly now more than ever,\u201d Mr. Maduro said recently.More consequential would be future sanctions to limit American oil companies and service companies from operating in Venezuela or to limit the ability of the Venezuelan national oil company to engage in banking activities in the United States or trade with American companies. That scenario would effectively end Venezuelan oil exports to the United States and prohibit Pdvsa from importing the American light oil used to dilute its heavy crude for transport through pipelines and processing.Such moves, at least in the short term, could result in a collapse in production of the oil that Venezuela depends on to get the foreign currency it needs to buy food and to service its debt.\u201cIt will put Pdvsa on its knees and almost certainly lead to default,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston.Depending on the details of future sanctions, Citgo, wholly owned by the Venezuelan state oil company, could also be crippled. Citgo operates roughly 4 percent of American refining capacity as well as a sprawling network of pipelines and gasoline stations in the United States.Venezuela now sells more than 700,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States, out of a total production of roughly two million barrels a day, or just over 2 percent of world production. Energy experts say Venezuela could eventually replace the American market, by exporting more heavy oil to China and India, though at a discount. And the 100,000 barrels a day of light oil it imports from the United States could be replaced by imports from Nigeria and Algeria.Venezuela would have to move quickly. It faces big bond payments later this year, and its foreign reserves are dwindling.\u201cThey have shown that they can get along, so I\u2019m not sure suspending the purchasing of 700,000 barrels will crack the government,\u201d said Luis E. Giusti, a former Pdvsa chief executive. \u201cHow much more things will deteriorate compared to what is happening now is a big question that doesn\u2019t have a straightforward answer.\u201dIn the United States, a cutoff of Venezuelan oil imports would force Chevron, Valero Energy, Phillips 66 and other refiners to replace the heavy crude with imports from places like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, producing higher tanker costs. The administration could sell the refiners supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve to help cushion the blow to their profit margins.\u201cIn the short term it\u2019s going to be very disruptive,\u201d said Chet M. Thompson, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade group that has been lobbying against sanctions that would disrupt Venezuelan oil imports. \u201cYou are going to end up driving fuel prices up.\u201dNicholas Casey contributed reporting from Lima, Peru.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump and Putin, Sanctions Are a Setback Both Sought to Avoid", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Throughout 2016, both Donald J. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin complained that American-led sanctions against Russia were the biggest irritant in the plummeting relations between the two superpowers. And the current investigations, which have cast a shadow over Mr. Trump\u2019s first six months in office, have focused on whether a series of contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle and Russians were partly about constructing deals to get those penalties lifted.How that happened is a story of two global leaders overplaying their hands.Mr. Putin is beginning to pay a price for what John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, described last week as the Russian president\u2019s fateful decision last summer to try to use stolen computer data to support Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. For his part, Mr. Trump ignited the movement in Congress by repeatedly casting doubt on that intelligence finding, then fueled it by confirming revelation after revelation about previously denied contacts between his inner circle and a parade of Russians.If approved by Congress this week, Mr. Trump has little choice, his aides acknowledge, but to sign the toughened sanctions legislation that he desperately wanted to see defeated.Just days ago, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and other top officials were lobbying fiercely to preserve Mr. Trump\u2019s right to waive Russia sanctions with a stroke of the pen \u2014 just as President Barack Obama was able to do when, in negotiations with Iran, he dangled the relaxation of sanctions to coax Tehran to agree to sharp, decade-long limits on its nuclear activity.As one of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides pointed out last week, there is a long history of granting presidents that negotiating leverage when dealing with foreign adversaries.But by constantly casting doubt on intelligence that the Kremlin was behind an effort to manipulate last year\u2019s presidential election, Mr. Trump so unnerved members of his own party that even they saw a need to curb his ability to lift those sanctions unilaterally.On Sunday, Mr. Trump\u2019s new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, repeated the White House position that Mr. Trump remains unconvinced by the evidence Russia was the culprit behind the election hacking. He said that when the subject comes up, Mr. Trump cannot separate the intelligence findings from his emotional sense that the issue is being used to cast doubt on his legitimacy as president.\u201cIt actually in his mind, what are you guys suggesting?\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to delegitimize his victory?\u201dIf so, Mr. Trump is the only one with access to the best intelligence on the issue who still harbors those doubts.Last week at the Aspen Security Forum, four of his top intelligence and national security officials \u2014 including Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director \u2014 said they were absolutely convinced that the Russians were behind the effort to influence the election.\u201cThere is no dissent,\u201d Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said on Friday at the Aspen conference. The Russians, he said, \u201ccaught us just a little bit asleep in terms of capabilities\u201d the Kremlin could bring to bear to influence elections here, in France and Germany. The Russians\u2019 goal was clear, he said: \u201cThey are trying to undermine Western democracy.\u201dAnd on Sunday, Mr. Trump made it clear again that regardless of statements by Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Coats, the entire issue is a political concoction.Mr. Putin\u2019s decision sometime early last summer appears to have been to turn a familiar Russian surveillance operation of the American political campaign into \u201cactive measures,\u201d releasing information that Russia hoped would harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. It succeeded in its immediate goal, disrupting the election and casting doubt on the integrity of the American voting process.But with the new sanctions, it now also appears to have set back his long-term strategy: to get out from under a sanctions regime that, along with low oil prices, has stunted his country\u2019s economy.Russia has stumbled along at barely 1 percent growth, and the new sanctions, while hardly draconian, will not ease its pain.Chris Weafer, a senior partner at Macro-Advisory, which works with international investors on Russia, said the new American sanctions legislation was \u201cmuch weaker\u201d than originally proposed and raised no new serious hurdles for the Russian economy. But he added that it would further damage perceptions of Russia\u2019s prospects and curb badly needed Western investment by \u201creminding investors about Russia risk\u201d and by prompting countersanctions by Moscow.\u201cIf this legislation is passed, you can definitely expect a Russian reaction,\u201d he said.Whether Russia can easily ride out a new round of sanctions is far from certain, especially at a time when companies and banks that racked up debts in the West before 2014 are now facing payment deadlines that will become increasingly difficult to meet because of credit restrictions on Russian entities under sanctions.The proposed new measures could also expand the number of Russian companies that are affected by credit and other restrictions. They bar American entities from doing business with any company in which a Russian individual or company under a previous sanction owns more than a 33 percent stake. This could make Western banks far more wary of lending money to Russian companies in general as the exact ownership of many of these is often unclear.And then there is the provision calling for Mr. Trump to ban American investments of more than $10 million in Russian privatization efforts. That could put a damper on an already stalled drive by Russia to raise money by selling off some of its assets.Another Russian project that could suffer is Nord Stream 2, a new pipeline that would significantly increase the amount of Russian natural gas delivered to Germany and other parts of Europe. Russian state television dismissed any American moves against Nord Stream as a transparent attempt to boost the sale of American liquefied natural gas to Europe at the expense of Russian energy sales.It will be a year or more before the effects of the new sanctions will be clear \u2014 and by then, there may well be new turns in the relationship with Moscow.But this much is clear: The rapprochement that Mr. Trump talked about on the campaign trail is now further away than it was a year ago this month, when Mr. Trump first called on Russia, jokingly he insisted later, to hack into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email account and publish whatever it found.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruling Threatens Hong Kong\u2019s Independence From China", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cVoters entrusted us with the task of monitoring the government,\u201d said Leung Kwok-hung, one of those unseated. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost that power.\u201dSince 1997, China\u2019s economy has become less dependent on Hong Kong, while the territory\u2019s prosperity has become more entangled with the mainland. As the political and economic power imbalance grows, and Hong Kong is drawn tighter into China\u2019s orbit, Beijing\u2019s leaders are less willing to offer Hong Kong the same degree of deference they once showed it.But through it all, people in Hong Kong have been comforted by the fact that the city has its own legal system \u2014 based on British common law, unlike China\u2019s \u2014 that is proudly independent. That legal system remains robust, and it is one reason investment flows to Hong Kong. But Friday\u2019s ruling will deepen worries that Chinese influence is weakening judicial protections.Since pro-democracy protesters occupied major streets in Hong Kong for months in 2014 \u2014 a movement that came to be known as the Umbrella Revolution \u2014 Mr. Xi\u2019s government has sought to strengthen its grip on the city. But the democratic lawmakers held enough seats in the legislature to frustrate the city\u2019s pro-Beijing administration with filibustering and veto power over bills introduced by pro-Beijing lawmakers.The court ruling was \u201ca disturbing and ominous development,\u201d said Willy Lam, a political analyst and adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Like many critics of the decision, he suggested that the judge had bent over backward to create a decision pleasing to Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s a direct interference in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, a breach of both its judicial independence and separation of powers,\u201d Mr. Lam said.The ruling could galvanize opposition groups in Hong Kong. On Friday night, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Legislative Council, a concrete and glass edifice near Victoria Harbor, to denounce the decision.But for now, Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy parties have been forced into retreat after a buoyant showing in local elections last year, and some of the lawmakers who were removed may privately rue turning their oath-taking into protests.Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty from British rule in 1997. Under terms agreed upon by London and Beijing, Hong Kong retained its own legal system, as well as the Legislative Council.When their protest movement in 2014 failed to bring about freer local elections, Hong Kong\u2019s democracy campaigners set their sights on maintaining enough members in the council to thwart policies they saw as weakening the city\u2019s separate status.The voters did not disappoint. In September, people turned up at polling stations in record numbers, electing many of the protesters who led rallies and spent nights in tents.It was a triumphant moment for the activists, and the message was clear: Hong Kong people reject Chinese encroachment on their city\u2019s freedoms. The next month, in the grand chamber of the Legislative Council, the newly elected legislators took the oath of office.That\u2019s when the troubles began.It did so by issuing a legal interpretation of the Basic Law, the charter ensuring that Hong Kong is governed according to a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle and that the judiciary remains independent for at least half a century from when the city returned to Chinese rule. The interpretation orders that legislators who deliver an oath in an \u201cinsincere or undignified manner\u201d must be barred from office and not be given a chance to do it again.The purge continued on Friday. The court removed the four additional legislators based on the interpretation and precedent set in the removal of Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, arguing that they, too, had failed to take the oath properly.The removed legislators include Nathan Law, a leader of the 2014 protests who later founded the party Demosisto with fellow protester Joshua Wong.\u201cIt\u2019s flagrant political suppression by the government,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cI had read the oath completely, and the Legislative Council approved it. It only became an issue after Beijing\u2019s interpretation.\u201dMr. Law, 24, had begun his oath saying he would \u201cnever serve a regime that murders its own people\u201d and read the Cantonese word for \u201cChina\u201d with an upward inflection, as if asking a question. He was the youngest person ever to win a legislative seat.\u201cBy adopting a rising intonation, Mr. Law was objectively expressing a doubt on or disrespect of the status of the People\u2019s Republic of China as Hong Kong\u2019s legitimate sovereign country,\u201d the judgment said.The three other legislators who were unseated, Leung Kwok-hung, Lau Siu-lai and Edward Yiu, had delivered their oaths with various displays of defiance, including by reading extremely slowly, inserting words calling for democracy and displaying props. Likewise, their oaths were declared invalid by the court, and they have been asked to pack up in two weeks.The four disqualified legislators may not be the last to be removed, since at least four other pro-democracy legislators used props or made defiant speeches before or after delivering the oath of office.\u201cThey played with fire and got burned,\u201d said Priscilla Leung, vice chairwoman of the pro-Beijing party Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong.Ms. Leung told reporters she might introduce a bill to amend legislative rules to prevent filibustering by opposition legislators, though she declined to offer a timeline. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing that since I entered the Legislative Council in 2008, but we hadn\u2019t had enough votes.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Delicious World of Bruno, Chief of Police", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Pour15 PhotosLE BUGUE, France \u2014 As the police chief of the sleepy fictional town of St.-Denis in the P\u00e9rigord region of southwestern France, Bruno Courr\u00e8ges has battled murderers and arsonists, truffle fraud and archaeological vandalism, drug pushers and terrorists.Not surprisingly, given the priorities here, where the St.-Denis tennis club is tricked out with a well-appointed kitchen \u201csince no communal activity could take place without there being food and wine involved,\u201d many of the battles between local tradition and globalization play out over issues of gastronomy.Bruno grows vegetables and keeps chickens. He hunts black truffles and small birds. And he cooks well, rustic yet aristocratic fare like terrines, fish soups, veal stews and roasted chickens. A ham hangs in his kitchen, and while he loves a glass of good wine, he is mostly content with the local stuff sold out of a tank by Hubert, his local wine merchant.I have been especially intrigued by Bruno\u2019s world because the P\u00e9rigord, where duck fat is a way of life, is a backwater for wine, even if it is just an hour inland from Bordeaux.I paid a visit to Mr. Walker, 70, in late spring. When he is not in London or Washington, he lives with his wife, Julia Watson, in a small town, Le Bugue, which straddles the V\u00e9z\u00e8re river and serves as a model for the fictional St.-Denis.He spent almost three decades writing for The Guardian and served as bureau chief in Moscow and Washington. It was while living in Moscow in the mid-1980s that he and his wife discovered this corner of France.\u201cDear friends had moved there, and we would visit every year,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when we were in Moscow, to be able to eat the food of the P\u00e9rigord was pretty good.\u201dIn 1998, they bought their own place, an old farmhouse, barn and pigeon tower on a quiet country lane, and quickly adapted to the rhythms and flavors of P\u00e9rigordin life. Though it\u2019s an area rich in the pleasures of the table, the region is among the poorest in the country by certain socio-economic standards.\u201cBut it\u2019s the highest quality of life,\u201d Mr. Walker said over an evening aperitif, served with a rough country p\u00e2t\u00e9 and bread in his yard. \u201cIt\u2019s the gastronomic heartland of France. The food just goes back and forth, and it\u2019s a very nice way to live. Bartering fosters community.\u201dGetting into the spirit, Mr. Walker and Ms. Watson planted a potagerie, the garden of vegetables and herbs that is essential to French country life, and acquired a flock of hens, presided over by a rooster named Sarkozy.As one would expect from a rooster, Sarkozy can be loud and blustery. Still his presence is a problem in other ways.The couple cannot sell their eggs at the market in Le Bugue, which will celebrate its 700th anniversary in 2019, because European Union regulations prohibit a rooster from living with the egg-laying chickens. So they have entered the barter economy themselves.\u201cWe\u2019re all in the underground,\u201d Ms. Watson said. \u201cNot fighting the Nazis, just all the silly laws.\u201dThe European Union and its rules are a sore subject for residents of the region, who often see new regulations, no matter how well intentioned, as intrusions on a time-honored way of life. Pig butchering, sausage making, cattle farming, cheese production and the traveling still, which circulated the countryside on the back of a bicycle, are among the traditions that have been altered by rules intended to safeguard the health and well-being of the citizens.\u201cWhen we bought our house 20 years ago, the main industry was farming,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cNow it\u2019s tourism.\u201dThe British have always been drawn to this part of France, which they ruled until ejected from France at the conclusion of the Hundred Years\u2019 War in the 15th century. The international success of the Bruno series has also contributed to P\u00e9rigord\u2019s allure as a tourist destination.Mr. Walker and Ms. Watson had just welcomed a busload from Florida who wanted to see where Bruno had pulled a body from the river in \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Cave,\u201d the sawmill opposed by the Greens in \u201cBlack Diamond,\u201d and the cafe where Bruno gets his croissants (every morning in every book). The books do especially well in Germany, and a constant procession of German Bruno fans passes through Le Bugue and the neighboring towns.\u201cThe P\u00e9rigord without Bruno is not the P\u00e9rigord,\u201d said Raymond Bounichou, a former intelligence officer and gendarme who lives down the road from Mr. Walker.Tourism comes with a cultural cost. Three supermarkets, catering largely to tourists, now compete with the local march\u00e9, which appears Tuesdays and Saturdays. Le Bugue is served by five bakeries, each with its own following, though the tourists seem to prefer what Mr. Walker described as \u201chorrible sandwiches in plastic triangles.\u201d\u201cEvery time I see one my soul shrivels up,\u201d he said.As much as he is enamored of the food and wine, Mr. Walker is at heart a historian and storyteller who is drawn to the P\u00e9rigord by its layered, copious history. Aside from its prehistoric residents, the region \u2014 dotted with castles, chateaus and fortifications \u2014 has been a center of conflict for centuries. The Moors came around the year 600 and stayed until 750. The Vikings arrived next. \u201cThen came the real curse, the English,\u201d Mr. Walker said.The legacies of the French Revolution, of World War II, of Indochina and the Algerian conflict still run deep, and age-old conflicts are seared in local memory. Numerous plaques commemorate French citizens killed by the Nazis.History also partly explains why the wines of Bergerac, made from a similar set of grapes as Bordeaux\u2019s wines, are so little known compared with their coastal siblings. Aside from Bordeaux\u2019s longtime advantage controlling the port and placing duties on Bergerac wines, Bergerac\u2019s woes are partly self-inflicted.Rather than replanting after phylloxera, the ravenous aphid that destroyed much of Europe\u2019s grapevines in the late 19th century, the local government had a better idea, Mr. Walker said.\u201cRadical socialists in power pushed tobacco as the new wonder crop,\u201d he said. \u201cThe black tobacco of Gauloises was grown around here.\u201dNowadays, many of the growers in Bergerac sell their grapes to the local cooperatives, which make cheap wines sold in supermarkets. Mr. Walker makes it a practice to visit some of the better winemakers in the region, often accompanied by his friend Mr. Bounichou.\u201cIt\u2019s a deep pleasure knowing the guy who made the wine, to hear them talk about it,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThe look of pride as they pour the wine, I adore that.\u201dSadly, of these producers, only Tiregand is sold in the United States, and only in the Chicago area.\u201cThe image of Bergerac is not great,\u201d said Caro Feely, who has documented her family\u2019s experiences running Ch\u00e2teau Feely in the books \u201cGrape Expectations\u201d and \u201cSaving Our Skins.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re better off selling it as organic, biodynamic Vin de France than using the appellation.\u201dWhile tradition reigns supreme here, the region is not an insular, unwelcoming place. At a big Sunday market in the nearby town of St.-Cyprien, where Mr. Walker waved to the butcher and said hello to his friend St\u00e8phane, a cheesemaker and neighbor who is also the basis for a character in the Bruno books, most of the vendors sold the local specialties. But Japanese temaki, pad Thai and goods from Burundi and Morocco could also be found.Mr. Walker describes himself as \u201ca welcome stranger\u201d in the community, though his adaptation seems complete. He makes vin de noix, a local liqueur made from green walnuts. He takes part in a cassoulet competition that pits the P\u00e9rigord against Toulouse: \u201cWe maintain it has to have a stuffed duck neck; they think it\u2019s all about sausages.\u201d And he relishes recounting a bit of farm wisdom for determining whether a calf can offer real milk-fed veal (which involves probing the rearward orifice).In between planning meals and visiting vineyards, Mr. Walker, like Bruno, takes care of business, retreating to his office in the pigeon tower, where he does most of his writing \u2014 at least 1,000 words a day.\u201cIt\u2019s the classic journalist\u2019s dream,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Company Behind Many Surprise Emergency Room Bills", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthEarly last year, executives at a small hospital an hour north of Spokane, Wash., started using a company called EmCare to staff and run their emergency room. The hospital had been struggling to find doctors to work in its E.R., and turning to EmCare was something hundreds of other hospitals across the country had done.That\u2019s when the trouble began.Before EmCare, about 6 percent of patient visits in the hospital\u2019s emergency room were billed for the most complex, expensive level of care. After EmCare arrived, nearly 28 percent got the highest-level billing code.On top of that, the hospital, Newport Hospital and Health Services, was getting calls from confused patients who had received surprisingly large bills from the emergency room doctors. Although the hospital had negotiated rates for its fees with many major health insurers, the EmCare physicians were not part of those networks and were sending high bills directly to the patients. For a patient needing care with the highest-level billing code, the hospital\u2019s previous physicians had been charging $467; EmCare\u2019s charged $1,649.\u201cThe billing scenario, that was the real fiasco and caught us off guard,\u201d said Tom Wilbur, the chief executive of Newport Hospital. \u201cHindsight being 20/20, we never would have done that.\u201d Faced with angry patients, the hospital took back control of its coding and billing.\u201cIt almost looked like a light switch was being flipped on,\u201d said Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale who is one of the study\u2019s authors.EmCare said that it allowed hospitals to treat sicker patients when it takes over, and that an increase in such patients explained the higher billing in Newport.Fiona Scott Morton, a professor at the Yale School of Management and a co-author of the paper, described the strategy as a \u201ckind of ambushing of patients.\u201d A patient who goes to the emergency room can look for a hospital that takes her insurance, but she almost never gets to choose the doctor who treats her.Sometimes, insurers simply pay higher out-of-network bills, but the cost is often passed on directly to patients.After slipping on some wet leaves outside her house in Crescent City, Calif., in February, Debra Brown, a 60-year-old county accounting clerk, wound up at Sutter Coast Hospital. She is paying off her deductible, but her insurer covered most of her remaining hospital bill. She was shocked to get an additional bill from a doctor who she said never identified himself and only briefly touched her broken ankle. That physician worked for EmCare. Her portion of the bill is more than $500.\u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to pay this bill off, and I can\u2019t afford to see a doctor about my high blood pressure medication,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cThis is insane, and it\u2019s greedy.\u201dWhen emergency room doctors work for a company that has not made a deal with an insurer, they are free to bill whatever they want, insurers say. \u201cThe more they bill, the more they get paid,\u201d said Shara McClure, an executive with Blue Cross of Texas.E.R. doctors say out-of-network billing isn\u2019t their fault. Sometimes, insurance companies will offer only low payments, leaving physicians no choice, said William Jaquis, an executive with the American College of Emergency Physicians, who is also an E.R. physician employed by EmCare. Doctors would \u201cprefer that we had better payment and better negotiation with the insurers, and the patients would be covered,\u201d he said.The researchers focused on 16 hospitals that EmCare entered between 2011 and 2015. In eight of those hospitals, out-of-network billing rose quickly and precipitously. (In the others, the out-of-network rate was already above 97 percent, and it did not go down.) They also looked at a larger sample of 194 hospitals where EmCare worked and found an average out-of-network billing rate of 62 percent, far higher than the national average.The before-and-after analysis was limited to the small number of hospitals where the researchers could find public records of EmCare\u2019s entrance, and it was based on claims from only one large insurance company. While the nationwide patterns are consistent with studies that have looked at other insurance companies, the single insurer in the study may not be typical in all cases: EmCare does participate in some insurers\u2019 networks, such as Blue Cross of Texas. EmCare also says it has reached agreements with more insurers in Texas, Arizona, Florida and Virginia since 2015.Researchers also examined what happened when one of EmCare\u2019s top competitors \u2014 TeamHealth \u2014 took over a handful of mostly nonprofit emergency departments. There, they found a smaller increase in out-of-network billing and virtually no change in hospital admissions, testing or coding.Analysts point out that hospitals, despite any patient complaints, can benefit financially from the increased testing and admissions EmCare has delivered. In the study, surprise bills were more common at for-profit hospitals than at their nonprofit competitors.\u201cThey\u2019d have to have their heads in the sand to be totally unaware\u201d about the out-of-network billing, said Leemore Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School, who reviewed the research.EmCare\u2019s emergency room management has come under scrutiny before. The company was named in a 2011 whistle-blower lawsuit against Health Management Associates, a for-profit hospital chain. The suit alleges that both EmCare and the hospitals pressured E.R. doctors to increase admissions and tests, even when the physicians believed they were not medically necessary. The company \u201crepeatedly terminated physicians and E.R. medical directors\u201d who pushed back, the suit says. The case, which was brought by a hospital chief executive and a former EmCare executive, is still pending. Envision said it does not comment on pending litigation.As in so many other parts of the modern economy, turning operations over to large outside contractors has been a big part of the transition. Nearly a quarter of all emergency room doctors now work for a national staffing firm, according to a 2013 Deutsche Bank report.EmCare in particular has thrived. Founded in the 1970s, it has grown rapidly in recent years.Some doctors say the staffing companies save them from the administrative headaches of billing and scheduling.In addition to its work in emergency rooms, EmCare has been buying up groups of anesthesiologists and radiologists. In these hospital specialties, it is hard for patients to shop, and out-of-network billing is common.EmCare\u2019s size and reach have made some doctors wary of criticizing its practices. According to Dr. Carol Cunningham, an emergency room physician in Ohio, that is especially true in places where there is little alternative to working for a large staffing company. \u201cYou may have trouble finding something in the area,\u201d she said.But some doctors outside the E.R. have been less reticent. Dr. Gregory Duncan, chief of surgery at Sutter Coast Hospital in Crescent City, Calif., said patients started complaining about bills they received after EmCare took over the emergency room in 2015.\u201cI discovered a pattern of inflated bills and out-of-network bills,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are doing is egregious billing.\u201dDr. Duncan, who also sits on the county health care district board, has joined with other elected officials in asking Sutter Coast to terminate its contract with EmCare.In an emailed response, Mitch Hanna, the chief executive of Sutter Coast, said the hospital chose EmCare because of its ability to fully staff its emergency department. He added that he understood EmCare was working to bring two large commercial insurers into its network by the end of the year.EmCare said in early February that it planned to reach agreements with insurers for most of its doctors. The company also said it was working with insurers, hospitals, lawmakers and others to make sure patients get appropriate care \u201cwithout creating undue financial burden.\u201d The American College of Emergency Physicians favors an approach in which out-of-network emergency room doctors are paid a standard rate.California recently passed a law setting a maximum amount that out-of-network doctors can charge patients. Other states, including Florida and New York, have also passed laws to limit surprise bills.But many state efforts to reduce surprise billing have been met by fierce lobbying from doctors who oppose efforts to weaken their bargaining position, said Chuck Bell, the programs director at the consumer advocacy group Consumers Union.\u201cThe whole thing is really a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cProgress is really slow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When You\u2019re Traveling With Trump, Be Ready for the Unexpected", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy first indication that a foreign trip with President Trump would be a touch different from traveling with other presidents (I accompanied President Barack Obama through seven countries) came during a late-afternoon run through the historic part of Warsaw as I awaited his arrival on Air Force One before the two-day G-20 summit last week.Usually, overseas presidential trips are elaborately choreographed affairs weeks or months in the making, with pre-baked schedules to match. But that afternoon, just five hours before Mr. Trump disembarked, I finally received an email from the White House informing me of his schedule \u2014 and my own \u2014 for the next day. It was the latest I could ever recall getting such information.But the Trump White House eschews many of the protocols and procedures that usually surround a president, and advance warning for the press about Mr. Trump\u2019s movements and plans can be difficult to come by. For instance, there was a mention of a \u201cnews event\u201d with President Andrzej Duda of Poland, but it would not become clear until the next morning whether Mr. Trump planned to take any questions.Such uncertainty is standard in countries that lack a free press \u2014 I had a similar experience last year with Mr. Obama during his trip to Cuba, when even the White House did not know until it was underway whether President Ra\u00fal Castro would permit a question-and-answer period \u2014 but unusual for a democratic nation such as Poland.Mr. Trump\u2019s second foreign trip did bear some of the hallmarks of past presidential travels, however: He moved through the streets of Warsaw in the heavily armored limousine known as the Beast. And apart from the presidential press pool, which followed in a van in his motorcade, other reporters trailed in tour buses and were led around by young White House aides like schoolchildren on a heavily guarded field trip, our laminated credentials allowing us entry into heavily fortified stops on the president\u2019s route.Later in Hamburg, Germany, protesters with placards and riot police with water cannons clogged the streets at the Group of 20 summit of major world economies, making it difficult to get around. At one point, a press shuttle bus I was riding from the summit site stopped and armed guards boarded, one loading his Glock pistol loudly and saying, \u201cReady!\u201d before we continued on our route. We were suitably intimidated.Things got more heated the next day when Chinese officials tried to exclude much of the White House press pool from a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China. I huddled along with the rest of the White House press pool \u2014 a group of five writers, four still photographers, a radio reporter and a television news crew that follows the president\u2019s every move \u2014 in a hallway outside the meeting, being shoved and jostled by Chinese journalists as Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Xi\u2019s aides exchanged angry words in English, Chinese and German.Apologetic White House aides explained that some of us might not make it in for the so-called spray at the start of the meeting, when reporters typically get a glimpse of the tableau and have the opportunity to hear from both leaders and ask questions. My colleagues and I \u2014 some of us longtime traveling companions who have bonded like a bunch of kids thrust into the world\u2019s most stressful summer camp over the adrenaline-fueled long hours and exhilarating moments of other presidential trips \u2014 mused aloud that we couldn\u2019t remember another world leader treating a U.S. president and his press corps this way at an international summit meeting. In the end, we all got inside.The trip began much as it started \u2014 with a last-minute decision by the White House that defied tradition. There would be no closing news conference by Mr. Trump to wrap up the summit and sum up his travels. No on-camera briefing by senior officials either, although three of them did take a handful of questions on Air Force One on the way back to Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Boycott That Wasn\u2019t: How United Weathered a Media Firestorm", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSome took to Twitter to suggest new advertising slogans for United. \u201cIf we can\u2019t beat out competitors, we\u2019ll beat our customers\u201d was one. \u201cUnited Airlines: putting the hospital in hospitality\u201d was another.\u201cThey\u2019ll be studying this in business schools for years,\u201d said Andrew Winston, a corporate strategy consultant and author of \u201cThe Big Pivot\u201d and a recent article in Harvard Business Review about the United incident.Having recently completed a round trip from Newark to San Francisco on United, I wasn\u2019t all that surprised that United appeared to be weathering the storm. When I booked my ticket, United offered the most convenient flight options at the cheapest fares, albeit just $12 or so less than American. So I booked on United, even though the Dao incident was fresh in my mind.My experience bears out an adage about airlines: People almost always opt for convenience and price, even while complaining loudly about crowded planes and a dearth of amenities. And now that there are just four major carriers in the United States, thanks to years of industry consolidation, many passengers don\u2019t have all that much choice.\u201cThe barriers to customer movement are pretty high,\u201d Mr. Winston said. \u201cYou\u2019d think that consumer perceptions matter a lot, but given that the major carriers practically have a monopoly on many routes and airports, it\u2019s not that easy to switch.\u201dThat said, once on board, I found the experience surprisingly pleasant. The flight took off on time and landed early. The snack I wanted was still available even though I was seated toward the back. My video screen malfunctioned, depriving me of an opportunity to watch the movie \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d But the flight attendant was so empathetic, and tried repeatedly to fix the problem (rebooting the aircraft\u2019s entire entertainment system several times) that I ended up reassuring her that I was happy to read a book. She gave me a voucher worth 5,000 frequent-flier miles or a $100 credit on a future flight, which seemed pretty generous for a minor incident.The return trip was even better. The plane was a mint condition Boeing 777-300ER, with an intriguing business-class layout I admired while on my way to coach. Back there, the seats were leather and unusually comfortable (even for someone as tall as I am.) The video equipment worked. I was surprised when a flight attendant offered me a complimentary meal. I told her it must be a mistake since I was in an ordinary coach seat.A United spokeswoman told me the airline had begun serving complimentary meals and drinks on many transcontinental flights beginning July 1, but only for Economy Plus passengers. She speculated that there may have been some extra meals on my flight, or I may have been upgraded to an Economy Plus seat without my realizing it. And she said the plane was probably one of the airline\u2019s 11 new 777-300ERs, which are being broken in on transcontinental routes before moving to international ones.That flight also took off on time and landed early. (United said it had the best on-time arrival and departure performance of any carrier in the second quarter.)Maybe this simply reflects diminished expectations, but after the remarkably stress-free flight, I wondered if it might be a good idea to fly an airline soon after an embarrassing episode like the Dao incident on the theory that everyone will be on their best behavior.According to United, my experience wasn\u2019t an anomaly, since the airline has put in a host of recent, post-Dao changes aimed at customer satisfaction. \u201cTo say we learned some lessons would be putting it mildly,\u201d said Megan McCarthy, the United spokeswoman.Besides the free meals and drinks in Economy Plus, United is now offering up to $10,000 in compensation for passengers who give up their seats on overbooked flights. These issues will be resolved before boarding so no one gets dragged off after taking an assigned seat. (United said \u201cinvoluntary denied boardings\u201d had dropped 88 percent in June from a year earlier.) When the airline loses luggage, customers will no longer have to provide receipts to prove the value of what was in it. The airline will provide up to $1,500 in compensation, no questions asked.United has also set up a team based in Chicago to offer creative solutions to customer problems. Ms. McCarthy cited an example of providing a flight to a nearby airport and ground transportation to their destination if someone has been denied boarding on an overbooked flight.\u201cThat was the right thing to do,\u201d said Steve Barrett, editor of PRWeek magazine. \u201cThey should have done it immediately. United made it a much bigger story than it ever would have been.\u201dWhen I spoke to Mr. Barrett this week, he acknowledged that no boycott had materialized and United\u2019s bookings were holding up, helped in part by a series of incidents at rival airlines suggesting that United wasn\u2019t any worse.Still, United \u201chas suffered considerable reputational damage,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cNo one is going to forget that video anytime soon.\u201dUnited is tying executive pay (not just Mr. Munoz\u2019s) to customer satisfaction, and in its recent earnings report included a section on the \u201ccustomer experience.\u201d The airline said it would continue its renewed focus on the customer.\u201cThat\u2019s great and I hope it\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Winston said. The airlines \u201chave spent the last 30 to 40 years building a culture that\u2019s about maximizing profits. Employees and customers were just a cog in that strategic wheel. Maybe it takes an incident like this to make them realize they can be about something more than moving cattle in the cheapest possible way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "John McCain Has Brain Cancer, Senator\u2019s Office Says", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. McCain\u2019s office said he was recuperating at his home in Arizona and \u201cappreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days.\u201dHis office said Mr. McCain would decide when to return to the Senate as he consults with his medical advisers.Mr. McCain learned of the tumor after undergoing surgery late last week at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix to remove a blood clot above his left eye.Mr. McCain, the son of a prominent family dedicated to military service, has been in American life since the 1960s. He was the public face of the mistreatment of American prisoners at the North Vietnamese camp known as the Hanoi Hilton, where as a Navy pilot he was confined and tortured for over five years. Decades later, he was the happy-go-lucky captain of the Straight Talk Express, the campaign bus where he cultivated his image as a candid political maverick in his failed 2000 presidential run. He was elected to a sixth Senate term this past November.Four presidents \u2014 Donald J. Trump, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and the elder George Bush \u2014 issued heartfelt statements wishing Mr. McCain a speedy recovery late Wednesday.\u201cSenator John McCain has always been a fighter,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 election, called the senator a \u201chero & one of the bravest fighters I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\u201cCancer doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s up against,\u201d Mr. Obama tweeted. \u201cGive it hell, John.\u201dOn Wednesday night, about a dozen lawmakers gathered in the Dirksen Senate Office Building to explore a health care compromise asked Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who is a Baptist minister, to lead them in prayer for their colleague.\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who was present. He said finding a solution to the health care impasse was \u201cmore challenging without him.\u201dMr. McConnell called Mr. McCain a hero to both Senate Republicans and the nation at large.\u201cHe has never shied from a fight, and I know that he will face this challenge with the same extraordinary courage that has characterized his life,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday night. \u201cWe all look forward to seeing this American hero again soon.\u201dMr. McCain endured grueling rehabilitation from his time in the prison camp but later led the effort to reconcile with Hanoi in a striking gesture of forgiveness. After quickly becoming prominent as a House member in his first election in 1982, Mr. McCain won the Senate seat given up by the Arizona icon Barry Goldwater in 1986. He became a fixture in the Senate, where he denounced the corrosive effects of big money in political campaigns and was a central player in congressional debates on military policy, immigration and health care.Wednesday\u2019s disclosure suggested that Mr. McCain\u2019s condition was more serious than initially believed, although the statement said that \u201che is recovering from his surgery \u2018amazingly well,\u2019\u201d according to his doctors, \u201cand his underlying health is excellent.\u201dAs the Republican health care bill teetered in recent days, Mr. Trump referred affectionately to Mr. McCain as a \u201ccrusty voice\u201d in the capital. But their relationship has been fraught.In July 2015, during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump denigrated Mr. McCain\u2019s military record, saying he was considered a war hero only because he was captured. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a comment that many suggested had gone too far. Mr. McCain, who at the time was facing conservative opposition in his re-election bid, remained a supporter of Mr. Trump throughout the campaign.However, Mr. McCain has pressed for a deep investigation into any interference into the presidential campaign by Russia, which he considers an adversary. On Tuesday, and despite his condition, Mr. McCain issued a statement warning about Russian intrusion in Ukraine and calling for new sanctions against Moscow.Mr. McCain faced an uphill battle in 2008 given public discontentment with the United States-led war in Iraq and overall fatigue with the administration of George W. Bush. Mr. McCain picked Sarah Palin, then the governor of Alaska, as his vice-presidential running mate in an effort to reinvigorate a flagging campaign with a woman on the ticket.A crucial moment in the race occurred in late September 2008 when he suddenly suspended his campaign and returned to Washington for an economic summit meeting at the White House that was also attended by Mr. Obama, then a Democratic senator from Illinois. Mr. McCain\u2019s 11th-hour effort to focus on the economy was generally considered a lost opportunity, and the financial collapse helped propel Mr. Obama to the presidency.Mr. McCain currently leads the Senate Armed Services Committee and is a top proponent of using military force overseas. The Senate is preparing to take up the annual Pentagon policy measure produced by the committee.In Congress, he is probably best known for his efforts to champion changes in campaign finance laws over the fierce objections of some of his Republican colleagues, particularly Mr. McConnell.The standard of care includes surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and then radiation and chemotherapy. In the past, radiation sometimes diminished patients\u2019 brain function, but techniques have improved so that more healthy brain tissue is spared and patients fare better, said Dr. Mitchel S. Berger, a neurosurgeon and glioblastoma expert at the University of California, San Francisco.An earlier version of this article misstated when Donald J.

We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe.\u201dThe frenzied addition of coal plants underscores how the world is set to remain dependent on coal for decades, despite fast growth in renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power.In China, concerns over smog and climate change have prompted a move toward renewables, as have slowing economic growth and a gradual shift in the Chinese economy away from heavy manufacturing and toward consumer industries. The addition of domestic capacity, though large on paper, does not mean there will be growth in coal consumption. The current coal plants are operating far below capacity because demand for coal-generated power has slowed considerably.But overseas, the Chinese are playing a different game.The China Energy Engineering Corporation, which has no public plans to develop coal power in China, is building 2,200 megawatts\u2019 worth of coal-fired power capacity in Vietnam and Malawi. Neither company responded to requests for comment.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Kevin P. Gallagher, a professor of global development policy at Boston University and an expert in Chinese energy investment overseas, said a strong infrastructure demand in developing countries and a sharp fall in coal financing by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank had opened up the field for Chinese involvement.\u201cIn China, you have lots of very competitive and politically influential companies \u2014 but all of a sudden there\u2019s no demand,\u201d Professor Gallagher said, referring to China\u2019s slowing economic growth. \u201cSo China is helping these companies go overseas to help make the adjustment at home less painful.\u201dSome of the countries targeted for coal-power expansion, like Egypt or Pakistan, currently burn almost no coal, and the new coal plants could set the course of their national energy policies for decades, environmentalists warn.In Egypt, coal projects by Shanghai Electric and other global developers are set to bring the country\u2019s coal-fired capacity to 17,000 megawatts, from near zero, according to the Urgewald database.Four virtual-reality films take you on, above and below the Antarctic ice.Pakistan\u2019s coal capacity is set to grow to 15,300 megawatts from 190. In Malawi, planned coal projects would bring its coal-fired capacity to 3,500 megawatts from zero.Chinese companies are not the only drivers of the global coal expansion.Western investors also continue to play a role in financing new coal plants overseas. Bonds and shares of the world\u2019s biggest coal developers, like India\u2019s National Thermal Power and Marubeni, are frequently found in the portfolios of large institutional investors and banks.To be sure, countries like China and Japan are also big players in renewables. China is a major exporter of solar panels and wind turbines, and is leading the construction of the Quaid-e-Azam solar park in Pakistan, one of the world\u2019s largest.\u201cFor now, those concerns seem not to extend elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Gimon said.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Counseled by Industry, Not Staff, E.P.A. Chief Is Off to a Blazing Start", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the four months since he took office as the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt has moved to undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules, a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency\u2019s 47-year history, according to experts in environmental law.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s supporters, including President Trump, have hailed his moves as an uprooting of the administrative state and a clearing of onerous regulations that have stymied American business. Environmental advocates have watched in horror as Mr. Pruitt has worked to disable the authority of the agency charged with protecting the nation\u2019s air, water and public health.But both sides agree: While much of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy agenda is mired in legal and legislative delays, hampered by poor execution and overshadowed by the Russia investigations, the E.P.A. is acting. Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built a career out of suing the agency he now leads, is moving effectively to dismantle the regulations and international agreements that stood as a cornerstone of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy.\u201cJust the number of environmental rollbacks in this time frame is astounding,\u201d said Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard. \u201cPruitt has come in with a real mission. He is much more organized, much more focused than the other cabinet-level officials, who have not really taken charge of their agencies. It\u2019s very striking how much they\u2019ve done.\u201dIn a sign of both Mr. Pruitt\u2019s influence in the White House and the high regard in which Mr. Trump holds him, he will take a leading role in devising the legal path to withdraw from the 194-nation Paris agreement on climate change, a job that would typically fall to lawyers at the State Department.And he is doing all this largely without the input of the 15,000 career employees at the agency he heads, according to interviews with over 20 current and former E.P.A. senior career staff members.\u201cI have been consistently informed by multiple career people at E.P.A. that Administrator Pruitt is not meeting with them ahead of making decisions like rolling back these major regulations,\u201d said James J. Jones, who had worked at the agency since the Reagan administration before retiring in January. Mr. Jones, an expert in chemical and pesticide pollution, was appointed by Mr. Obama as the E.P.A.\u2019s assistant administrator for chemical safety in his final years at the agency.Instead, Mr. Pruitt has outsourced crucial work to a network of lawyers, lobbyists and other allies, especially Republican state attorneys general, a network he worked with closely as the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Since 2013, the group has collected $4.2 million from fossil fuel-related companies like Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries, Murray Energy and Southern Company, businesses that also worked closely with Mr. Pruitt in many of the 14 lawsuits he filed against the E.P.A.Within the agency, Mr. Pruitt relies on the counsel of a small network of political appointees, including a number of former lobbyists and senior industry officials. For example, he tapped Nancy Beck, previously a policy director for the American Chemistry Council, which lobbies on behalf of companies such as Dow and DuPont, to oversee the E.P.A. office charged with enforcing regulations on hazardous chemicals.\u201cIt amounts to a corporate takeover of the agency, in its decision- and policy-making functions,\u201d said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a government watchdog group.Mr. Pruitt, 49, sees himself as a champion of states\u2019 rights, pressing to diminish the intrusive authority of an overbearing federal agency. Hanging near the fireplace on the wood-paneled walls of his office is a portrait of President James Monroe, who opposed ratifying the Constitution because he said it gave too much power to the federal government.Mr. Pruitt pushed that message in his first speech to the agency\u2019s staff. \u201cCongress has been very prescriptive in providing, in many instances, a very robust role, an important role of the states,\u201d he said. He did not mention public health or climate change.Since then, Mr. Pruitt has begun what he calls his \u201cback to basics\u201d agenda for the E.P.A. \u2014 one that he has described to multiple people as an effort to rein in the regulatory efforts of the Obama era, which focused on invisible greenhouse gases from tailpipes and smokestacks. Instead, Mr. Pruitt has said, he wants to focus on \u201ctangible\u201d pollution \u2014 for example, the Superfund program, which cleans up hazardous waste at old industrial sites.\u201cI am making it a priority to ensure contaminated sites get cleaned up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be more hands-on.\u201d (His proposed budget for 2018, however, would cut the Superfund program by about 25 percent.)Mr. Pruitt made his message explicit in a visit to the Harvey coal mine in Sycamore, Pa., to kick off a \u201cback to basics\u201d promotional tour in April.\u201cIt\u2019s sad that a regulatory body of the government of the United States would declare a war on any part of our economy,\u201d he told the miners. \u201cThe regulatory assault is over.\u201dAttorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, who worked closely with Mr. Pruitt when he was Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general to sue the E.P.A., said he was pleased that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s new job hadn\u2019t changed him. On March 1, Mr. Paxton met with Mr. Pruitt to request that the agency withdraw a rule requiring energy companies to collect data on emissions of methane from oil and gas wells. Mr. Paxton delivered the letter with the signatures of 11 attorneys general, laying out the case for walking back the rule.\u201cI personally handed him the letter, and the next day the rule was personally withdrawn,\u201d Mr. Paxton said.Meanwhile, the agency\u2019s career scientists and legal experts say they have been largely cut out of the process. Senior staff members with decades of experience in environmental law and science said they had been consulted rarely on the agency\u2019s major decisions to undo environmental protections.It is not unusual for E.P.A. administrators to consult with lobbyists, state officials, and industry and advocacy groups as they develop major policy proposals. But veteran E.P.A. employees say Mr. Pruitt has gone much further in cutting out career staff members.\u201cGoing back to the Reagan administration, I was never aware of a substantive decision made without input from career staff,\u201d said Mr. Jones, the former head of the E.P.A.\u2019s chemical regulation office. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that you have all the relevant facts if you\u2019re not meeting with the people who have a greater depth of knowledge on these issues than almost anyone in the country.\u201dSome career E.P.A. employees said they had been consulted, particularly in the writing of legal language to execute Mr. Pruitt\u2019s agenda. After Mr. Pruitt drafted his plan to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s rule on pollution in the nation\u2019s waterways, he turned to the E.P.A.\u2019s legal office to help ensure the language was bulletproof, said Kevin Minoli, the agency\u2019s acting general counsel.\u201cAs lawyers, it\u2019s not our job to choose the ultimate policy decision,\u201d said Mr. Minoli, who has served as an E.P.A. lawyer since the end of the Clinton administration. \u201cAs lawyers, our job is to help articulate the policy in the most legally defensible way possible.\u201dAmericans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Leaders of at least three major environmental and public health groups \u2014 the Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy and the American Lung Association \u2014 have had meetings with Mr. Pruitt, they said. E.P.A. officials said he had also met with advocacy groups such as the American Public Health Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the March of Dimes, the National Medical Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of American, and the National Environmental Health Association.But the influence of those groups, which have pushed to retain environmental rules, appears to be outweighed by the counsel of industry groups.Dow Chemical Company had pushed the E.P.A. to reconsider an Obama-era ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that the E.P.A.\u2019s scientists have concluded causes developmental damage in children. On March 30, Mr. Pruitt reversed the ban.On March 13, Mr. Pruitt met with agriculture lobbyists, including Dale Moore, executive director of the American Farm Bureau Federation, which has lobbied heavily for the repeal of an Obama-era regulation that could restrict the use of fertilizers near waterways. Last month, Mr. Pruitt filed a draft plan to repeal the Waters of the United States Rule.On March 22, he had dinner at the Trump International Hotel in Washington with 45 members of the board of directors of the American Petroleum Institute, a body composed largely of chief executive officers of the oil and gas industry. At the time, oil and gas companies were pushing the E.P.A. to roll back a set of rules on methane leaks from drilling wells, which the industry estimates could cost it over $170 million.\u201cThe nice thing is,\u201d Mr. Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, said, \u201cnow we feel like we\u2019re being heard.\u201dAn article on Sunday about the influence of Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, erroneously reported a meeting between Mr. Pruitt and Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. While a meeting was scheduled for March 9 at an energy conference in Houston, both the E.P.A. and Dow said it was later canceled and did not take place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Boasts of Its Savings in Regulatory Rollback", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration says it is moving forward with its aggressive plans to shred government rules and regulations.The White House on Wednesday released its first official report on its rollback efforts, claiming that during President Trump\u2019s first five months in office it had brought about savings for the economy rather than impose regulatory costs. As a comparison, the report said President Obama\u2019s agencies accrued $3.1 billion in regulatory costs during the same period at the start of his administration. The administration also said it was ahead of schedule in implementing President Trump\u2019s pledge to eliminate two regulations for each new one on the books.The report shows how the administration is trying to follow through on a campaign pledge by Mr. Trump to broadly reduce regulation and reverse rules put in place under his predecessor.\u201cThere is a substantial withdrawal and rollback of proposed regulatory actions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also important to note that what we are doing now is in some ways fulfilling a number of longstanding principles that other presidents have always talked about.\u201d\u201cThere is a war on regulations going on,\u201d said Rena Steinzor, one of the authors of the analysis and a law professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cIn defiance in the rule of law, the Trump administration is freezing rules that are critically important to public health, that will save hundreds of thousands of people from death and also from injury.\u201dMs. Rao said that the regulatory review process required a \u201ccareful\u201d analysis and compliance with the law, and that much of the action at this stage was on regulatory proposals that were being considered. She said agencies would need to study the costs and benefits of deregulation, just as they would do before proposing regulation.\u201cDeregulation is going to take time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not something you can just do at the snap of a finger.\u201dThe White House report, which it described as an update on its regulatory agenda, said the administration\u2019s actions during the first five months would produce annualized savings of $22 million for the economy. In total, 860 regulatory actions have been either withdrawn or flagged for further review under the Trump administration, said the report, which Ms. Rao said was based on data from staff at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.The administration has not yet put a figure on how much it believes it can save through curbing regulations over the course of a year or longer, Ms. Rao said. \u201cThat is what we are working on figuring out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is hard to prejudge that.\u201dThe report cited a series of planning rules and regulatory actions from federal agencies. In one case, the Bureau of Land Management proposed repealing a 2015 regulation on hydraulic fracking, which it said duplicated rules in place in many states. In another, the White House said the Labor Department planned to streamline approval of new apprenticeship and vocational programs.The judges said the agency had the right to reverse the methane regulations but would have to undertake a new rule-making process to undo the Obama administration\u2019s regulation, creating a formal public record to document why the rule was no longer necessary or justified under federal law.Asked about the ruling, Ms. Rao acknowledged there were \u201cconcerns\u201d about the impact of the ruling. \u201cAgencies want to move quickly to get things done, to fulfill their priorities,\u201d she said, adding that her office would be working with agencies to be sure they follow the law and are \u201cdoing things the right way.\u201dEric Lipton contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Risky Offshore Oil Strategy", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsSeven years ago, a BP oil well blew out off Louisiana, causing the Deepwater Horizon drill rig to explode, killing 11 workers and releasing several million barrels of toxic crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.As co-chairmen of the bipartisan National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, we investigated the causes of the disaster and examined the offshore drilling industry to identify ways to reduce the risks it poses to workers, the public and the environment. Although Congress has refused to enact any of the commission\u2019s safety recommendations, the Department of the Interior adopted many of them after extensive input from industry, government and the public.As Americans flock to the nation\u2019s beaches this summer, it is important to understand what Mr. Trump\u2019s recent moves portend. Specifically, his executive order calls for the reconsideration of a critical safeguard that is the most important action the government has taken to reduce offshore drilling hazards. This safeguard, the well control rule, tightened controls on blowout preventers designed to stop explosions in undersea oil and gas wells. The rule was based in part on lessons the commission learned about the root cause of the BP disaster.Had this common-sense rule been in place on April 20, 2010, that calamity might well have been averted. Weakening or rescinding this rule would increase the risks of offshore operations, put workers in harm\u2019s way and imperil marine waters and coastlines.Mr. Trump\u2019s order also directed the Interior Department to review current rules on offshore drilling. Opening more areas to exploration, as the Trump administration moved to do last week, could threaten the fragile Arctic Ocean off Alaska as well as environmentally sensitive reaches of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. A spill in any of those waters could threaten multibillion-dollar regional economies that depend on clean oceans and coastlines.Nothing has changed to justify these moves since the current five-year offshore leasing plan, which runs through 2022, was finalized after years of public and industry input. Broad public opposition to expanding drilling into frontier areas has not diminished. Nor are the identified potential harms to economies and ecologies any less significant.In short, drilling in the outer continental shelf remains risky business. Safety and oversight in offshore drilling continues to need improvement, not roll backs.President Trump\u2019s executive order disregards these facts. It fails to account for the vulnerabilities of the ocean\u2019s frontier regions, a lack of adequate federal investment in safety measures for Arctic conditions, or the danger to coastal economies. It will put workers\u2019 lives as well as ecologically rich and economically important waters and coastlines at needless additional risk.Bob Graham, a former Florida governor and United States senator, and William K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, were the co-chairmen of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Urban China, Cash Is Rapidly Becoming Obsolete", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 There is an audacious economic phenomenon happening in China.It has nothing to do with debt, infrastructure spending or the other major economic topics du jour. It has to do with cash \u2014 specifically, how China is systematically and rapidly doing away with paper money and coins.Almost everyone in major Chinese cities is using a smartphone to pay for just about everything. At restaurants, a waiter will ask if you want to use WeChat or Alipay \u2014 the two smartphone payment options \u2014 before bringing up cash as a third, remote possibility.Just as startling is how quickly the transition has happened. Only three years ago there would be no question at all, because everyone was still using cash.\u201cFrom a tech standpoint, this is probably one of the single most important innovations that has happened first in China, and at the moment it\u2019s only in China,\u201d said Richard Lim, managing director of venture capital firm GSR Ventures.Even so, the attendant cultural shift was graspable only in person. I recently moved to Shanghai and felt the change with cash acutely because my first few weeks in the metropolis of more than 20 million were spent cut out of the system. Because of an issue with my bank, I couldn\u2019t immediately link my account to WeChat, which has become a virtual wallet for so many.That meant I had to navigate China the way I would have three years ago: with a stack of red 100-renminbi notes.At coffee shops and restaurants, I held up lines as I fumbled out my wallet and peeled off the bills to give the cashier. If I was hungry I had to go outside and find a restaurant, while bowls of noodles, groceries and coffee materialized at our office, ordered by my colleagues and paid for on the phone. If I had to get somewhere, I couldn\u2019t use my phone to unlock one of the ubiquitous bicycles that are a part of China\u2019s bike-sharing craze.Even the buskers were apparently ahead of me. Enterprising musicians playing on the streets of a number of Chinese cities have put up boards with QR codes so that passers-by can simply transfer them tips directly.\u201cIt has become the default way of life now,\u201d said Shiv Putcha,\u00a0an analyst with the research firm IDC. \u201cLiterally every business and brand in China is plugged into this ecosystem.\u201dSome Scandinavian countries have also weaned themselves from cash but still use cards frequently. In China, the change has been to phones.\u00a0One friend didn\u2019t realize how reliant she had become on mobile payments until her bank called her. She had left her A.T.M. card in the machine three weeks earlier and had not noticed its absence.In practical terms, this means Tencent and Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, the two Chinese internet companies that run WeChat and Alipay, respectively, are sitting atop a gold mine of staggering proportions. Both companies can make money off the transactions, charge other companies to use their payment platforms and all the while collect the payments data to be used in everything from new credit systems to advertising.Mr. Lim said that according to recent data, Ant Financial and Tencent were set to surpass credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in total global\u00a0transactions per day in the coming year. The key is that both companies are able to provide payments on the cheap,\u00a0partly\u00a0by allowing smaller vendors to make use of a simple printout of a QR code or their phone, instead of an expensive card reader. A back-end system that stores\u00a0a record of user accounts, instead of having to communicate with a bank, also keeps costs down.While Tencent does not break out what it makes from mobile payments, in the fourth quarter of 2016 the \u201cother services\u201d item in its earnings almost tripled from a year earlier to 6.4 billion renminbi, or $940 million, driven largely by mobile payments.There are some potential future problems with China\u2019s sweeping embrace of online payments. As the country builds its entire consumer economy around two private smartphone payment platforms, it is slowly locking out people unable to get onto those networks, and locking itself into those companies.At the simplest level, that makes life difficult for tourists and business travelers who are unlikely to open a bank account in China and so will find it hard to turn their phones into wallets.More broadly, it means things could get harder for foreign and local businesses alike. Foreign companies hoping to sell to Chinese consumers now must deal with Alibaba and Tencent or risk being unable to take payments. Likewise, Chinese companies reliant on Alibaba and Tencent have to build out separate structures to deal with the world of Facebook, Google and credit cards that still dominate elsewhere.There is a corollary for what could happen here. In Japan in the early 2000s, flip phones could do everything from stream cable TV to pay at stores. But because the phones were so advanced, Japan was slow to adopt smartphones, and it went from tech giant to tech laggard in 15 years.No doubt aware of this, Alibaba and Tencent are pushing to expand beyond China to ensure their newest innovation doesn\u2019t go the way of the dinosaurs. Still, competition is most likely looming.\u201cThe million-dollar question is: Will Western firms decide to build a system and compete?\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cThe answer is probably yes.\u201dUntil then, new arrivals like me have to deal with being locked out of China\u2019s online payments infrastructure.Earlier this month, though, I lucked out using cash. As I was trying to get a pile of stuff from Ikea back to my new apartment, a cabdriver looked skeptically at the huge rolled-up mattress pad I was planning to load into the back of his car.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take you,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI can only take cash.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I have,\u201d I said to my fellow Luddite, who grumpily agreed to ferry me home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maybe We\u2019ve Been Thinking About the Productivity Slump All Wrong", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsAmerican businesses are doing a terrible job at making their workers more productive.Productivity growth is the weakest it has been since the early 1980s \u2014 only 0.8 percent a year over the last half a decade, compared with 2.3 percent on average from 1947 to 2007. This is the root cause of slow growth in both G.D.P. and worker pay.At least, that is the standard way of thinking about productivity and its relationship to the economy. In a mainstream view, productivity is a kind of magic force that helps explain rising output. New labor-saving inventions come along or new management practices are taken up that miraculously allow companies to produce more output with fewer hours of work.But what if this is the wrong way of thinking about it? What if productivity growth is not so much an external force that proceeds in random fits and starts, but is rather deeply intertwined with the overall state of the economy and labor market?It\u2019s a chicken or egg problem: Does low productivity cause slow growth, or does slow growth cause low productivity?J. W. Mason, the author of the report, argues that soft productivity growth reflects not some unlucky dearth of new innovations, but rather is a consequence of depressed demand for goods and services and a slack labor market that has depressed wages.Maybe if the labor market were tighter and wages were rising faster, it would induce companies to invest more heavily in new labor-saving innovations.What\u2019s particularly interesting is that this diagnosis \u2014 though decidedly not the policy prescriptions \u2014 has some overlap with the arguments of influential conservative economists.And it comports with the view of some of the more sophisticated analysts of productivity trends from the business world.For example, Marco Annunziata, the chief economist of General Electric, argues that many of the technological innovations now coming to market, like 3D printing and the use of augmented reality glasses in industrial settings, really are generating huge productivity gains where they are deployed.But capital spending has been weak over all, and particularly weak for those more transformative innovations.\u201cThe investment that should be most powerful in driving productivity for companies has been the weakest,\u201d Mr. Annunziata said. \u201cIt means that all these innovations aren\u2019t scaling. They\u2019re only being implemented on an episodic basis, on a small scale.\u201dCompanies, in his telling, are spending their capital budgets not on things that might cause a leap in their workers\u2019 productivity, but on smaller projects to replace old machinery and software and make marginal efficiency gains.What would change that? That\u2019s what brings us back to Mr. Mason\u2019s arguments about the interplay between demand and productivity growth.Just maybe, if the labor market tightens and good workers are harder to find \u2014 and wages rise \u2014 that will be the impetus to get companies to consider more of those big-ticket innovations that generate productivity growth.Consider a hypothetical (though one that isn\u2019t actually that hypothetical right now). If your neighborhood fast food place employs 10 people during the lunch rush, with each making $10 an hour, what will happen if your state raises its minimum wage to $15?The owner might raise prices, or accept lower profits, or close the store entirely. Or, just maybe, the owner will invest in new machinery to enable workers to do more with less. Perhaps the restaurant will be able to operate just fine with only five workers after investing in self-ordering kiosks and a hamburger-flipping robot.There\u2019s a term for a restaurant that can serve the same number of burgers with half as many employees, and it\u2019s higher productivity. (While this can conjure scary notions of a work force made redundant by robots, economists see a more hopeful picture: that higher productivity enables faster economic growth and higher incomes, at the cost of some temporary disruption for the workers affected.)In the context of the minimum wage debate, pretty much everyone agrees that this kind of response \u2014 \u201ccapital substitution,\u201d to use the technical term \u2014 is to be expected. But there\u2019s no reason it would happen only after a minimum-wage increase. You could imagine the same thing happening if wages rose because of market forces; that same fast food restaurant might invest in kiosks and robots if the labor market were so tight that no workers were willing to take the job for $10.If you look at long-term patterns of productivity growth, they roughly fit this idea, that a booming job market tends to be followed by a productivity boom, and that deep recessions are followed by productivity slumps.The strongest productivity growth in post-World War II America came in the late 1960s and early 2000s. The two periods of greatest weakness were the early 1980s and the last decade since the global financial crisis.In this way of thinking about productivity, inventors and business innovators are always cooking up better ways to do things, but it takes a labor shortage and high wages to coax firms to deploy the investment it takes to actually put those innovations into widespread use.Mr. Mason adds that this idea has some big implications for how to think about growth in worker compensation in the current economic environment. There has been a glaring contradiction around how much American workers\u2019 wages can, or should, be rising.\u201cOn Mondays and Wednesdays, economists argue that wages are low because robots are taking people\u2019s jobs. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t have wages rise because productivity growth is low,\u201d said Mr. Mason, an economist at John Jay College. \u201cBoth can\u2019t be true.\u201dIn other words, instead of worrying so much about robots taking away jobs, maybe we should worry more about wages being too low for the robots to even get a chance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Finance Meeting\u2019s Meager Results Reflect Nation\u2019s Problems", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s top leaders have gathered every five years since 1997 for a National Financial Work Conference. At past gatherings, they have created entire regulatory agencies and rearranged the rules for huge markets, almost overnight.So economists and regulators have been almost breathlessly speculating about this summer\u2019s work conference. Would the regulatory commissions overseeing the banking, securities and insurance industries be merged into the central bank? Would the legal definition of securities be broadened to shed some regulatory daylight on widespread activities like shadow banking, peer-to-peer online investment networks and off-balance-sheet wealth management products?But the actual results of the two-day work conference, which ended on Saturday afternoon, were much more, well, modest, to put it politely.The biggest accomplishment of the conference appeared to be an announcement that a commission would be established under the auspices of the cabinet. The commission would meet regularly to discuss issues of financial stability.But the leaders of the various financial regulatory agencies already meet regularly at the offices of the State Council, which is China\u2019s cabinet, although these meetings are not officially at the level of a commission.Some economists speculated in the final days before the two-day conference that at least the State Council meetings would be moved to the central bank. Allowing the central bank to serve tea and provide a conference room might give the central bank staff a little extra confidence by allowing them to negotiate as hosts. The central bank also has a history of advocating broader financial reforms than the other principal financial regulatory agencies: the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.But the leaders did not even move the meetings away from the State Council\u2019s offices to the central bank. And the result of the conference fell far short of predictions that the regulatory agencies might become clearly subservient to the central bank.The statement that accompanied the end of the conference did mention that the central bank had a role to play in preventing systemic financial risk. That is already the role of central banks in many countries. But Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group based in Shanghai, said that the specific mention of it in the statement might strengthen the central bank\u2019s hand somewhat.But he was skeptical of the new commission, noting that it would lack legal powers and have very few staff members. \u201cChina failed to achieve a real breakthrough in financial regulatory reform, and the rising conflicts between financial regulation and financial realities will continue to create troubles in the coming years,\u201d Mr. Liu said.State-controlled media carried a statement that described President Xi Jinping of China as having said at the conference, \u201cFinance is an important core competitiveness of the country, financial security is an important part of national security, and the financial system is an important economic and social development of the basic system.\u201dThe apparently meager results from the conference underline not just bureaucratic resistance to change, which Mr. Xi probably has the political muscle to overcome, but the very real and complex policy dilemmas facing China.One example lies in the vast, lightly regulated off-balance-sheet activities of Chinese banks, which Mizuho Securities calculated on Friday to be roughly equal to the entire assets on the balance sheets of the banking industry. Regulators in the West would probably force banks to move these activities as quickly as possible onto their balance sheets, which would probably have the effect of curtailing them.But many of these off-balance-sheet activities, like various kinds of loan guarantees, are crucial to providing financing for China\u2019s vigorous small and medium-size enterprises. These smaller businesses have had little luck competing with large, state-owned enterprises for conventional bank loans. But they account for the bulk of the job creation in China, at a time when the government is trying to slim down chronically loss-making industries like steel manufacturing and coal mining that are also big employers.Other financial regulatory disputes in China involve bureaucratic turf issues. One question lies in how to modernize China\u2019s antiquated securities law, which still applies only to stocks and bonds and lacks provisions to cover the more complex instruments issued these days by insurance companies, banks, online lenders and other types of financial institutions.The China Securities Regulatory Commission has pushed hard for the broadest possible definition of securities, which would give it much greater influence. The banking and insurance regulators have resisted this, contending that many of the new financial instruments are extensions of banking and insurance.One mystery left unresolved by the statement at the end of the conference lies in who will run the top financial regulatory agencies in the years ahead, particularly the central bank.Zhou Xiaochuan has been the governor of the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, since 2002, making him one of the world\u2019s longest-serving central bankers. Mr. Zhou is already more than two years past the usual retirement age for Chinese officials at his level. He received a special dispensation from the usual age limits by being allowed to join a senior government advisory body that is exempt from age limits.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volvo, Betting on Electric, Moves to Phase Out Conventional Engines", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVolvo Cars on Wednesday became the first mainstream automaker to sound the death knell of the internal combustion engine, saying that all the models it introduces starting in 2019 will be either hybrids or powered solely by batteries.While most major automakers offer hybrids and battery-powered options, none of them have been willing to forsake cars powered solely by gasoline or diesel fuel. On the contrary, United States automakers have continued to churn out S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, whose sales have surged because of relatively low fuel prices.\u201cOur customers are asking more and more about electric cars,\u201d Hakan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. While Volvo\u2019s strategy has risks, Mr. Samuelsson acknowledged, \u201ca much bigger risk would be to stick with internal combustion engines.\u201dThough based in Sweden, Volvo is owned by Geely Automobile Holdings of China, which already produces battery-powered cars for the Chinese market. The decision by Volvo to focus on electric vehicles could ultimately give it and Geely a head start if, as many analysts expect, sales of battery powered cars begin to take off. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles.Volvo\u2019s battery-powered vehicles will be produced initially in China, but eventually also in Europe and at a new factory the company is building near Charleston, S.C.Hybrids, which combine battery power with gasoline or diesel engines, accounted for about 2 percent of passenger car sales in the United States last year, a number that has been declining because gasoline prices have fallen.And cars that run solely on battery power are still rare in most countries because of high purchase prices, lengthy charging times and limited ranges.Still, most carmakers expect the share of electric cars to grow quickly as the technology improves, prices fall and public charging stations become more commonplace. Rapid advances in self-driving cars will also encourage a shift to battery power: It is simpler to link self-driving software to an electric motor than to a conventional engine.Although no other traditional carmakers have declared their intention to bury the internal combustion engine, virtually all of them are investing in hybrid and battery technology.The major American automakers are moving forward with their own electrification strategies, albeit on a much smaller scale than Tesla and now Volvo.Ford has sold electric versions of a few mainstream models, but it has not yet developed an all-electric vehicle from the ground up. That is changing, however. The company has said it will introduce a battery-powered S.U.V. by 2020 and will add other electric models thereafter.The third big domestic automaker, Fiat Chrysler, has lagged. It sells an electric version of its Fiat 500 subcompact car and a hybrid gas-electric variation of its Chrysler Pacifica minivan. But the company has yet to announce any plans to build a new vehicle that is available only as an electric model.Carmakers including Volvo have depended on diesel to provide better fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide emissions. But the Volkswagen scandal has raised awareness of the health effects of diesel exhaust.Diesel engines burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline motors, but they produce far more nitrogen oxides, which cause asthma and are considered a carcinogen. The cost of the equipment needed to neutralize diesel fumes is becoming prohibitive.\u201cThe diesel engine is getting more expensive,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson said during a news conference in Stockholm on Wednesday. \u201cWe would prefer to talk about the alternatives.\u201dThe changing political landscape in the United States has somewhat muddied the outlook for electric cars on the other side of the Atlantic. The Obama administration was highly supportive of electrified vehicles, which could help companies meet tougher federal fuel-economy standards.But, so far, President Trump has not pursued policies that encourage the development of electric vehicles.Moreover, the persistence of low gasoline prices continues to push American buyers toward bigger vehicles \u2014 trucks and S.U.V.s \u2014 and has made the fuel economy of electric or hybrid vehicles less potent as a selling point.Volvo\u2019s transition will be gradual. It plans to still produce existing models with conventional engines after 2019, but it will no longer introduce new models with the older technology. Depending on demand, Volvo will completely phase out cars powered solely by gasoline or diesel by around 2024.But by focusing on electrification, Volvo can concentrate its limited research and development resources on new technologies rather than continuing to invest in fuel-powered motors that may become obsolete. With sales of 534,000 cars last year, Volvo is dwarfed by companies like Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors, each of which sold about 10 million vehicles in 2016.Volvo will be able to draw on technology developed by its parent company, Geely. The companies can also save money by purchasing components such as batteries together.Analysts said Volvo\u2019s decision to pursue a lineup dedicated to electric and hybrid vehicles is motivated, in part, by the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion engines.\u201cChinese ownership of Swedish-based Volvo likely played a role in the automaker\u2019s announcement today,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the auto-research site Autotrader.com. \u201cChina\u2019s air pollution problems have prompted a more serious push toward cleaner automobiles.\u201dVolvo said on Wednesday that it would introduce five models from 2019 to 2021 that would run solely on electric power. That includes two models sold under Volvo\u2019s Polestar brand, which the company is marketing as a maker of high-performance electrified cars.Other models will include plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from power outlets and run for short distances solely on batteries, and so-called mild hybrids, which charge their batteries from the car\u2019s conventional engine or by recovering energy from braking. Hybrids still require gasoline or diesel fuel, but they are typically more efficient because the batteries share the load.Mr. Samuelsson said the company also wanted to encourage suppliers to invest in battery technology and charging stations.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make a clear statement,\u201d he said.Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Strongman Has a Weak Point: North Korea", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, is known as the Chairman of Everything. He makes decisions daily on the economy, the military, foreign policy, human rights and more.Yet on North Korea he is stuck. A strongman who usually acts with precision and boldness, Mr. Xi has been reluctant to take on the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, ostensibly a Chinese ally, whom he privately disparages to Western leaders as young and reckless.The answer? He will probably do little, if anything.As much as Mr. Xi disapproves of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, he fears even more the end of Mr. Kim\u2019s regime, a unified Korea with American troops on his border and a flood of refugees from the North into China. And despite North Korea\u2019s missile advancement on Tuesday, Mr. Xi still has some breathing room, Chinese military and strategic experts said.Chinese military experts are assessing the launch more conservatively than their American counterparts, saying they were not convinced the missile was actually an intercontinental ballistic missile.\u201cThis test may or may not be an ICBM,\u201d said Wu Riqiang, associate professor of international affairs at Renmin University. He said the missile was \u201cprobably unable to hit Alaska.\u201dIn contrast, American experts said the North Koreans had crossed a threshold, if only just, with a missile that appeared able to reach Alaska. While the missile traveled only about 580 miles, it did so by reaching 1,700 miles into space and re-entering the atmosphere, North Korean, South Korean and Japanese officials said.South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry suggested on Wednesday that the North\u2019s missile had the potential to reach Hawaii, about 4,780 miles from Kusong, the North Korean town from where the missile was fired, and farther than Alaska.Mr. Wu said the North\u2019s long-range missile capabilities were less threatening to China than to the United States. China would be more concerned if the North had tested a short- or medium-range ballistic missile, he said.China may be increasingly frustrated by the North\u2019s behavior, but it has never been the target of Mr. Kim\u2019s weapons. The United States is the North\u2019s declared enemy and the ultimate target of its nuclear arsenal.More worrisome to China than the missile advances was the prospect of North Korea\u2019s sixth test of a nuclear bomb, Mr. Wu and other experts said. China\u2019s northeast, a depressed area of smaller cities and rusted industries, runs along the border with North Korea, not far from the tests. The nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri in North Korea is so close to the Chinese border that residents in the city of Yanji have complained that their windows rattled during the last several tests.\u201cFor China, a sixth nuclear test represents a graver threat than an ICBM test,\u201d said Feng Zhang, a fellow in political science at the Australian National University. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s ICBMs threaten the U.S. more than China, but North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and the testing of them near the Chinese border are a strategic and environmental threat to China.\u201dMr. Wu said, \u201cThe missile launch just isn\u2019t as pressing for China as a nuclear test might be.\u201dBut no matter the North\u2019s behavior, it would be very difficult for Mr. Xi to declare a red line with Pyongyang, either officially or unofficially, said Cheng Xiaohe, associate professor of international relations at Renmin University.\u201cThe ICBM is not a Chinese red line \u2014 even the U.S. does not draw that line clearly and unequivocally,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. If China did draw such a red line, he said, \u201cChina or the U.S. must automatically take retaliatory actions,\u201d such as Beijing cutting off oil supplies to North Korea.But China cannot afford to squeeze the North so hard \u2014 by cutting off fuel, for example, or basic trade \u2014 that the country destabilizes, sending refugees pouring over the border.Mr. Xi is at least publicly expressing disapproval of North Korea\u2019s latest actions. He was in Russia visiting President Vladimir V. Putin when the North announced it had successfully tested an ICBM. The two leaders issued a joint statement calling for negotiations that would aim to freeze the North\u2019s arsenal in exchange for limitations on the American military posture in South Korea.Instead of penalizing North Korea, China has been calling for such negotiations for many months, but the Trump administration has declined.Beyond cracking down on trade between the two nations, Mr. Xi holds very few cards against North Korea, and he has little choice but to rely on a kind of strategic hesitation, said a Chinese analyst of foreign affairs who sometimes advises the government.\u201cXi as a strategist is facing an anguished choice to use up his means on Kim Jong-un while having no confidence at all that it would be effective,\u201d said the analyst, Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cWhat can this strategist do? A sort of hesitation is unavoidable.\u201dMr. Xi is facing an increasingly \u201cdetermined and decisive\u201d Mr. Kim, and he is also confronted by an American president who is not easy to deal with, Mr. Shi said. \u201cXi and Trump are unable to see eye to eye for long, and even if they were it would extremely difficult to thwart Kim for long,\u201d he said.It was not clear where Mr. Trump got his 40 percent figure. A South Korean trade group said on Monday that China had imported much more iron in the last few months than previously. But the group also said that the North was a long way from making up the lost revenues from China shutting down its North Korean coal imports.China\u2019s trade with the North grew 37.4 percent during the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2016, Chinese trade data released in April showed. China said the trade grew even as it stopped buying North Korean coal.Ye Fei contributed research.Advertisement"}

States with high credit ratings can borrow cheaply; it will be hard for any private enterprise to overcome that advantage. Ultimately, the risks of cost, delay and performance cannot be entirely shifted from the citizens.

And most state and local governments don\u2019t have the management capacity to oversee complex public-private infrastructure projects.They need to be able to design projects that appropriately allocate project risks to each partner, write solicitations so that bids maximize value for money, negotiate contract details that optimize public value, require and monitor key performance indicators to keep project performance on track, and provide an exit strategy that protects taxpayers if the partnership fails.The tremendous backlog of infrastructure needs in the United States suggests that there is an important role for both public and private finance. But public-private partnerships without strong public management are a recipe for disaster.Mr. Forrer is director, Institute for Corporate Responsibility, and Mr. Kee is professor emeritus of public policy and public administration, both at George Washington University.To the Editor:We are facing a crisis of infrastructure in this country, but we should not let crisis and fiscal desperation drive our policy decisions. Infrastructures are large, interconnected and difficult to change once they are in place.Let us take great pains to avoid getting stuck in partnerships that go bankrupt, limit public access or ruin our health.

Peters and Samara Barend are correct that properly structured public-private partnerships can play an important role in building the infrastructure our country desperately needs. The problem comes when projects are not properly structured.With so little money at risk, the private concessionaire can walk away with little lost if there are significant cost increases or delays.This shows why it is critical to look at the specifics.

Amanda Sullivan, a camp coordinator and a postdoctoral researcher in early childhood technology, smiled. \u201cThey\u2019ve been debugging their Hokey Pokeys,\u201d she said.To prepare, children need to start as early as preschool, educators say. Foundational skills that affect whether people thrive or fall behind in the modern economy are developed early, and achievement gaps appear before kindergarten.\u201cIt\u2019s a real misnomer that simply learning to code is the answer,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a chairman in engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWe don\u2019t need everybody to be extremely capable Python coders. It\u2019s a way of understanding what machines are good at and what they\u2019re not good at \u2014 that\u2019s something everybody needs to learn.\u201dIt\u2019s not that technology should be avoided; many researchers say children should be exposed to it. But we don\u2019t know what machines will be able to do in two decades, let alone which programming languages software engineers will use. And children learn better, they say, by playing and building instead of sitting behind screens.\u201cThat\u2019s key for programming, and it\u2019s key for life,\u201d she said. Her curriculum, used in schools nationwide and abroad, teaches skills like sharing and perseverance, and is woven into all subjects in the school day: Children program robots to act out a story they\u2019re reading, for example.At the Tufts summer camp, the children were programming the robot \u2014 which has no screen but uses colored wooden blocks and a bar code scanner \u2014 by building a sequence of blocks labeled with commands like \u201cturn right\u201d or \u201cspin.\u201dThey had already learned an important piece of syntax: The program must begin with a green \u201cbegin\u201d block and end with a red \u201cend\u201d one. Nico Luker, 6, decided to test what would happen if he scanned a program without the \u201cend\u201d block. \u201cIt won\u2019t work without an end,\u201d predicted Noam Webber, 6. Sure enough, the robot sat still.Meanwhile, the children were learning about teamwork, failure and sharing. \u201cTechnology can be a vehicle to help people create and collaborate better, but at the end of the day, people need to learn to work with people,\u201d Ms. Umaschi Bers said. To begin, teachers place all the materials on tables, and children take what they need. Some try to take everything, prompting a conversation about sharing and ethical choices.There\u2019s a testing area, where children get points for how many times they try something that fails. \u201cWe don\u2019t create an artificial environment where everything will work,\u201d Ms. Umaschi Bers said. \u201cWe let them find frustration because they will only learn to manage frustration if they encounter it.\u201d\u201cIf you raise and educate kids to be flexible, problem solvers and good communicators, they can adapt to a world that is new,\u201d she said.\u201cYou\u2019re learning to work in groups and be creative, and that this problem you\u2019re facing today looks like a problem you faced in a different context a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a process that is very hard for artificial intelligence to replicate.\u201dJess Bidgood reported from Medford, Mass., and Claire Cain Miller from Portland, Ore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Vote Marred by Violence, Including Candidate\u2019s Death", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 The legitimacy of Sunday\u2019s election to overhaul Venezuela\u2019s Constitution was under threat as many voters avoided the ballot box, nations across the region rejected the predetermined result and the streets erupted in the deadliest day of unrest in three months.President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had ordered a rewriting of the Constitution. The election on Sunday was simply to pick the members of the constituent assembly that will carry it out; there was no option to reject the process.By evening, electoral officials announced the winners of the vote, a list of leftist stalwarts including Diosdado Cabello, a powerful politician who once participated in a failed coup attempt, and Cilia Flores, Mr. Maduro\u2019s wife. The result effectively liquidates the Venezuelan political opposition and leaves the left with complete control over a country that remains deeply divided.\u201cI said rain, thunder or lightning, the 30th of July was going to come,\u201d the president said in a shaky video made from his vehicle after he cast his ballot. He remained sanguine throughout the day, saying the vote would soon bring peace to a country where about 120 people have died during protests this year against his rule.But the powers of the new assembly members will be so vast that they could possibly remove Mr. Maduro from office, some analysts noted, ending a presidency that has been deeply unpopular, even among many leftists.As the day rolled on, many countries \u2014 some once aligned with Venezuela\u2019s leftist ideology \u2014 rejected the result, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Spain.Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, called the vote a \u201csham election\u201d that would lead to a dictatorship. The United States repeated threats of sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s economy.\u201cIf these other countries don\u2019t recognize Venezuela as a democracy, it will be hard for them to look like a legitimate power,\u201d said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group. Mr. Smilde mentioned a list of consequences that such isolation could entail, from access to bank loans to straining diplomatic ties with its largest neighbors.One candidate for the constituent assembly, Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Pineda, a 39-year-old lawyer, was killed in his home the night before the vote. Prosecutors said an armed group had broken into Mr. Pineda\u2019s home in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar on Saturday night and shot him dead there.Hours later, a large explosion rocked a middle-class neighborhood in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, injuring at least seven police officers on patrol. Video circulating on social media showed the uniformed officers, all on motorcycles, riding into a fireball that had just erupted in front of them.Nearby residents applauded as the security forces threw tear gas at them.As the day wore on, government security forces used water cannons, rubber bullets and batons against protesters, just as they have for the last three months.At least 10 people were killed in clashes between the police and demonstrators, the government said, including two boys, ages 13 and 17, who were shot in the western state of T\u00e1chira. A police officer was shot in front of a school in T\u00e1chira, and a 43-year-old man was killed in Barquisimeto, the capital of Lara State, when a bullet pierced his head, according to the state prosecutor\u2019s office.The force of the unrest raised fears that Mr. Maduro\u2019s efforts to consolidate power could steer the country toward deeper conflict.The government took strong precautions to control Sunday\u2019s vote. It outlawed protests in the days before and after, vowing tough sentences for those who disobeyed. And it barred many news outlets, including The New York Times, from entering polling stations to interview voters.Some of those interviewed outside, where lines were short or nonexistent, said they hoped the government would use the new powers of the constituent assembly to crush the opposition, whose control of the legislature has already been weakened this year by the courts, which are aligned with the Maduro government.\u201cThe constituent assembly will be the power,\u201d said Javier Granadillo, a 46-year-old mechanic who voted in Caracas and blamed the opposition for the country\u2019s current crisis. \u201cIf any part of the government doesn\u2019t do its job, they will be dissolved.\u201dHowever, some polls leading up to Sunday\u2019s voting showed that large majorities of Venezuelans did not think their country needed a new Constitution.This month, Venezuelans issued a stinging rebuke to Mr. Maduro by turning out in droves during a symbolic vote held by the opposition. More than seven million votes were cast, opposition leaders said, with 98 percent against rewriting the Constitution.Election officials said on Sunday night that eight million people cast ballots, which would represent more than 40 percent of eligible voters. But lines observed by reporters throughout the country on Sunday cast doubt on the figure. An independent estimate by the investment bank Torino Capital, based on a poll of voting centers, estimated that between 3.1 million and four million voters cast ballots.The opposition made little headway in opposing the weekend of the vote. Leaders canceled a rally scheduled in the afternoon because of the clashes rocking the country. A demonstration on Friday, billed as a last stand against the vote, was poorly attended.Instead, opposition members took to their social media accounts to drum up support.\u201cToday\u2019s journey has been one of abstention and repression, with dead and wounded,\u201d wrote Henrique Capriles, the opposition governor of the state of Miranda who narrowly lost to Mr. Maduro in 2013\u2019s presidential election and was banned this year from running again. \u201cA monumental failure!\u201dThe focus of many voters in Caracas seemed to be on food, not politics. Venezuela remains in an economic tailspin, causing severe shortages of food and medicine.\u201cWhen the opposition got the National Assembly they said there would be food, and now it\u2019s even worse,\u201d said Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, 43, a government employee who said he supported Mr. Maduro.\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m asking of the constitutional assembly is that they start putting out food,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if they don\u2019t, the people are going to get angry.\u201dNicholas Casey reported from Bogot\u00e1, and Patricia Torres and Ana Vanessa Herrero from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Factories or Runways? Municipal Airports Face Economic Pressure", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetDETROIT \u2014 Coleman Young International Airport was once one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports and a thriving piece of Detroit\u2019s economy. But like so much else in the city, it festered for decades after the action moved to the suburbs.Now local officials want to reinvigorate the 264-acre plot. The question is whether that means it will survive as an airport or be remade for other purposes.The City Council this month is expected to select a firm to start studying options for the site, including using the land for a half-dozen new factories or other industrial uses. Unless the city uses the site for an economic development purpose, Mayor Mike Duggan\u2019s administration says, Detroit will soon run out of wide-open, city-owned spaces that can be offered to companies looking to build manufacturing or other commercial facilities here.Many council members, however, have said that the city should reinvest in the airport, saying it could be an economic engine as well.The debate in Detroit is not unusual. Cities across the nation are reconsidering the value of municipal airports in the era of superjumbo jets and budget cuts. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association estimated the nation loses 50 public-use airports a year.Almost all are general-aviation airports, ones that cater primarily to owners of private planes, and most have operating deficits that the cities must make up for in their budgets. Detroit, for instance, faces a $1.3 million operating loss in the 2017 fiscal year for Coleman Young, which averages just 30 landings a day. The main airport for the region is Detroit Metropolitan, a Delta Air Lines hub about 20 miles west of the city limits.Jed Howbert, the director of Mr. Duggan\u2019s team overseeing jobs and the economy, said Coleman Young\u2019s location, close to numerous freeways and a railroad spur, makes the site particularly appealing.\u201cWe may certainly figure out that it\u2019s worth keeping as an airport and investing more in the airport,\u201d he said, \u201cor we may decide there\u2019s better opportunity and might have a better impact on Detroit as a manufacturing and logistics center or some other thing we just haven\u2019t thought about.\u201dPlans to redevelop Bader Field, located within walking distance of Atlantic City\u2019s casino district, faltered when the city\u2019s economy collapsed at the onset of the most recent recession. In the process, tourist-dependent Atlantic City lost a key transportation amenity just as it desperately needed more visitors.\u201cAny pilot who flies over Bader Field just kind of looks at it wistfully like, \u2018I wish I could land there but I can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Paul Freeman, a private pilot and aerospace engineer who manages a website tracking the history of more than 2,000 former airfields in the United States.He said there were many cases of airports being closed \u201cand then some municipal bonds didn\u2019t happen or some business venture didn\u2019t happen and the end result is, 10 years later, the property\u2019s still there, the airport\u2019s still not running, it\u2019s deteriorating and it ends up benefiting nobody.\u201dThere are success stories, though. Austin, Tex., and Denver are examples of how a region can reap decades\u2019 worth of benefits from the redevelopment of former airports. Both cities shut theirs down in the 1990s and replaced them with modern suburban facilities, and both have realized billions of dollars in mixed-use, master-planned development on the old sites that continues to unfurl.Closing the Austin airport \u201cmagically released land in the center city,\u201d said Pam Hefner, redevelopment project manager for Austin. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s so rare and it\u2019s such an incredibly valuable resource.\u201dMany communities salivate over just that opportunity. In Kennewick, Wash., for instance, the tiny and money-losing Vista Field closed in 2013, and the regional planning agency is in the process of finishing a master plan for the now-vacant 103 acres.The community of about 210,000 residents along the Columbia River in southeastern Washington has struggled to keep its young people from leaving to pursue careers elsewhere. Skip Novakovich, president of the Port of Kennewick Commission, a three-person panel that oversees the area, said the commission was planning a new core with walkable neighborhoods and a mix of residential and commercial spaces.\u201cIt\u2019s been expensive, but it\u2019ll put $400 million on tax rolls,\u201d said Mr. Novakovich, referring to the project, which will require an investment of about $500 million. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the largest economic development project ever for this region. The only thing I\u2019m nervous about is if we develop it to what the public said they wanted and they say, \u2018Nope that\u2019s not what we wanted.\u2019\u201dAdvocates for revitalizing old airfields rather than closing them say they empathize with the communities looking for new economic development. Still, they worry that the reduction of airfields will hurt the overall American aviation system, which is built partly for travel but also to ensure ubiquitous landing sites in the event of national security events or natural disasters.\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that each of the individual institutions that own and operate these airports are making reasonable and genuinely rational decisions in terms of what affects them locally,\u201d said Thomas Thatcher, an architect and planner who wrote a 2011 report sponsored by the F.A.A. called \u201cA Guidebook for the Preservation of Public-Use Airports.\u201d \u201cBut when you take all of those individual good-faith decisions and accumulate them over a 10- or 20- or 30-year period across the nation, we might realize, Oh dear. On a collective basis, it created a terrible problem.\u201dIn Detroit, the fact that many City Council members began the study process disposed toward keeping Coleman Young bodes well for preservationists.Scott Benson, a councilman who represents the district that contains the airport and is a city planner by trade, views the property as an untapped gem whose value will only rise in this era of drones and internet shopping deliveries. Closing the airport, Mr. Benson argued, is a one-way street because shuttered airfields will not reopen and cities rarely find other sites that are as convenient. A new airport would also have to go through the rigors of passing environmental and community requirements, which are more stringent than when the original airports were founded.\u201cHaving a 260-acre international airport within the borders of a large city is an extremely unusual asset to have,\u201d Mr. Benson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just drop a city airport anywhere in the country. I have a really hard time thinking that the airline industry, the logistics industry, the aerospace industry is not salivating over the opportunity to get in there and invest.\u201dWith tens of thousands of abandoned homes being taken over and bulldozed by the city, many are baffled by the contention of the mayor\u2019s administration that there is no other land available for new industrial facilities.But Mr. Howbert, the city official, noted that those vacancies were a patchwork, not a large contiguous piece of land. For that, he said, Detroit has just one option right now for the areas \u2014 30 contiguous acres or more \u2014 needed for factories.\u201cThis began,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Howbert said, \u201cwhen we realized we\u2019re essentially out of large-scale parcels that are suitable for manufacturing or other large job-creating, industrial-type investments.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foxconn Says It Plans to Build Factory in Wisconsin, Adding 3,000 Jobs", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFoxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants, said Wednesday it would open its first major American factory in Wisconsin, a boost both for the battleground state\u2019s economy and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing.White House officials noted President Trump\u2019s direct negotiations with Foxconn for the project, which they said would create at least 3,000 jobs and represent a $10 billion investment.Mr. Trump joined Foxconn\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, at the White House for an announcement on Wednesday, with two Wisconsin Republicans, Gov. Scott Walker and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, in attendance.The new factory, which would produce flat-panel display screens for televisions and other consumer electronics, could raise Wisconsin\u2019s profile in advanced manufacturing. Older industrial firms in the state, like Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee, have struggled recently, with the motorcycle maker saying last week that it planned to lay off 180 workers.\u201cTV was invented in America,\u201d Mr. Gou said at the White House, before noting that products like LCD displays and similar technology were no longer made here. \u201cWe are going to change that. It starts today in Wisconsin.\u201dThe company did not identify exactly where the plant would be built but said it would be in Mr. Ryan\u2019s district in southeastern Wisconsin. Mr. Walker said that Foxconn would receive $3 billion in tax breaks and other subsidies over the next 15 years from the state.Like Mr. Trump\u2019s visits to a Carrier factory in Indianapolis in December and Snap-on\u2019s tool plant in Kenosha, Wis. in April, the White House event on Wednesday was as much a campaign-style rally as an economic announcement.\u201cThis is a great day today for American manufacturing and American workers and for everybody who believes in the concept, in the label, Made in the U.S.A.,\u201d he said. Mr. Gou, Mr. Trump said, \u201cjoins a growing list of industry leaders who understand America\u2019s capabilities are limitless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d see Terry and say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to give us one of these massive places,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get elected, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be spending $10 billion.\u201dMr. Trump hailed the Foxconn project as the latest sign that his efforts to promote advanced manufacturing in this country were succeeding.Most of Apple\u2019s iPhones are built by Foxconn in China, and Apple has said in the past that it would be very difficult to move that work to the United States.Foxconn\u2019s announcement could yield significant political benefits for the company and for the White House. Although based in Taiwan, much of the company\u2019s production is done in China, and Mr. Trump has singled out Beijing\u2019s trade practices for attacks.Mr. Walker said Foxconn\u2019s investment could indirectly result in an additional 22,000 new jobs, with its planned 20-million-square-foot complex occupying a footprint three times the size of the Pentagon.Even if the project did ultimately produce 25,000 new jobs, it would be a tiny fraction of the total number of jobs the United States economy has added during the most recent recovery. In the first half of 2017, for instance, the economy added a monthly average of 180,000 jobs; the manufacturing sector alone gained 41,000 jobs overall in that six-month period.Wisconsin was among the states in the Midwest that helped tip the election to Mr. Trump in November. At 3.1 percent, its unemployment rate is well below the national average of 4.4 percent, but the loss of relatively high-paying, blue-collar jobs has taken a toll in many parts of the state.Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Walker are influential national figures in the Republican party, adding to Wisconsin\u2019s appeal for Foxconn.That history left some experts skeptical of the company\u2019s latest commitment, and of the White House\u2019s eagerness to claim credit for a major economic victory.\u201cI\u2019ll be excited about the Foxconn announcement when workers are getting paychecks in Wisconsin,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonprofit partnership of domestic manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union. \u201cFoxconn has a history of talking big and not necessarily delivering on their commitments.\u201dStill, Mr. Paul said, \u201cI do hope this is built and there are tons of jobs.\u201d He noted that makers of consumer electronics long ago left the United States for Asia, even as factories making heavy goods like cars, jet engines and steel managed to hang on in this country.\u201cOver and over, we\u2019ve heard the excuse that consumer electronics can\u2019t be brought back,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cI do hope this succeeds because it shows these sourcing decisions are more about choices than capabilities. There\u2019s very little electronic display production in the United States now.\u201dAndy Tsay, a business professor at Santa Clara University who has studied where companies build factories, said that a new Foxconn plant could make sense given the products it will be making.\u201cA flat-panel display is not a small thing, with today\u2019s TVs; it\u2019s certainly not inexpensive to ship,\u201d he said. \u201cBuilding close to where the customers are makes sense for a product like that.\u201dMr. Gou has been opportunistic about opening factories to meet the broader aims of his business.Professor Tsay said that when Foxconn won its first order to make desktop computer chassis for Dell, the computer maker insisted that production occur in the United States. So Mr. Gou bought a company in Kansas City to do it.Although the right combination of factors can make manufacturing feasible anywhere, Mr. Tsay said he doubted Apple planned to build factories in the United States, as Mr. Trump suggested this week, unless it decided to build a large product such as a car.Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about plans by Foxconn to build a factory in Wisconsin misstated, in some copies, the average number of jobs the economy added per month in the first half of 2017. It was an average of 180,000 jobs, not 80,000 jobs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After North Korea Test, South Korea Pushes to Build Up Its Own Missiles", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea announced Saturday that it will soon start talks with the Trump administration about allowing Seoul to build more powerful ballistic missiles to counter the North, but current and former American officials said the move would have little effect on the most urgent problem facing Washington: North Korea\u2019s apparent ability to strike California and beyond.The new missiles that South Korea wants, in addition to being able to strike deep into the North, could be a way of pressuring China to restrain Pyongyang because the missiles would probably be able to hit Chinese territory as well.Mr. Moon\u2019s top national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, called his White House counterpart, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, early on Saturday Seoul time to propose that the allies immediately start negotiations to permit South Korea to build up its missile capabilities. General McMaster agreed to the proposal, which would probably involve increasing the payload on South Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles, according to officials in both countries.South Korea needs approval from the United States to build more powerful missiles under the terms of a bilateral treaty.There are still questions over whether the North can shrink a nuclear weapon to fit atop its intercontinental missiles, or keep it from burning up on re-entry into the atmosphere.But at the Pentagon and inside American intelligence agencies, there was a sense that the North had now crossed a threshold it has long sought: Demonstrating that if the United States ever threatened the regime of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader and grandson of the country\u2019s founder, it had the ability to threaten death and destruction in the continental United States.The United States has lived with that threat from Russia and China for decades, but the last four American presidents have all said the country could not take that risk with a government as unpredictable as North Korea\u2019s.Hours after Friday\u2019s test, some former American officials said President Trump\u2019s options were limited.\u201cIn the White House you have a threshold decision: Can you get them back to the table or not,\u201d Mark W. Lippert, President Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Seoul, said Saturday about negotiating with the North Koreans \u2014 a step Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign, and again several months ago, he was willing to try. Mr. Lippert said he supports Washington\u2019s current diplomatic efforts as well as United Nations sanctions against the North.But so far, the North has not responded, perhaps calculating that it first wanted to demonstrate it was a permanent member of the club of nuclear-armed nations, and able to strike American cities, to strengthen its position before any negotiation.Mr. Lippert, speaking at a conference in Kent, Conn., said that barring negotiations, \u201cthe question gets binary pretty quick: containment or some kind of military operations.\u201dOthers question whether this administration, immersed in its own internal upheavals, can focus on the problem.\u201cIt takes a president of the United States who has the intellectual, global and historical depth\u201d to deal with the Korean crisis, said R. Nicholas Burns, who served as undersecretary of state for political affairs in the Bush administration.Some believe the United States will simply learn to live with the North\u2019s new capability, despite the words of Mr. Trump and his predecessors.\u201cWe are left in a situation where they believe we will ultimately acquiesce,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, an American diplomat who led nuclear negotiations with North Korea during the last Bush administration, which resulted in the dismantlement of part of a plutonium reactor. Mr. Hill is now dean of the Korbel School at the University of Denver.\u201cChina is gravely concerned with the course of action taken by South Korea,\u201d a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said in the statement. \u201cDeploying Thaad won\u2019t solve South Korea\u2019s security concerns, won\u2019t solve the related issues on the Korean Peninsula and will only further complicate issues.\u201dIn Washington, Mr. Trump accused China of failing to curb North Korea\u2019s aggression and signaled he would restrict trade with Beijing as a consequence.\u201cI am very disappointed in China,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Saturday night post on Twitter. \u201cOur foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue.\u201d\u201cChina could easily solve this problem!\u201d Mr. Trump said.On Friday, just as news of the North Korean test was breaking, the man who engineered the opening of America\u2019s diplomatic relations with China, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, argued the administration needed a new and different approach to convincing the Chinese to take a more forceful stance.\u201cI believe we have a better chance of getting to the nuclear problem with North Korea if we first come to an agreement with China about what follows after the collapse of the North Korean regime,\u201d Mr. Kissinger said. That would include a commitment from the United States to withdraw most of its troops from the Korean Peninsula after a North Korean collapse, to allay the Chinese fear that, with the buffer of North Korea gone, the United States military would be right on its border.Mr. Kissinger has made the proposal to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and other officials, according to people familiar with those conversations. But many doubt the Chinese would trust the American commitment, perhaps noting that the promises to integrate Russia into the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall never came to pass.Missile analysts remain uncertain and even doubtful that North Korea has cleared all the technical hurdles to build a reliable nuclear-tipped ICBM. But the test on Friday night left little doubt that the country, although cut off from most of the global economy and hit with several rounds of United Nations sanctions, was getting closer to its goal of arming itself with long-range missiles that can deliver nuclear warheads to the United States.South Korea fears that by building nuclear missiles that can reach major American cities, North Korea is trying to weaken the United States\u2019 resolve over whether to intervene on the South\u2019s behalf should war break out on the Korean Peninsula.\u201cWe must actively look for measures to secure our military\u2019s own forces to deter and effectively deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats,\u201d Mr. Moon said after an emergency meeting of his National Security Council on Saturday.South Korea wants to build ballistic missiles that can deliver more powerful payloads to targets in the North, including the location of its leadership and its missile and nuclear sites, most of which are hidden deep underground, defense officials here said. A hurdle to that ambition has been a treaty signed with Washington in the 1970s in return for American help in building its missiles.(South Korea can already load warheads weighing up to two tons on ballistic missiles with shorter ranges, but those missiles cannot reach key missile bases in northern North Korea.)The South Korean demands reflected growing regional jitters over how the North\u2019s growing missile capabilities may affect Washington\u2019s defense commitment to its allies in the region. On Saturday, Mr. Moon warned that the latest North Korean test could lead to \u201ca fundamental change in the security structure in Northeast Asia.\u201d\u201cU.S. policy for 21 years has been to prevent this day from coming, and now it has,\u201d said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington, referring to the North\u2019s ICBM test on Friday. \u201cNorth Korea didn\u2019t test an ICBM to launch a bolt from the blue against Washington; they\u2019re hoping to split the United States from its allies.\u201dBarry Pavel, director of the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security at the Atlantic Council, said North Korea could use a nuclear-tipped ICBM capability to \u201ctarget the United States and deter U.S. security cooperation with its close Asian allies.\u201dNorth Korea first tested its ICBM, the Hwasong-14, on July 4, although in that earlier launching, it did not demonstrate the missile\u2019s full range.\u201cThe U.S. trumpeting about war and extreme sanctions and threat against the D.P.R.K. only emboldens the latter and offers a better excuse for its access to nukes,\u201d said Mr. Kim, the North\u2019s leader, referring to the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, after watching the missile test on Friday.\u201cAs the principal economic enablers of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.But there is a growing frustration over China\u2019s reluctance to use its economic leverage to rein in the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions and over Washington\u2019s inability to persuade Beijing. China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s external trade, but it fears the collapse of the Communist government on its border more than a nuclear-armed North.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and David E.

{"Headline": "Banking Regulatory Nominees Back Fewer Financial Restrictions", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Randal Quarles, nominated by President Trump to supervise the nation\u2019s largest banks, told senators on Thursday that it was time to reconsider some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Quarles appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, which is considering his nomination as the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman of supervision. The committee also questioned Joseph Otting, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for comptroller of the currency.The Fed has wide-ranging responsibility for financial regulation, including oversight of the largest financial companies, like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.The comptroller\u2019s office supervises the banking subsidiaries of those companies.The hearing showcased the basic divide between the two political parties on financial regulation. Republicans argue that the federal government overreacted to the 2008 financial crisis, imposing unnecessary restrictions that are now impeding economic growth. Democrats not only oppose a rollback, but say some areas require stronger rules.Democrats described both nominees as the wrong kind of people for the jobs. \u201cWe need people in government who are willing to stand up to large financial institutions, and we need people who have a demonstrated history of doing that,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Mr. Quarles. \u201cAnd you simply don\u2019t.\u201dRepublicans, by contrast, described the two men\u2019s private-sector experience as valuable. \u201cI actually find that refreshing,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He said career bureaucrats tend to \u201cregulate, regulate, regulate more.\u201dHe added, \u201cI hope you all will get in there and right-size the regulations.\u201dMr. Quarles and Mr. Otting circumvented questions about specific regulations, offering at most general views. Asked about the Volcker Rule, which seeks to keep banks from speculative investments, both men said it should be simplified.Asked about regulation of the insurance industry, both agreed there should be less.The sharpest questions focused on the two nominees\u2019 backgrounds.Mr. Otting was hired as chief executive of OneWest Bank in California in 2010, working under the company\u2019s chairman, Steven Mnuchin, who is now the Treasury secretary. OneWest was a resurrection of the failed mortgage lender IndyMac, and Mr. Otting presided over thousands of foreclosures as the company sought to limit the losses from its bubble-era mortgage lending. In 2011, federal regulators accused the company of failing to follow legal requirements in some cases. Mr. Otting signed a consent order, but he insisted on Thursday that he did not accept the government\u2019s findings of wrongdoing.\u201cThere were errors,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think we never made errors.\u201d But he said the company had not engaged in purposeful shortcuts and deceptions, like the \u201crobosigning\u201d of the documents required to take away a borrower\u2019s home.Democrats responded with incredulity. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada read aloud from the government\u2019s findings, concluding: \u201cThat is robosigning.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, quoted the speech on Thursday, noting that his constituents had suffered greatly as a result of industry experiments.Mr. Quarles responded with contrition. \u201cThat is probably the most unfortunate use of language I have ever made and I do not stand behind that statement,\u201d he said.Both nominees have the support of Senate Republicans and are expected to be confirmed, although the timing remains uncertain.Mr. Quarles, if confirmed, also will sit on the Fed panel that makes monetary policy, the Open Market Committee. He said Thursday that the Fed should adopt a mathematical rule for determining the level of its benchmark interest rates. Conservatives say following such a rule would make Fed policy more stable and predictable, which in turn would benefit the economy. Mr. Quarles said he took \u201cvery seriously\u201d the Fed\u2019s statutory obligation to minimize unemployment.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Nursing Home Deal Spurs Questions About Chinese Money", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 No nursing home wants to be known for uncertainty and intrigue.So a Canadian retirement home chain found itself in an uncomfortable position last year when it agreed to be bought by a politically connected Chinese company with a shadowy group of owners. Regulators approved the deal even though the buyer was under regulatory scrutiny in the United States, and while critics in Canada questioned the identities of its local representatives.Today, the chairman of the Chinese buyer, Anbang Insurance Group, is being held by the Chinese police for undisclosed reasons \u2014 and critics say the deal represents the latest example of Canada\u2019s troublingly lax attitude toward Chinese money flooding into the country.\u201cWhen the Anbang house of cards finally collapses, who will gain control of these senior care facilities in B.C.?\u201d Mark R. Strahl, a lawmaker with Canada\u2019s opposition Conservative Party, asked at a parliamentary session last month, referring to the province of British Columbia. \u201cAre seniors about to find out that their landlord is actually the People\u2019s Republic of China?\u201dCanada, like the United States and other countries, is grappling with how to handle billions of dollars of Chinese purchases on its home turf. Recent purchases have included big oil companies, swank office buildings and cutting-edge tech firms. That last set, in particular, has raised objections in the United States as well as Canada from those worried that they could give China access to sensitive technologies.\u201cThere\u2019s an emerging pattern here of being na\u00efve with regard to China, and lax with regard to national security,\u201d said Michael Byers, a Canada Research Chair at the University of British Columbia.That leaves Canadian officials in a fix. China has helped lift Canada\u2019s economy with tens of billions of dollars a year in exports. Its investments are often in businesses like nursing homes that could use the money. Many of those transactions have little to do with national security or other sensitive issues.The anxieties, said Yuen Pau Woo, who represents British Columbia in Canada\u2019s Senate, reflect \u201ca longstanding tradition to simply be suspicious of and prejudiced against foreign ownership.\u201dNow some critics are focusing on the deals themselves.The United States will review the Norsat deal, said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which monitors security issues for Congress.\u201cThe U.S. and Canada have a unique security, defense and intelligence relationship,\u201d Mr. Wessel said in an email. \u201cAs such, any transaction that impacts upon these critical areas need to be strictly scrutinized.\u201dThe Trudeau administration defended the recent deals, saying they were thoroughly vetted under Canadian takeover law. \u201cOur government has a balanced approach of openness to ideas, people and trade,\u201d said Hans Parmar, a spokesman for Canada\u2019s economic development ministry.That law, called the Investment Canada Act, is similar to the takeover review laws of the United States. Government officials make recommendations to the economic development minister, who can block the deal.\u201cIn that regard, most investment in Canada is not subject to any review at all,\u201d said Josh Krane, a partner at the law firm Blake, Cassels & Graydon.The government points to recent moves to tighten regulations, including a 2015 requirement that investors declare whether a foreign state had financial interests or other influence over them.Anbang\u2019s deal for the retirement home chain, Retirement Concepts, went through Canada\u2019s deal review process.Anbang burst onto the global deal scene three years ago when it unveiled a deal to buy New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel for about $2 billion. But questions about ownership have dogged the company. The New York Times reported last year that many of the company\u2019s owners had links to its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, who according to Anbang\u2019s public records does not own shares himself. Such ownership issues can be sensitive in China, where the wealthy and powerful often hold shares in companies in the names of other people.In November, Anbang said it would purchase Retirement Concepts, which owns more than 20 retirement homes across Canada. Medical groups, unions and doctors quickly criticized the deal, asking whether a foreign buyer could be held accountable.The deal was approved in February. Four months later, Anbang was back in the news after Mr. Wu, Anbang\u2019s chairman, was detained by the Chinese police for undisclosed reasons.Tim Ragones, a spokesman for Anbang, said its North American operations were unaffected. \u201cWe continue to operate our properties and move forward with our development projects,\u201d he said in an email. Retirement Concepts did not respond to requests for comment.Scott Sinclair, a fellow at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a think tank, says he worries that Anbang intended only to use Retirement Concepts as a foreign supply of cash \u2014 one it could squeeze if it came under more official pressure in China.\u201cThe Canadian government didn\u2019t get any assurances from Anbang to protect vulnerable seniors, aside from the promise to maintain existing staffing levels,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that, this was pretty much a blank check for Anbang.\u201dEdward Wong in Princeton, N.J., contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save the Census", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAn administration uninterested in staffing federal agencies, at war with facts and eager to help Congress cut the budget is further endangering a cornerstone of American democracy: the duty to count all who live here.Every decade since 1790, as required by the Constitution, the federal government has undertaken a painstaking census of its people, the accuracy and fairness of which serves the interests of both political parties and of every citizen. The decennial count is used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and set the boundaries of congressional districts. It determines how tens of billions of dollars in federal aid are divvied up.Mr. Trump poses an additional threat: His repeated efforts to discredit voter registration data and government employment numbers leave census officials worried that a random tweet from him could discourage more people from participating. Census professionals worry that the administration\u2019s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants could make them wary of providing information about themselves and where they live.The census is the federal government\u2019s chief source of data about the American people and economy, a sweeping endeavor. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do the investment at the front end, you can\u2019t fix it later,\u201d says Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan advocate for a more effective federal government.The census begins on April 1, 2020, and it must be completed in the summer for congressional reapportionment and redistricting to take place. Any failure would be immediately apparent \u2014 and it would tar Republicans at the height of the 2020 primary campaign season. Perhaps that reality will help inspire congressional leaders to support an accurate count, demonstrating to Americans that, even in the age of Trump, facts matter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flying Is Bad for the Planet. You Can Help Make It Better.", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re flying, you\u2019re adding a significant amount of planet-warming gases to the atmosphere \u2014 there\u2019s no way around it. But there are some ways to make your airplane travel a little bit greener.(For perspective, the global average was about five tons of carbon dioxide per person in 2013.)When you buy carbon offsets, you pay to take planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in exchange for the greenhouse gases you put in. For example, you can put money toward replanting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.To offset the almost 0.9-metric-ton carbon footprint of a single passenger traveling on United from New York to San Francisco in July and back again, Sustainable Travel International, which runs United\u2019s offset program, offers two choices: Donate $8.95 to a wind farm in Texas or donate $10.75 to a forest conservation program in Peru.Extremely hot days are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades, potentially disrupting our everyday lives.There\u2019s some debate about the best way to offset \u2014 where and when tree-planting programs should occur for maximum effect, for example.To make sure that an offset program really does what it says, it has to meet several criteria, including that it be verified by an independent third party. All of the programs used by the major airlines are verified by such groups to make sure they provide the carbon reduction effects that the companies claim.In business class and first class, seats are bigger, so fewer people are being moved by the same amount of fuel. The study estimates that a first-class seat could have a carbon footprint as much as nine times as big as an economy one.At last, coach passengers have something to be happy about: smaller carbon footprints.Apparently, some of the rules about lowering and raising your window shades could help cut emissions.When you land at a warm destination, flight attendants might ask you to shut your window shades, said Christine Boucher, a director of global environmental sustainability for Delta Air Lines.The reason? It reduces the amount of fuel used to cool the aircraft when it\u2019s sitting at the gate, she said.This won\u2019t do anything to counteract all the emissions the plane created while flying. But it\u2019s an example of how far airlines will go to save fuel when they can. That helps their bottom lines, but also the environment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "United Airlines Profit Rises Despite Boycott Threats Over Passenger Treatment", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo much for the outrage directed at United Airlines.The results point to an underlying principle about the airline business: Passengers, by and large, look for the most convenient and cheapest fares, not which airlines claim to offer the best service. The case of Dr. Dao and the initial public reaction put that principle to the test. A video of airport security officers dragging him off a flight on April 9 ricocheted around the world after another passenger posted it to Twitter. Dr. Dao\u2019s lawyer said the removal, to make his seat available to a United employee, had left Dr. Dao with a broken nose, a concussion, two knocked-out teeth and sinus problems.Dr. Dao\u2019s treatment touched a nerve among fliers, who have been squeezing into smaller seats on crowded aircraft. Air travel has become an increasingly uncomfortable experience for all but the wealthiest passengers.But spurning an airline is challenging, given the waves of consolidation that have put the majority of flights in the United States under the control of four carriers \u2014 United, Delta, American and Southwest. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult at this point in time for consumers to exact a penalty against airlines that have exhibited poor customer service\u201d or been involved in a high-profile situation like Mr. Dao\u2019s removal, said John Kwoka Jr., a Northeastern University economics professor who has advised state attorneys general on airline mergers.Also complicating those calls is the simple fact that for many leisure fliers, price is paramount. United is finding ways to reach those fliers. Like other carriers, United has introduced \u201cbasic economy\u201d tickets that offer a bare-bones travel experience for the lowest cost possible on any given route. \u201cWhat the airlines have learned is the customer cares about low prices more than anything else,\u201d said Michael J.

{"Headline": "How the Death of a Muslim Recruit Revealed a Culture of Brutality in the Marines", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "FeatureRecruits at Parris Island have been subjected to severe hazing, far beyond that experienced in other U.S. military boot camps. Is this really the only way to create a warrior?Supported bySilence.\u2018\u2018Raheel?\u2019\u2019 she said. The phone was dead. The call lasted less than five seconds. In her darkened living room in Taylor, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, Ghazala worried. The previous morning, Raheel, a 20-year-old Marine Corps recruit, left for boot camp on Parris Island, S.C. He had promised to call his parents when he arrived, and Ghazala and her husband, Masood, had been waiting by the phone. But the call, when it came, was strange, with an almost deafening noise in the background. Ghazala couldn\u2019t be sure it was even him. In the morning, she phoned Raheel\u2019s recruiter. \u2018\u2018No one knows my son\u2019s voice better than me,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018That didn\u2019t sound like my son.\u2019\u2019The Siddiquis, who emigrated from Pakistan in the 1990s, hadn\u2019t wanted their precious oldest child, and only boy, to join the Marines. Slender and unathletic, Raheel had always seemed most content designing video games on his computer. He graduated ninth in the class of 2014 from Taylor\u2019s Harry S. Truman High School, a valedictorian with his pick of colleges, including a full academic scholarship to Michigan State. After months of deliberation, he decided on the University of Michigan\u2019s Dearborn campus, where he enrolled in September 2014, lured by its new program in robotics engineering. But the following July, after his freshman year, Raheel drastically changed course, announcing to his family that he had decided to leave college and enlist in the Marines.Ghazala didn\u2019t understand. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re intelligent \u2014 why?\u2019\u2019 she pleaded with him. Raheel tried to placate her. It was a \u2018\u2018golden opportunity,\u2019\u2019 he told his parents. \u2018\u2018After three years in the Marine Corps, I can do anything.\u2019\u2019That call was the last time she heard her son\u2019s voice.Raheel was raised in public housing and spent his high school years intent on escaping his shabby hometown. \u2018\u2018He always wanted challenges,\u2019\u2019 says Jerry Abraham, a former guidance counselor at Truman High whom Raheel frequently enlisted to help him find the hardest classes. In pursuit of a perfect G.P.A., Raheel had virtually no social life, though he had a na\u00efve optimism unusual for a teenager. \u2018\u2018He saw the world as nothing but a wonderful place,\u2019\u2019 says Karey Lee, Raheel\u2019s supervisor at a nearby Home Depot, where he worked part time on the customer-service desk. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think he knew that hatefulness existed, to be honest.\u2019\u2019Military recruiters were fixtures at Truman High. The Marines, the most selective of the armed services, came to campus twice a week. \u2018\u2018They targeted the kids that were more college-oriented and capable of being successful,\u2019\u2019 says Abraham, whose office was in the same building as the school\u2019s R.O.T.C. program. They were also quick to reject students who failed to meet their standards, which include scores in the top third on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (Asvab) test and no history of serious drug use, crime or tattoos that the Marines consider \u2018\u2018undesirable.\u2019\u2019 Like many of his classmates, Raheel took the Asvab and scored high. With his talents, drive and rigid focus, he would very likely have struck recruiters as the \u2018\u2018golden goose,\u2019\u2019 as one former Marine put it.The University of Michigan-Dearborn was the most prestigious school to which Raheel applied, and in April 2014 he was accepted and given a $2,000 scholarship. It was not the full academic scholarship he was offered by Michigan State, but with the hefty financial aid he would receive, it was \u2018\u2018technically a full free ride,\u2019\u2019 Raheel announced on Facebook. The assistance, however, came with strings: Should his grades dip below a C average, he wouldn\u2019t receive any more money until they went back up.Raheel enrolled in Michigan\u2019s honors program, a special track requiring students to maintain a 3.2 G.P.A. He assumed it would be easy. Lee, his boss at Home Depot, estimated that Raheel probably worked about 20 hours a week his freshman year, though it never occurred to her to ask why he needed to work so many hours if school was paid for. \u2018\u2018He never talked about what he did with the money,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I assumed he was doing well at school because, I mean, he was a genius.\u2019\u2019After high school, Raheel had told his mother she should stop working odd jobs and let him contribute to the family\u2019s income. Massood didn\u2019t make much at an auto-parts factory, and Raheel was concerned about how the family would pay for his 16-year-old sister to attend college. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s face it,\u2019\u2019 he confided to a friend, \u2018\u2018she\u2019s not going to get a full scholarship, and my parents can\u2019t afford to send her, so I have to make sure she goes.\u2019\u2019It was a lot for an 18-year-old. His grades began to suffer. By December, Raheel was getting Cs. Worried that he might fail chemistry, he texted his friend Nathan Pykor, also a student at the Dearborn campus: \u2018\u2018I just feel too STRESSED over all of my classes because I haven\u2019t dedicated enough time.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You\u2019re fine,\u2019\u2019 Pykor, who had known Raheel since high school, replied. \u2018\u2018You know that it\u2019s nearly impossible to get a 4.0 in college.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not fine,\u2019\u2019 Raheel texted back.His solution, he told Pykor, was to withdraw from his classes and \u2018\u2018start fresh\u2019\u2019 in the spring, which he did, finishing the semester with three As and a B. But as Pykor told me, withdrawing from his classes very likely meant Raheel would owe the University of Michigan the money it had given him to attend classes in the fall. It also could have jeopardized his aid package for the following year.On June 16, 2015, Raheel posted on Facebook for the first time in a while. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m thinking about joining the military. Maybe the Marines.\u2019\u2019 Just three weeks later, on July 8, he signed his enlistment papers and entered the Marines\u2019 Delayed Entry Program, which, lasting anywhere between a month and a year, is designed to stagger the number of recruits the corps can train at any one time. It\u2019s also intended to indoctrinate \u2018\u2018poolees,\u2019\u2019 as they are called, into the culture of the Marines. \u2018\u2018The D.E.P. is all about selling the Kool-Aid,\u2019\u2019 says a lance corporal who also enlisted in the Marines in 2015, after his freshman year. (\u2018\u2018I decided I didn\u2019t like college enough to justify all that debt,\u2019\u2019 he told me.) \u2018\u2018You meet every Saturday, and they\u2019ll tell you stories, do little workouts,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018tell you some lies.\u2019\u2019 Like \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Yeah, I\u2019m always in my room playing Xbox,\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s all this time to party\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 \u2014 anything that will appeal to college kids.Raheel spent close to eight months in the D.E.P. under the tutelage of his recruiter, who the Siddiquis said told them that Raheel was his most motivated poolee. Ghazala marveled at the changes in her son, who now woke each day at 4 a.m. to spend hours at the gym. Any doubts his mother had about his education were assuaged by Raheel\u2019s own assurances: He said he had been told that he could continue his education while serving, and that, having chosen a technical specialty, working on Marine aircraft, he might not even have to fight unless he wanted to. (In fact, Marines I spoke to said it was nearly impossible to pursue an education during their first enlistment; once deployed, every Marine has to be prepared to fight if suddenly under attack.) At Raheel\u2019s urging, Ghazala visited the recruiting office in Taylor, where she says that recruiters assured her that Raheel\u2019s safety wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u2018\u2018I feel like they\u2019re really good at lying,\u2019\u2019 says the lance corporal, who was sold on the corps by recruiting videos that presented the Marines as \u2018\u2018badasses\u2019\u2019 on humanitarian missions to save refugees or deliver food and water. Raheel told his parents that enlisting in the Marines would put him on the fast track to join the F.B.I., which, to their total surprise, had become his life\u2019s dream. A few weeks before he left for boot camp, Raheel stopped by Truman to tell some of his old teachers about his plans. Abraham pressed him on his decision, but Raheel\u2019s mind was made up.\u2018\u2018Be careful,\u2019\u2019 Raheel\u2019s friend Hussein Chehab, who worked with him at Home Depot, says he told him before he left. \u2018\u2018Just .\u2009.\u2009. watch yourself. You don\u2019t know what kinds of people are down there. You don\u2019t know how other people think.\u2019\u2019History, or what Marines call \u2018\u2018knowledge,\u2019\u2019 lives on Parris Island. Everything about the place is an elegy to the corps, from the statue of Marines lifting the flag on Iwo Jima to the street names, each one its own small lesson: Boulevard de France, Cuba Street, Wake Boulevard, Saigon Drive. Inside the Recruit Chapel, a series of stained-glass windows depicts chapters of Marine heroism and sacrifice. In one, a platoon of Marines rests in the hand of God. In another, a ragtag band of soldiers and sailors stands before the gates of heaven guarded by stoic, crisply dressed Marines.The Marines are America\u2019s smallest conventional military force, with just 184,000 active-duty troops. They are also the military\u2019s most insular warriors \u2014 with the possible exception of Navy SEALs \u2014 whose tight bond, or \u2018\u2018esprit de corps,\u2019\u2019 grows out of the codes, traditions and reverence for suffering that Marines believe set them apart from civilians and all other military branches.Central to this identity is the uniquely miserable experience of boot camp, where since World War II, as the historian Aaron O\u2019Connell writes in his 2012 book, \u2018\u2018Underdogs: The Making of the Modern Marine Corps,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Recruits [have] learned in ways they would not forget that what made Marines exceptional was their ability to endure more pain than members of their sister services.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Making\u2019\u2019 Marines, as the corps calls recruit training, is a three-part process, with boot camp being the first and most grueling test. Its purpose, unlike Army boot camp, is not to train war-fighters; for Marines, that comes in the second and third phases of training. Boot camp is meant to create the \u2018\u2018warrior spirit,\u2019\u2019 as the corps puts it, over three months of group indoctrination intended to strip recruits of individuality and, through repeated exposure to pain and physical challenge, condition them to accept and perform violence.In his 1984 memoir, \u2018\u2018First to Fight,\u2019\u2019 the esteemed Marine lieutenant general Victor Krulak, known as Brute, spoke of the \u2018\u2018almost mystical alchemy\u2019\u2019 that happens during boot camp, whose shared hardships he saw as \u2018\u2018the genesis of the enduring sense of brotherhood that characterizes the corps.\u2019\u2019 But the lines between hard training and abuse can blur. Like every other branch of the military, the Marine Corps has official strictures against hazing, which it defines as any unauthorized verbal or physical conduct of a \u2018\u2018cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning or harmful\u2019\u2019 nature. The Marines have nonetheless investigated hundreds of hazing allegations in the past five years alone. (The particulars of the hazing incidents in this article were taken largely from redacted reports prepared by the Marines in the course of their investigations. Details like names and dialogue were provided by eyewitnesses and other recruits.) \u2018\u2018There is a natural tension between an organization that trains people for lethality and the larger culture,\u2019\u2019 a Marine reserve officer told me. \u2018\u2018Inside the culture, you\u2019re supposed to be able to take a punch and give a punch and crush a skull. Outside, this is not something that\u2019s valued.\u2019\u2019The bedrock of Marine tradition is a long-ago era when buff, male and mostly white combat Marines launched amphibious early-morning assaults on enemy beaches armed with M1 rifles and Ka-Bar knives. Today\u2019s far less homogeneous troops roll into battle in armored Humvees or tanks, with sophisticated high-powered weaponry and thermal-imaging goggles. Many never leave their base at all, waging war remotely while operating a joystick or writing code. In many ways, the Marines have become indistinguishable from the Army.Adapting to these harsh truths hasn\u2019t been easy for the corps, whose current and former officials, with some exceptions, were reluctant to speak openly about these challenges except on condition of anonymity. \u2018\u2018The Marines have a purpose, and it\u2019s a militant purpose,\u2019\u2019 one senior officer says. \u2018\u2018We are an organization grounded on the physical, but wars are not as physical anymore. The character of war has evolved a lot from the early 20th century. The question is: Has our force evolved? I don\u2019t think it has.\u2019\u2019Once inside the doors, the mystical journey from civilian to Marine known as the Transformation begins. It\u2019s pandemonium. Drill instructors scream from every direction as the kids, scrambling to individual metal desks, are ordered to fill out administrative paperwork, signaling their completion by raising their right hand, with pen, above their heads. From there it\u2019s on to the phone bank, where, with instructors bawling at them to finish, recruits are told to make three- or four-second calls home, reading as fast as they can from a five-line script taped to the phone box:The rest of the intake process, known as \u2018\u2018receiving,\u2019\u2019 follows over the next few days: buzz cuts, boots, uniforms, shots. They are given physical-fitness tests, fed what most describe as truly awful food and ordered to perform seemingly meaningless tasks, like standing at attention while holding their heavy gear in front of them until their arms give out, or sitting cross-legged and motionless on the floor for hours. Some Marines I interviewed recalled being kept awake for nearly two days after arriving. \u2018\u2018All you can think about is sleep,\u2019\u2019 one said. \u2018\u2018Those are the main tools: fear and sleep deprivation.\u2019\u2019Drill instructors, or D.I.s, are revered on Parris Island, where they roam the base with a special aura. \u2018\u2018Nobody will counter them,\u2019\u2019 one senior Marine official told me. \u2018\u2018Without them, there is no Parris Island.\u2019\u2019 Some D.I.s are not much older than the recruits. Only a small fraction have been to war. Almost all adopt the mien of an infantry grunt, though in truth, most D.I.s, like most Marines, aren\u2019t combat troops but rather part of the corps\u2019s expanding cast of supporting players: mechanics, air traffic controllers, technicians, clerks. Some Marines I spoke with described boot camp as a performance: The lead actors are the D.I.s, men and women who for the first time in their professional lives are embodying the macho warrior archetype they were taught to venerate as recruits.To qualify for D.I. training, a Marine must have finished at least one term of enlistment and be given a clean psychological bill of health as determined by what the Marine officials insist is rigorous testing aimed at weeding out those Marines suffering from PTSD. They must also complete an 11-week drill-instructor school, where, as one former officer puts it, they are taught to \u2018\u2018mold these guys into killers.\u2019\u2019 D.I. school, by all accounts, is almost as intense as boot camp. This is by design; every moment of a drill instructor\u2019s schedule is tightly scripted and charted on what the corps calls its \u2018\u2018training matrix.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The system is very unforgiving on the D.I.,\u2019\u2019 says Gary Lee, a retired Marine sergeant major who helped design the training program in 1995. \u2018\u2018They never get a break from their responsibilities.\u2019\u2019 During a 12-week training cycle, D.I.s spend almost all their time on their feet. Their voices croak with exhaustion and strain. They barely sleep.The stress of the job, coupled with the near-unbridled power given to drill instructors, creates a dangerous alchemy. This has been particularly true on Parris Island, whose violent \u2018\u2018shadow culture,\u2019\u2019 as it has been described to me, exceeds San Diego\u2019s. Since 2014, there have been 24 official hazing investigations on Parris Island, half of them substantiated. There is a perspective on the base \u2018\u2018that somehow you can make a better Marine by beating the shit out of him,\u2019\u2019 says the retired Marine general Charles Krulak, Brute Krulak\u2019s son. \u2018\u2018I have argued consistently that it\u2019s not true \u2014 you do not make a better Marine by treating them that way; in fact, it\u2019s totally against what we as a Marine Corps stand for. But it\u2019s a mentality that has existed down there for so long.\u2019\u2019In 1995, Charles Krulak became the commandant of the Marine Corps and decided this culture had to change. Krulak and his team came up with what they called the transformation process, which overhauled boot camp to incorporate an agenda based on the Marines\u2019 \u2018\u2018core values\u2019\u2019 \u2014 honor, courage, commitment \u2014 into every aspect of basic training. The goal, Krulak says, was to create \u2018\u2018a smarter, more selfless, more adept and more educated Marine.\u2019\u2019 It channeled the violence of Marine Corps training into specific moments, the most important being the Crucible, a grueling 54-hour physical and psychological endurance test that comes at the end of the training cycle, and was intended as the final and, in Krulak\u2019s mind, only arbiter of whether a recruit is ready to become a Marine.The transformation process managed to curtail hazing for a few years, says Krulak, who retired from the corps in 1999. \u2018\u2018As I recall, the number of courts-martial had a significant decrease during those four or five years when I was commandant. Problem was, after I left we had a changing world. I think in all these years of war, we lost a bit of our focus,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018There are people who think war entitles them to behave any way they want.\u2019\u2019As new waves of recruits passed through Parris Island after Sept. 11, the Marines rushed to meet the demands for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of the reforms Krulak had put in place began to erode. Without the structure to support them, it was easy for some drill instructors to fall back on the violent methods they themselves experienced at boot camp. In 2005, a film crew from a South Carolina TV station inadvertently caught a terrified-looking recruit named Jason Tharp being hit by a drill instructor at the Parris Island pool. The following day, Tharp drowned during water-survival training; his drill instructor was charged with negligent homicide (and later acquitted). In 2011, a Parris Island drill instructor was sent to the brig for more than a year after he was found guilty of ordering one of his recruits to record a video of himself masturbating on the D.I.\u2019s cellphone. The next year, a trainee received second- and third-degree burns to his buttocks requiring skin grafts after his drill instructor ordered him \u2018\u2018to perform unauthorized exercises under an upside-down laundry bin on a floor covered in bleach,\u2019\u2019 according to Marine Corps documents. The D.I. was court-martialed in 2014, having been turned in by his senior D.I., who himself would later be court-martialed for ordering his platoon into the showers and making them run in place, while thickening the air by pouring bleach down the drain. After these stories broke, some Marines recalled the routine nature of such punishments and how infrequently they were ever brought to light. \u2018\u2018Reporting it would have gotten nowhere,\u2019\u2019 a onetime Parris Island recruit, who claimed that he was made to scrub the floors with pure bleach, wrote in a Reddit thread in 2014. \u2018\u2018I saw too much other stuff get swept under the rug.\u2019\u2019In June 2014, Lt. Col. Kate Germano arrived at Parris Island to head up the Fourth Battalion, which trains the corps\u2019s female recruits. She found a culture badly in need of reform. Two of her female drill instructors were facing courts-martial for mistreating recruits and, in one case, abusing other, lower-ranking drill instructors, a phenomenon known as \u2018\u2018hat hazing.\u2019\u2019 Abuses toward the recruits included ethnic slurs, so-called hard corrections like pushing and shoving and refusing to give recruits bathroom breaks. Germano, who spent 2004 and 2005 as an adjutant and Marine Corps legal officer in Iraq, was so alarmed that she decided to give her subordinates a PowerPoint presentation on Abu Ghraib. \u2018\u2018I saw a direct similarity between the culture in both places,\u2019\u2019 she says.Germano believed that much of the failure rested with the depot\u2019s regimental commander, Col. Daniel Haas, who had been at Parris Island since July 2013. (The Marines declined to make Colonel Haas available for a response.) Haas had a remote leadership style \u2014 \u2018\u2018not the type of guy that will care and feed you,\u2019\u2019 one of his other battalion commanders later said \u2014 that clashed with Germano\u2019s more hands-on approach, which included impromptu walk-throughs and counseling her subordinates to demand more of the female recruits to help them compete effectively with their male counterparts. While many of her Marines made changes, others perceived Ger\u00admano as meddlesome.In April 2015, less than a year after coming to Parris Island and 11 months before Raheel\u2019s arrival, Germano received the results of the battalion\u2019s annual Command Climate Survey, in which lower-ranking officers and noncommanding officers evaluate their commanders. In her survey, Germano\u2019s subordinates described her as \u2018\u2018hostile, unprofessional and abusive.\u2019\u2019 Though Germano maintains she was none of those things, the commanding general of Parris Island relieved her of her command following an investigation.Isolated in a remote corner of the depot, the Third had long been a rogue fief on Parris Island, its silent pact with Marine officialdom being that it would create the most disciplined recruits but would do so in its own way. It had operated in this manner for more than 60 years, and even in the era of values-based training, the Third was virtually unchanged.In 1998, a Navy chaplain, Thomas Creely, now retired, came to Parris Island to serve as chaplain for the recruit training regiment and noticed a particularly stark pattern of abuse in the Third. \u2018\u2018For example,\u2019\u2019 he later wrote in a paper presented to the International Society for Military Ethics, \u2018\u2018after lunch recruits were made to drink water until they vomited. Then they were made to do push-ups in their own vomit.\u2019\u2019 Creely worked with the command until 2003 to try to eradicate the problem, but the \u2018\u2018blind loyalty of drill instructors,\u2019\u2019 who remained silent in the face of abuse, stood in the way. \u2018\u2018What you have in the Third Battalion is a cycle of abuse,\u2019\u2019 Creely told me recently. \u2018\u2018And until that cycle is broken, it doesn\u2019t matter how much education you do.\u2019\u2019Lt. Col. Joshua Kissoon, who commanded the Third Battalion while Germano was on the base, was a by-the-book Marine who publicly took a hard stance against hazing. Shortly after assuming command, he instituted a zero-tolerance policy on the touching of recruits by their D.I.s and put his staff on warning: Any violation of the rules would be investigated. Between 2013 and 2015, 221 preliminary hazing investigations were conducted across the depot\u2019s four battalions; 69 of those were from the Third, and more were punished from that battalion than any other. This included three D.I.s who were recommended for courts-martial after an investigation first reported by Wade Livingston at The Beaufort Gazette in February 2015 revealed a \u2018\u2018staggering level of misconduct and recruit abuse,\u2019\u2019 with recruits reporting that they were choked, kicked and punched in the face, and that they had their heads slammed against walls.Some junior officers felt the D.I.s were being punished unfairly, though they themselves were never in the squad bays. (One later said his presence in the barracks \u2018\u2018undermines\u2019\u2019 the drill instructors.) When Colonel Kissoon received the results of his own Command Climate Survey in April 2015, they were not much better than Germano\u2019s. That spring, Kissoon began to take a softer line in some cases, according to Marines in the battalion. On his desktop, his subordinates later said, he kept a redacted copy of the command investigation that led to Germano\u2019s firing. \u2018\u2018This could happen to me,\u2019\u2019 he told colleagues.It was into this environment of \u2018\u2018inconsistent decision making,\u2019\u2019 as some of Kissoon\u2019s officers put it, that a new group of Third Batallion recruits landed in April 2015. Most were straight out of high school. A few had been college students. Two had master\u2019s degrees. Another had been living in his car. All now learned their survival depended on how they handled the cognitive dissonance between what they learned as official Marine Corps policy and how that policy was systematically ignored.Jake Weaver, then 19, a new member of Platoon 3054, Lima Company, recalls that when he met his D.I.s, they gave him and his fellow recruits a choice. \u2018\u2018You want to be trained like Marines, right? Not like crappy \u2018individual\u2019 Marines?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Individualism\u2019\u2019 was a sign of what the D.I.s called \u2018\u2018the new corps,\u2019\u2019 a place where \u2018\u2018everyone can walk through and become a Marine,\u2019\u2019 Weaver recalls, and drill instructors couldn\u2019t get away with what they used to. \u2018\u2018They\u2019d convince us to feel like it was wrong to be trained by the book,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018and if we wanted to be trained right, the old-school way, we had to let them beat us and haze us and not say anything, because that\u2019s how you become a Marine.\u2019\u2019Weaver, who grew up in rural Interlachen, Fla., was the grandson of a Marine who fought in the Korean War. His senior drill instructor was a squarely built Marine who told his recruits he\u2019d served in Iraq. He also claimed he was involved in a friendly-fire incident in which 10 Marine infantrymen were killed, though most officials I spoke with say the story is doubtful. (\u2018\u2018There wasn\u2019t an incident in that whole war where you had 10 or 12 people killed in one swoop,\u2019\u2019 Krulak told me.) As Weaver saw it, his D.I. behaved like a person with PTSD. \u2018\u2018He lost his temper like crazy. Some days he\u2019d be supermotivating toward us,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018and then an hour later we\u2019d be almost done for the day, and he\u2019d walk in the squad bay and just flip out.\u2019\u2019During the day, platoons were put through the standard exhaustive physical and tactical training, interspersed with classes or informal discussions on moral courage in battle. But the real making of Marines went on at night. When darkness fell, a D.I. would sometimes dump a bottle of Gain detergent on the floor and order recruits, both hands on their wooden scrub or \u2018\u2018scuzz\u2019\u2019 brushes, to run across the length of the squad bay in a bear-crawl position, an exercise that they timed and called the Indy 500. Other nights, the drill instructors would create what they called a \u2018\u2018hurricane\u2019\u2019 by dumping everyone\u2019s things on the floor, sometimes covered with detergent, sunscreen or shaving cream. Over the months, recruits in the battalion lost consciousness, were revived and never told a soul. A few developed life-threatening rhabdomyolysis, a rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, often caused by overexertion.Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix was one of Lima Company\u2019s most aggressive D.I.s. Recruits knew to be scared of Felix, even those like Weaver who weren\u2019t in his platoon. \u2018\u2018He was pretty frickin\u2019 psycho,\u2019\u2019 one Marine recalls. Felix, a swaggering man with a shaved head, enlisted in 2002 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, working as a crew chief maintaining aircraft and their weapons systems. He talked about his resentment toward Muslims, whom he blamed for killing some of his friends in the war. (Felix\u2019s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.) Ameer Bourmeche, a Muslim recruit from Brooklyn and Weaver\u2019s platoonmate, soon became Felix\u2019s target. \u2018\u2018I remember him calling Bourmeche a \u2018terrorist,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 recalls the recruit in Platoon 3054, who asked not to be identified. \u2018\u2018He used to mess with him: \u2018Where are the W.M.D.s?\u2019 \u2018Were you part of 9/11?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Though Bourmeche, who declined to comment for this article, never talked about his faith to anyone\u2019s recollection, the platoon was made aware of it during their first week of training, when one of their drill instructors polled the group on their religions. Weaver thought it was strange: \u2018\u2018He was giving us this talk about how we\u2019re all brothers in the Marine Corps, and how we\u2019re all in this together, no matter what race or religion we are. Then he was asking us: \u2018What religions do we have here? I\u2019m sure we have Christians. I\u2019m sure we have an atheist. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a Baptist.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 He looked at Bourmeche. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s your religion?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Islam, sir,\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche replied.The sergeant seemed intrigued. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with recruit Bourmeche being a Muslim,\u2019\u2019 he said.Less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the Marine Corps is Muslim. Across the entire United States military, there are fewer than 6,000 self-reported Muslim active-duty and reserve troops, or about 0.27 percent out of a total force of 2.2 million. Many of the recruits had never met a Muslim in their lives. \u2018\u2018I was pretty narrow-minded when I came in,\u2019\u2019 one of Bourmeche\u2019s platoonmates admits. \u2018\u2018I was like: \u2018Why is he here?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Bourmeche seemed to be singled out nearly every day for punishment. \u2018\u2018He was one of the smartest kids in the platoon, scored really high on all his tests, but they just messed with him,\u2019\u2019 Weaver says. He remembers Bourmeche twice being sent to the medical unit after punitive intensive training sessions intended, his friends figured, to force him to drop out. He refused. In early July, Platoon 3054 took part in their final, 54-hour test, the Crucible, grinding through 90-degree heat. Each recruit finished the course and earned the precious eagle, globe and anchor pins and the title \u2018\u2018Marine.\u2019\u2019On July 14, 2015, Felix and several other D.I.s entered the squad bay in the middle of the night. It appeared they\u2019d been drinking in the small office, or \u2018\u2018D.I. hut,\u2019\u2019 at the far end of the barracks, where drill instructors on night duty sometimes slept. Felix was so drunk \u2018\u2018he might not have known what he did the next day,\u2019\u2019 according to one member of Platoon 3054.\u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the terrorist?\u2019\u2019 Felix said. He ap\u200bproached Bourmeche\u2019s rack. \u2018\u2018You a terrorist?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018No, sir!\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You a Muslim?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, sir!\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Attention!\u2019\u2019Bourmeche jumped down.\u2018\u2018Column left!\u2019\u2019 Felix and another D.I. marched him into the shower room, where, as Bourmeche would later tell investigators, the drill instructors turned on the water and made him do push-ups, high-knees and crunches. Then, when he was thoroughly wet, they marched him into the laundry room.\u2018\u2018Get in the dryer.\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche folded his six-foot, 157-pound frame into the Speed Queen. Felix said that the Marine Corps has \u2018\u2018a way of weeding out spies.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to find out who you really are.\u2019\u2019 Then he closed the door.\u2018\u2018Who are you working for?\u2019\u2019 Felix called.\u2018\u2018Nobody, sir!\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche answered.Felix ran the dryer for half a minute and opened it.\u2018\u2018What\u2019s your religion?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Islam, sir!\u2019\u2019In the squad bay, Weaver and the others, ordered out of their beds, were pushing a recruit around like a scuzz brush. They heard Bourmeche\u2019s body thud as it hit the bottom of the dryer. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re going to kill us the first chance you get, aren\u2019t you, terrorist? What are your plans?\u2019\u2019Inside the dryer, Bourmeche began to cry. His neck and shoulder were burned.Felix opened the door. \u2018\u2018Are you still a Muslim?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, sir!\u2019\u2019A half an hour later, it was over. Bourmeche, damp and shaken, was told to go back to the squad bay. As he was standing by his bed, a D.I. approached him. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s pretty effed-up what they did to you back there,\u2019\u2019 he said. Bourmeche agreed. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to tell a senior drill instructor about this, though, right?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018No, sir,\u2019\u2019 Bourmeche answered.The next night, it happened again. Felix told Bourmeche to hand him his martial-arts belt. He tied Bourmeche\u2019s shoelaces together, then took the belt, wrapped it around Bourmeche\u2019s neck, strung it under his laces and tightened it so Bourmeche bent at the waist. \u2018\u2018Are you a terrorist?\u2019\u2019 Felix held the end of the belt like a leash. He began to walk him like a dog. \u2018\u2018Are you a spy?\u2019\u2019Bourmeche, in pain, began screaming. \u2018\u2018No, sir!\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yell \u2018Allah akbar.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Allah akbar!\u2019\u2019While the rest of the platoon looked on, Felix crushed the platoon\u2019s flagpole into Bourmeche\u2019s toes. Then he handed him a scuzz brush. \u2018\u2018Cut off his head,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to another new Marine. \u2018\u2018Show us you\u2019re a terrorist.\u2019\u2019Bourmeche struck his platoonmate in the neck with the brush several times. Felix seemed pleased. \u2018\u2018This is how the Taliban would do it,\u2019\u2019 he told the platoon. \u2018\u2018And he\u2019d cut your head off just as quick as his brethren.\u2019\u2019Another D.I. shook his head. \u2018\u2018We let a full-blood terrorist join the corps,\u2019\u2019 he said. Afterward, no one said a word. What happens on Parris Island stays on Parris Island \u2014 that had been the message all through boot camp.Weaver, one of the platoon\u2019s highest-performing recruits, was shaken. During a family picnic just before his graduation, he told his parents that \u2018\u2018crazy stuff\u2019\u2019 happened during training. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t talk about it here,\u2019\u2019 he said nervously. \u2018\u2018After we get off the island, we can talk about it.\u2019\u2019Over the next few months, Weaver tried to push what he experienced to the back of his mind, but it was always there. He had believed the Marines was an ethical organization. Then a D.I. bashed his head against a wall for seemingly no reason. And another, after asking if he was a devout Christian, taunted him: \u2018\u2018Say \u2018goddamn.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 That fall, Weaver, then in his last phase of training in Pensacola, Fla., suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized with suicidal thoughts.Having lost his desire to serve, he received word he was being given an \u2018\u2018other-than-honorable discharge\u2019\u2019 from the Marines. His father, Troy, decided to phone his commanding officer and tell her what he knew. \u2018\u2018The fact is, the abuse would have never been reported had I not stood up and said, \u2018Look, you\u2019re not going to give him a bad discharge because of what he went through at Parris Island,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Troy told me. \u2018\u2018Those kids weren\u2019t talking.\u2019\u2019 (Weaver was given an other-than-honorable discharge, which he continues to contest.)On Nov. 5, 2015, Marine officials on Parris Island began an investigation into allegations of abuse based on statements Weaver, Bourmeche and another former recruit from Platoon 3054 had given their commanding officer. Weaver claims the investigators spent only 10 minutes talking to him. Kissoon, through his lawyer, maintains that during this period, Col. Paul Cucinotta, who had replaced Haas as regimental commander in the summer of 2015, refused to brief him on the inquiry as it was unfolding. Internal Marine reports later described the investigation as \u2018\u2018suboptimal.\u2019\u2019When the investigators submitted their findings to Cucinotta in January 2016, the training regiment\u2019s executive officer, Lt. Col. Christopher Lynch, found the evidence persuasive enough to recommend that those involved be \u2018\u2018sat down\u2019\u2019 or suspended from their duties. Cucinotta later claimed he agreed. (\u2018\u2018We disagree with Colonel Cucinotta\u2019s testimony,\u2019\u2019 says Kissoon\u2019s attorney, Colby Volkey.) As of February, however, none of those implicated in the investigation had been suspended. Four months after the hazing reports, Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix returned to the Third Battalion and assumed the title of senior drill instructor, this time for Platoon 3042, Kilo Company.As the recruits sat crossed-legged, Sergeant Felix stepped forward. \u2018\u2018I am your senior drill instructor,\u2019\u2019 he said with the signature barking cadence D.I.s use to exert their authority, and then began his scripted pledge. He promised to treat them with \u2018\u2018firmness, fairness, dignity and compassion,\u2019\u2019 and informed them that abuse would not be tolerated.There wasn\u2019t anything particularly unusual about that first day. The new recruits were ordered to perform hundreds of burpees. They were told to dangle their rifles off the ends of their pinkies. They were \u2018\u2018dog-piled\u2019\u2019 into a corner and then ordered to run back and forth, over and over. One of Raheel\u2019s platoonmates, who shared with me his detailed recollections on the condition of anonymity, thought he was going to pass out. \u2018\u2018And I was in pretty good shape,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I remember one kid had a panic attack and started throwing up, and I think he peed himself, too.\u2019\u2019 The officers stood in the back of the squad bay, he says. When they left, \u2018\u2018that\u2019s when the real hell started.\u2019\u2019On the morning of March 13, less than 24 hours after being picked up by his platoon, Raheel announced to his D.I.s that he\u2019d rather die than continue training. He would jump out the squad-bay window if he had to.When a recruit threatens suicide, everything stops. At first the D.I.s tried to reason with Raheel: What would his mother think were he to come home without becoming a Marine? \u2018\u2018I\u2019d tell my mother goodbye and kill myself,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The future does not matter.\u2019\u2019 The Marines took Raheel\u2019s belt and boot laces to prevent him from strangling himself.Suicide threats are common during the early weeks of boot camp, though how many are serious is unclear. \u2018\u2018Everyone knows saying you\u2019re suicidal is a ticket off Parris Island,\u2019\u2019 Raheel\u2019s platoonmate says. Sickness or broken bones, on the other hand, will get a recruit a long stint in medical, after which they will simply be assigned to another company and start training all over again.Base officials determined Raheel didn\u2019t qualify for emergency transport to the hospital. Instead, he was \u2018\u2018cross-decked\u2019\u2019: They moved him, still without laces or a belt, to another platoon\u2019s squad bay. Over the next 24 hours, he sat there cross-legged on a mattress in the middle of the room while a \u2018\u2018shadow watch\u2019\u2019 of recruits shined a flashlight on his face and took turns monitoring him around the clock. At some point during this period, Raheel, who had to request permission to leave the mattress to use the bathroom, recanted his suicide threat and said he\u2019d decided he wanted to be a Marine.The next morning, Felix escorted Raheel to recruit liaison services, an office set up to ascertain if recruits had enlisted fraudulently (such as by failing to disclose a history of suicidal ideation), and to motivate struggling recruits to return to training. Drill instructors who accompany recruits to these sessions usually sit in a waiting area, but Felix \u2018\u2018stood about 10 feet away,\u2019\u2019 according to the report, while Raheel provided what was referred to as a \u2018\u2018voluntary statement\u2019\u2019 retracting his threat. \u2018\u2018This recruit thought it was the only way to quit,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018This recruit never meant that and regrets it.\u2019\u2019 The base\u2019s mental-health unit deemed him to be at a \u2018\u2018low risk for harm,\u2019\u2019 and Raheel went back to training.It would be noted later, in the Marines\u2019 report, that Raheel, shortly after saying he wanted to kill himself, confided to the military police who were going to escort him to the hospital that he \u2018\u2018could not handle\u2019\u2019 being hit by his drill instructors. The allegation was noted and disregarded several times by what appeared to be several officials.In reviewing the incidents of that week, the Marines made no mention of the four days after Raheel resumed training. His platoonmate, though, recalls them as torture. As one report noted, Platoon 3042\u2019s senior drill instructor \u2018\u2018taught his subordinate drill instructors that in order to be successful at training recruits, they needed to \u2018hate recruits.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 They were called \u2018\u2018bitches,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018faggots,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018maggots,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018little bitches,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018pussies\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018retards.\u2019\u2019 A Russian-born recruit was called \u2018\u2018the Russian,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018the cosmonaut,\u2019\u2019 and was asked if he was a Russian spy. Raheel was called a terrorist. Felix asked on one occasion if he needed his turban.Raheel\u2019s platoonmate didn\u2019t understand why Raheel had joined the Marines. Orders seemed to confound him. Rather than simply following them, he thought about what he was asked. \u2018\u2018Like a normal person,\u2019\u2019 the platoonmate says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not necessarily wrong, but it\u2019s not how they wanted it. It wasn\u2019t the Marine way of doing things.\u2019\u2019 This earned Raheel, who always \u2018\u2018looked like a scared animal,\u2019\u2019 as his platoonmate says, undue attention from the D.I.s. \u2018\u2018Anything that\u2019s not masculine \u2014 if you\u2019re not six feet tall and built like a football player \u2014 that\u2019s not what they want. They want people who are the definition of Marines. Anyone else, you have to prove yourself.\u2019\u2019Once, the platoonmate recalls, Felix stuffed a recruit in a footlocker. Another time, he made a recruit eat nothing but Jell-O and mashed potatoes for a few days, and threatened that if he didn\u2019t improve, he\u2019d have to stuff him in a locker, too. Choking recruits until they were gasping for air was common. Some of the D.I.s, the platoonmate suspected, were almost as terrified of their senior D.I. as the recruits were. One drill instructor, he recalled, became so ill that he projectile-vomited all over the squad bay while simultaneously yelling at the recruits after he himself had been screamed at by Felix moments before. \u2018\u2018We never knew if it was blood or Gatorade, but he\u2019s vomiting this red stuff while screaming, and we were like, What is going on?\u2019\u2019On March 17, Platoon 3042 received instruction on Marine Corps mixed-martial-arts punching techniques. According to the Marines\u2019 report, recruits in Lima Company were instructed to throw a \u2018\u2018flurry of punches\u2019\u2019 as hard as they could, and not to listen to their instructors\u2019 directions but instead \u2018\u2018just to keep punching.\u2019\u2019 It was routine, recruits later said, for their drill instructors to pair bigger or stronger recruits against the weaker or poorly performing recruits. During the March 17 drill, recruits were punched repeatedly in unprotected parts of their body, including their jaws. One sustained two broken ribs. The abuse, according to the report, caused one recruit \u2018\u2018to cry during the event.\u2019\u2019 The platoonmate believed one of the targeted recruits was Raheel, but he can\u2019t be sure. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really all a blur,\u2019\u2019 he says. It was only Day 4. Many recruits didn\u2019t even know one another\u2019s names. Terror caused them to avoid making eye contact. \u2018\u2018Lots of stuff happened while we slept,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Or in the dark.\u2019\u2019At around 2 a.m. on March 18, Raheel woke up his bunkmate. He was in pain, he said. We\u2019re all in pain, the other recruit told him. Two hours later, the recruits awoke and prepared to sound off before leaving for chow. Raheel pointed to his throat and silently mouthed words. When two D.I.s started yelling at him, Raheel handed one of them a note. \u2018\u2018This recruit has to go to medical. This recruit\u2019s throat has been swollen for three days and is getting worse,\u2019\u2019 it said. \u2018\u2018This recruit also coughed blood a few times last night. And this recruit completely lost his voice and can barely whisper. This recruit\u2019s whole neck is in a lot of pain.\u2019\u2019A D.I. told Raheel they would deal with the matter after breakfast. He sat silently through the meal, zombielike. Upon returning to the barracks, the platoon set about cleaning, and Raheel was called to the front of the squad bay. He was supposed to fill out a form so he could go to the medical unit. He stood before Felix but failed to greet him properly, perhaps because he couldn\u2019t speak. His silence seemed to enrage the senior drill instructor. \u2018\u2018Get back!\u2019\u2019 he shouted. Raheel ran 144 feet across the squad bay from one end to the other. \u2018\u2018Siddiqui, run!\u2019\u2019 Felix continued. \u2018\u2018Get back! Run!\u2019\u2019His platoonmate, who had been quietly making his bed and trying to stay out of the D.I.s\u2019 line of sight, watched Raheel running back and forth. Suddenly Raheel grabbed his throat, crying, and fell to the floor. Some recruits thought he was faking. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know if he did it willingly, I don\u2019t know if he was just exhausted, but he dropped,\u2019\u2019 the platoonmate says.\u2018\u2018Get up, Siddiqui!\u2019\u2019 Felix shouted. \u2018\u2018I know you\u2019re faking. Get up!\u2019\u2019At this point, reports differ. Raheel appeared to be unconscious. A D.I. claimed he rubbed his knuckles across Raheel\u2019s sternum to revive him. Other recruits and drill instructors say that never happened. The platoonmate I interviewed recalls seeing Raheel, on the floor, clutching his throat. Leaning over, Felix slapped him across the face. Five feet away, Raheel\u2019s platoonmate thought at first the D.I. was \u2018\u2018acting like an emergency responder,\u2019\u2019 trying to revive him. But then he slapped him again, so hard that the sound echoed across the squad bay.\u2018\u2018And Siddiqui gets up, and he starts dead sprinting, which I thought was a logical thing to do: This is boot camp, he\u2019s running away,\u2019\u2019 his platoonmate says. But he was running too fast. \u2018\u2018He is literally sprinting the fastest I\u2019d ever seen anyone sprint,\u2019\u2019 he says. Slowly it dawned on him what Raheel was about to do. \u2018\u2018We were all still cleaning, kind of dispersed around the squad bay.\u2019\u2019 The doors, he recalls, were open. \u2018\u2018And he straight-up jumped.\u2019\u2019An air ambulance was requested to take Raheel to a hospital in Savannah, Ga., 40 miles away, but the request was denied because of heavy fog. A second air lift was scuttled, and so Marines drove him to Beaufort Memorial Hospital, where after an hour of sustained effort in the emergency room, doctors decided Raheel needed higher-level care. Three hours after his fall, he arrived at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. It was too late: At 10:06, after more than an hour of attempts to save his life, Raheel was pronounced dead.The following day, an autopsy was performed at the hospital. The medical examiner concluded that Raheel died of blunt-force trauma sustained during his fall. But the autopsy report, details of which were shown to me by the Siddiqui family, also found evidence of petechial hemorrhaging, which can be caused by anything from heavy coughing to vomiting or asphyxiation and strangulation. Several days later, J. Edward Allen, the Beaufort County coroner, wrote a final autopsy report concluding that \u2018\u2018in light of the history provided and the autopsy findings,\u2019\u2019 Raheel had committed suicide.A week after Raheel died, his body was sent back to his parents in Michigan. At the funeral home, the family stared down in horror at their son. His arms, chest, stomach and legs were purple. There were ligature marks, not unlike the ridges of a webbed military belt, around his neck, which had not been mentioned in the autopsy report. To Ghazala it looked as if her son had been tortured.In Beaufort, a city with three military installations that collectively pump over $1.5 billion into the local economy, the news that a Marine recruit had died on Parris Island was met with studied silence. \u2018\u2018Marine Corps boot camp isn\u2019t the Boy Scouts,\u2019\u2019 one reader posted on the Facebook page of The Beaufort Gazette, which broke the story on March 20. \u2018\u2018Stay home if you can\u2019t handle some hazing.\u2019\u2019 Hazing had not been mentioned publicly at this point, but in Detroit, the Siddiquis\u2019 Democratic congresswoman, Representative Debbie Dingell, heard through an anonymous tip that religious bias might have played a role in Raheel\u2019s death. In April, Dingell wrote to the Marine commandant, Gen. Robert Neller, asking that an \u2018\u2018unbiased inquiry\u2019\u2019 be made into the matter. Dingell recently told me that soon after she wrote the letter, she received anonymous calls telling her to stay out of Marine business. \u2018\u2018Some of my own colleagues warned me, \u2018You don\u2019t want to challenge the Marines on their training methods,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 she said.The official investigation into the death of Raheel Siddiqui lasted over a year and spawned two other investigations: a more thorough examination of the hazing allegations in the Bourmeche case and a broader hazing inquiry requested in spring 2016 by the Obama White House, after the president received an anonymous email from unnamed \u2018\u2018concerned loved ones of innocent recruits\u2019\u2019 claiming their children were being abused.On Sept. 8, 2016, the Marine Corps released the findings of these investigations. That same day, the corps announced that 20 Marines \u2014 including, it was later revealed, three teams of drill instructors, several junior officers, Kissoon and the depot\u2019s new regimental commander, Col. Paul Cucinotta \u2014 had been relieved of duty and faced punishment pending the results of further investigation. (In early June, Kissoon appeared before the military\u2019s version of a grand jury, and he is still awaiting charges. Six Marines, representing much of the chain of command, were granted immunity or other considerations to testify against him, according to Kissoon\u2019s lawyer.) The reports were heavily redacted; in the 132-page command inquiry into Raheel\u2019s death, the last 43 pages were entirely blacked out.Of those involved in the three investigations, just six Marines have been formally charged with wrongdoing. Four Marines \u2014 one of whom was acquitted at trial, another who pleaded guilty, a third who made \u2018\u2018a pretrial agreement with prosecutors,\u2019\u2019 according to a Marine spokesman, and a fourth who faces a general court-martial \u2014 had charges levied against them for abuse-related incidents elsewhere in Lima Company. Felix and another drill instructor, Staff Sgt. Michael Eldridge, were charged with a range of offenses including cruelty and maltreatment, drunk and disorderly conduct and failure to obey a general order. In Felix\u2019s case, the charges also included obstruction of justice stemming from the dryer incident involving Bourmeche and the hazing of Raheel. Both face general courts-martial later this summer.A number of former and current Marine officials, including several high-ranking officers, say they are agonized by the reports. \u2018\u2018What I\u2019m hearing makes my stomach turn,\u2019\u2019 the senior officer I spoke to says. \u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t rocket science. We have procedures and policies and rules on the books against this stuff, and people have to enforce them. I mean, who is in charge? If you are having a hard time controlling those drill instructors, you\u2019re not a leader.\u2019\u2019Though it would be tempting to blame the allegations of abuse on a few Marines \u2014 the \u2018\u2018few bad apples\u2019\u2019 theory \u2014 Raheel\u2019s platoonmate told me that rough practices in his platoon continued long after Felix and his drill instructor team were replaced, the very next day, with another team, and after that team was later replaced with another. The message, he says, was \u2018\u2018the D.I.s could pretty much get away with anything. Let\u2019s say you did report something. They\u2019d change the D.I., and what happens after that? Another D.I. who presumably was friends with the prior D.I. is going to make your life hell.\u2019\u2019On Aug. 7, nearly a year and a half to the day that Raheel Siddiqui arrived on Parris Island, Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix will stand trial, a proceeding expected to last at least two weeks. The charges against him are technically violations of military discipline; he has not faced broader criminal charges like assault. The Siddiqui family thinks the charges are insufficient. \u2018\u2018We were advised that an assault charge was not brought because the [other charges] carried a harsher penalty,\u2019\u2019 says Shiraz Khan, the family\u2019s lawyer. \u2018\u2018Well, the elements of assault are much different, and so are the implications. The systemic hazing, abuse and maltreatment suffered by Raheel Siddiqui while at Parris Island was not the result of a single incident by one individual. We aren\u2019t blind to what Raheel\u2019s body and autopsy say.\u2019\u2019When I visited the Siddiquis\u2019 small apartment late last fall, Ghazala, wearing jeans and a sparkly blue hijab, showed me photographs she took of her son\u2019s body at the funeral home. \u2018\u2018Why would they do this to my son?\u2019\u2019 she said, distraught, pausing over a photograph of Raheel\u2019s neck. Taking me upstairs, she led me into his room, which was spotless, almost antiseptic, a shrine to a sometimes mischievous yet fundamentally obedient boy who prayed at least four times a day, dressed in colorful shirts and smiled so much and so often that those who knew him could never imagine him being depressed. Ghazala showed off Raheel\u2019s academic awards and his orange Home Depot apron inscribed with good-luck messages written by every one of his colleagues. The dress-blue uniform he would have worn upon graduating boot camp hung in his closet, neatly pressed. The Marines had dressed Raheel\u2019s body in it. \u2018\u2018He was brainwashed,\u2019\u2019 Ghazala said, wiping away a tear. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s smart, intelligent, beautiful, excellent boy. Perfect. I am so proud of my son.\u2019\u2019 Ghazala spoke of him in the present tense.No one from the family has agreed to be interviewed since last winter. \u2018\u2018Their son is gone, there are no answers and they\u2019re suffering,\u2019\u2019 says Khan, who told me that his office has received only 20 or so of about 220 pages they\u2019ve requested from the investigation, and have had very little direct discussion with the Marines. For the most part, he says, they have learned about any progress in the case by reading the newspapers.Kate Germano, who retired from the Marines in 2016, isn\u2019t surprised. \u2018\u2018The last thing the Marines would want is anyone connecting the dots,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently. \u2018\u2018This is a cultural issue. The conduct that is considered acceptable at Parris Island, from the failures in leadership to the hands-on methods the drill instructors use, would not be acceptable anywhere else in the Marine Corps. But down there, for whatever reason, it\u2019s considered a badge of honor. Those who don\u2019t see it that way are considered weak. But it\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault.\u2019\u2019The island\u2019s new commanding general, Austin Renforth, known as Sparky, who took control several months after Raheel\u2019s death, insists they are rooting out the problem. Under his watch, officers play a more active role in supervising drill instructors, something many officials believe is essential to reforming the culture. Renforth, though, insists the problems on Parris Island aren\u2019t cultural. \u2018\u2018This place is such a fishbowl \u2014 when someone does something wrong it gets national attention, but it\u2019s not systemic,\u2019\u2019 he says. That said, he allowed, \u2018\u2018I have to make sure it never happens again.\u2019\u2019 Renforth doesn\u2019t explain how he plans to do this, other than to say he wants everyone involved in making Marines to have \u2018\u2018buy-in,\u2019\u2019 as he puts it.Renforth is the epitome of a combat Marine: graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, commander during the first gulf war and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, son of a World War II veteran who himself went through boot camp on Parris Island in 1941. This is his first training command, and he says he was surprised that many of his D.I.s were not combat vets. A year ago, in the very beginning of his tenure, Renforth, who has five children, considered reaching out to Ghazala and Massood. He changed his mind. \u2018\u2018I just didn\u2019t feel it was my place,\u2019\u2019 he says.Tragedies happen. But a vast majority of recruits, he says, make it through boot camp just fine. \u2018\u2018We want them all to transform,\u2019\u2019 Renforth says. \u2018\u2018If they show up with a little \u2018want to\u2019 in their hearts, they\u2019ll make it.\u2019\u2019 Renforth has no plans to change the fundamentals of training. \u2018\u2018I believe in the way we make Marines, and I believe in the product,\u2019\u2019 he says. In the end, it\u2019s about instilling \u2018\u2018core values.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We get kids from all over the nation, and we try to fill them up with values,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It changes their lives.\u2019\u2019An article on July 9 about Marine recruits at Parris Island misspelled the name of the town where Jake Weaver, a former Marine, grew up. It is Interlachen, Fla., not Interlaken. The article also misidentified the rank of Victor Krulak. He was a lieutenant general at the time of his retirement in 1968, not a brigadier general.An article on July 9 about Marine recruits at Parris Island referred incorrectly to the tenures of Col. Daniel Haas and Lt. Col. Kate Germano. Haas had been there about a year \u2014 not several years \u2014 before Germano arrived in 2014, and Haas left in the summer of 2015, not the fall. And it was the commanding general of the depot \u2014 not Haas \u2014 who relieved Germano of her command.Janet Reitman is an investigative journalist and contributing editor at Rolling Stone, where she covers politics and national security.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Through the Outback", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "It has been mythologized in poetry and song, made horrific in films like \u201cWake in Fright,\u201d and infused into Australia\u2019s history and psyche. Yet few Australians, including myself, have fully explored its realities.I grew up in what we call regional Australia \u2014 the small cities outside the major capitals \u2014 but my mum was from Yeoval, a farming village that was also the childhood home of Banjo Paterson, the Australian poet who romanticized bush life. Until my grandfather died, a slide carousel was a staple of family Christmases: the photographs of Nan, Pop and their five daughters dressed in white English pomp for a country show or the horse races were my own iconic images of this mysterious land.I spent most of the last dozen years away from Australia, making photographs of other people\u2019s mythical and mysterious places: Afghanistan and Iraq, Greece and Ireland, India and the Middle East. In December, I turned my eye on remote regions much closer to home.Mine was a journey of more than 19,000 kilometers (12,000 miles), crisscrossing desert, mines, wheat belts and cattle stations. The path was dotted with roadkill, mainly kangaroos: I hit seven myself, killing five.One night in Queensland, two greys hopped onto the road and one stopped and stood upright; I could neither stop nor swerve, only watch it explode on impact into a pink mist. Another time, in the Northern Territory, wedge-tailed eagles dived between the sporadic cars and trucks to feed on rotting animal carcasses.DarwinPormpuraawCairnsTennant CreekMcKinlaySelwynSolomon HubAlice SpringsMarchmont StationIslay PlainsWarakurna CommunityAUSTRALIATamboWilunaBrisbaneCoober PedyTibooburraBourkePacksaddleKalgoorlieWilcanniaPlumbago StationPerthCassilisCopi Hollow YeovalAdelaideSydneyHayCarwoolaTooleybucHarrowMelbourneBallaratHobartDarwinPormpuraawCairnsTennant CreekMcKinlaySelwynSolomon HubAlice SpringsMarchmont StationIslay PlainsWarakurna CommunityAUSTRALIAWilunaTamboBrisbaneCoober PedyTibooburraBourkePacksaddleKalgoorlieWilcanniaPlumbago StationPerthCassilisCopi HollowYeovalAdelaideSydneyHayTooleybucHarrowCarwoolaMelbourneBallaratHobartDarwinPormpuraawCairnsTennant CreekMcKinlaySelwynAlice SpringsIslay PlainsWarakurna CommunityTamboWilunaAUSTRALIABrisbaneCoober PedyBourkePacksaddleKalgoorliePerthWilcanniaCopi HollowHayTooleybucSydneyHarrowBallaratHobartThe outback of Australia\u2019s post-colonial imagination \u2014 or at least the version of my suburban, 1980s childhood imagination \u2014 involves an explorer confronting an untamed land, trying to forge a country through hard work and freedom; its archetypes include drover, stockman, Aboriginal tracker, gold miner, shearer, landlord and outlaw.The population of the area has been dropping for decades, especially as a proportion of growing Australia. At the same time, Aboriginal Australians are a growing presence, a majority in many small towns losing white residents to bigger cities: They are 3 percent of Australia\u2019s people, but a quarter of those in remote areas.One clich\u00e9 that rang true on my travels was genuine country hospitality. I started out trying to set up subjects ahead of time, but found it difficult to predict which events or personalities would yield the best stories. So I abandoned plans in favor of walking into a country pub and seeing who wanted to chat at the bar.Isla Hughes, a young governess, was holding a jug of Midori cocktails on the veranda of the pub in Tibooburra, New South Wales, on New Year\u2019s Day. The night before, I had noticed Michael Koke, 18, in the stock yards at the local rodeo. Theirs were among a series of portraits I made \u2014 using film instead of digital cameras \u2014 throughout my time on the road, a collection of faces, clothing and backdrops that I see as puzzle pieces of the outback I discovered.Word of mouth was my best asset in the bush. One publican introduced me to the owner of a sheep station near Tambo, where I met shearers whom I reconnected with 200 miles away a few weeks later. That same farmer posted on Facebook that I was looking for a cattle muster, which led me to Islay Plains, where I met a family that had turned its farm organic after a drought. When I was vouched for by one person, I was O.K. to another.I found Lynette Warn at the Walkabout Creek Hotel in McKinlay \u2014 the town where the bar scenes for \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d were filmed \u2014 and ended up drunk with her daughter and the daughter\u2019s boyfriend. The next day, they took me to the trailer-home that Lynette and her husband, Adam, live out of as they roam from job site to job site installing fences.Ms. Warn, 45, grew up in the bush \u2014 her parents had a fence-building business, too. They dug holes for the posts with a shovel back then, not a custom hydraulic driver. \u201cAdam can drive 75 posts in a day,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cMy father, if he put 10 posts in a day, he had a bloody good day.\u201dThe nearest supermarket, though, remains a two-and-a-half hour drive away, so Ms. Warn said she went shopping only once every two weeks, adding, \u201cYou have to be organized living out here.\u201d\u201cI like the remoteness,\u201d she added. \u201cI like people, and meeting people, and that sort of thing, but I like to be able to walk away and go back to my own area. I could never live with a neighbor there and a neighbor there \u2014 that just does my head in.\u201dOne morning, Fred Appleton took me up in his helicopter as the day\u2019s first sun splashed across the gum trees of Islay Plains cattle station, which he has owned since 2007. We bounced and weaved, spotting black and brown cows, then swooping down to muster them in a common direction. Young ringers on motorbikes rounded up the stragglers, and four hours later a herd of 800 was ready for counting and branding.I heard many complaints about this method from old-timers like Azzie Zilla Fazulla, 90, a former drover in Tibooburra. \u201cThe young fellas, I don\u2019t know, they are a good mob of blokes, but they are too fast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t push cattle too hard. Some of the old stockmen would turn over in their graves.\u201dMr. Appleton, though, is a man who embraces change. Three years ago, he and his wife, Anna, invested $1.2 million in a long-term water supply and organic processes to insulate their operations against global warming.\u201cDuring the drought in 2012, \u201913, \u201914, the prices were crap, something had to change,\u201d explained Mr. Appleton, who is 40. \u201cWe had heard about organics and I thought it would all be a load of wallop, but we looked into it a bit more. We decided we were basically organic anyway, so we thought: Why not get accredited for it?\u201cAt the time, beef was $3 a kilo on the hook and an organic one was $5.50 a kilo,\u201d he said, citing Australian dollar figures. The difference equated to $500 an animal.Adrian and Julie Brown, farmers at Marchmont Station in Queensland, had practically the reverse experience. The drought led them to sell 1,000 head of cattle and 10,000 head of sheep in 2014 and 2015. The castrated rams, called wethers, brought $46 to $48 each. In 2016, when the rains started, they restocked with 5,500 sheep \u2014 at $90.50.\u201cAnything with four legs is very expensive at the moment, which is good if you have something to sell, but if you\u2019re buying back it\u2019s expensive,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cOnce upon a time in a drought you could just close the doors, the business would stop, you could stop your expenditure. Now rents and rates are really high, they are two of my biggest costs. We are a long way short of recovering from the drought.\u201dThere are 400 mines producing 19 different minerals, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and mining employs 266,000 people, with the nation\u2019s highest average hourly wage ($56.90 in the local currency).One of those people is Tom Schluter, 49, an Australian who moved to Thailand six years ago and now is part of the \u201cfly-in, fly-out\u201d work force, or FIFO for short, that is deeply resented by many of the old-timers I met. He works for two weeks, then is off for one. When he works \u2014 on the road crew at Solomon Hub, the flagship mine of the Fortescue Metals Group, in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia \u2014 it\u2019s more than 80 hours per week.\u201cIt\u2019s more like a lifestyle out here than a job,\u201d Mr. Schluter said.But in Kalgoorlie, one of Australia\u2019s legendary mining towns, I saw the flip side of the FIFO coin. Kenneth Smith, 74, has owned the Grand Hotel since 1983. He told me stories about a pub so packed he needed four barmaids on a shift; there were three drinkers the night I visited. The pub itself looks like a movie set that was abandoned 20 years ago.\u201cWe don\u2019t get workers from the gold mine coming to the pub anymore,\u201d Mr. Smith lamented. \u201cThey fly out and the money leaves the town, or they don\u2019t come because they are too tired from long shifts. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s killing the place.\u201dTimor SeaDarwinGulf of CarpentariaINDIANOCEANNitmilukNational ParkCoral SeaCairnsOperatingminesNORTHERNTERRITORYKarlamilyiNational ParkAlice SpringsQUEENSLANDWESTERNAUSTRALIAUluru-Kata TjutaNational ParkSOUTHAUSTRALIAOpalminesBrisbaneNullarbor PlainPerthNEW SOUTHWALESGreatAustralianBightAdelaideSydneyCanberraMelbourneVICTORIATasman SeaTASMANIAHobartTimor SeaDarwinGulf of CarpentariaINDIANOCEANNitmilukNational ParkCoral SeaOperatingminesCairnsNORTHERNTERRITORYKarlamilyiNational ParkAlice SpringsQUEENSLANDWESTERNAUSTRALIASOUTHAUSTRALIAOpalminesBrisbaneNullarbor PlainPerthNEW SOUTHWALESAdelaideSydneyGreatAustralianBightCanberraMelbourneVICTORIATasman SeaTASMANIAHobartDarwinTimor SeaCoral SeaINDIANOCEANNORTHERNTERRITORYCairnsOperatingminesAlice SpringsQUEENSLANDWESTERNAUSTRALIAOpalminesBrisbaneSOUTHAUSTRALIANEW SOUTHWALESPerthAdelaideSydneyCanberraGreatAustralianBightMelbourneVICTORIATasman SeaTASMANIAHobartDarwinCoral SeaTimor SeaINDIANOCEANCairnsOperatingminesOpalminesBrisbanePerthAdelaideSydneyGreatAustralianBightTASMANIAHobartOpal is Australia\u2019s national gemstone. In Coober Pedy, a town in South Australia where temperatures soar so high people live underground in shallow burrows they call \u201cdugouts,\u201d freelance prospectors stake their claims and dig for opal to sell to tourists or Chinese dealers.\u201cYou can work for three months and not see a chip of opal,\u201d explained Rudi Fletcher, 81, an Austrian who came to Australia at 23 for a working holiday with a mining company and never left. \u201cOpal is where opal wants to be, not where we want it to be.\u201dGeorge Kountouris, 60, is a second-generation Australian whose family is from Sparta, Greece, and a second-generation opal miner. He sleeps at his store to protect his stones, with a 88-pound Doberman named Sir Winston and four security cameras.He remembers when there were \u201cthree or four thousand miners\u201d in the town back in the 1970s, and says \u201cnow there\u2019s probably 10 or 15 at the most.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about your biggest find,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one likes, Australians in general, no one likes a smart arse or a bragger.\u201dWilcannia had the country\u2019s third-highest per-capita crime rate last year: Suicide, alcoholism and unemployment are also all rampant. I remember when I was growing up, people joked that it was a place you should not stop. These were usually white Australians without much direct experience or close interaction with Indigenous Australians. I had never spent much time in Aboriginal communities, either.Now, as a journalist eager to understand all kinds of people, of course I wanted to stop.A pink sunset was fading as I pulled in to find a group of Aboriginal teenagers, some on foot and some on BMX bikes, meandering down a wide empty street. Their dress was American hip-hop, a sign of what Virgean Wilson, a social worker, said was \u201cstrangling our culture.\u201d\u201cI look out the window here and I see our children dressed like the American Negro and using that horrible slang and listening to that mind-boggling music that doesn\u2019t have a meaning to us,\u201d she said.Though many young Indigenous Australians would undoubtedly disagree, Mrs. Wilson connected this trend with the rising suicide rate in the community. \u201cIt takes them down this pathway of more misery,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI hear young people, as young as 7, say, \u2018I am going to kill myself.\u2019\u201dBenita Kennedy\u2019s brother, William Roger Shane Kennedy, hanged himself at their auntie\u2019s house last year. The photo on his funeral program showed a smiling William holding a half-crushed can of Victoria Bitter beer. He was 25.Talking to dozens of Aboriginal Australians during my travels, I kept asking about the source of the deep social problems plaguing their communities. No one had any clear answers, but it felt like their world had just changed too fast: for 40,000 years, their ancestors were hunter-gatherers guided largely by nature\u2019s rhythms; in less than 250 years, they had that land taken and were forced to assimilate into a white man\u2019s world.Daisy Ward, a Ngaanyatjarra elder in Warakurna, Western Australia, embodies the transition. She recalls going into town every two weeks as a child to watch black-and-white Hollywood westerns on a projector \u2014 and walking home into the desert, barefoot. When she was 9, she went on a field trip to Perth, the state capital, and she remembers \u201cgoing to a statue and asking the statue, \u2018Can you give me water, please?\u2019\u201d A friend whispered to her, \u201cYou have to turn the tap on.\u201dWe picked wild tobacco in the hill near where Ms. Ward was born in the bush, and she found a honey ant nest. Digging at the earth with an iron rod, she collected hundreds of ants whose abdomens were translucent sacs of sweet liquid, and we sucked them around a campfire while other elder women cooked kangaroo tails they bought frozen at the community store.\u201cI feel proud to be an elder, to speak out and say what\u2019s good, what\u2019s better for young kids,\u201d said Ms. Ward, who works as a community liaison at a local school. \u201cI\u2019m waiting with my hands out to give helping hands if they need it.\u201d\u201cWelcome to Paradise,\u201d says a rusty sign in Wiluna, a town clear across the country from Wilcania \u2014 more than 1,800 miles, to be exact \u2014 but in a startlingly similar situation. A town once thriving with miners and stockmen, now dilapidated. Many of the white men have moved on with the profits of the land, leaving the traditional owners behind.Several folks I met there described it as the place where, in the 1970s, some of the last desert-dwelling Aboriginal Australians wandered, naked and dusty, spears in hand, into the white man\u2019s industrialized world. Under the awning of the Wiluna Hotel, whose windows were boarded up, I met Jefry Stewart, who told me he was the last surviving child of one of those last desert nomads.Mr. Stewart asked me to buy him some beer, because it was one of the three days each week when Wiluna residents are restricted to buying only midstrength alcohol, but outsiders can still get full strength.

{"Headline": "U.N. Agency Reports Worst Drought in 16 Years in North Korea", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea is suffering its worst drought in 16 years, a United Nations agency reported on Friday, raising fears of worsening food shortages in the country, where children and other vulnerable groups have been malnourished for years.Seasonal rainfall in the main cereal-producing regions is below that of 2001, when grain production fell to a record low of two million tons, Vincent Martin, the agency\u2019s representative in North Korea, said in a news release.Although some rain has fallen this month, it was likely to be too late to allow the normal planting and development of main crops that would be harvested in October and November, the report said.Because of the drought, the production of early season crops that are harvested in June, including wheat, barley and potatoes, dropped to 310,000 tons, more than 30 percent below last year\u2019s 450,000 tons, it said. The early season harvest usually accounts for 10 percent of the country\u2019s total annual cereal production.\u201cIncreased food imports, commercial or through food aid, would be required during the next three months at the peak of the lean season, ensuring adequate food supply for the most vulnerable, including children and elders,\u201d the agency said in a statement.North Korea experienced chronic food shortages in the 1990s, when a famine caused by years of bad weather and economic mismanagement forced the country to issue a rare appeal for international help. By some estimates, more than a million people died in the famine.The country has since allowed more market-oriented activities and encouraged trade with China to increase access to food. Its own food production has also improved in recent years. But humanitarian relief groups still call for donations, warning that shortages remain widespread.The South\u2019s Defense Ministry had wanted to hold a military dialogue with the North on Friday. After receiving no response, it said it was willing to wait for several more days.North Korea has not yet reported any damage from the drought. Instead, its main state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, urged the country on Friday to produce more goods locally, especially raw materials and fuel, to overcome what it called \u201cbarbaric\u201d international sanctions pushed by the United States.The American tactic will never break the Communist neighbors\u2019 \u201cfriendly ties sealed in blood,\u201d it said, referring to when China and North Korea joined to fight the Americans during the 1950-53 Korean War. The newspaper also warned that the Chinese would gain little if they succumbed to pressure from the United States and hurt their neighbor.North Korea\u2019s trade with China grew 6.1 percent to $6 billion last year, the agency said. China accounts for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s external trade.Economists caution that it is difficult to offer reliable economic growth estimates for North Korea because it does not release its economic data. Analysts have often said the central bank\u2019s estimates on North Korean economic growth are too conservative.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crematory Is Booked? Japan Offers Corpse Hotels", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSAKA, Japan \u2014 The minimalist rooms at the Hotel Relation here in Japan\u2019s third-largest city are furnished with plain twin beds. Flat-screen televisions adorn the walls. Plastic-wrapped cups and toothbrushes are provided in the bathrooms. And just across the hall are the rooms where the corpses rest.Checkout time, for the living and the dead, is usually no later than 3 p.m.The Hotel Relation is what Japanese call an \u201citai hoteru,\u201d or corpse hotel. About half the rooms are fitted with small altars and narrow platforms designed to hold coffins. Some also have climate-controlled coffins with transparent lids so mourners can peer inside.Part mortuary, part inn, these hotels serve a growing market of Japanese seeking an alternative to a big, traditional funeral in a country where the population is aging rapidly, community bonds are fraying and crematories are struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people dying.By custom, Japanese families take the bodies of their loved ones home from the hospital and sit for an overnight wake followed by a service the next morning in the company of neighbors, colleagues and friends. Then, in the afternoon, the body is sent to a crematory.But as neighborhood ties have weakened, funerals that once involved entire communities are increasingly the province of small, nuclear families. At the same time, Japanese society is getting old so fast and deaths per year are climbing so quickly that families sometimes have to wait several days before a body can be cremated.The corpse hotels offer a practical solution \u2014 a place where a body can be stored at low cost until the crematory is ready, and where small, inexpensive wakes and services can be held outside the home.\u201cWe can say the supply doesn\u2019t meet the demand,\u201d mainly in urban areas, said Hiroshi Ota, an official at the Japan Society of Environmental Crematories. While Japan has an estimated 5,100 crematories, Tokyo, with a population of more than 13 million, has just 26.\u201cThe demand for cremation will increase until the baby boomers disappear,\u201d Mr. Ota said.Japan has funeral parlors, too, an industry that developed as people moved from the countryside to the cities and it became difficult \u2014 and often impossible \u2014 to take corpses into high-rises. But they cater to larger groups and more elaborate ceremonies, and these days, that can seem a bit much.In the bubble economy of the 1980s, \u201cJapanese funerals were based on showing off to other people, and people cared how they were viewed by others,\u201d said Midori Kotani, executive researcher at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, an arm of one of Japan\u2019s largest insurance companies. \u201cBut fewer and fewer people talk to their neighbors, so they don\u2019t have to show off or think about how they are viewed by them.\u201dThe corpse hotels are used by families who want a simpler affair, or want to skip a funeral altogether. According to Ms. Kotani, about 30 percent of deaths in the Tokyo area are not marked by a funeral service, up from just 10 percent a decade ago.After cremation, families usually keep the ashes at home for 49 days before a burial service at a cemetery. On the 49th day, according to Buddhist tradition, the dead are believed to arrive at the next world.When Hajime Iguchi died at age 83 last autumn, his sister and brother-in-law held his wake and funeral at Sousou, a corpse hotel in the Tokyo suburb of Kawasaki City. Mr. Iguchi, a lifelong bachelor, had died in a nursing home after a protracted illness, and had few friends left.\u201cBack in the day, we used to have funerals at home, but times have changed,\u201d said his sister, Kunie Abe, 73. \u201cNeighbors all used to know each other and would help one another out. But today, you don\u2019t even know your next-door neighbor.\u201dThe demand for \u201citai hoteru\u201d is likely to grow. Last year, 1.3 million people died in Japan, up 35 percent from 15 years earlier, and the annual toll is expected to climb until it peaks at 1.7 million in 2040, according to the Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare.About 37 percent of Japanese women who died last year were over 90, with few surviving friends to mourn them. And close to one-fifth of Japanese men never marry or father children, leaving behind few relatives to plan or attend funerals.The number of people dying alone is also on the rise. In Tokyo, for example, the number of people over 65 who died alone at home more than doubled between 2003 and 2015, the latest year for which government figures are available.At the Hotel Relation here in Osaka, about a third of the customers forgo a formal funeral. Instead, they sit in the rooms with their dearly departed for a day or two, with only close family in attendance, and then send the bodies for cremation.\u201cIn the past, if you heard someone held a funeral just for family members, people in the neighborhood would say, \u2018What kind of people would hold a family-only funeral?\u2019 But now it is accepted,\u201d said Yoshihiro Kurisu, the hotel\u2019s president.Corpse hotels are more economical than large funeral homes. According to the Japan Consumer Association, the average funeral in Japan runs 1.95 million yen, or about $17,690. The cheapest package at the Hotel Relation costs 185,000 yen, or about $1,768.The package includes flowers, a room for the family to spend the night in the same room as the corpse, a traditional white gown for the deceased, a simply decorated coffin, transport of the body from the hospital and then to the crematory, and an urn to hold the ashes. Each additional night costs 10,800 yen, just under $100. Families who want separate rooms, wakes or funerals pay extra.\u201cItai hoteru\u201d first appeared about five years ago in Japan\u2019s largest cities, and there are only a few across the country. Some have angered residents who do not want to live in such proximity to death and mourning.Near the Sousou hotel in Kawasaki City, signs on fences protest, \u201cCorpse storage: absolutely opposed!\u201dHisao Takegishi, the hotel\u2019s owner, said he understood why neighbors were uncomfortable. But he said his staff tried to be as discreet as possible when bringing in bodies.Inside, Mr. Takegishi painted the walls in pastel colors and equipped the rooms with green sofas and stools. They look more like start-up break areas than a setting for wakes or funerals. The entryway, with shelves of plants and a few books, evokes a spa.\u201cI did not want it to look too sad or lonely,\u201d he said. Sousou has relationships with funeral directors and monks, and can help clients plan modest services.Yuki Matsumoto, the executive director of the All Japan Funeral Directors Co-operation, which represents about 1,340 long-established funeral homes, said some owners of the new businesses paid little regard to standards or the dignity of the dead.Japan does not require a license to open a funeral business, and there are few regulations for how they operate. \u201cSo in this situation, it is possible that bad-intentioned businesses can enter the industry,\u201d Mr. Matsumoto said.But Mr. Kurisu at the Hotel Relation said traditional funeral homes just resented the new competition. \u201cI am hated by people in the business because I am driving down the prices of funeral services,\u201d he said.At Mr. Iguchi\u2019s tiny funeral ceremony last fall, a monk chanted last rites as his body rested in a coffin lined with white satin. Five guests, all relatives, sat in folding chairs nearby.After the chanting, they rose to lay flowers and origami cranes on Mr. Iguchi\u2019s body, making a bright garland around his head and on his chest.His sister, Mrs. Abe, leaned close to her brother\u2019s ear. \u201cSo long,\u201d she whispered.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bushmen Who Had the Whole Work-Life Thing Figured Out", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneEvery year automation and computerization squeeze out new segments of the labor force. In response, trade unions and workers anxiously wring their hands while savvy politicians demonize the \u201csinister\u201d forces of globalization and make promises about job retention that they almost certainly won\u2019t be able to keep.The anxiety induced by the prospect of ever greater automation is a far cry from the Jetson-like fantasies of robotic convenience that inspired so much optimism during the 20th century. This is hardly surprising. After all, work dominates our lives. It defines who we are, determines our social status, mediates our sense of self-worth, shapes our political affiliations and determines our entitlements to a slice of the economic pie.Sometimes referred to as the \u201cproblem of scarcity,\u201d the economic problem Keynes referred to is the fundamental principle of most economy theory. It assumes that although people\u2019s desires are limitless, the resources available to satisfy their needs and wants are limited. And as far as Keynes was concerned, the economic problem was nothing less than \u201cthe primary, most pressing problem of the human race\u201d from the \u201cbeginnings of life in its most primitive forms.\u201d\u201cWe have been expressly evolved by nature \u2014 with all our impulses and deepest instincts \u2014 for the purpose of solving the economic problem,\u201d he lamented. \u201cIf the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose.\u201dBut Keynes was ultimately an optimist. He believed economics to be a rational science and people, on the whole, to be capable of making economically rational choices when presented with them. So he took the view that, save a few \u201cpurposeful money makers,\u201d we would recognize the economic Utopia for what it was, slow down and \u201cenjoy the abundance\u201d when it arrived.Hindsight tells us that Keynes\u2019s optimism was misplaced. Capital growth and productivity are already much greater than he predicted they would be by 2030, and technological advances have exceeded his wildest expectations. Yet our collective appetite for work is undiminished.But in 1930, the idea that \u201cprimitive\u201d people with no interest in labor productivity or capital accumulation and with only simple technologies at their disposal had already solved the \u201ceconomic problem\u201d would have seemed preposterous.Subsequent research produced a more nuanced picture of the Ju/\u2019haonsi\u2019s affluence. It showed that they had an unyielding confidence in the providence of their environments and the knowledge of how to exploit this. As a result, they only ever procured enough food to meet their immediate needs confident that there was always more available, much like busy urbanites with empty refrigerators who get food on the go when they are hungry. This research also revealed that even though Ju/\u2019hoansi did not have to work particularly hard, they were neither indolent nor bereft of purpose. They found profound satisfaction from the work they did and used of their free time to make music, create art, make jewelry, tell stories, play games, relax and socialize.What was most compelling about this research was that it suggested that \u201ceconomic problem\u201d was neither universal nor the primary problem of the human race from the beginnings of time. For where the economic problem holds that we have unlimited wants and limited means, Ju/\u2019hoansi hunter-gatherers had few wants that were easily met.It is only very recently that the evolutionary importance of this work has become clear. New genomic research as well as a series of recent archaeological finds in southern Africa suggest that the hunter-gatherer lifestyle practiced by the Ju/\u2019haonsi extends back much further in time than was previously thought. Genomic data now indicates that our species has been around for more than 200,000 years and, if the recent discovery of a distinctly Homo sapiens-like jawbone in Morocco stands up to scrutiny, there is case to push this date back beyond 300,000 years. Genomic data also suggests that the Ju/\u2019hoansi and their broader genetic community \u2014 the Khoisan \u2014 have been hunting and gathering successfully in southern Africa for a significant proportion of human history. There is evidence to suggest that highly refined hunting technologies used by modern Ju/\u2019hoansi hunters stretches back at least 45,000 years and possibly as far back as 90,000 years ago.If the success of a civilization is judged primarily on its endurance over time, then the Ju/hoansi\u2019s ancestors\u2019 achievements render those of the ancient Egyptians, the Mayans or even the Victorians, mere novelties. It is difficult to be absolutely certain about how the Ju/\u2019hoansi\u2019s ancestors lived, but there is plenty more evidence to suggest that they were a lot like 20th century Ju/\u2019hoansi and very little evidence to suggest that they were particularly different from them. And if the Ju/\u2019hoansi are a good analog for how our ancestors lived, then this has implications for understanding our \u201cnatures\u201d and how we respond to challenges like automation.When Keynes bemoaned the \u201chabits and instincts\u201d bred into us over countless generations, he echoed a vision of human nature that existed long before economists determined that work was the elementary particle of human endeavor and that the economic problem was as much part of who we are as our instinct to fall in love. Now the evidence points to the Neolithic revolution as the genesis of the \u201ceconomic problem.\u201d For while agriculture was far more productive, it exposed rapidly growing populations to a new range of potentially catastrophic risks that inspired a range of innovations but that first and foremost placed a premium on human labor. For no matter how favorable the elements, farming requires plenty of hard work before it yields any rewards at all, and the consequences of not working are dire.But many environmental economists warn that we have reached the limits of growth and that our continued productivity risks cannibalizing our future. Yet mainstream strategies for dealing with problems like climate change and biodiversity remain firmly rooted in the core assumptions of the economic problem \u2014 they aim to find more sustainable ways for us to continue to produce, consume and work as much as we do. Likewise strategies proposed to manage the impacts of automation tend focus mainly on the question of how to find replacement work for those made redundant.But if our working culture is an artifact of the economic problem, then perhaps we would do better to embrace automation as an opportunity to reimagine our relationship with work so that we may, as Keynes put it, \u201clook forward to an age of leisure and abundance without dread.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Finds Reason for the U.S. to Remain in Afghanistan: Minerals", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, searching for a reason to keep the United States in Afghanistan after 16 years of war, has latched on to a prospect that tantalized previous administrations: Afghanistan\u2019s vast mineral wealth, which his advisers and Afghan officials have told him could be profitably extracted by Western companies.Mr. Trump has discussed the country\u2019s mineral deposits with President Ashraf Ghani, who promoted mining as an economic opportunity in one of their first conversations. Mr. Trump, who is deeply skeptical about sending more American troops to Afghanistan, has suggested that this could be one justification for the United States to stay engaged in the country.To explore the possibilities, the White House is considering sending an envoy to Afghanistan to meet with mining officials. Last week, as the White House fell into an increasingly fractious debate over Afghanistan policy, three of Mr. Trump\u2019s senior aides met with a chemical executive, Michael N. Silver, to discuss the potential for extracting rare-earth minerals. Mr. Silver\u2019s firm, American Elements, specializes in these minerals, which are used in a range of high-tech products.Stephen A. Feinberg, a billionaire financier who is informally advising Mr. Trump on Afghanistan, is also looking into ways to exploit the country\u2019s minerals, according to a person who has briefed him. Mr. Feinberg owns a large military contracting firm, DynCorp International, which could play a role in guarding mines \u2014 a major concern, given that some of Afghanistan\u2019s richest deposits are in areas controlled by the Taliban.In 2010, American officials estimated that Afghanistan had untapped mineral deposits worth nearly $1 trillion, an estimate that was widely disputed at the time and has certainly fallen since, given the eroding price of commodities. But the $1 trillion figure is circulating again inside the White House, according to officials, who said it had caught the attention of Mr. Trump.The lure of Afghanistan as a war-torn Klondike is well established: In 2006, the George W. Bush administration conducted aerial surveys of the country to map its mineral resources. Under President Barack Obama, the Pentagon set up a task force to try to build a mining industry in Afghanistan \u2014 a challenge that was stymied by rampant corruption, as well as security problems and the lack of roads, bridges or railroads.None of these hurdles has been removed in the last eight years, according to former officials, and some have worsened. They warn that the Trump administration is fooling itself if it believes that extracting minerals is a panacea for Afghanistan\u2019s myriad ills.\u201cIt would be dangerous to use the potential for resource exploitation as a selling point for military engagement,\u201d said Laurel Miller, a senior analyst at RAND who served until last month as the State Department\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cThe barriers to entry are really quite considerable, and that kind of argument could fuel suspicion about America\u2019s real intentions in Afghanistan.\u201dBut for Mr. Trump, as a businessman, it is arguably the only appealing thing about Afghanistan. Officials said he viewed mining as a \u201cwin-win\u201d that could boost that country\u2019s economy, generate jobs for Americans and give the United States a valuable new beachhead in the market for rare-earth minerals, which has been all but monopolized by China.China already has a $3 billion contract to develop a copper mine about 25 miles southeast of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Officials said Mr. Trump was determined not to spend American lives and treasure in Afghanistan only to watch China lock up its rare-earth deposits, which are used to make products from wind turbines to computer chips.Mr. Silver, the chemical executive, may head an effort to maximize the rights for American companies to extract these minerals, according to a senior official.Mr. Trump\u2019s interest also reflects how his military advisers have struggled to present him with other persuasive reasons to send troops to the country, where the United States has been at war since 2001.The White House\u2019s review of Afghanistan policy \u2014 led by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 was supposed to be finished by the middle of July. Instead, it bogged down after Mr. Trump expressed displeasure with a proposal from General McMaster for a modest troop increase and a multiyear commitment to the country.Policy meetings have become increasingly heated, officials said, as Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have squared off against General McMaster. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is also said to be unhappy with the current proposals.Vice President Mike Pence, not General McMaster, will lead a meeting Wednesday of National Security Council principals on Afghanistan. Some officials said that reflected General McMaster\u2019s isolation; others said that the general welcomed Mr. Pence\u2019s involvement and that the two were closely aligned on the policy.But Mr. Trump, it is clear, is not. In June, he grudgingly agreed to give Mr. Mattis the authority to send additional troops \u2014 a number believed to be about 4,000 \u2014 as a stopgap measure to stabilize security in Afghanistan. But Mr. Mattis has not yet used his authority, perhaps reflecting his recognition that the commander in chief is uncomfortable with it.When reporters last week asked Mr. Trump at a meeting at the Pentagon whether he planned to send more troops, he answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d and added, \u201cISIS is falling fast,\u201d suggesting he viewed the counterterrorism threat in Afghanistan as declining.Worried that Mr. Trump will be locked into policies that did not work for the last two presidents, Mr. Bannon and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have brought in outside voices, including Mr. Feinberg and Erik D. Prince, a founder of the private security firm Blackwater International. Both have urged using more private contractors and giving the C.I.A. an oversight role in the conflict.In addition, Mr. Feinberg has reached out to people involved in the Obama administration\u2019s effort to build Afghanistan\u2019s mining industry. Some warned him that the prospects for a profitable business are worse now than in 2009, given the decline in commodities prices and the deteriorating security in areas where the deposits are believed to lie.Afghanistan\u2019s deposits of copper and iron ore are trading at about a third of their 2010 prices. Most of the undiscovered deposits of rare-earth minerals are believed to be in Helmand Province, large parts of which are controlled by the Taliban.\u201cThere are undoubtedly minerals to be exploited in Afghanistan, which could help provide economic stability to the country in the future,\u201d said Daniel F. Feldman, a former special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cBut given all the obstacles, it could be many years before mining yields dividends for the Afghan people.\u201dOne advantage is that the Trump administration would have a willing partner in the Afghan government. During the Obama administration, President Ghani resisted the rapid development of the mining industry, largely because he worried about the threat of widespread corruption that would come with it.But as soon as Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Ghani reversed his position, contacting the Trump team and promoting Afghanistan\u2019s mineral wealth. He realized that Mr. Trump would be intrigued by the commercial possibilities, officials said.Mr. Trump has said little publicly about Afghanistan since being elected. But his thinking about what the United States should reap for its military efforts was made clear in another context soon after his inauguration. Speaking to employees of the C.I.A., the president said the United States had erred in withdrawing troops from Iraq without holding on to its oil.\u201cThe old expression \u2018To the victor belong the spoils,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cYou remember?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lawyer, the Addict", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "A high-powered Silicon Valley attorney dies. His ex-wife investigates, and finds a web of drug abuse in his profession.Supported byIn July 2015, something was very wrong with my ex-husband, Peter. His behavior over the preceding 18 months had been erratic and odd. He could be angry and threatening one minute, remorseful and generous the next. His voice mail messages and texts had become meandering soliloquies that didn\u2019t make sense, veering from his work travails, to car repairs, to his pet mouse, Snowball.I thought maybe the stress of his job as a lawyer had finally gotten to him, or that he was bipolar. He had been working more than 60 hours a week for 20 years, ever since he started law school and worked his way into a partnership in the intellectual property practice of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a prominent law firm based in Silicon Valley.Then, for two days, Peter couldn\u2019t be reached. So I drove the 20 minutes or so to his house, to look in on him. Although we were divorced, we had known each other by then for nearly 30 years. We were family.I parked in Peter\u2019s driveway, used my key to open the front door and walked up to the living room, a loftlike space with bamboo floors bathed in sunlight.\u201cPeter?\u201d I called out.Silence. A few candy wrappers littered a counter. Peter worked so much that he rarely cooked anymore, sustaining himself largely on fast food, snacks, coffee, ibuprofen and antacids. I headed toward the bedroom, calling his name.The door was ajar. A few crumpled and bloodied tissues were scattered on the bedsheets. And then I turned the corner and saw him, lying on the floor between the bathroom and the bedroom. His head rested on a flattened cardboard box.In my shock, I didn\u2019t see the half-filled syringes on the bathroom sink, or the spoon, lighter and crushed pills. I didn\u2019t see the bag of white powder, or the tourniquet, or the other lighter next to the bed. The police report from that day noted several safes around the bedroom, all of them open and spilling out translucent orange pill bottles.Peter, one of the most successful people I have ever known, died a drug addict, felled by a systemic bacterial infection common to intravenous users.Of all the heartbreaking details of his story, the one that continues to haunt me is this: The history on his cellphone shows the last call he ever made was for work. Peter, vomiting, unable to sit up, slipping in and out of consciousness, had managed, somehow, to dial into a conference call.None of this made sense. Not only was Peter one of the smartest people in my life, he had also been a chemist before becoming a lawyer and most likely understood how the drugs he was taking would affect his neurochemistry.In my attempt to fathom what happened to him and how I \u2014 and everyone else in his world \u2014 missed it, I set out to create a map of Peter\u2019s life the year before he died. (To protect the privacy of our children and Peter\u2019s extended family, I\u2019m not using his surname.)I studied his texts to drug dealers, and I compared the timing of those with dates and times of A.T.M. withdrawals he made. I needed to see the signs I hadn\u2019t known were signs. The nonsensical conversations. The crazy hours he kept. The nights he told our children he was running out to get a soda, only to disappear.Human beings are physically and emotionally complex, so there is no simple answer as to why Peter began abusing drugs. But as a picture of his struggle took shape before my eyes, so did another one: The further I probed, the more apparent it became that drug abuse among America\u2019s lawyers is on the rise and deeply hidden.One of the first things I learned is that there is little research on lawyers and drug abuse. Nor is there much data on drug use among lawyers compared with the general population or white-collar workers specifically.Over all, the results showed that about 21 percent of lawyers qualify as problem drinkers, while 28 percent struggle with mild or more serious depression and 19 percent struggle with anxiety. Only 3,419 lawyers answered questions about drug use, and that itself is telling, said Patrick Krill, the study\u2019s lead author and also a lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s left to speculation what motivated 75 percent of attorneys to skip over the section on drug use as if it wasn\u2019t there.\u201dIn Mr. Krill\u2019s opinion, they were afraid to answer.Nearly 21 percent of the lawyers that said they had used drugs in the previous year reported \u201cintermediate\u201d concern about their drug use. Three percent had \u201csevere\u201d concerns.\u201cAlcohol is legal,\u201d Mr. Krill said, not to mention socially acceptable. \u201cSo admitting you drink too much is not directly at odds with your role as a licensed attorney.\u201dIllicit drug use, however, is illegal. \u201cI think the incidence of drug use and abuse is significantly underreported,\u201d he said.In recent years, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a significant rate of increase specifically among attorneys using prescription medications that become a gateway to street drugs.\u201d It used to be mostly alcohol, he said, \u201cbut now almost every attorney that comes in for treatment, even if they drink, they are using drugs, too \u2014 Xanax, Adderall, opiates, cocaine and crack.\u201dOpioids and stimulants often go hand in hand with alcohol. In fact, drugs are sometimes used to combat the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.In addition to having a private practice at the time, Mr. Cuban was working for his well-known brother, the businessman Mark Cuban, who threatened to fire Brian if he didn\u2019t get sober. \u201cI kept thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not going to rehab. I\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t go to rehab, they aren\u2019t in 12-step programs,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, half the people I know in my 12-step program are lawyers.\u201dThat stress became particularly acute as the economy sank after the 2008 financial crisis. Jobs became more scarce. The pressure grew to not take time off from work.At Peter\u2019s memorial service in 2015 \u2014 held in a place he loved, with sweeping views of the Pacific \u2014 a young associate from his firm stood up to speak of their friendship and of the bands they sometimes went to see together, only to break down in tears. Quite a few of the lawyers attending the service were bent over their phones, reading and tapping out emails.Peter himself lived in a state of heavy stress. He obsessed about the competition, about his compensation, about the clients, their demands and his fear of losing them. He loved the intellectual challenge of his work but hated the combative nature of the profession, because it was at odds with his own nature.Long before law school, when Peter was still in his early 20s and wearing his hair in a long ponytail, his passions were science, philosophy and music. One of his idols was the astronomer Carl Sagan. Another was Jimi Hendrix. He gave me books like \u201cSiddhartha\u201d and \u201cLetters to a Young Poet\u201d and played bass guitar in bands from college onward, even while a lawyer.When he was a graduate student in chemistry, we spent whole weekends lying on the floor playing records for each other, talking about why we loved them and what memories a particular song snatched from the recesses of our minds.After graduation, Peter worked for two small pharmaceutical companies but found the profession tedious and low paying. Having grown up in a low-income family, he didn\u2019t want to worry about paying the bills again. So he decided to use his chemistry background to become a patent lawyer.When he graduated from law school, the starting salary of his first job in law was five times what he had earned as a chemist. But our lives were not suddenly easy. Although we had enough money, Peter\u2019s work schedule gave him little time to enjoy the fruits of his labor.One Christmas Day early in his career, Peter\u2019s boss phoned from a ski lift in Aspen, Colo., to make sure Peter was going to finish a brief by that evening. He did, skipping dinner.\u201cI can\u2019t do this forever,\u201d Peter often told me. \u201cI can\u2019t keep going like this for the next 20 years.\u201dPeter battled his own brand of melancholy, something I found attractive in a tragically poetic, still-waters-run-deep kind of way. He used to tell me he wasn\u2019t someone who ever really felt happy. He had moments of being \u201cnot unhappy,\u201d he said, but his emotional range was narrow.When something great happened, he didn\u2019t jump for joy. When something sad happened, he didn\u2019t break down and cry. The only times I ever saw tears in his eyes were in the hospital, right after each of our children was born.Yet for almost a decade as an associate at various law firms, Peter displayed no photos of his children or me in his office. When I asked him why \u2014 particularly when other lawyers seemed to have photos in theirs \u2014 Peter told me he didn\u2019t want the partners to see him as \u201cdistracted by my family.\u201dIn many ways, Peter\u2019s personality and abilities read like a wish list of qualities for a lawyer. Trained as a scientist, he approached problems in a deliberative, logical way. He was intelligent, ambitious and most of all hard-working, perhaps because his decision to go to law school was such an enormous commitment \u2014 financially, logistically and emotionally \u2014 that he could justify it only by being the very best.And he was. In law school he was editor of the law review and No. 1 in his class. He gave the speech at graduation.He also had a single-minded focus that could border on obsessive. I remember when he became consumed with Bach\u2019s harpsichord concertos, assembling a library of every one he could find. He read about them, listened to lectures about them and even found a mathematical representation of a particular piece on YouTube, which he had us all watch. That level of focus was well suited for deep dives into the new drug formulations, medical devices and technologies with which he had to constantly and quickly familiarize himself.In addition, he said, law students generally start school with their sense of self and their values intact. But, in his research, he said, he has found that the formal structure of law school starts to change that.Rather than hew to their internal self, students begin to focus on external values, he said, like status, comparative worth and competition. \u201cWe have seven very strong studies that show this twists people\u2019s psyches and they come out of law school significantly impaired, with depression, anxiety and hostility,\u201d he said.Academics often study law students because students are considered a bellwether for the profession. \u201cThey are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d Dr. Benjamin said.Wil Miller, the lawyer and former methamphetamine addict, said that in his experience, law school encouraged students to take emotion out of their decisions. \u201cWhen you start reinforcing that with grades and money, you aren\u2019t just suppressing your emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re fundamentally changing who you are.\u201dAfter students began law school they experienced \u201ca marked increase in depression, negative mood and physical symptoms, with corresponding decreases in positive affect and life satisfaction,\u201d the professors wrote.Students also shed some of their idealism. Within the first year of law school, students\u2019 motivation for studying law and becoming lawyers shifted from \u201chelping and community-oriented values to extrinsic, rewards-based values.\u201d\u201cThese aren\u2019t the majority of lawyers,\u201d she added. \u201cBut there are quite a number abusing drugs, and once they get to heroin, it\u2019s very hard to break it.\u201dFor the last two years of his life, every time Peter and I were together \u2014 whether it was back-to-school night, our son\u2019s cross country meets or our daughter\u2019s high school graduation \u2014 people would ask me if he was O.K. They asked if he had cancer, an eating disorder, a metabolic disorder, AIDS. But they never asked about drugs.Drugs didn\u2019t cross my mind, either. Not even the day I found his body, surrounded by drug paraphernalia, and called 911.That day in Peter\u2019s house, the emergency medical workers told me right away that it was probably a drug overdose. I remember saying, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d After all, I said, he was a partner at a law firm. He had an Ivy League education.\u201cHow could that be?\u201d I asked one of them. \u201cHe was so smart.\u201dID around her neck and clipboard on her lap, she nodded at me with a look of understanding. \u201cWe see a lot of this now,\u201d she said, meaning wealthy, accomplished men and women who start out with pain pills and graduate to amphetamines or heroin.As I cleared out Peter\u2019s house after he died, I found receipts from medical-supply companies that had delivered things like bandages and tourniquets to his office address. Yet I don\u2019t think addiction crossed the mind of anyone he worked with, either.It\u2019s difficult, though, to imagine that one class every three years would have prevented Peter \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 from becoming an addict. Real change, experts and recovering addicts say, needs to happen at the law-firm level, but that is complicated by an entrenched culture of privacy combined with an allegiance to billable hours.Ms. Smith, formerly of Pillsbury Winthrop, says she doesn\u2019t know what her previous firm knew or didn\u2019t know about her substance abuse. \u201cThey never said a thing to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd during that entire time I was an addict, I didn\u2019t get a single negative performance review.\u201dEdward Flanders, managing partner in Pillsbury\u2019s Manhattan office, said the firm was not aware of Ms. Smith\u2019s substance abuse issues when she was there. Ms. Smith spoke about her experience to the firm\u2019s New York City employees in March.\u201cHearing about her experience was pretty eye-opening for the firm, and it\u2019s not something we want anyone else to have to go through alone,\u201d Mr. Flanders said.I\u2019ve spent the past two years marinating in this mess, trying my best to navigate things like the byzantine probate process and my children\u2019s broken hearts. I firmly believe that law-firm culture, particularly at big firms, has to become more compassionate and more aware of the signs that one of their own is struggling.Looking back, I can see the signs I missed.There was the time our son broke his wrist playing soccer four years ago and was prescribed Vicodin; Peter rifled through my medicine cabinet looking for the leftovers. \u201cI use them for my back,\u201d he said.There was the holiday concert in which our son\u2019s band was performing where Peter showed up late and jittery, looking so thin that I noticed his head seemed too big for his neck. After the show I walked with him to his car, and he complained that he was getting pushback from his firm about working from home so much.\u201cI\u2019m more productive at home, but they have to see me, physically, in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think I\u2019m working if I\u2019m not there.\u201dThey were right.And there was the time in early 2015 when my son told me Peter had received a shipment from Amazon that he had opened at the dining room table, pulling out boxes of syringes, bandages, cotton balls and wound cleanser. Peter explained it away as simply stocking up on medical supplies.My son was puzzled by that. But by then his father\u2019s behavior had become so strange, this almost seemed normal. \u201cI just put my headphones on,\u201d my son told me, \u201cand said, \u2018I have to do homework.\u2019\u201dYears ago, when Peter was still a relatively new associate, he would joke that the perfect drug for him would be the combination of an antidepressant, a pain reliever and a stimulant. When I cleaned out his house, I found the ingredients for it: Vicodin, Tramadol, Adderall, cocaine, Xanax, crystal meth and a kaleidoscope of pills I couldn\u2019t identify, but not for lack of trying.Yet even as addiction was taking over his life, Peter continued working. In the notebooks he used to keep track of injection times and dosages, he also made cryptic notes about client calls and meetings, lists of things needed to prepare documents, filing deadlines.Being a patent lawyer is intellectually grueling work, and Peter was good at it \u2014 really good at it \u2014 for a long time. Perhaps the arrogance that grows from a profession in which your advice is worth $600 an hour is what allowed him to believe he didn\u2019t need to ask for help, that he could kick this on his own. Just another item on his lengthy to-do list.In fact, while cleaning out his house I found a list of New Year\u2019s resolutions Peter wrote in December 2014, tucked into the bottom of a dresser drawer. \u201cRun three races, spend more time with kids,\u201d his note to himself read.And in red marker, the word \u201cquit.\u201dAn article last Sunday about lawyers and drug addiction misstated the period during which Wil Miller, a former sex crimes prosecutor, was addicted to methamphetamines. It was the last six months of his tenure, not the entire 10 years he was in the job. The article also misspelled Mr. Miller\u2019s given name as Will.An earlier version of this article referred incompletely to Lisa Smith\u2019s association with the firm Pillsbury Winthrop. While Ms. Smith was a lawyer, she was working in the firm\u2019s marketing department, not as a lawyer, during the period she said she used cocaine to deal with alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Produced by Antonio de Luca and Whitney Richardson.Advertisement"}

Senga Nengudi\u2019s \u201cRapunzel,\u201d a large staged photograph from 1981, pushes fairy tale into nightmare, and Ellen Berkenblit\u2019s painting shows her signature pointy-nosed heroine, who blends with and confronts an abstract jangle of color and fabric. Kandis Williams\u2019s \u201cCervical Smile\u201d takes on the feigned happiness demanded of women from pre-Freudian times forward; it might be titled \u201cFrom Hysteria to Hollywood.\u201d The three paintings from Dawn Mellor\u2019s series of exuberantly vandalized celebrity portraits are among her best, ambiguously balancing what has been done to the canvas and to its subject. In her painting \u201cReg Park and the Hard Gainers,\u201d Suzanne McClelland scatters cyclones of dark marks and smears with contrasting body measurements and weights. Maybe competing boxers? Reg Park is the father of modern bodybuilding; hardgainers are devotees who don\u2019t achieve results. The painting portrays a man desperate to be manlier.Seen in New York for the first time, the work by the Canadian artist Liz Magor consists of two sculptures: enigmatic, seemingly lost parcels on the floor. Each is a paper bag containing a large wrapped box and a pair of old-fashioned hosiery still in cellophane. The colors and surfaces of the papers are overly intense and matched to the hosiery; secrets of the flesh are sensed, displaced and remain hidden. Also new to New York are the extraordinary little tableaus of f.maquespenteado, a Brazilian-born artist based in Portugal.

Some collaborations are featured here at little altarlike work stations displaying tools and partly made products alongside finished ones. Among the best is a Japanese hanten, or padded jacket, in indigo fabric patterned with eyes. An Amish quasi-hanten covered with bright quilting is iffier. The designers\u2019 capacity for cuteness and witty tchotchkes can sometimes wear thin, but their international design wonderland is not to be missed.ROBERTA SMITHThrough Aug. 4.

Alice Mackler\u2019s earthenware figure combines squeezes, pokes and thumbprints with a rooster-colored glaze, creating a startling mannequin of bright-eyed psychological defiance. Kevin McNamee-Tweed\u2019s winning monoprints look like plates from a hobo history of civilization, and in Charlie Roberts\u2019s trippy lavender acrylic of a charismatic dancing house plant, apparently rough edges belie a deeply satisfying sense of balance.The single most lingering detail may be on one of two untitled works by Hawkins Bolden (1914-2005), who lost his sight as a child in Memphis and spent much of his life assembling found junk into scarecrows for his garden. The headless figure is composed of a plastic torso from a child\u2019s doll whose arms and legs have been removed and reaffixed. Three jagged holes pierce the figure\u2019s chest and abdomen, where the nipples and navel would be, as if to form a simple face, and a modest tangle of metal wire emerges from two of the holes. Plastic gears are visible through the neck. But it\u2019s the cruciform arms, designed to look as if they\u2019re reaching for a hug, that I\u2019m still thinking about.

{"Headline": "Review: A \u2018Rake\u2019s Progress\u2019 for a Fame-Hungry Internet Age", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStravinsky\u2019s 1951 opera is written in a Neo-Classical style: Its music alludes to composers such as Mozart and Bach, but is nonetheless laced with pungent 20th-century dissonance, off-kilter rhythms and angular vocal lines. Sometimes Mr. McBurney\u2019s production adopts this self-conscious fakeness. The singers are restricted to stylized gestures, and appear onstage in neatly symmetrical groupings. The opera\u2019s happy opening scene between Tom and his girlfriend, Anne Trulove, plays out in front of flat projections of idyllic pastoral scenes, recalling the Hogarth engravings that served as the source for W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman\u2019s libretto.Michael Levine\u2019s set is a white box whose walls are made of paper, suggesting that Tom is an empty page. A kind of modern Faust, he is soon tempted by Nick Shadow, a demonic figure who tears his way through the paper walls to claim that he brings Tom a great fortune, and to cart him off to London. Played by the bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen with verve and a black suit, Nick offers big-city slickness to the na\u00efve Tom.Tom\u2019s adventures in London society, more Dionysus than Dickens, get a flashy modern gloss here. With projections and a group of actors, including more tearing through walls, Mr. McBurney creates vivid vignettes of clubs, skyscrapers, a brothel (including the amusing Hilary Summers as the madam Mother Goose), a stock market crash and Tom\u2019s medley of sexual partners (both women and men). The irony and sharp edges of Stravinsky\u2019s score, as well as the humor of the madcap staging, keep us at a distance from the action, able to witness Tom\u2019s downfall with a cool, critical eye.Mr. McBurney\u2019s targets may be on the obvious side, but the staging succeeds through its visual wit and sudden swerves into pathos. When Tom sits in front of his bed and sings \u201cI wish I were happy,\u201d the music is chilly and austere, and the white box surrounding Mr. Appleby seems to offer no comfort at all. As the auctioneer Sellem, the bald and spectacled Alan Oke bore some resemblance to Stravinsky, dispassionately selling off the 18th-century artifacts of Tom and Baba\u2019s house \u2014 or relics from the warehouse of music past.Despite its humor, everything in this production leads to death and loss. As Nick pushes Tom ever further down the path of debauchery, and eventually penury, the tears in the paper walls multiply. By the third act\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d-like graveyard scene, in which Tom plays a card game for his soul, the walls are scarred from his ordeals, implying both psychic damage and hard-won experience.His voice underlined by a creepy harpsichord, Tom wins his soul, but Nick takes his mind. The final scene, in which Tom wanders through Bedlam, is acted with haunting economy by Mr. Appleby on bare stage.The epilogue echoes \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d as well: The whole cast reminds the audience of the story\u2019s moral, and warns against \u201cidle hands and hearts and minds.\u201d In other words, get off Twitter.Advertisement"}

Sam Brownback of Kansas Will Be Nominated as Religious Ambassador", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam Brownback, the beleaguered governor of Kansas whose aggressively conservative fiscal polices turned some fellow Republicans against him, will be nominated to serve as ambassador at large for international religious freedom, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.Mr. Brownback, 60, represented his home state in Congress before being elected to two terms as governor beginning in 2011.Melika Willoughby, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brownback, said he remained Kansas\u2019 governor as of Wednesday night. She said there would a news conference on Thursday afternoon, but declined to comment beyond Mr. Brownback\u2019s Twitter statement.Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, a doctor from suburban Kansas City who previously served in the State Legislature, is expected to take over as governor if Mr. Brownback\u2019s nomination is confirmed by the United States Senate.In the ambassadorship, Mr. Brownback would lead the Office of International Religious Freedom, which is under the umbrella of the State Department and charged with promoting religious freedom as a foreign policy objective.Mr. Brownback\u2019s policies were seen as a test of the Republican doctrine that lowering the tax burden on businesses would attract employers to the state and help the economy grow. It was being closely watched by conservatives across the country to see how it might affect Kansas. But the growth never came.Mr. Brownback will leave Kansas at a time of uncertainty over funding for public education. The Kansas Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the constitutionality of the state\u2019s new school funding mechanism.\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of failed leadership,\u201d said State Representative Melissa Rooker, a moderate Republican who has frequently opposed Mr. Brownback\u2019s policies. She said she did not know what to expect from Mr. Colyer, a Republican and an ally of Mr. Brownback\u2019s, because he was not involved in the day-to-day dealings of the Legislature.Representative Jim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House, said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d to hear of the appointment, which has been rumored in Topeka for months.\u201cI\u2019m not going to miss him,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cHe has left a state in carnage and destruction.\u201dMr. Ward said that he believed the governor \u201chad the background\u201d for his new role, but that \u201che hasn\u2019t embraced diversity\u201d consistently in Kansas. \u201cHopefully, this job that he\u2019ll step into, he\u2019ll realize that Americans are of all kinds of faith,\u201d Mr. Ward said.Representative Ron Ryckman Jr., a Republican and the House speaker, said Mr. Brownback was \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d for the ambassadorship. \u201cI wish him all the best in his new post and would like to express my gratitude for his extensive service to the State of Kansas,\u201d he said.Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state, who is running to succeed Mr. Brownback, said, \u201cHe is the first truly conservative governor that Kansas has had in the last 40 years, and so he definitely made history in that respect.\u201dMr. Kobach added, \u201cOn the other hand, though, he faced a real battle at the end to preserve the tax cuts, and I wish he had won.\u201dIn announcing the intended nomination, the White House noted that Mr. Brownback, a former United States senator and congressman, \u201cworked actively on the issue of religious freedom in multiple countries and was a key sponsor of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.\u201dMr. Brownback, a father of five who comes from a farming family, has also been a lawyer, a state secretary of agriculture and a one-time presidential candidate.John Eligon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As \u2018Brexit\u2019 Clock Ticks, U.K. Seems Adrift", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuch descriptions of Britain\u2019s leaders are perhaps not all that surprising, given the country\u2019s often colorful political wars. Except they were issued not by opponents of the governing Conservative Party, whose lawmakers are negotiating the country\u2019s departure from the 28-nation bloc, but by people in or close to it.With the British currency languishing, the standard of living progressively squeezed and investors starting to take fright, there is markedly less bravado in London about a new age of opportunities for a \u201cglobal Britain.\u201d Amid a growing sense of drift, gone is the talk of a \u201cred, white and blue Brexit\u201d \u2014 a reference to the colors of the national flag.\u201cI am not sure that anybody is in control at the moment,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cThere are about as many views about the direction of Brexit as there are members of the cabinet.\u201dThe chaos is being met with consternation elsewhere in the European Union, where negotiators say they are beginning to wonder if the British will ever decide on a coherent strategy.\u201cOver the last 12 months, we have heard everything and the opposite: hard Brexit, soft Brexit, quick Brexit, long Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you follow what is coming out of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, it is not clear what vision Britain is opting for.\u201dThe prime minister is pleading for an end to the ferocious \u201cbackbiting and carping\u201d in the Conservative Party, and she lectured her cabinet this week on the importance of keeping internal discussions confidential.Her pleas came after reports that the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, had said at a recent cabinet meeting that public sector workers \u2014 who are subject to a cap on pay increases of 1 percent, when inflation is more than 2.5 percent \u2014 were overpaid compared with their counterparts in the private sector.Things went only marginally better on Thursday, when the European Union\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, emerged from a meeting in Brussels with Mr. Davis to lament that he still had no idea of Britain\u2019s positions on the most basic issues, like how much the country will owe the bloc in its so-called divorce bill.Officially, Britain is still pursuing the vision of a clean break with the European Union that Mrs. May outlined in January, one that prioritizes immigration and the supremacy of British courts \u2014 even over the interests of the economy.Unfortunately for Mrs. May, voters hinted last month that they did not support that approach. With a shortage of nurses and doctors in the National Health Service, among other labor shortfalls, there is a growing realization that Britain is dependent on foreign workers.As a result, the prime minister\u2019s plan for the withdrawal may not have the support of a majority of her cabinet, let alone of Parliament \u2014 a challenge she must contend with while fighting to keep her job and as potential successors circle.Logic suggests that, given the divisive nature of the withdrawal from the European Union and the Conservatives\u2019 recent electoral showing, the party should shift to a softer approach in negotiations, perhaps enlisting the support of lawmakers from the opposition Labour Party. But the leadership struggle is taking precedence.\u201cThe national interest and parliamentary arithmetic would dictate some kind of grand coalition on Brexit,\u201d Mr. Bale said. \u201cBut the logic of the internal politics of the Conservative Party points the prime minister, and aspirant leaders, away from the obvious solution.\u201dThe contenders to succeed Mrs. May \u2014 Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, as well as Mr. Hammond and Mr. Davis \u2014 will ultimately be chosen by members of the Conservative Party, who tend to be emphatically supportive of leaving the bloc, and who will not tolerate backsliding into a diluted withdrawal.So, as Mr. Hammond leads the push for a softer, less economically risky strategy, supporters of a harder exit are pushing back.Britain is a big and diverse country that imports many goods from the Continent, which means there are incentives on both sides to strike a deal \u2014 and Mr. Fritz-Vannahme and others say they believe a sensible outcome can be brokered.As the clock ticks, though, British businesses are growing nervous. So far this year, investment in the auto sector has been about $840 million, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group. If that trend continues, the annual total will be well below the $3.2 billion invested in 2015, the last full year before the vote on European Union membership. Carmakers worry that leaving the European customs union would mean the imposition of tariffs and the disruption of complex international supply chains, both of which would raise their production costs.At the same time, many banks are planning to relocate members of staff, in the expectation that firms based in London will lose the right to offer services across the European Union once Britain leaves the single market. And airlines will be affected unless a deal is reached to protect their right to fly to and from continental Europe. The budget airline easyJet has already announced plans to set up a new carrier, with headquarters in Austria, to allow it to continue operating flights across the bloc after Britain\u2019s withdrawal.Trying to steady the ship, Justice Secretary David Lidington dismissed reports of political infighting as little more than the product of summer garden parties: \u201ctoo much sun, and too much warm prosecco.\u201dFew are buying that, however, and many analysts say they expect the feuding to continue until Mrs. May is pushed aside and a successor is named. But solving the leadership crisis may take time, which Britain can ill afford as far as the withdrawal process is concerned. And as Mrs. May herself has signaled, forcing her out could lead to a new general election that could be won by Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. So the jockeying, backbiting and carping might continue for some time.Either way, the feuding reflects more than internecine battles among the Conservative grandees. It also reflects a growing, if belated, realization that there are few good options for Britain.A so-called cliff-edge withdrawal that cuts many ties with the European Union without establishing new trade arrangements could lead to a sharp recession and an unpopular jolt to voters who had been promised a sunny future in a prosperous trading nation.At the opposite end of the spectrum is what is being called the Norway option, in which Britain would leave the European Union but try to remain a part of its economic structures. That would put the country in a worse position than it is in today, forcing it to pay money to the bloc and to accept European rules without having a say in making them.Mr. Hammond is trying to thread the needle, softening the possible economic hit a little by allowing for businesses to have a transition period to adapt to new rules.A looming question is whether Britain should seek to replicate elements of its membership of the European Union\u2019s customs union, which eliminates tariffs on industrial goods. That could reassure big industries like the auto and pharmaceuticals sectors, and it might ease the border problem in Northern Ireland, which would have a frontier with the European Union because the Republic of Ireland, its neighbor, is a member of the bloc.But it would most likely prevent Britain from striking trade deals with non-European nations, as supporters of leaving the union had promised.As the negotiations progress, and the trade-offs and costs of leaving the European Union become clearer, the choices are likely to become even harder.\u201cBritons are not very honest with themselves,\u201d Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said. \u201cThe harder, sharper the Brexit, the harder the economic situation will be.\u201dPerhaps it was in recognition of such troubles that Mr. Hammond offered a recent toast.\u201cIn victory, you deserve Champagne,\u201d he told a gathering at the French Embassy in London, in a slight variation on the words of Winston Churchill. \u201cIn defeat, you need it.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With State Finances Shaky, Kansas Governor Prepares to Step Down", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 For more than six years, Gov. Sam Brownback has steered Kansas on a hard right turn on one issue after another: taxes, guns, abortion rights, Medicaid and welfare benefits.He will leave as an unpopular leader of a state in uncertain fiscal health, with more robust conservative policies and governed by a Legislature in which many in his own Republican Party have defied him. Polished, persistent and self-assured, Mr. Brownback has been seen as a model for the opportunities and perils of governing without compromise from the right on both social and fiscal issues.\u201cHe puts the lie to the myth that the default strategy is just to go as conservative as you possibly can in Kansas,\u201d said Chapman Rackaway, a longtime observer of Kansas politics, now at the University of West Georgia.On Thursday, standing beneath a buffalo head mounted on the wall of his office, Mr. Brownback was by turns contemplative, jovial and emotional as he announced that his time as governor would be coming to an end. For about the first five minutes, he listed what he felt were his accomplishments, including a sustainable water plan for western Kansas farmers and the growth of the state\u2019s wind energy industry.\u201cI\u2019d like to have kept the income taxes lower,\u201d Mr. Brownback said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to have kept the business tax deduction.\u201dYet he remained defiant to the criticism that his tax policies had left the state with huge budget deficits. Asked if he should have approached his tax policies differently, he largely blamed a weak national economy for the state\u2019s fiscal woes.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I could change, it\u2019d be the price of oil and the price of wheat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hit a recession in \u201915.\u201dMr. Brownback\u2019s nomination is something of an anticlimactic turn for a figure who once sought to cut a path from the Iowa caucuses to the White House, and then reinvented himself as a tax-slashing activist governor.Viewed last year as a prospect for President Trump\u2019s cabinet, Mr. Brownback will settle instead into a low-profile diplomatic post with no particular political clout.Still, in his remarks, he spoke fervidly of his new role. At one point, explaining how taking communion could get people killed in some countries, Mr. Brownback, who is Catholic, became red in the face, paused and had to take a sip from a Styrofoam cup before continuing to speak.In some respects, the position may be a return to an earlier version of Mr. Brownback\u2019s political persona: During his time in the United States Senate, he was known chiefly as an articulate and well-mannered advocate for conservative social issues, like opposing abortion and human cloning, and for speaking out on issues of international human rights.Bob Vander Plaats, an evangelical activist in Iowa, said that when Mr. Brownback ran for president in 2008, he was not viewed as the tax-cutting crusader he turned out to be as governor.\u201cNot that lowering taxes wasn\u2019t important to us, but he was always seen as a pro-family candidate,\u201d said Mr. Vander Plaats, who backed Mike Huckabee that year.To critics and allies alike, Mr. Brownback\u2019s fatal flaw might have been his unyielding devotion to his conservative tax doctrine.He argued that Kansas should be more like Texas and Florida, states without income tax \u2014 though he barely addressed the concerns of people who said that those states had other major revenue generators in oil and tourism.Dan Hawkins, a Republican state representative, has been a close ally of Mr. Brownback\u2019s over the years. He said the governor \u201chas had an extremely successful administration,\u201d pointing to things like welfare overhaul and privatizing the state\u2019s Medicaid system.But Mr. Brownback\u2019s tax policy was his downfall, Mr. Hawkins said.\u201cMaybe the governor was out there a little bit on his own, away from mainstream Kansas on his tax policy,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s maybe why you have the backlash. To demonize him over it is wrong, too. What he wanted was laudable. He wanted growth for Kansas.\u201dThe governor\u2019s stubbornness in sticking with conservative orthodoxy on taxes was in some ways counter to his more pragmatic approach in other areas.He recently toured the state\u2019s western reaches to promote conservation measures for the Ogallala Aquifer, the nation\u2019s largest freshwater aquifer, whose depletion could be detrimental to Kansas\u2019 vital agricultural economy.And he has been generally supportive of providing financial incentives to renewable energy providers as a way of boosting Kansas\u2019 wind energy industry.And allies, like State Senator Ty Masterson, a Republican, praised the governor\u2019s accomplishments, saying Kansas had gone from \u201can abortion state to a strong anti-abortion state, and from a high-income-tax to a low-income-tax state.\u201d\u201cIt is true our state government had some hard spending choices to make with the slower tax revenue growth, but our people had more money in their pockets, until this year, when the new Legislature overrode his veto and gave that hard choice back to our constituents,\u201d Mr. Masterson said.To Steve Brunk, a former Republican state representative, Mr. Brownback\u2019s reputation was hurt by what he felt were distortions about the impact of his tax policy and state spending.He said that lawmakers under Mr. Brownback increased funding for schools \u2014 though education advocates argued that those increases did not keep up with inflation, and the costs of supporting growing school populations.Mr. Brunk also pointed to legislation passed in 2015 that increased consumption taxes \u2014 on things like cigarettes and the sales tax \u2014 and closed tax loopholes as ways that the governor was working to help right the state\u2019s finances.\u201cIn my mind it was just a matter of waiting for the economy to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe now that it is recovering. And so the tax cuts that are in place would do a lot to stimulate the economy.\u201dOthers, including many Republicans, saw less to praise. State Representative Stephanie Clayton, a moderate Republican, said she was \u201cexcited\u201d about Mr. Brownback\u2019s likely departure and called it \u201can opportunity for Kansas to have a fresh start, for us to return to dignity in governing.\u201dMs. Clayton said the governor\u2019s tenure had been marked by division within the Republican caucus and political hostility toward moderates like her.But Ms. Clayton said she did not doubt that Mr. Brownback was genuine in his conservative beliefs.\u201cThe man was not insincere. He believes what he does,\u201d Ms. Clayton said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t just doing it for political benefit.\u201dOn the Christian right, his nomination was applauded. \u201cIn his time in the United States Senate, religious liberty was one of his top priorities, not only for Christians but for religious minorities around the world,\u201d said Gary Bauer, a prominent Christian activist.Aaron Estabrook, executive director of the Save Kansas Coalition, which has criticized Mr. Brownback and advocated political moderation, said he was \u201crelieved\u201d to know the governor was moving on.\u201cI think good leaders acknowledge mistakes, and they adjust,\u201d Mr. Estabrook said, \u201cand he just never did that.\u201dJohn Eligon reported from Topeka, and Julie Bosman from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Sees U.S. Economic Growth as Steady but Slow", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s view of the American economy, which it updated Friday in a semiannual report to Congress is out: steady growth still impeded by a range of problems.The report gives the reasons for confidence, describing the steady growth of consumer spending on the foundation of a solid economic expansion. However, it also highlighted a number of reasons that growth has remained relatively slow by historical standards.The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in June for the third consecutive quarter, a sign of confidence in the strength of the economy. It also announced that it planned to start reducing its securities holdings by the end of the year.The Fed pointed to evidence that lenders are seeking opportunities to take larger risks. It noted, for example, that companies with poor credit ratings are able to borrow at interest rates that are unusually close to the rates for companies with good credit ratings. The differences \u201cnow stand near the bottom of their historical ranges,\u201d the Fed said.Yet demand for loans remains weak. \u201cApparent high risk appetite in asset markets has not led to increased borrowing in the nonfinancial sector,\u201d the report said.In a similar vein, the Fed said banks reported a broad decline in loan demand during the first quarter of 2017, \u201ceven as lending standards on such loans were reported to be basically unchanged.\u201dThe Fed publishes the assessment, called the Monetary Policy Report, twice a year, in the winter and the summer. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, will appear before House and Senate committees on Wednesday and Thursday to present the report.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said Thursday that uncertainty about federal fiscal policy may be weighing on the economy once again. Businesses reported a burst of optimism after President Trump\u2019s election, in part because of hope that the new administration would enact fiscal policies like tax cuts. But that optimism is flagging.The report noted, however, that business investment \u201crose robustly\u201d in the first quarter, thanks to increased spending on drilling and mining equipment, which could indicate a shift.The low level of investment may be one reason for the slow pace of productivity growth, an average annual pace of just 1 percent, about half the pace during the period from 1990 to 2004.Productivity growth in the United States remains a little bit faster than in other developed countries.The slow pace of productivity growth is an important reason that employee compensation is rising slowly. A measure of hourly compensation that includes wages, salaries and benefits rose at an annual pace of 2.25 percent over the last four quarters, the Fed said. Measures of wage growth, excluding benefits, are in the same ballpark.There is some evidence of a modest upward trend as the labor market has tightened, but the growth remains very weak by historical standards.The eagerness of investors is driving up a wide range of asset prices, a trend the Fed said had continued since its last report in mid-February. It noted that \u201cvaluation pressures have increased further\u201d for Treasury securities, equities, corporate bonds and commercial real estate.But the Fed is not sounding alarms. \u201cVulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system remain moderate on balance,\u201d it said.It also dismissed persistent concerns about the liquidity of financial markets, particularly the market for corporate securities.\u201cAvailable evidence suggests that financial markets have performed well in recent years, with minimal impairment in liquidity, either in the market for corporate bonds or in the market for other assets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Senate Health Care Bill Failed: G.O.P. Divisions and a Fed-Up President", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump was fed up with the grind of health care legislation, and at a dinner with Republican senators on Monday at the White House, he let them know it. He told the lawmakers how annoyed he was with one Republican who was not there, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had gone on television over the weekend to oppose a Senate health care bill that once held the promise of victory for Mr. Trump.It is one thing to vote no, Mr. Trump told the group, according to one of the guests. It is another, the president said, to go on all of the Sunday shows and complain about it.The scene on Monday night was an exasperating end for Mr. Trump to a month of negotiations between the White House and Senate Republicans in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic legacy.The effort by Senate Republican leaders to remake the nation\u2019s health care system \u2014 which went well beyond the perimeters of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 was in retrospect doomed from the moment it began, even with the wind of an unlikely win in the House at their backs.The Senate measure would impose annual caps on Medicaid spending, ending what has been an open-ended entitlement for the poor and disabled. The process bypassed committees, any public airing of the bill or formal bill drafting. Instead, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, farmed out the remaking of 17 percent of the economy to a small group of senators, all Republican white men. The bad first look did not fade.But under fire for the all-male panel, Mr. McConnell reduced it to little more than a kaffeeklatsch, open to anyone who wanted to come by and chat health care.Republican senators, reflecting the divide in the party, quickly formed two camps: those who wanted to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicaid, and those, mainly from states that had expanded the program, who wanted to preserve it. Both groups held constant meetings, with many usually conservative senators like Jerry Moran of Kansas and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa sliding into the moderate group\u2019s gatherings to quietly voice their own concerns.Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, in particular, formed the spine of opposition to the bill, and pushed for changes to reduce the cuts to Medicaid. In his state, more than 700,000 low-income people have gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.Senator Susan Collins of Maine criticized the Trump administration\u2019s often specious descriptions of what the bill would actually do, bolstering other more quiet critics\u2019 resolve.\u201cThe only change that Obamacare made in Medicaid was to give states the option of expanding coverage with increased federal funding,\u201d said Ms. Collins, who opposed the Senate legislation. \u201cYet the Senate bill would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from this program, imposed an entirely new formula and reduced the reimbursement rate below the cost of medical inflation.\u201dThe changes, she added, \u201cwould have been made without the Senate holding a single hearing to evaluate the consequences on some of our most vulnerable citizens, rural hospitals and nursing homes.\u201dMr. McConnell in the meantime did not have enough reliable allies on the right. Mr. Paul made it clear from the start that he would not support anything but a full repeal of the law. Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas had repeated conversations with Republican leaders and the White House about how to make the bill sufficiently conservative. Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, dealt an early blow by suggesting he would not support the bill.Making matters worse for the White House, the bill had virtually no support from health care, insurance, patient advocate and disease groups, and was harshly judged by the Congressional Budget Office. Grass-roots opposition to the bill \u2014 aided by Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 swayed members of Congress in a way rarely seen on Capitol Hill.At the annual meeting of the American Hospital Association in May, Mr. Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, urged hospital executives to mobilize their employees in an effort to defeat the bill, which had been approved by the House just a few days earlier.\u201cYou have every right to express your outrage on behalf of the people who you take care of and your employees,\u201d Mr. Schumer told hospital leaders. \u201cEveryone needs to speak up and let their elected officials know how bad this bill is.\u201dThe final efforts for the bill began to unravel over the weekend as several Republican senators began to balk at the legislation. Although the Trump administration had dispatched Seema Verma, the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to the summer meeting of the National Governors Association in Providence, R.I., to try to persuade governors \u2014 and, by extension, the senators in their states \u2014 of the bill\u2019s merits, the governors remained unmoved.By Monday night, as Mr. Trump was meeting with the group of Republican senators at the White House \u2014 not one of whom was on the fence about the bill \u2014 Mr. Moran and Mr. Lee, two senators who were on the fence, issued statements saying they would not support it, a catastrophe for the White House.Late Monday, Mr. McConnell responded by vowing to pass a measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, then work on a replacement over the next two years. But on Tuesday, three Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Collins, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 told Mr. McConnell they would not support his last-ditch effort.Ms. Capito has generally been an ally of Republican leaders on even really tough votes and once told colleagues that the nearly 180,000 people on Medicaid in her state outnumbered the total number of people who had voted for her.On Tuesday in Kansas, citizen-activists like Courtney Eiterich, 42, of Lenexa, who has multiple sclerosis, were celebrating outside Mr. Moran\u2019s office in Olathe. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this level of political activism before,\u201d said Ms. Eiterich, who had been dogging Mr. Moran for months. \u201cBut if I\u2019m not speaking out, who\u2019s going to do it?\u201dMr. Kasich, who had been against the bill, was pleased with the outcome on Tuesday, and recalled conversations he had with Mr. Portman.\u201cI told him all the time, this is not just about opiates, though opiates are a big part of it,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about people who suffer mental illness or chronic illness. Rob was trying to figure out how to be constructive, but at the same time, he didn\u2019t want to be taken for granted in terms of his vote.\u201dPatient advocates, who had major concerns about the bill, were relieved.\u201cWe joined together in January over a plate of breakfast burritos, so we call ourselves the burrito coalition,\u201d said Sue Nelson, a vice president of the American Heart Association. \u201cWe wrote letters, we brought in patients, we talked to congressional staff until we were blue in the face. We provided members of Congress with hundreds and thousands of stories from patients to let them know how critical it was to preserve affordable health care for their constituents.\u201dNow what Mr. Trump once described as \u201can easy\u201d process appears destined to stall his policy agenda, and has damaged his diminished standing on Capitol Hill.Still, the White House is not giving up. Late on Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump was inviting all Republican senators to the White House on Wednesday \u2014 to talk about health care.Michael D.

{"Headline": "E-Commerce as a Jobs Engine? One Economist\u2019s Unorthodox View", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookRetailing is dead. Sales clerks are losing their jobs by the thousands. The employment picture for young people with only a high school education is going to get even worse. And all this is happening because of Amazon and its ilk, which are driving the shift among consumers toward e-commerce.We\u2019ve heard this story over and over in recent months: The echo chamber keeps repeating that the retail apocalypse is upon us.Mr. Mandel, chief economic strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, contends that most economists are using the wrong job numbers to measure the e-commerce industry. He says that government numbers and conventional industry classifications don\u2019t properly count all the jobs associated with e-commerce \u2014 in particular, the numbers miss large parts of the industry like fulfillment centers and distribution warehouses. As anyone who has noticed the growing volume of big brown boxes being delivered to people\u2019s homes can imagine, facilities like that, which are tied to the e-commerce sector, are expanding rapidly.\u201cTo be honest, this was a surprise to me \u2014 I did not expect this,\u201d Mr. Mandel told me.Then he added, matter-of-factly, \u201cI\u2019m just looking at the numbers.\u201dViewing e-commerce as an engine of jobs \u2014 not just any jobs, but good ones that are spread around the country \u2014 would be a new paradigm, for sure. But it\u2019s one that admittedly requires a healthy dose of skepticism.\u201cThis could be transformational,\u201d Mr. Mandel argued, contending that the rise of e-commerce could lead to \u201ca reduction in economic inequality and geographic inequality.\u201dMr. Mandel said that over the past quarter-century, \u201cproduction gains were not shared with the workers.\u201d But now, he said, jobs at fulfillment centers are \u201cdecent paying,\u201d often full time and usually with benefits. And many of those fulfillment centers are sprouting up across the country in \u201cplaces you haven\u2019t heard of in a while.\u201dWith a burst of enthusiasm, he added, \u201cThis could be the pendulum swinging back.\u201dOf course, Mr. Mandel\u2019s view flies in the face of established economic thought \u2014 and perhaps for good reason: His arithmetic relies on certain unconventional assumptions.\u201cI\u2019m highly dubious,\u201d said John Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an executive outplacement firm that maintains a monthly index of job losses across the country. \u201cIt does sound crazy to me.\u201dThe warehouses that Mr. Mandel views as a source of job growth, Mr. Challenger said, \u201care being automated.\u201dIs it possible Mr. Mandel is miscounting or perhaps double-counting?In truth, his argument relies to some degree on the assumption that many of the new jobs created in a category known by the government as \u201cgeneral warehousing\u201d are tied to e-commerce. That may be a good assumption \u2014 but it\u2019s impossible to know for sure.Mr. Mandel justifies his assumption with an example of how convoluted the current method for counting e-commerce jobs is: Amazon publicly says it has 12,000 employees in Kentucky, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports only 2,640 workers in Kentucky in the e-commerce category. \u201cBy contrast, the general warehouse industry,\u201d Mr. Mandel writes, \u201chad more than 23,000 workers in Kentucky.\u201dAll of which is to say that we may not have as good a handle on the demographics of the job market as we think.Mr. Mandel said he had been \u201cvery careful\u201d to look only at changes in warehousing since 2007. \u201cWhen I look at changes on a county-by-county level, they correlate very well with building of fulfillment centers,\u201d he said.He acknowledged that his number could be an overestimate, saying that it might include \u201crecent building of warehouses that are not for e-commerce reasons.\u201dNationally, since 2007, \u201cthe decline in shopping hours is 64 million hours a week,\u201d Mr. Mandel said. \u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of about 1.5 million jobs,\u201d some of which are now being created to staff the new fulfillment centers.\u201cRobots have been tough to do,\u201d Mr. Mandel said, suggesting that they will come, but that it will take longer for them to replace humans than we think.\u201cI\u2019m basically an optimistic person,\u201d Mr. Mandel said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long time looking at what happened in the first part of the 20th century \u2014 how we got the combination of jobs gains and higher wages \u2014 and I think we\u2019re on the same path.\u201dIt feels a bit hard to believe to those of us who are inherent skeptics, but let\u2019s hope he\u2019s right.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}

But not this time: When Air India announced on Monday that coach passengers on its domestic flights would now be offered only vegetarian meals, the move provoked an uproar on social media.G. P. Rao, a spokesman for the government-owned airline, said the change was made a week ago strictly to reduce waste and cut costs. But what people eat can be a sectarian flash point in India, especially since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party took power.Many members of the Hindu majority are vegetarians, while the country\u2019s Muslims and some other minorities eat meat. So the airline\u2019s action was seen by many as discriminatory and part of a wave of religious nationalism sweeping the country.Others, though, came to Air India\u2019s defense, saying they could not understand all the public indignation.In India, diet is an important signifier of group identity. At the heart of the outrage over the airline\u2019s policy is a widespread sense that India\u2019s Hindu nationalist ruling party is trying to limit the freedom of the country\u2019s minorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Called the School Board Racist. Now, He\u2019s Joined It.", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDECATUR, Ill. \u2014 Back when he was a member of a notorious street gang, Courtney Carson was as loyal as they come. When he heard that a confidant had flipped from the Black Stones to the rival Gangster Disciples, he rounded up some friends and confronted the defector at a high school football game.The warring sides stomped up the stadium\u2019s concrete bleachers, taunting each other. Then someone threw a punch. In no time, fists and feet were flying and the crowd was running for cover.It was 1999 and the Decatur school board responded swiftly, expelling Mr. Carson and five classmates, all of them black, for two years. The punishment, which was eventually cut in half, polarized this central Illinois city, largely along racial lines, and drew thousands of civil rights activists to town. Suddenly, a thriving industrial mecca became a center of racial strife.\u201cI used to feel like Decatur was no place for a black man,\u201d said Mr. Carson, adding that he felt as though school board members had turned their backs on him. \u201cI thought, as a young person, that they were racist.\u201dIn the 18 years since the fight and its fallout, that sentiment has evolved as Mr. Carson, 35, has turned around his life. He took up work as an activist, minister and mentor to young people going through the same challenges he faced. Then this year, he added an improbable line to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Decatur school board member.Yes, Mr. Carson won election to the very board that expelled him.To many here, Decatur has largely transcended its past racial rifts. Residents talk proudly of Decatur as a place where people do not bat an eye when they see a mixed-race couple and where millions of dollars have been pumped into efforts to help marginalized children.Still, this is a place where black people make up about a quarter of the population, but have accounted for 42 percent of police traffic stops since 2010. At nearly 24 percent unemployment, black Decaturans are two and a half times more likely to be unemployed than white residents. And some black residents remain on the civic fringe, avoiding downtown or community festivals that they say do not cater to their culture.Mr. Carson operates in that tenuous spot between hope and unrest.He applauded Decatur as a place where \u201cwe really have that hard conversation\u201d about race, where the white police chief has been serious about investigating allegations of racism in his department.Yet he ran for school board in large part because racial disparities remain among students. Even after he turned his life around, he encountered problems all too familiar to many black people here and around the country, from difficulty getting a job to uncomfortable encounters with the police.\u201cOn one hand, we\u2019re coming together,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cBut at any given moment, any given time, if there\u2019s something substantial as it relates to black and white, then this city would divide.\u201dSo he tries to be proactive. After police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana, and the killing of five officers in Dallas, Mr. Carson held a public prayer vigil in Decatur last July. He met with community leaders to address what to do if this city encountered police violence.\u201cWhen a police officer shoots one of our little black babies, we will not burn our city down,\u201d Mr. Carson recalled saying.That was no consolation for Lonnie D. Mitchell II, the man who was shot. Prosecutors ruled that the shooting was justified because Mr. Mitchell had a knife and a pellet gun and did not follow the officer\u2019s commands to surrender. Mr. Mitchell said that he had his hands up, without any weapons in them, when the officer shot him.\u201cI know he wouldn\u2019t have done that over at the lake \u2014 across the lake, where all the rich white people live,\u201d Mr. Mitchell, 41, said, referring to Lake Decatur.Mr. Carson tries to broker these differences with chameleon-like deftness. He strolls just as easily into a school board meeting \u2014 where five of the members are white and he is one of two black members \u2014 as into a church or on the streets where he rabble-roused as a boy.The fight on Sept. 17, 1999, broke out during a game between MacArthur High School, which Mr. Carson attended, and its crosstown rival, Eisenhower.One of the seven students caught fighting dropped out of school before the district handed down its decision, but the others received two-year expulsions.The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and local activists, rallying on behalf of the students caught fighting, labeled the Decatur Seven, cast a harsh light on zero-tolerance school discipline policies and the disproportionate suspensions of black students. The Ku Klux Klan countered with its own rally. Mr. Carson recalled hustling out of a skating rink one day with his face covered when rumors surfaced that Klansmen were outside seeking to kill him and the six other black students.Opinions on the school board\u2019s decision pretty much ran along racial lines. White people thought it was fair, black people thought it was not.The only dissenting voice on the school board was Jeffrey Perkins, one of the two black members, who voted against the expulsions. The other black board member was absent the day of the vote.\u201cI just felt like putting young men out for two years was almost like a death sentence to them as far as being able to recover from that and continue with their education,\u201d said Mr. Perkins, who lost his re-election bid that year.In the school year before the fight, black students accounted for 60 percent of those who were suspended although they made up about 40 percent of the district\u2019s population.Jacqueline Goetter, who was the school board\u2019s president at the time, said the punishment was not racially motivated. The board was not going to tolerate that type of violence at a school event that endangered innocent bystanders, she said. She chalked up the racial disparities in punishment to poverty.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of poor students in our central city; we\u2019ve got a lot of those poor students who are black students,\u201d said Ms. Goetter, who is white. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting the same home life that other families may be getting. I can\u2019t control that.\u201dWith Mr. Jackson drawing attention to the case, George Ryan, then Illinois\u2019s governor, came here and helped negotiate an agreement that reduced the expulsions to a year and allowed the boys to attend an alternative school during that time.A booming industrial economy in this union town played no small part in masking racial problems, said Julie Moore Wolfe, Decatur\u2019s current mayor. In Decatur\u2019s heyday, locals could get a well-paying factory job without finishing high school, so no one really paid attention to the fact that more than half of black males were dropping out, she said.\u201cI think there was this sense that everything was O.K. and everybody was in a pretty good place,\u201d said Ms. Moore Wolfe, who is white and led the Decatur Chamber of Commerce at the time. \u201cThe reality of it was we weren\u2019t. Really, it opened a lot of eyes. It caused a huge racial divide in this community, one that the business community, the white community, didn\u2019t see coming at all.\u201dAt the urging of the N.A.A.C.P., civic leaders raised $6 million that is still being spent on programs to help marginalized students, including cultural training for school district staff.There have been positive results: 72 percent of black Decatur students now graduate from high school within four years, which is one percentage point higher than the district\u2019s white students.And there has been individual growth. Mr. Carson said he once hated white people, but now embraces them. His wife, Alyse, is white and said she was ignorant of racial issues in high school. Now, she cannot help but cringe at the slights her husband receives \u2014 the people who fawn that he is so well-spoken; the police officer who was rude to him when he was trying to help a car crash victim.Mr. Carson\u2019s appreciation for Decatur\u2019s continuing struggles are never far from his mind.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Carson strolled through a blighted, predominantly black neighborhood just south of downtown. There, black men complained of being stopped by the police for trivial reasons, like grabbing at their sagging pants or turning on their blinkers too soon while driving. Many black men do not have a valid driver\u2019s license because they have been stopped so many times, and that can make it difficult to get work. One man complained that the managers at the plant where he works show special attention to the white employees but not to black workers like him.Mr. Carson, wearing a well-fitting suit and pointy brown monk strap shoes, had an easy manner with the men here, and credibility because of his past.\u201cLethal,\u201d an old friend wearing a military green Yankees cap said, pointing toward Mr. Carson\u2019s knuckles.

{"Headline": "How Low Can Taxes Go? Outside Washington, Republicans Find Limits", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Something strange has been happening to taxes in Republican-dominated states: They are going up.And now some Republicans say that what has played out in these states should serve as a cautionary tale in Washington, where their party\u2019s leaders are confronting a set of circumstances that looks strikingly similar.Republicans, with control of Congress and the White House and a base that is growing impatient for tax reform, are trying to solve a difficult math problem: paying for critical programs like infrastructure, health care and education while honoring their promise to deliver lower taxes without exploding the deficit.With the federal deficit growing and economic growth sputtering along in the low single digits, the Republican Party is facing questions from within over what many see as a blind faith in the theory that deep tax cuts are the shot of economic adrenaline a languid economy needs.\u201cTax cuts \u2014 good. And that\u2019s about as much thinking that goes into it,\u201d said Chris Buskirk, a radio host and publisher of American Greatness, a conservative online journal. Now, he said, Republicans in Washington seem to be in an arms race to the lowest rates possible.\u201cEverybody is trying to overbid each other,\u201d Mr. Buskirk said. \u201cHow much more can we cut?\u201dOutside Washington, Republicans are discovering there are limits.Much of the devotion to tax cuts as an inviolable Republican principle stems from the success that President Ronald Reagan and Congress had in 1981 when they agreed to an economic recovery package that included a rate cut of about 25 percent for individuals.Bruce Bartlett, who advised Reagan on the 1981 tax cuts, chastised Republicans for what he described as their reflexive desire to drive rates lower.\u201cThe essence of what the supply-siders were trying to accomplish was accomplished by the end of the Reagan administration,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said.Yet, he added, Republican policy still mimics what was done under Reagan. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to keep pressing ahead \u2014 no matter what,\u201d he said.The situation in Kansas was, for at least some conservatives, a jolting realization that tax cuts can be too blunt an economic instrument.After Mr. Brownback took office in 2011, he pursued a plan that included cuts and, in some cases, an outright elimination of taxes for businesses and individuals to help invigorate the state\u2019s underperforming economy. He described it as \u201can experiment\u201d in conservative governance that could demonstrate what Republicans were capable of if they controlled legislative and executive branches across the country. (He is Kansas\u2019 first Republican governor since 2003.)The conservative movement got behind him. The plan was approved with the lobbying muscle of the billionaire Koch brothers\u2019 political network, which is overseen from Wichita, where one of the brothers, Charles G. Koch lives. It had the blessing of prominent conservative economists like Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer, the Republican Party\u2019s foremost supply-side evangelist.Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said the Trump tax cuts would pay for themselves with the economic growth they would inevitably create.In Kansas, the predicted economic bloom did not materialize. Employment and economic growth have lagged far behind the rest of the nation. The state treasury had so little money to spread around that the Kansas Supreme Court found that the state\u2019s spending on public education was unconstitutionally low.\u201cIf there were three words I could say to Congress right now,\u201d said Stephanie Clayton, a Republican state representative from a district in the Kansas City area, \u201cthey would be, \u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201dShe criticized what she said was a desire by her party to be more faithful to the principle than to the people Republicans were elected to help. Mr. Brownback and many conservatives, she said, overpromised on the tax cuts as a \u201csort-of Ayn Rand utopia, a red-state model,\u201d citing the author whose works have influenced the American libertarian movement.\u201cAnd I loved Ayn Rand when I was 18 \u2014 before I had children and figured out how the world really works,\u201d Ms. Clayton added. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, as it turns out.\u201dMr. Trump and Republicans in Washington are undeterred. Kansas, they argue, is not an economic microcosm for the country, with its unique dependence on energy, agriculture and aircraft manufacturing. And lawmakers there never could reduce spending enough to correspond to the much lower level of tax revenue coming into the state treasury.\u201cAt 15 percent, Swiss bankers will move here,\u201d said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.But restraining federal spending is still going to be a key part of the equation. \u201cWhat you need is not an explosion of spending,\u201d Mr. Norquist added. \u201cAnd you need the economy to grow faster than the size of the government.\u201dIn a world in which Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d reduces the size and cost of the government, the tax cuts make sense. But if lawmakers do not have the nerve to find savings somewhere, like in the social safety net for retirees, the outcome could end up resembling something close to Kansas\u2019 failed experiment.\u201cThe question is whether you can put together some kind of revenue-neutral tax reform,\u201d said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. \u201cI don\u2019t see the political will to do that right now. Certainly not in this environment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: With Tough Competition, Chevrolet Equinox Holds Its Own", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenIf I had a dollar for every time I was asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite car?\u201d I could buy that car. Even if it were an exotic.Truth be told, the vehicles that get my professional admiration are the everyday ones, the dependable workhorses that shuttle our children hither and yon, the cars that become part of the family. It\u2019s easy to love performance machines or luxury vehicles with fur-lined glove boxes (not a thing, but you get the gist). But the car geek in me admires budget-restrained engineering teams who create affordable cars that are truly desirable. That\u2019s a black art.The all-new third generation Chevrolet Equinox crossover is more proof that under Mary Barra, General Motors has found its footing. The Equinox takes care of five people, does the chores, doesn\u2019t drink to excess and looks good.In the brutal automotive business, the compact crossover market is the most fiercely competitive. It includes not only the Equinox but also the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Kia Sportage, Volkswagen Tiguan and Hyundai Tucson. The Equinox is critical to General Motors. Chevrolet moved 242,195 of them in the United States in 2016, which was second in volume only to the Silverado pickup truck. The 2018 model will probably sell quicker because it\u2019s a far better vehicle.Here\u2019s why. The Equinox is more than four inches shorter now but retains the same interior space. The 400 pounds it has shed may exceed the weight of the young family who drives it. Let\u2019s buy a round for the engineers.The Equinox\u2019s breezy design language, which also graces the Cruze, Malibu and Volt, could be used by Lexus in a parallel universe. One reason the second generation overstayed its welcome is that the original design for the third generation was so unloved in consumer clinics that it was scrapped. Good to know the Chevrolet team understands that ugly is forever once it\u2019s on the road.Friends and neighbors fawned over the Premier model\u2019s cabin with stitched elements on the instrument panel. Owners will be staring at it for years in bad traffic, so glad it\u2019s handsome. Budget plastics are placed below the center console where they\u2019re seldom seen or touched. (It\u2019s how wise product planners cut costs.) The center console is roomy enough to fit a single-lens reflex camera. G.M.\u2019s touch-screen user interface, with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, is simple to use.A base price of $24,525 will give pause to price-sensitive internet shoppers. Climbing to $33,975, my top trim Premier tester lacked available all-wheel drive and a panoramic sunroof. And adaptive cruise control is not even listed as an option. To be fair, the price includes vented front seats, a heated steering wheel and a surround-view camera system that some competitors don\u2019t offer. Generous pricing margins may allow Chevy dealers plenty of negotiation room. Get in there and haggle hard.Considering the comfort and refinement, the effort may be worth it. The Equinox shines by delivering a polished and quiet dynamic verging on luxury brand levels. If the roads to soccer or Little League practice are rough, this suspension smooths the bumps. It\u2019s respectable in the curves, too, without challenging the Mazda CX-5\u2019s cornering chops.Chevy\u2019s supportive seats impressed my backside (though that\u2019s a personal thing). A bonus: Set off the lane-keeping assist system and the driver\u2019s cushion vibrates discreetly, with no tattletale chimes. It\u2019s a marriage-saving feature first found in Cadillacs.The standard engine is a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder providing 170 horsepower and 203 pound-feet of torque. That\u2019s hooked up to a 6-speed transmission that aggressively holds low ratios for fuel efficiency. This standard power plant is smooth with acceleration in the middle of the pack. The CR-V is a little quicker and efficient. The Environmental Protection Agency rated the average fuel economy of a front-drive Equinox at 28 miles per gallon versus the Honda\u2019s at 30. A comparable RAV4 scores 25.Any performance and efficiency deficiencies can be rectified in spades with two engine options. There\u2019s a 2-liter turbo gasoline engine with 252 horsepower and a nine-speed transmission for Speed Racer. Scrooge McDuck may be interested in the four-cylinder turbo diesel paired to a six-speed that\u2019s expected to return 40 miles per gallon.The Equinox\u2019s automatic engine start-stop system is smooth enough to forget about in many situations. Good thing because it can\u2019t be turned off. Unlike the automatic all-wheel drive systems used by others, the Equinox requires drivers to enable it manually. (There\u2019s a prompt to push the button when conditions warrant.)Automatic emergency braking is standard on the RAV4, the 2018 Nissan Rogue and most CR-Vs. That safety tech is part of a $1,900 package on the Equinox and only available on the top Premier model.The back seat no longer slides fore and aft (eliminated because some second-generation owners never knew it did). The space is generous with a raised seat cushion offering significant thigh support for adults and superior visibility for children. The back also sports two USB ports, a 12-volt socket and a 115-volt three-prong outlet, so there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be charged.The days of Japan Inc. clearly outgunning Detroit & Co. on every level are gone. While my left brain admires the overachieving Honda CR-V, my right brain gives the nod to the comfortable, refined and stylish Equinox. Both engineering teams performed the black magic needed to make a mainstream car appealing. I won\u2019t be around to nag you to test drive. So experience at least three vehicles before writing that big check. A tip? The Equinox is worth a look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Says Economy Is Robust, but Adds That Fed Will Stay Flexible", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, delivered an upbeat message on the state of the American economy to Congress on Wednesday, highlighting the strength of job growth and indicating that the Fed remained on course to begin reducing its bond holdings in the fall.Ms. Yellen added, however, that the Fed was paying close attention to the recent weakness of inflation. While emphasizing that she expected prices to start rising more quickly, she said persistent weakness could lead the Fed to raise interest rates more slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s premature to reach the judgment that we\u2019re not on the path to 2 percent inflation over the next couple of years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears the inflation undershoot will be persistent.\u201dMs. Yellen\u2019s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee lifted stock prices and lowered bond yields on Wednesday. Investors tend to celebrate any sign that the Fed might slow the pace of its interest-rate increases.Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the committee, gave Ms. Yellen an unusually warm reception for the opposite reason, applauding the Fed for moving ahead with rate increases and describing the Fed\u2019s plans to start reducing bond holdings later this year as \u201cmore good news.\u201dThese biannual hearings can be combative, but steady economic growth and the Fed\u2019s commitment to a retreat from its stimulus campaign have drained some of the tension from recent sessions. The sharpest exchanges on Wednesday were about regulatory issues, with Republicans complaining that the Fed was unfairly constraining the banking industry to the detriment of economic growth.Ms. Yellen gave little ground. \u201cCongress has passed laws that place obligations on us to supervise these financial institutions,\u201d she said.The divide over regulation helps explain why Republicans hope President Trump will replace Ms. Yellen when her terms ends in February. The Trump administration has not ruled out her reappointment, although the choice of a new Fed chief is regarded as more likely.Asked whether her appearance before the House committee on Wednesday might be her last, Ms. Yellen responded, \u201cIt may well be.\u201dThe hearing also gave members of both parties a chance to talk about Mr. Trump.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, began her opening remarks by criticizing the president. \u201cSince Day 1, the story of the Trump administration has been one of chaos and turmoil,\u201d she said.Representative Sean Duffy, Republican of Wisconsin, responded that Democrats liked to congratulate the Fed for economic growth, but that Mr. Trump deserved the credit. \u201cThe real change has been that we have a new president in the White House,\u201d he said.The economy is now in the ninth year of one of the longest economic expansions in American history. The economy added 180,000 jobs a month on average in the first half of the year, about the same pace as the first half of 2016, even as the unemployment rate dropped to pre-crisis levels.House Democrats remain strongly supportive of Ms. Yellen, but several asked her whether the Fed was heading for the exits a little too quickly. Inflation remains below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target, and lately it has slowed.Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said on Tuesday at a conference in New York that she shared those concerns.Ms. Yellen said the Fed was keeping a close eye on the latest inflation data, but she reiterated the Fed\u2019s position that it expected prices to start rising more quickly. She has time to decide whether to hit the brakes: Analysts do not expect the Fed to raise rates sooner than its final meeting of the year, in December.Ms. Yellen declined to specify when the Fed intended to start reducing its bond holdings.\u201cThe exact timing of this I don\u2019t think matters a great deal,\u201d she said.The unemployment rate among African-Americans was 7.1 percent in June, the lowest since April 2000, although well above the national rate.Another concern is that only 62.8 percent of adults were either working or looking for work in June, compared with the 66 percent participation rate of a decade ago.Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky, told Ms. Yellen that in his view some people were not working because of the generosity of government benefits.\u201cMany employers say to me that they simply can\u2019t compete with the government for labor,\u201d he said.Ms. Yellen responded that demographic changes were the primary reason for the decline. \u201cTo my mind, the major factor here is an aging population,\u201d she said.She appeared to find common ground with House Republicans on another issue.Mr. Hensarling praised the Fed for including in its report to Congress an analysis of several formulas for determining the proper level of its benchmark rate.Republicans want the Fed to pick a single formula. Ms. Yellen on Wednesday reiterated that there were many rules and that there was \u201cno clear way to decide which ones are better than others.\u201d Such rules, she said, were best consulted for guidance.But Mr. Hensarling\u2019s comments hinted at a potential compromise.

They were the president\u2019s connection to the Washington establishment: the donors, flacks and apparatchiks of both parties whose influence over politics and the economy many Trump supporters wish to upend.By firing Mr. Priebus and Mr. Spicer and hiring John Kelly and Anthony Scaramucci, President Trump has sent a message: After six months of trying to behave like a conventional Republican president, he\u2019s done. His opponents now include not only the Democrats, but the elites of both political parties.Since the start of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has made no secret of his dislike of the capital. But his contempt for the city and the officials, lobbyists, consultants, strategists, lawyers, journalists, wonks, soldiers, bureaucrats, educators and physicians who populate it becomes more acute with each passing day.He ignores pleas to ratchet back his Twitter feed, rails against the inability of Congress to advance his agenda, bashes the press, accuses the so-called deep state of bureaucratic setbacks, and struggles to hire staff. In Robert Mueller, the special counsel, he faces a paragon of D.C. officialdom, investigating not only his campaign but also perhaps his finances. For Trump, the Senate\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare was more evidence of Washington dysfunction, and a reason to declare independence from Priebus, the Republicans and political norms. The call to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d is now a declaration of war against all that threatens his presidency.What we have been witnessing is a culture clash: a collision of two vastly different ways of life, personal conduct and doing business. The principles by which Mr. Trump lives are anathema to Washington. He abhors schedules. He wants to be unpredictable. He doesn\u2019t tune out critics, but responds ferociously to every one. He values loyalty to the executive above all, and therefore sees family, who are tied together by blood, as essential to a well-managed enterprise.Mr. Trump has no patience for consultants and experts, especially the consultants and experts in the Republican Party who were proven wrong about his election. Insecurity is a management tool: keeping people guessing where they stand, wondering what might happen next, strengthens his position.Mr. Trump\u2019s bombast, outsize personality, lack of restraint, flippancy and vulgarity could not be more out of place in Washington. His love of confrontation, his need always to define himself in relation to an enemy, then to brand and mock and belittle and undermine his opponent until nothing but Trump catchphrases remain, is the inverse of how Washingtonians believe politics should operate. The text that guides him is not a work of political thought. It\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201dThe difference in style between Mr. Trump and Washingtonians is obvious. D.C. is a conventional, boring place. Washingtonians follow procedure. Presidents, senators, congressmen and judges are all expected to play to type, to intone the obligatory phrases and clich\u00e9s, to nod their heads at the appropriate occasions, and, above all, to not disrupt the established order. We watch \u201cMorning Joe\u201d during breakfast, attend a round table on the liberal international order at lunch, and grab dinner after our summer kickball game. No glitz, no glam, no excitement.To say that Donald Trump challenges this consensus is an understatement. Not only is he politically incorrect, but his manner, habits and language run against everything Washington professionals \u2014 in particular, people like Reince Priebus \u2014 have been taught to believe is right and good.This is what distinguishes him from recent outsider presidents such as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan: Both had a long history of involvement in politics, and thought the Washington political class might play some role in reform. Mr. Trump does not.In this respect, Mr. Trump has more in common with Jimmy Carter. Neither president had much governing experience before assuming office (Mr. Trump, of course, had none). Like Mr. Carter, Mr. Trump was carried to the White House on winds of change he did not fully understand. Members of their own parties viewed both men suspiciously, and both relied on their families. Neither president, nor their inner circles, meshed with the tastemakers of Washington. And each was reactive, hampered by events he did not control.If President Trump wants to avoid Mr. Carter\u2019s fate, he might start by recognizing that a war on every front is a war he is likely to lose, and that victory in war requires allies. Some even live in the swamp.Matthew Continetti is editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Tries to Make Hacking a Profit Center", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea\u2019s state-sponsored hackers are increasingly going after money rather than secrets, according to a report published on Thursday by a South Korean government-backed institute.That kind of attack is still occurring, but in the last few years, North Korean hackers seem to have become more interested in stealing cash, the Financial Security Institute said in its report on Thursday.North Korea is isolated, impoverished and desperately short of foreign currency to pay for imports. Even so, it has trained a large army of hackers, originally as an inexpensive means of espionage, sabotage and propaganda, but now also as a moneymaker.The Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has identified a hacking group called Bluenoroff that it says is to blame for attacks on foreign financial institutions, like those in Poland and Bangladesh. Bluenoroff is said to be an offshoot of Lazarus, the North Korea-linked hacking group implicated in earlier attacks.The new report identified another Lazarus spinoff, which it named Andariel, and said that group was responsible for at least seven hacking attacks on banks, defense contractors and other businesses in South Korea over the last two years. (The names Lazarus and Andariel apparently refer to characters in a video game called Diablo.)\u201dBluenoroff and Andariel share their common root,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Bluenoroff has attacked financial firms around the world, Andariel focuses on businesses and government agencies in South Korea using methods tailored for the country.\u201dThe report said the Andariel group had increasingly shifted from destructive attacks on computer networks to crimes like stealing bank-card data and using it to draw cash from bank customers\u2019 accounts or selling the data on the black market. The group also used malware to cheat at online poker and on other gambling websites.\u201cAndariel is believed to focus on earning hard currency,\u201d the report said.The Financial Security Institute, which is financed by the South Korean government, cautioned that the report was partly conjectural and did not represent an official view.North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy and allows only a tiny portion of its population to have access to the internet, has been building up its cyberattack capabilities since the early 1990s, selecting teenagers and teaching them to be hackers, according to South Korean officials and defectors from the North. South Korean cybersecurity officials began detecting attacks attributed to North Korean hackers around 2009.North Korea is now believed to have 1,700 state-sponsored hackers, aided by more than 5,000 supervisors, trainers and other support staff, South Korean officials estimate. The hackers typically do their work abroad, taking legitimate software programming or other jobs in China, Southeast Asia or Europe and waiting for instructions from Pyongyang to mount an assault, they said.Going abroad is a rare privilege for North Koreans, and those who are allowed to work outside the country are required to send the government a quota of foreign currency every year, according to North Korean defectors.North Korea has been accused of illicit moneymaking schemes to pay for its huge military, its nuclear weapons program and its leaders\u2019 luxurious lifestyle, including gunrunning, drug trafficking and counterfeiting. As the United Nations has tightened sanctions and made those avenues more difficult, cyberattacks have loomed larger as a source of cash. Some hacking experts suspect North Korean involvement in the recent wave of global ransomware attacks.North Korea has denied any involvement in hacking attacks, accusing South Korea and the United States of slander.Advertisement"}

The shift in policy also opens another question: To what extent could it destabilize the world and come back to bite the United States?\u201cThe factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency,\u201d Professors Fearon and Laitin wrote. \u201cThese include poverty \u2014 which marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors rebel recruitment \u2014 political instability, rough terrain, and large populations.\u201dThe Trump administration has proposed cutting one-fifth of the funds used for buying antiretroviral drugs for people infected with H.I.V., a program that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives on the continent. It has pulled out of an agreement to help finance efforts by poor nations in Africa and elsewhere to deal with radical climate change.

{"Headline": "5 Who Killed Boris Nemtsov, Putin Foe, Sentenced in Russia", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 It was the most prominent political murder in Russia since President Vladimir V. Putin came to power.On Thursday, a court in Moscow sentenced the Chechen former security services officer, who was convicted of pulling the trigger, to 20 years in prison; four accomplices were ordered to serve 11 to 19 years.The shooting of Mr. Nemtsov, a charismatic opposition leader who antagonized the Kremlin, ended his two-decade democratic crusade that began in the wake of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, and continued through the authoritarian rise of Mr. Putin.An atomic physicist by training, Mr. Nemtsov became active in politics in the late 1980s and organized protests against the planned construction of nuclear reactors in his home city, Nizhny Novgorod, about 250 miles east of Moscow.Mr. Nemtsov went on to become a deputy prime minister in Mr. Yeltsin\u2019s administration, and he had been regarded as the president\u2019s heir apparent. But Mr. Nemtsov, like many other members of Russia\u2019s political elite, was tainted by the political missteps and corruption that characterized Russia in the 1990s, though he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.Mr. Nemtsov was outmaneuvered by Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent, when it came time to replace Mr. Yeltsin as president.Other politicians from the Yeltsin years went on to pursue lucrative business deals \u2014 sometimes taking advantage of their official positions \u2014 or dropped out of view when Mr. Putin assumed the presidency. Yet Mr. Nemtsov embraced his opposition role.Risking harassment and arrest, he focused on government corruption, helping build a small opposition movement in 2011 that was quickly squashed when Mr. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 after ceding the position to his handpicked stand-in, Dimitri A. Medvedev, for one term.By the time Mr. Nemtsov was killed in 2015, he had lost the spotlight to Aleksei A. Navalny, an anticorruption blogger and opposition organizer. But Mr. Nemtsov remained active in Russian politics and had been organizing opposition to the war in Ukraine.Mr. Dadayev, who served as an officer in the security services of the Kremlin-backed Chechen leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, may have been the one who fatally shot Mr. Nemtsov, but the politician\u2019s family and his supporters contend that the people who ordered the killing remain at large.Prosecutors have said that Mr. Dadayev and his accomplices killed Mr. Nemtsov after Ruslan Mukhudinov, the driver of a high-ranking Chechen military officer, promised to pay them $250,000. The prosecutors did not adequately explain why the driver would have that money or what would motivate him to organize the killing.Mr. Mukhudinov was charged in absentia after fleeing to the United Arab Emirates. His boss, Ruslan Geremeyev, the deputy commander of one of the main military regiments in Chechnya and a confidant of Mr. Kadyrov, was never questioned in the case. Mr. Geremeyev did not show up for questioning, and when investigators visited his home in Chechnya, no one answered the door, officials said.Some observers have said that Mr. Kadyrov wanted to test the limits of his independence from the Kremlin. Others have said he wanted to help his patron, Mr. Putin, by eliminating one of the Russian leader\u2019s harshest critics, even though the killing embarrassed the Kremlin.The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told journalists on Thursday that \u201cthere is hope\u201d that the organizers would still be found. The sentencing of the five Chechen men on Thursday is not likely to satisfy those who believe that the brazen death of Mr. Nemtsov was part of a larger plot.Andrew E.

Are there enough watch geeks out there to justify the expense of this 13,000-square-foot exhibition?We\u2019re hoping for 20,000 people over the course of 11 days.

The J.F.K. clock was given to him back in June 1963, at his famous speech over in Berlin.Generally speaking, unless somebody dies, we don\u2019t tell people about their watches. We\u2019ve never actually been a brand that has celebrity endorsers. Celebrity endorsers, sometimes they fall in and out of favor. Having to figure out who\u2019s hot, who\u2019s not, we\u2019d much rather let the watch be the superstar, the watchmakers be the superstars.The watch business has been facing headwinds lately: political uncertainty in the United States and abroad, economic disruptions in Europe, and an anti-corruption drive in China that cracked down on pricey gifts to officials. What has that meant for Patek?It\u2019s a strained market right now. But there\u2019s always a flight to quality, to less trendy purchases, whenever the economy slows down a bit. We saw that in 2007, 2008, 2009. People who were still buying, they wanted that blue blazer. They wanted that pearl necklace they can wear forever. When people see other brands that don\u2019t maintain their value \u2014 if you buy something, and it goes down 40 or 50 percent \u2014 you don\u2019t rush to buy five or six more.Where have you seen unexpected growth in the U.S. market?In Silicon Valley, some of the people you would think would be into throwaway, fast-moving technology are looking for something with lasting value, something they can pass down. I\u2019m not trying to sell it as an investment, but people have realized, \u201cIf I bought a Patek in the \u201940s for $500, it\u2019s $15,000, $20,000 today.\u201dSpeaking of technology, mechanical wristwatches in general have made a surprising comeback with millennials, kids of the cellphone age.

{"Headline": "Why Finland\u2019s Basic Income Experiment Isn\u2019t Working", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn reality, the Finnish trial was poorly designed, and is little more than a publicity stunt.The trial size was cut to one-fifth of what had originally been proposed, and is now too small to be scientifically viable. Instead of giving free money to everyone, the experiment is handing out, in effect, a form of unconditional unemployment benefits. In other words, there is nothing universal about this version of universal basic income.And so even when the experiment\u2019s official results are known, in 2019, they will reveal little \u2014 and far less than they could have \u2014 about the effects that universal cash payments could have on income inequality or people\u2019s attitudes toward work and their quality of life.Starting in the 1980s, Finnish progressives began discussing how distributing unconditional income might be a way to combat poverty and inequality resulting from declining employment in the industrial sector. The theory was that receiving a guaranteed income could free all citizens and allow groups like the jobless, students, stay-at-home parents and the elderly to meaningfully contribute to society through, say, caretaking, charity or artistic projects.But by the time Finland actually attempted the experiment, a conservative government committed to economic austerity was in power. How could it spearhead a leftist benefits program in the midst of economic hardship?A second, expanded experiment was supposed to start in early 2018, but there are signs \u2014 like silence \u2014 that the government may renege on that plan. The universal basic income program in Finland is being whittled down before it even properly begins.So what can we learn from all of this so far? How not to conduct a trial of this kind. Universal basic income can only succeed if the effort is sustained and widespread \u2014 and not available only to the unemployed. The program should not be intended to force people into low-paying jobs.The Finnish government has a chance to correct its course. It should expand the trial in early 2018, as originally planned, and steer it back to its original ideals: a bold experiment to collect hard data about how a much-debated idea actually works in practice. Only that would honor Finland\u2019s tradition of experimenting with innovative social policies.Antti Jauhiainen and Joona-Hermanni M\u00e4kinen are co-directors of Parecon Finland, an economic think tank, and the authors of the upcoming book \u201cHyvinvointivaltion vastaisku\u201d (The Welfare State Strikes Back).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Job Market May Have Some Room to Run After All", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsIn their particulars, the latest numbers are more consistent with an economy that has some room to run. This economic expansion, now eight years old, may have some life in it yet.If the economy were at full employment, we would expect the rate at which employers were adding jobs to slow down. You can\u2019t add workers to your payrolls if there are no workers to take those jobs. And as recently as a month ago it appeared that job growth was slowing down \u2014 not in an alarming way, but in the way you might expect in a job market that was becoming tight.Never mind. In June, the nation added 222,000 jobs, and previous months\u2019 job growth numbers were revised up by a combined 47,000. That was enough to push the average monthly job gains for the first half of 2017 to 180,000, basically the same as the 187,000 average in 2016. It had seemed that job growth was decelerating this year, but that no longer appears so (or at least, if it is so, we\u2019ll need a few more months of data to prove it).Part of the reason this strong job growth is taking place despite a low unemployment rate is that there were, in June at least, more people coming into the labor force. One of the most disappointing results in the May numbers was a sharp drop in the number of people in the labor force, but it looks to have been a statistical aberration, almost completely reversing itself in June.With the unemployment rate relatively low \u2014 4.4 percent in June \u2014 future growth in employment will need to come not from people who are actively looking for a job today, but from pulling people into the job market who currently aren\u2019t working or looking for work at all.The overall trend in 2017 isn\u2019t great on that front. The civilian labor force has increased by only 84,000 people a month on average, down from 140,000 in 2016. But the June numbers are at least some assurance that things aren\u2019t as bad as the May numbers suggested and that there continue to be potential workers out there who might join the labor force with an economy that truly hums.Indeed, the 2.5 percent annual growth in hourly earnings is consistent with the pattern in place for years now. It is neither an acceleration nor a deceleration. In any market, you expect that when something is getting scarce, its price will rise more quickly. The fact that wages \u2014 the price of labor \u2014 are not rising more quickly is a good hint that labor is not as scarce as the 4.4 percent unemployment rate might suggest.And while unemployment rose (from 4.3 percent) for good reasons in June \u2014 people entering the labor force \u2014 the simple fact that not all of those new entrants were immediately snapped up by employers is a hint that there may be some slack remaining in the job market. The broader measure of unemployment known as U-6 rose even more, reversing a drop in May and rising to 8.6 percent from 8.4 percent.Job creation is more robust than it had seemed, while wage growth is soft and the labor force is growing. It would be a mistake to make too much of one month\u2019s numbers, but for now the numbers support optimism that the labor market has room to get better \u2014 with higher wages for more workers \u2014 before it gets worse.Advertisement"}

Moreover, President Vladimir Putin has shown a ruthless commitment to self-preservation that relies heavily on returning Russia to a mythical place of power and glory, not in helping the West build a more stable world.Mr. Trump is making sound policy making even harder, though, with his admiration of Mr. Putin and his willingness to surrender the country\u2019s international leadership, which was on display during the Group of 20 meeting in Germany. Mr. Trump is noticeably more comfortable with Mr. Putin than he is with most of America\u2019s democratic allies, despite Mr. Putin\u2019s record of crushing domestic opponents, invading Ukraine and bombing civilians in Syria.There is nothing wrong with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambition to improve relations with Moscow, given Russia\u2019s importance as a nuclear weapons superpower with a United Nations Security Council veto. But that does not mean it is wise to underestimate, as Mr. Trump seems to do, the threat posed by Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts to weaken NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance, subvert democratic procedures and institutions in Europe and America, wage cyberwarfare, destabilize Ukraine and secure influence in Syria. Some Trump administration officials recognize those hazards; Mr. Trump does not.Mr. Trump also seemed far too solicitous in agreeing with Mr. Putin to create a joint working group on cybersecurity, an offer Mr. Trump withdrew after an avalanche of bipartisan criticism.The bottom line is that Mr. Trump\u2019s obsequiousness has yielded few results. Russia is still occupying Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and is intensifying the war in the east against Ukrainian government forces, despite promising in the 2015 Minsk agreement to halt the fighting. Nor has Mr. Trump persuaded Mr. Putin to increase economic pressure on North Korea, whose nuclear program is now dominating the administration\u2019s foreign policy; to stop the dangerous face-offs with American warplanes over the Baltic Sea; or to come back into compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces agreement of 1987 by withdrawing the deployment of a banned missile.There are some hopeful signs, including a limited cease-fire in southwestern Syria. And the administration appointed a well-regarded former American ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, who is known for tough views on Russia, as special envoy to work with Russia on Ukraine. But on a wide range of issues, Mr. Putin seems unwilling to cooperate, and Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t much seem to care.Advertisement"}

The institute had been recently established by Napoleon, following his victory over the Egyptian Army in a battle lasting less than an hour, and although it stood in a salubrious garden district of Cairo, Attar was nervous because he had heard of drunken fights in the area, where the French were billeted.No doubt his mentor, a sheikh who had been invited to the institute along with other Egyptian bigwigs the previous year, had sought to put the young man off. As Christopher de Ballaigue relates in \u201cThe Islamic Enlightenment,\u201d his fascinating and elegantly written account of the impact of modernity on the Islamic world, Abdulrahman al-Jabarti had come away from his encounter with the savants struggling even to formulate a response to ideas like majority voting, judicial process and scientific experimentation or indeed to a copy of the Quran translated into French. In the end, he had condemned much of it, ignored some of it and admired very little. In Jabarti\u2019s world, the purpose of schooling was to learn the Quran by heart, restating the orthodox Muslim position that God alone was the cause of all earthly phenomena, knowledge was finite and revelation, not reason, was the surest guide to living.Hassan al-Attar, though, was disarmed by the enthusiasm of the French savants. Introduced to a young scholar who discussed literature with him in faultless Arabic, he left dazzled and inspired by the Frenchman\u2019s love of learning, his breadth of reference, his knowledge of the literature and traditions of another culture \u2014 and, on subsequent visits, by the scientific, astronomical and engineering apparatus he was shown. Attar\u2019s admiration would lead to one of the first of many attempts to reconcile Islamic teaching with Western enlightenment values.Napoleon\u2019s short-lived occupation opened the way to a new Egyptian ruler, an Albanian adventurer, to begin a radical reform of the Egyptian state. It was abundantly clear to Muhammad Ali that Western know-how, trade and finance were the keys to power in the modern world, and like Henry VIII he confiscated lands set aside in pious foundations. He also introduced commercial tribunals, a public health office, telegraph offices, canals and cotton factories. Alexandria became a great port where a Russian observed every day \u201csome fresh innovation in the European style destined for the improvement of the city or for public utility.\u201d Yet perhaps 20,000 men, women and children died in the digging of one canal in 1819. Not for the first time, Western advances did not bestow equal benefits.De Bellaigue, a journalist and author, focuses on three Islamic cities in the first half of the book \u2014 Cairo, Istanbul and Tehran. In each, the rulers attempted to adopt elements of Western modernity. Egypt\u2019s nominal suzerains, the Ottoman sultans, had in fact begun reforms before the period covered by this book, but progress was slower in a sprawling multifaith empire in which there were many more interest groups to reconcile than in Egypt alone. In Istanbul, the sultan succeeded in using French military advisers to reform the army and destroy the reactionary Janissaries. The introduction in 1836 of quarantine and other preventive measures against plague, which had hitherto been treated with fatalism, changed people\u2019s life expectancy, and saw plague eradicated by the 1850s.\u201cThe Islamic Enlightenment\u201d introduces us to a fascinating gallery of individuals who would grapple with reform and modernization in theory and practice over the next two centuries. Efficient guns, training in modern drill, factories, machines and bank loans were tools for the entry of Muslim states into the modern world, but they were not value-free. Rising levels of literacy, with the introduction of printing, allowed a press to flourish, in the European mold \u2014 but rulers in Istanbul found the means to control them could also be imported. The first censorship law was based on similar edicts issued by Napoleon III.The growing complexity and interdependence of society and economies changed the way government was viewed, and the development of a literate bourgeoisie created people who thought about such things, focusing attention on the need for constitutions. That they often fared badly was hardly a surprise \u2014 by the time the Ottoman sultan agreed to grant a constitution in 1876, France had already run through 12 of its own.Reactions were further complicated by the persistent pressure of the West on the resources of the Islamic world. Autocrats saddled their countries with profligate loans. The shah of Iran actually sold the resources of his country to Baron Reuter in 1872, an act of such egregious self-interest that it was undone by popular demand and international outcry, while the Ottomans were humiliated by the imposition of a foreign-staffed debt administration and the British occupied Egypt, effectively on behalf of European bondholders, in 1882. There were plenty of people in the Islamic East who could read Darwin and conclude, like the Egyptian feminist Qasim Amin, that natural selection impelled Europeans \u201cpowered by steam and electricity, to seize the wealth of any country weaker than them.\u201d And while many others felt that their values \u2014 Islamic values \u2014 were threatened by the soullessness of the machine age, a multifaceted and slippery Sunni cleric, Jamal al-Din Afghani, was able to articulate some Muslim responses to modernity in ways that were distinctly modern, involving wreaths of cigar smoke, opera seats, international travel and a bulletin for the doctrine of Pan-Islamism called Firmest Bond, which was sent out, like an email newsletter, free of charge to every influential ruler or opinion maker in the Middle East. Islam, Jamal said, required its Luther.One candidate for the role might have been the Egyptian Muhammad Abduh, who proposed a return to attitudes from the time of the salaf, the ancestors \u2014 not, as the term is used today to describe salafism, a fundamentalist religious outlook that denies the importance of reason, but as a creative moment in which, in Abduh\u2019s view, any educated Muslim with the Quran could think out his position for himself. Abduh, like Attar a century before, was swept aside by a concert of vilification.Inherent contradictions and weaknesses, allied with competing international developments, persistently favored modernization imposed from above. Both Turkey and Iran, after World War I, cleaved to narratives of militant nationalism, with varying degrees of success. It became increasingly possible to ignore Islam entirely, following, as de Bellaigue puts it, \u201ca worldview that had formed around Max Weber\u2019s idea of humankind moving away from the \u2018great enchanted garden\u2019 of traditional belief and culture.\u201d As he says, the two ideologies competing for support in the postwar Muslim world, capitalism and Communism, were agreed on one thing: the utter obsolescence of religion in public life.A book like this can only point to the sheer complexity of Muslim identities, loyalties and accommodations in the modern world, both among the hundreds of millions who lead lives of varying degrees of quiet and the troubled few. Far from spurning or avoiding modernity, Muslims are \u201cdrenched in it,\u201d as de Bellaigue points out, and in tracking the sinews of enlightenment through the last two centuries of Islamic thinking, this brilliant and lively history deserves nothing but praise.Jason Goodwin is the author of the Yashim Ottoman detective series and \u201cLords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Trump Kill the Bourbon Boom?", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf President Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on steel imports, expect to see an immediate response from the European Union \u2014 including retaliatory tariffs on, of all things, bourbon.This may seem an oddly disproportionate choice. Everyone needs steel; bourbon, on the other hand, is just a hipster fad and a good-ole-boy mainstay, right?In fact, a punitive tariff on bourbon and other American whiskeys would be both a symbolic and a substantive body blow \u2014 a strike at a unique American product that is enormously popular overseas. Should the tariff dominoes fall, it will be a case study in the shortsightedness of a supposedly \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade policy that, in the end, hurts Americans the most.Mr. Trump\u2019s intention to pursue better trade deals for the American people is laudable, and done right it could add jobs to some of America\u2019s long-suffering industries. But very few industries are truly domestic, with no interests abroad, and when free trade suffers, they suffer, too.Still, why bourbon? Trade officials aren\u2019t stupid; when they retaliate, they hit where it hurts \u2014 which is not always obvious.Consider a recent trade battle between the United States and the European Union. In 2009 Washington imposed a 300 percent tariff on Roquefort cheese to force Brussels to lift a ban on American beef. Roquefort cheese may not be a strategic European industry, but it\u2019s the lifeblood of many French villages, and the tariff was among the reasons the union eased the ban.Kentucky and Tennessee face similar financial burdens if trade talks go south and countries target American distilled spirits. Thanks to the $1.5 billion in spirits that America now exports, over the next six years Kentucky distilleries will invest more than $1 billion in expansions and new facilities.In rural Lynchburg, Tenn., the Jack Daniel Distillery is undergoing a $140 million expansion, likewise made possible in part by its explosive growth overseas, where it sells 65 percent of its output. Needless to say, a retaliatory tariff on whiskey would put those plans, and the many Lynchburg jobs that rely on them, at risk.A looming trade war isn\u2019t the industry\u2019s only concern. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, early in his term, to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and his aversion to trade pacts in general, undermines many American exporters\u2019 long-term growth strategies, which rely heavily on overseas markets that lap up \u201cmade in America.\u201dTake Vietnam, a TPP member that increased American spirits imports by 173.9 percent between 2015 and 2016, to $45.9 million, making it the category\u2019s fastest-growing importer. Under the trade deal, the country is expected to drastically increase its American whiskey consumption.Without American membership in the TPP, a 12-nation pact that created zero tariffs for American products, Vietnam\u2019s 45 percent duty on bourbon and other distilled spirits will no longer be phased out, putting those expectations on ice.It\u2019s not just about tariffs. When you\u2019re selling \u201cAmerica\u201d abroad, you need deals in place to make sure no one else is copying the brand. But absent trade agreements, other countries are free to sell their own versions of American products. Like Champagne and cognac, bourbon\u2019s name protection relies largely on trade deals that set standards and definitions; without them, foreign distillers are surely tempted to slap \u201cbourbon\u201d on anything they want.Trade deals also create structures to combat counterfeiting, another big problem for exporters. Asian countries already pose a great counterfeit risk for iconic brands like Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Maker\u2019s Mark. While the TPP would not entirely have curbed this problem, it would have given American companies distilling the real thing stronger legal protection.Of course, the TPP is not Mr. Trump\u2019s only target. The president wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and possibly impose a 20 percent tariff on Mexican products.Again, this hits the spirits industry in surprising ways. Like many successful American companies, distillers are globally diversified. Heaven Hill and Sazerac, which make Evan Williams and Buffalo Trace bourbons, are family-owned companies with deep roots in America that at the same time have a big overseas reach, importing or owning foreign facilities and marketing tequilas, rums and vodkas, as well as other whiskies.Since tequila cannot be produced in the United States \u2014 it has a geographical protection similar to bourbon\u2019s and can be made only in Mexico \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy will damage American businesses that own, import or market tequila. And if we pull out of Nafta, expect to see a proliferation of Mexican distillers suddenly pumping out \u201cbourbon.\u201dThe liquor business is a relatively small part of the American economy. But whiskey has an outsize role as a flagship export, a symbol of \u201cAmerica\u201d overseas. And its woes are hardly unique \u2014 the same challenges that whiskey faces under an America-first trade policy will be visited on countless export-led industries, precisely the sorts of businesses that are looking to Washington to clear the way for a more robust role in the global economy.It\u2019s hard to argue with Mr. Trump when he says he wants a trade policy that produces more jobs, better pay and a fair playing ground abroad. But threatening tariffs and pulling out of trade deals can quickly boomerang, hurting the very sectors of the economy that he\u2019s trying to protect \u2014 even one as quintessentially American as bourbon.An Op-Ed essay on July 12 about whiskey exports misstated the annual value of American spirits exports. It is $1.5 billion, not $1 billion.Fred Minnick is the author of \u201cBourbon: The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of an American Whiskey.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When Liberty Fails to Deliver", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.On June 6, 2017, the Canadian foreign minister made an extraordinary speech to that country\u2019s Parliament. Rather than outlining a specific policy proposal or program, Chrystia Freeland chose instead to defend the current international system \u2014 what many call the liberal international order \u2014 and argue that Canada must play a vital role in defending, supporting and strengthening it. The reason for this urgency, she implied, was that it faced various threats, not least that the United States of America, the country that had built, nurtured and sustained this order, now seemed disposed to \u201cshrug off the burden of world leadership. To say this is not controversial,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt is simply a fact.\u201d In an almost elegiac fashion, she thanked the United States for its \u201cseven-decades-long contribution to our shared peace and prosperity,\u201d implying that the era of America as steward of the international system was over. She never mentioned Donald Trump by name, but the speech was about him.That the foreign minister of one of America\u2019s closest and most like-minded allies should feel the need to deliver a eulogy to American leadership tells us that many around the globe sense a systemic crisis. To understand the nature of this crisis, we could not find a better guide than Edward Luce\u2019s \u201cThe Retreat of Western Liberalism.\u201d An important caveat: Luce, a highly regarded columnist for The Financial Times, is not using the word \u201cliberal\u201d in its American, partisan sense, but rather in its older sense. Liberalism here means the tradition of liberty and democracy and, by extension, the open, rules-based international economic and political system that has characterized the Western world since 1945, and many more parts of the globe since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Luce argues that the ideas and values that organized these societies internally and externally are now under mortal threat.I suspect that Luce came to the view that animates this book while working on his last one, \u201cTime to Start Thinking: America in the Age of Descent.\u201d In that book, Luce documented in unsparing detail the ways in which the United States was in economic decay. He painted a vivid and prescient picture of the hollowed-out towns and counties that once made up America\u2019s manufacturing, mining and agricultural heartland, places that are now well known and much talked about. He described the world of what he called \u201ceveryday Americans,\u201d who had not seen a rise in their incomes in almost a generation and who, as a consequence, watched their communities and families fall apart. As Luce says in this new book, the key problem is \u201cthe backlash of the West\u2019s middle classes, who are the biggest losers in a global economy\u201d that has been working for most everyone else.He argues that just as economics has been failing to deliver, so has politics. The end of the Cold War ushered in an age of technocracy in which both parties huddled around the center, offering a variety of tax cuts on the one hand and targeted government interventions on the other. Referring to the left-wing parties\u2019 move to the center, Luce quotes a scholar, Jan-Werner M\u00fcller, who said, \u201cThe third way turned elections into a mere choice between Coke and Pepsi.\u201d If economic divisions seemed to narrow, cultural ones have grown, involving issues like immigration, race and religion, over which divisions are stark and compromise is seen as betrayal. The result is two angry teams, unable to trust the other at all, no matter what facts or evidence suggests. Despair about their circumstances and bitterness toward elites have left Middle America \u201cso cynical about the truth,\u201d Luce writes, \u201cthat it will take its script from a political version of pro wrestling.\u201d All this has made American politics dysfunctional and paralyzed. If America\u2019s share of the global economy has declined, its political model has slipped even more in global esteem.At the same time, Luce points out, there is the challenge to the Western order from newly rising powers. He quickly sketches out a mostly familiar story of the economic emergence of China and the inevitable expansion of its influence in Asia and perhaps beyond. This is bringing it into conflict with the global superpower and, \u201cunder Trump,\u201d Luce writes, \u201cthe two great countries seem almost destined to stray into some kind of crisis.\u201d He doesn\u2019t dwell on this prospect much; he is far more consumed by his larger story of the economic and political decay of the West.\u201cThe Retreat of Western Liberalism\u201d is really an extended essay, and it meanders a bit without getting too absorbed by any one issue. Luce writes in fluid prose, moving from a telling statistic to a striking quotation. Throughout, one is struck by his command of the material and the acuity of his prose \u2014 he is unsparing in his condemnation of the elites who didn\u2019t see this coming, too absorbed in their own bubble, too confident of their smart strategies. Hillary Clinton and her crowd come in for special condemnation as the most egregious examples of elite groupthink the author had ever seen.But while we all deserve criticism for missing the phenomenon of the \u201cleft-behinds\u201d and the economic and cultural forces that were roiling large parts of the country, I am not yet convinced that we must write obituaries for Western liberalism. Since this book was written, elections have taken place in several European countries, and everywhere the pro-European, pro-globalist forces have done well. In Holland, the center-right candidate won. In France, the centrist reformer Emmanuel Macron now dominates that country\u2019s politics like no figure since Charles de Gaulle. In Britain, the Labour Party had a resurgence. In coming elections in Germany, the center-right Angela Merkel appears likely to win. And if she loses, it will be to the even more pro-European Social Democratic candidate.There remain powerful reasons to embrace and uphold the liberal international order. Britain, a perennially Euro-skeptic country, has decided to leave the European Union. But that Union has grown from six to 28 over the past decades because dozens have clamored to join. And they have done so for a reason. Consider the latest aspirant, Ukraine. In 1990, around the time they were liberated from the Soviet empire, Ukraine and Poland had the same per capita GDP. Today the average Pole is over three times as rich as his counterpart in Ukraine, and Poland is secured economically, politically and militarily by the European Union and NATO. It is not just elites who benefit from the Western order; it is primarily ordinary people.The West faces many problems, and Luce outlines them vividly. But it has enormous reserves of wealth, talent and energy with which to solve them. Luce adumbrates some solutions himself, in a thin last chapter, and they are familiar variants of the center-left agenda (ones that, I have to say, sound a lot like those proposed by Hillary Clinton) \u2014 smarter redistribution, better retraining, etc. The important point, however, is that good policies do work. Instead of viewing the entire West as being overwhelmed by a tsunami of right-wing populism, we might step back and study countries separately. Those that have had strong safety nets as well as programs to help people move up the economic ladder, like Northern Europe, do not have as much of a problem as others. There, immigration rather than economics is the key driver, but that will wane in importance since immigration flows are dwindling. In my view, Germany seemed vulnerable to right-wing nationalism in the form of the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland only after Merkel\u2019s extraordinary decision to take in a million refugees, but as that fades into the background, so has the AfD. In France, Macron is articulating a defense of Western democracy against Russian interference in much stronger terms than is the American president.In many ways, the one Western country that has seemed immune from any of this populism has been Chrystia Freeland\u2019s Canada. That is not because Canadians are genetically immune to populism but rather because for the last 20 years, they have pursued good public policy. Canada\u2019s economics, health care, banking and immigration policies have been inclusive and successful. One sign of the strength of Western liberalism would be if the United States could recognize that there are now other countries with a deep commitment to these ideas and values that might even be approaching them more successfully than is Washington. The West, in other words, we now live in is a post-American West.FAREED ZAKARIA is the anchor of CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS,\u201d a Washington Post columnist and the author of \u201cThe Post-American World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beer Makers Who Used Other Breweries Are Opening Their Own", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChris Lohring surveyed America\u2019s beer scene in 2010 and decided to play the contrarian. Rather than mimic the popular and potent stouts and India pale ales, he would specialize in low-alcohol, high-taste \u201csession beers,\u201d as he called them.To lenders, though, the business plan held as much appeal as flat beer. So Mr. Lohring kept costs low by using established breweries in Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut to produce and package crisp pilsners and rustic farmhouse ales under his Notch Brewing label.Contract brewing, as it is known, was perfect for a start-up like his, requiring no expensive infrastructure. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing riskier than building a plant before the brand and the beers have been proven,\u201d said Mr. Lohring, who in 1993 helped found Tremont Brewery in Boston.But now, consumers are increasingly seeking beer at the source: Since 2010, sales at breweries and brew pubs have risen more than 500 percent, according to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Beer lovers routinely troop to breweries for releases of cans and bottles, and a sense of belonging to a particular place has become as important as the beer itself.That places contract brewers in a pickle. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a brewery, you\u2019re kind of homeless,\u201d said Mikkel Borg Bjergso, Mikkeller\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to show people.\u201dAs a result, many itinerant beer makers are dropping anchor, opening breweries with tasting rooms for thirsty patrons.And this month, Mr. Bjergso announced that he would create a brewery at Citi Field, home of the New York Mets. Scheduled to open this year, Mikkeller Brewing NYC will brew and can beers like its Say Hey Sally pilsner, served alongside food from Fuku and Pat LaFrieda. \u201cNext year at Citi Field, people will be drinking beer made at the ballpark,\u201d said Jim Raras Jr., Mikkeller NYC\u2019s executive vice president.\u201cSay you\u2019re sitting there as a contract brewer, and you\u2019ve got a million bucks,\u201d Mr. Lohring said. \u201cDo you spend the old-fashioned way with advertising and marketing, or do you spend a million bucks on a facility where you serve beer to consumers? It\u2019s a pretty easy decision.\u201dTaprooms also serve as consumer focus groups. Mr. Lohring uses his to test richly flavored Old World lagers and pale ales featuring new hop varieties. \u201cWe get immediate feedback from customers and sales,\u201d he said, \u201cand that informs us on our next steps.\u201dPreviously, fans passing through Rhode Island could visit only the brand\u2019s headquarters, then in Providence. Now Mr. Hellendrung can meet fans at the brewery, as he did recently with a North Carolina couple who stopped by while driving to Maine. \u201cWe were able to sit down and have a beer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just awesome to have a great conversation.\u201dAll the same, many of these beer companies still outsource much of their brewing.\u201cIt\u2019s great to produce an I.P.A. and serve it to customers within a week or two weeks instead of two months,\u201d Mr. Bjergso said. He can better adapt to fickle consumer tastes by making and selling popular I.P.A.s directly from the brewery. \u201cYou\u2019re able to give the customers a better experience if you\u2019re behind everything, instead of going to a supermarket or some random bar,\u201d Mr. Bjergso said. (Mikkeller and the other brewers still sell most of their beers in bars and stores.)Joe and Lauren Grimm, home brewers in Gowanus, Brooklyn, always wanted to build a hometown brewery. But a state law barred brewers from selling their wares on the premises \u2014 an essential source of revenue for many small brewers faced with high rents. So in 2013, the married couple started traveling as far afield as Massachusetts and Virginia to produce juicy I.P.A.s and hopped sour beers with their Grimm Artisanal Ales label.\u201cHalf the month we\u2019re not in Brooklyn,\u201d Ms. Grimm said.Though Grimm has grown into a popular Brooklyn brand, there is still a stigma attached to beer not brewed under its own roof. \u201cEvery time you drink a beer brewed under a contract basis, there\u2019s an asterisk,\u201d Mr. Grimm said.His wife added, \u201cA lot of people come up to me and say, \u2018Wow, the quality and consistency in your beers is amazing, even though you\u2019re gypsy brewing.\u2019\u201dA 2014 change in the law permitted taproom sales, and the Grimms are building a brewery in a former garage in East Williamsburg that they hope will start producing beer in August and serving it in September. The Grimms will bring most of their brewing in-house, aging sour ales in large oak foudres and fermenting beers with microbes captured in their backyard.Creative freedom like that is possible only when you\u2019re calling the shots. \u201cWith gypsy brewing, I\u2019ve always been working with one hand tied behind my back,\u201d said Brian Strumke, who founded the nomadic Stillwater Artisanal in 2010. \u201cThere are always limitations.\u201dHe is completing plans for a Greenpoint brewery, where he can produce beers banned at outside breweries, including ones fermented with wild yeast, which conventional brewers go to great lengths to keep out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a place that would let me can those beers, so now I\u2019m going to build one,\u201d Mr. Strumke said.\u201cSome people say: \u2018You\u2019re stupid. You have the most perfect business model,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jarnit-Bjergso said of his contract arrangement. \u201cI want to make Evil Twin a real New York brand.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to give something back,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind a Chinese Powerhouse, a Web of Family Financial Ties", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Hainan Airlines wanted to expand in the 1990s, its top executives turned to a little-known businessman in his early 30s, who helped the Chinese upstart develop golf courses, resorts and seaside villas.It was the beginning of a lucrative partnership for the businessman, Wang Wei, one that would put him on the path to becoming a billionaire. Over the next two decades, Mr. Wang set up companies that managed properties, as well as supplied computers, software services, seafood and Cuban cigars to Hainan Airlines and its parent company, the HNA Group.What HNA rarely publicly revealed, if ever, is that Mr. Wang is the younger brother of its co-founder and co-chairman, Wang Jian. In the past 25 years, HNA has regularly funneled business to a small group of relatives and associates of the company\u2019s senior executives, dealings with limited disclosure to investors in its listed companies or its overseas bonds, according to a review of thousands of corporate records by The New York Times.HNA is part of a new breed of aggressive Chinese deal makers that have risen, seemingly out of nowhere, into the ranks of the global corporate elite. But the ambitions of these giants have been fueled by debt and masked by opaque ownership structures, creating uncertainty over their corporate governance, strategic motivations and financial health.The situation makes it hard for governments and businesses around the world to understand the forces behind the spending sprees. Companies and regulators could be making decisions without a complete picture of how the conglomerates work, while investors may not know what they are buying.HNA and other big Chinese players like Anbang Insurance Group and Dalian Wanda Group are under pressure at home and abroad, as the authorities and investors worry about the risk these highly indebted companies pose to the broader economy.Untangling the operations of HNA, already complicated by its murky ownership and a complex array of affiliates, is made more difficult by a web of interconnected deals with friends and family members of top executives. The documents reviewed by The Times \u2014 which include annual reports, court filings and corporate registration records in the United States and China \u2014 reveal a systematic pattern of these so-called related-party transactions with friends and family.Wang Wei is tied to more than a dozen companies that do business with HNA. Other relatives and associates of the company\u2019s top executives have scores of ventures that work with HNA.\u201cHNA Group and its portfolio companies work closely with global, independent accounting, financial and legal advisors to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements in relevant jurisdictions, including disclosures with respect to related party transactions,\u201d the conglomerate said in a statement. \u201cRelated party transactions are conducted, reviewed and documented on commercial terms consistent with appropriate standards.\u201dThe lack of transparency among HNA and other conglomerates could amplify concerns in the United States and elsewhere. HNA\u2019s ownership of nearly 10 percent of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, has recently drawn scrutiny from European regulators.The European Central Bank, which supervises commercial banks in the eurozone, is considering opening an inquiry into whether HNA meets the criteria for large bank shareholders, according to two people with knowledge of discussions who were not authorized to speak on the record. If regulators were to determine that HNA is not qualified \u2014 for example, because it is poorly financed \u2014 the company could be forced to sell its stake or be stripped of its voting rights.Regulators around the world closely watch transactions with family and friends to ensure that companies put the interests of investors first. The deals can present potential conflicts if contracts are awarded without a competitive bidding process or if associates profit at the expense of the company and its shareholders.Should HNA have failed to properly report such transactions to banks or investors, it could run afoul of regulators in multiple locales, including China, Europe and the United States. Any regulatory scrutiny over HNA\u2019s business dealings could hamper the conglomerate\u2019s ability to raise new money.\u201cThere are red flags around this type of thing,\u201d said Geoff Peck, a risk management expert at FTI Consulting, a global advisory firm. \u201cI think regulators would take a dim view if it wasn\u2019t disclosed.\u201dHNA\u2019s spectacular growth has catapulted it to the forefront of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands. It promotes itself as a modern enterprise \u2014 transparent, socially responsible and run by executives trained at Harvard.JPMorgan, UBS and PwC declined to comment. A spokesman for the United States Treasury Department, which led the review, said the agency does not comment on the process.HNA\u2019s dealings with family and friends trace back to the company\u2019s founding as Hainan Airlines in 1993.At the time, China was in the midst of an economic overhaul, seeking to transition from a planned economy to one where market forces and private entrepreneurship were encouraged. After Hainan island was designated a special economic zone, local leaders tapped Chen Feng, a government official who had worked with the World Bank, and Wang Jian, who worked at the country\u2019s civil aviation authority, to help start a regional airline.The two men persuaded the local government to establish Hainan Airlines as a joint stock company. A new phenomenon in China, the structure allowed private investors, including the founders and top executives, to own a piece of the state-backed airline. They also persuaded the government to let foreign investors, for the first time, take stakes in a Chinese airline. During a trip to Wall Street, Mr. Chen pitched the carrier to the billionaire George Soros and won a $25 million commitment, a huge credibility boost.\u201cWithin China, it was the only airline allowed to operate like that,\u201d said Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Technology in Sydney. \u201cChen Feng was able to get huge loans from the state banks. So people know there was something special about his deals.\u201dAs the company took off, family and friends of the company\u2019s senior executives began setting up private businesses, positioning themselves to profit from the airline, according to The Times\u2019s review of documents.A woman named Huang Weirong owned a stake in Beijing Business Culture Diffusion Company, which has handled tens of millions of dollars in advertising for Hainan Airlines. A man named Zhang Zhijun controlled Xiangjian Information Technology, which invested alongside HNA and its affiliates in technology and airline information systems.Both individuals had separate ties to HNA executives. The two had each created numerous other companies with the family of Wang Jian, the co-founder and co-chairman.Mr. Wang\u2019s younger brother, Wang Wei, was one of the biggest beneficiaries of HNA\u2019s business.His companies sold equipment and services to Hainan Airlines and helped develop the company\u2019s properties, including West Coast Golf Club in Haikou. He was also a key partner in a large oceanfront property on Hainan island, which today houses high-end villas and a luxurious resort.In the mid-1990s, O\u2019Brien McGarey, president of the Dye Design Group, a prominent golf course design firm in Colorado, said he was hired by Hainan Airlines to assess a large plot near Haikou, with plans to build a golf course and villas. \u201cWe signed a contract with Hainan Airlines and we met with Wang Jian and Wang Wei, his younger brother,\u201d Mr. McGarey said. \u201cWang Wei was titular head and he was running the golf course.\u201dIt is unclear how Wang Wei raised the initial money for his businesses. But along the way, he landed on the list of China\u2019s billionaires.The family of Mr. Chen, HNA\u2019s co-founder and co-chairman, also forged business alliances with the company.When Hainan Airlines first sought to establish a presence in the United States in the 1990s, Mr. Chen\u2019s younger brother, Chen Guoqing, set up Pacific American Corporation in New York. The company purchased aircraft engines and spare parts for the airline\u2019s fleet, which included Airbus 320s, Boeing 737s and Gulfstream jets. Pacific American also helped HNA buy a collection of European hotels and co-invested with HNA in Yangtze River International Leasing Company.Pacific American\u2019s ownership is fuzzy.For years, it has billed itself as a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines or the HNA Group. Chen Guoqing called it a subsidiary in his biography for Asia Society, a nonprofit in New York. Court documents, filed in the United States as part of a 2007 bankruptcy dispute involving Dornier Aviation North America, listed Pacific American as an affiliate of Hainan Airlines.Public filings in Asia do not describe Pacific American the same way. A 2015 bond prospectus, which HNA filed in Singapore, described it as a \u201crelated party\u201d while annual reports filed by Hainan Airlines over 18 years stated that Pacific American was a major supplier. Those filings did not disclose that Pacific American was run by the younger brother of Chen Feng, and more recently, by Chen Feng\u2019s son, Daniel Chen.A spokesman for the HNA Group confirmed that Pacific American is an independent company and is not owned by HNA or any of its affiliates.At least one major investor was in the dark about such deals: Mr. Soros.Hedge funds controlled by Mr. Soros ultimately invested a total of $50 million in Hainan Airlines and an affiliate, Grand China Airways. Early on, an executive on Mr. Soros\u2019s team usually served as a director of Hainan Airlines.But the family ties to suppliers and service providers were never discussed, according to three people with knowledge of the investments. Mr. Soros, who declined to comment, sold his stake in 2011.The close connections also extended to HNA\u2019s acquisition strategy. The company has created hundreds of affiliates, public and private entities that regularly do business with one another \u2014 swapping assets, merging and then restructuring.Over the past seven years, more than 30 acquisitions have involved deals between two companies under the HNA umbrella, deals worth an estimated $20 billion, according to Dealogic. In 2015, Xian Minsheng, an affiliate of HNA, paid $8.6 billion to buy Hainan Supply Sales and Daji, also an affiliate of HNA.This sort of serial deal making has been a driving force behind the rapid growth of HNA, a strategy backed by ever increasing amounts of debt. HNA has more than $100 billion in debt, much of it owed to state-run banks.As HNA and other conglomerates make ever bigger bets, Chinese policy makers, economists and investors are wondering if the debt is sustainable. Shares in several HNA public companies have slumped in recent weeks over debt concerns.HNA\u2019s Mr. Chen has seemed unfazed in the past. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve accumulated so much lice, you no longer feel the itching,\u201d he said in an interview some years ago. \u201cWhen you borrow a lot of money, you have no problem sleeping.\u201dJack Ewing and Michael Forsythe contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "In Favor of a Fuzzy Brexit", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 There is a sense of drift and stalemate about British politics today: A severely weakened prime minister who may soon be out of office. A public that is restless and anxious, as it becomes clear that our political leaders have failed to prepare people for the difficult decisions ahead on \u201cBrexit.\u201d And an influential minority still passionately opposed to the decision to leave the European Union.After the unexpected victory for national-communitarian sentiment in the Brexit referendum in 2016, the general election in Britain last month featured an equally unexpected showing by the well-educated, liberal pro-Europeans \u2014 especially younger ones \u2014 rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s so-called hard Brexit of prioritizing immigration control and leaving the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union.But this stalemate between the country\u2019s two dominant \u201cvalues\u201d blocs may turn out to be benign. Britons excel at constructive ambiguity, or \u201cmuddling through,\u201d and a constructively ambiguous Brexit may be exactly what both Britain and Europe need.One thing is clear: The British decision to opt for the nation-state and self-government rather than the supranational embrace of the European Union is not going to be reversed, however quixotic it seems to the internationally minded everywhere.Opinion polls taken both before and after the June election suggest that around 70 percent of Britons think that it is the duty of the government to deliver Brexit. There is little regret among the 52 percent who originally backed leaving the European Union, and about half of the 48 percent who voted to remain now say that because it passed, it should go ahead.Nevertheless, a series of nudges and winks in the last few weeks from several of the senior British political players \u2014 above all, the Brexit secretary, David Davis \u2014 suggest that the election has left its mark and that British negotiators are edging away from a hard Brexit toward a \u201cfuzzy\u201d one, for when serious trade talks begin in October.This means a much longer transitional period than originally envisaged by both sides, possibly staying inside the European Union\u2019s customs union in some modified form, and a much greater readiness on Britain\u2019s part to compromise on continuing payments into the European Union\u2019s budget (as well as a large onetime leaving fee) and on some continuing jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice.Curiously, as the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, suggested to me, the apparent stalemate election result that swept away the Conservative\u2019s small majority in Parliament, while leaving them comfortably the largest party, may in the end have made no difference at all to the Brexit talks.\u201cPart of the thinking behind Theresa May\u2019s surprise decision to call the election for early June was that it would give her a bigger majority and thus empower her to make the compromises necessary in a long and difficult negotiation in which Britain has a relatively weak hand,\u201d said Ms. Kuenssberg. \u201cIt now looks as if the compromises will be forced upon her by weakness rather than strength.\u201dAbout three-quarters of all members of Parliament, including a majority in all the main parties, originally voted for Remain. A more pluralistic approach to Brexit, with greater input from the British Parliament, as well as from the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, is now the order of the day.Voting to leave was always going to be a lot easier than actually leaving, especially when the referendum result gave politicians no indication as to what kind of Brexit people wanted. But according to Bronwen Maddox, the director of the Institute for Government, a nonpartisan think tank, more progress in preparing for Brexit has been made behind the scenes at the highest levels of the civil service than is generally acknowledged.\u201cThe problem is there are limits on how much preparation you can do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot do all the logistical work on preparing for a new kind of customs union with the European Union until you know what has been agreed.\u201dBritain\u2019s reputation for good government and generally getting the big decisions right has taken a battering in recent months. But beneath the noisy political infighting, and more by accident than design, we may now be edging toward some sort of national consensus on a \u201cfuzzy\u201d Brexit. Moreover, a Brexit vote that was supposedly inspired by a narrowly provincial England, and that was predicted to tear Britain apart, has actually drawn it closer together, with both Scottish and Welsh nationalists losing ground in the June election.There remains one big problem: the European Union itself. Since the high point of success in the mid-1990s almost everything it has touched has turned bad \u2014 the clearest justification for Britain\u2019s decision to leave. There was the politically overextended euro, which worsened the post-2010 eurozone crisis; the premature enlargement to the former Communist states of Eastern Europe, including unchecked free movement of people; the failure to secure Europe\u2019s external border, which encouraged the refugee crisis of 2015-16. Not to mention second-order messes like the mishandling of the Ukrainian crisis.The European Union is run by Europe\u2019s brightest and best, but many of them are driven by a post-national ideology for which there is no actual consensus. To many ordinary Europeans, the cure of European integration is worse than the disease. What is the point of pooling all that sovereignty if the resultant institutions cannot save you from global financial meltdown and cannot even regulate the new digital behemoths?The European Union is enjoying an unusual unity in the early stages of the Brexit negotiations. But if, come March 2019, we end up with a mutually harming deal, or no deal at all, Brussels is sure to be at least as much to blame as London\u2019s negotiators, who are now more open to compromise than seemed likely a few months ago. Maybe it is Europe\u2019s true-believers who need to embrace the spirit of constructive ambiguity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Bachelet of Chile Is the Last Woman Standing in the Americas", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 No one relished the milestone more than President Michelle Bachelet of Chile.For a few years, she and two other female leaders presided over much of South America, representing more than half of the continent\u2019s population.Their presidencies \u2014 in Argentina, Brazil and Chile \u2014 made the region an exemplar of the global push for a more equitable footing for women in politics. And their moment came long before the United States, often regarded as less sexist than Latin America, even came close to electing a female president.And in a few months, she will be gone, too.After Ms. Bachelet\u2019s term ends next year, none of the countries in North or South America are expected to have female presidents, a notable turnaround in a part of the world where, until recently, women have been elected to lead influential democracies.\u201cPerhaps we had a cycle of hyper-abundance,\u201d she said during a recent interview at the presidential palace in Santiago.The end of the Bachelet era is raising troubling questions for advocates of women\u2019s rights who had hoped that the region\u2019s recent track record of electing women was a lasting step toward gender equality.\u201cIn all of these countries where there have been such leaps forward on gender equality, the tide could easily recede,\u201d Ms. Puri said.\u201cThey\u2019re all flawed leaders in their own way,\u201d said Shannon K. O\u2019Neil, a Latin America expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. She noted that none of the presidents managed to get ahead of the corruption sweeping the region, leaving their parties, to varying degrees, tainted by scandal.Presidents often see their support plunge while in office. But the three female presidents say their gender exposed them to particularly virulent backlashes.\u201cThey accused me of being overly tough and harsh, while a man would have been considered firm, strong,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said. \u201cOr they would say I was too emotional and fragile, when a man would have been considered sensitive. I was seen as someone too obsessed with work, while a man would have been considered hard-working.\u201dChile\u2019s president, Ms. Bachelet, 65, is a pediatrician and single mother who began her government career as an adviser in the Health Ministry, rising quickly to become the nation\u2019s first female health minister in 2000 and then its first female defense minister in 2002.After the celebrations on the night of her victory in 2006, Ms. Bachelet returned home haunted by a fleeting encounter on the campaign trail.\u201cIf you\u2019re elected, my husband will never hit me again,\u201d a voter told Ms. Bachelet. It was a sobering feeling, she said, that she had become \u201ca repository of the dreams and aspirations of so many people who had great expectations for my government.\u201dDuring her first four-year term, Ms. Bachelet steered legislative efforts to curb workplace discrimination, to protect victims of domestic violence and to expand health care for women, arguing that it was much more than a matter of fairness.\u201cI always make a soccer analogy,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said. \u201cIf, of the 11 players, we only had half in the field, we would never win a game. The country, in order to develop, needs the skills of men and women.\u201dWhen she left office in 2010, Ms. Bachelet, who was not eligible to run for a second consecutive term, was tapped to serve as the inaugural executive director of U.N. Women. She took star power to a new agency that funded poverty-fighting initiatives and pushed to get more women elected.But its ambitions were limited in part by an inability to raise enough money. Despite the close relationship between Ms. Bachelet and Hillary Clinton, then the American secretary of state, the United States has been a marginal funder of U.N. Women, providing between $4.5 million and $7.6 million annually since 2009.Ms. Bachelet soon returned to politics, winning the presidency again in 2013. During her second term, she created a ministry of women and gender equality, and passed an electoral change requiring that at least 40 percent of candidates for elected office be women. Before stepping down, she is seeking to partly decriminalize abortion, a proposal that Congress is considering.\u201cThe hardest thing to change is the culture,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said.Ms. Bachelet fumed. \u201cTo joke about that is to belittle all of us and that is unacceptable,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.While sexism may remain in Chilean politics, Virginia Guzm\u00e1n, a sociologist at the Center for the Study of Women in Santiago, said Ms. Bachelet\u2019s presidencies had left an indelible mark. Women are still underrepresented in politics, she said, but they have gained clout in other spheres, including unions and student movements.\u201cShe will be remembered as someone who tried to steer the country toward becoming more democratic in important ways,\u201d Ms. Guzm\u00e1n said.While Ms. Bachelet was popular during her first term, she said, she felt she was held to a different standard than male politicians. When her predecessor choked up in public, Ms. Bachelet said, he was hailed as a sensitive man.\u201cIf I became emotional, if my eyes welled up, I was seen as a woman who is unable to control her emotions,\u201d she said.It irked her that when editorial writers would criticize her decisions, they surmised that she had acted on the misguided advice of male advisers. \u201cThere\u2019s difficulty in understanding that as a woman, one has the ability to think, to make autonomous decisions,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said.The former female presidents of Argentina and Brazil, though different from Ms. Bachelet in tactics and style, spoke similarly of being subject to gender-based criticisms, and often to far cruder attacks.\u201cIt\u2019s not even subtle \u2014 it\u2019s overt,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a backlash to try to keep them in their place.\u201d\u201cIt will take another 50 years to reach parity if we continue with this kind of rhythm,\u201d said Zeina Hilal, who studies gender and politics at the union. She said women struggled to raise money, to break into party leadership positions and to overcome the bias of voters who question the ability of women to lead.Iv\u00e1n Aleite, a driver in Santiago, said he could not wait for Ms. Bachelet\u2019s term to end. Her declining popularity as a result of a sluggish economy and judicial inquiries into questionable business deals by her son and daughter-in-law, he said, are indicative that women are unfit to run the country. \u201cI have a theory about why Donald Trump got elected,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans saw the results of women presidents around the world, and the truth is that, with the exception of Angela Merkel, none of them has had the wherewithal to govern.\u201dMs. Jalalzai has heard similar arguments from voters across Latin America. But if Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency turns out badly, she argued, \u201cpeople aren\u2019t going to say he was a horrible president because he was a man.\u201dMeridith Kohut contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Paradox of Mexico\u2019s Mass Graves", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrug cartels are widely believed to be behind the mass grave. Most of the victims are yet to be identified. A mother living a few blocks from the field said she had no idea it was there. In April, residents filed a complaint that the smell of rotting corpses being unearthed was seeping into their homes.At the same time, Mexico has a trillion-dollar economy and is the eighth-most-visited tourist destination on the planet. The government denies there is an armed conflict going on.How can we understand this paradox and classify this bloodshed? Is it simply a horrendous crime problem, or is it an actual war? The question is not merely academic \u2014 it affects real-life decisions, like those of judges who decide whether people fleeing the violence can be classified as refugees.The truth is that the conflict is neither just crime nor civil war, but a new hybrid type of organized violence. We will never understand its nature until Mexico truly investigates how these mass graves came about. And that investigation includes the role of the state itself.On Monday, the former governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte, was extradited from Guatemala to Mexico to face charges of working with organized crime and embezzling state funds during his tenure from 2010 to 2016, when the mass grave at Colinas de Santa Fe was discovered. Some of his top aides have also been arrested. When the size of the grave was revealed, the new state prosecutor, Jorge Winckler, told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that nobody knew what was going on here, with vehicles coming in and out. If that wasn\u2019t with the complicity of authorities, I don\u2019t know how it was done.\u201dThe site was discovered not by the police but by mothers searching for their disappeared children. One of them, Maria de Lourdes Rosales, was trying to find her son, a 25-year-old customs worker who was abducted by a group of gunmen in 2013. After the police found no trace of him, she joined other family members of the more than 30,000 people who have disappeared across the country to demand justice. \u201cYou live with great pain every day,\u201d Ms. Rosales told me. \u201cYou are missing something in your life, in your heart, in your soul, and your only goal is finding them.\u201dOne day, when a group of mothers were marching in protest, a car drew up and a mysterious man got out to give them a hand-drawn map showing where the mass grave was. The mothers went to the site and began digging. Only after they unearthed clothes and human bones did the state forensics teams take over.In June, the mothers found yet another mass grave in Veracruz State, after somebody sent a map to one of them on Facebook.The cartels make billions smuggling heroin, cocaine and crystal meth to America, as well as from a portfolio of rackets from kidnapping to oil theft. That money is used to bribe police and politicians, who in turn help the cartels to eliminate anyone who stands in their way to making more money. The victims are not only rival cartel operatives but also include customs workers who won\u2019t take bribes, inconvenient journalists and many who simply witnessed the wrong thing at the wrong time \u2014 \u201ccivilians,\u201d all.Yet at the same time, for many Mexicans, life goes on in apparent normality \u2014 with no tank battles or aerial bombardments. This is what separates the conflict from a civil war, even though the death toll is comparable. The pattern of killing is perhaps most similar to that of the death squads of a dictatorship. And in Colinas de Santa Fe, children could play obliviously while at their doorstep was a mass grave akin to those left by the Islamic State.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece Looks to Turn a Corner After Years of Economic Pain", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreece, long Europe\u2019s economic problem child, is trying to prove that it has made progress in its recovery efforts by announcing plans to sell debt for the first time in years.If investor interest is strong, it would be a landmark moment, not only for Greece but also for the eurozone, the 19 countries that use the euro. If Greece struggles to find buyers, however, the debt sale could represent yet another blow for a country that has only recently started to see signs of a turnaround after nearly veering out of the currency union just two summers ago.Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, the economy minister, said his country was \u201cgetting out of a rut,\u201d adding: \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for Greece to become a normal country.\u201dIn a statement issued later in the day, the office of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras described the move as \u201ca significant step\u201d for Greece that would help it \u201cgain sustainable and stable access to the international markets.\u201d While the government has not explicitly said what the proceeds from the sale will be used for, the bulk of the sale is expected to be used to roll over existing debt.The upcoming offering of five-year bonds \u2014 Greece has previously issued Treasury bills \u2014 does not mean that the country is out of the woods. It is just the first of several steps that Athens must take to test whether it can raise money in international markets to support its economy and government operations when the latest bailout, worth \u20ac86 billion, expires in August 2018.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The sale is likely to be dominated by institutional investors, eager to snap up bonds that provide a hefty return (albeit in return for considerable risk), especially when compared to lower-yielding assets elsewhere in Europe.The Greek economy is still reeling from years of severe budget tightening, pension cuts, tax increases and other austerity actions required under the bailout programs. To rebuild its finances, the Greek government will need to maintain those measures even after the current rescue expires next year.Since then, Mr. Tsipras seems to have pivoted toward restoring political and economic stability, and the bond offering represents another step on that road. He now appears bent on burnishing his legacy by making the country financially self-sufficient again during his tenure.Talk in Athens that another surprise election might be held before his term expires in 2019 has also faded away.The calmer climate has attracted the attention of investors, especially in the United States, where companies and financial firms appear to be intensifying their search for deals as the Greek economy shows signs of stabilizing.Mr. Papadimitriou, the economy minister, said that on a recent trip to New York and Washington, more than 400 American investors had told him that they saw the potential to do business in Greece in sectors such as banking, maritime ports, pharmaceuticals, tobacco and tourism.During the trip, Mr. Papadimitriou added, \u201cpeople were already asking me when Greece would come back to the market.\u201dThe country still faces deep economic fissures, however. And success in the financial markets would hardly settle a debate over whether the nascent recovery has been worth the pain.Years of budget squeezing have taken a toll. While the economy appears to be stabilizing, expanding 0.4 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter, growth would have to surge by much more than that to make up for a near 25 percent contraction since the crisis broke out.For regular Greeks battered by years of privation and hardship, however, the government\u2019s efforts to appeal to investors have little meaning.Stavroula Vardaki, 68, looked perplexed at the mention of the government\u2019s prospective debt sale. \u201cWho cares if they sell bonds, what difference does it make?\u201d she wondered. \u201cMy pension\u2019s been cut six times already. I barely have enough to put something aside for my grandchildren.\u201cHow did they get us into this mess?\u201d she asked.An earlier version of this article misstated the maximum amount of cash Greeks could withdraw each day from banks in 2015.

{"Headline": "When the Trump Agenda Loses Steam, Muni Bonds Gain Momentum", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyMunicipal bonds were supposed to be among the biggest losers under a Trump presidency.Shortly after the November election, muni bonds \u2014 issued by states, municipalities and local agencies to finance government projects \u2014 faced a \u201ctriple whammy,\u201d said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management.First, there was a sharp rise in market interest rates late last year in anticipation of the new Trump policies boosting economic growth. And rising rates are a headwind for bonds in general. Then there was the president\u2019s pledge to lower income tax rates, coupled with concerns that he might eliminate the tax-exempt status of muni income.And finally, President Trump has promised to increase infrastructure spending by possibly $1 trillion \u2014 which, if it happens, could flood the muni market with additional supply, weighing on the price of existing muni securities.But it hasn\u2019t turned out that way so far.Meanwhile, concerns about a slow-growing economy have resurfaced, pushing the yield on 10-year Treasury notes back down to 2.3 percent at the end of June, from as high as 2.62 percent in March. And the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, recently told the Senate Finance Committee that the Trump administration supported preserving the muni bond tax exemption.The result of all of these developments is that muni bond mutual and exchange-traded funds have enjoyed a surprisingly good run this year.For instance, the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF, whose biggest holdings include revenue bonds issued by the California State University system as well as the University of California, has generated total returns of 3.6 percent this year and 2.2 percent in the recently ended quarter.Even before investors factor in the tax break (muni income is exempt from federal taxes and, in some cases, state taxes as well), that performance compares favorably with the 2.3 percent returns for the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF this year and the 1.6 percent gains in the last quarter.Going forward, though, navigating the muni bond landscape will get a whole lot trickier, money managers say.Even if Mr. Trump cannot produce annual growth of greater than 3 percent, which has eluded the economy lately \u2014 or the 4 percent rate that the White House promised earlier this year \u2014 the administration is still planning to move forward on its efforts to cut taxes.Ultimately, how much income tax rates eventually come down, if at all, will help determine the direction of muni bond prices. But the tax cut debate itself is likely to create short-term volatility for these investments.What\u2019s more, muni investors are largely following a conservative strategy.\u201cYou can see where investors are hiding out,\u201d says Mark R. Freeman, co-manager of the Westwood Income Opportunity Fund. \u201cEverybody is bunched up at the short end of the curve,\u201d he said, referring to muni debt with a maturity of no more than five years.That demand for shorter-term munis has made it harder to find great values. In fact, it has compressed the so-called yield spread \u2014 the gap between what short-term muni bonds are paying and what similarly dated Treasuries yield.For example, the average high-quality two-year municipal bond is paying 1.06 percent, according to Bloomberg, while two-year Treasuries are paying considerably more: 1.36 percent.By comparison, 30-year munis are paying virtually the same as Treasuries before the tax benefit is factored in: 2.87 percent before the tax break, versus 2.92 percent for equivalent Treasuries. And for someone in the 25 percent tax bracket, that 2.87 percent is actually the equivalent of a 3.83 percent taxable yield.To be sure, long-dated bonds are susceptible to larger drops in price should interest rates rise. And with the Federal Reserve lifting short-term rates, taking on that much so-called duration risk by buying extremely long-dated bonds does not seem to make sense, money managers say.Gregg S. Fisher, founder of the investment management firm Gerstein Fisher, says investors should remember a big reason for buying muni and other core bonds in the first place: \u201cFor the certainty that they present,\u201d he said.That\u2019s why he suggests investors play it relatively safe for the foundation of a muni portfolio, by sticking with bonds that are from high-quality issuers with investment-grade ratings (reducing the risk of a default) and that mature in less than five years.\u201cOur preference for any client, no matter what state they live in, would not be to buy 100 percent of their bonds issued in any one state,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should diversify across the country,\u201d he added, even if doing so forgoes some state tax breaks.Ajay Thomas, head of municipal securities at William Blair, agrees that investors should mostly be considering investment-grade municipal bonds. But he points out that as investors venture out to the lower end of the high-quality bond universe and the higher end of the low-quality world, they may start to see better opportunities.\u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily seeing a big difference in yields if you go from a AAA-rated bond to a AA bond,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you go below A, there\u2019s clearly some spread.\u201d He noted that there were some decent opportunities among munis related to health care and higher education in this category.Ms. Spath of Sierra Investment Management also said that higher-yielding munis are worth a look.Sierra sold all its muni holdings shortly after the presidential election last year, amid mounting pressures weighing on these investments, Ms. Spath said.But in early January, as some of the reaction to the Trump victory subsided, the firm moved back into muni bonds.Today, Sierra\u2019s municipal bond exposure is entirely in high-yield muni funds, she said.\u201cHigh-yielding municipals are currently yielding roughly the same as high-yield corporate bonds, and that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said, noting that many investors are totally overlooking the tax benefit these securities provide.She said the firm preferred investing in munis through a fund, in part because of the diversification advantage but also because institutional buyers can often obtain better prices.Among Sierra\u2019s top muni holdings is Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund, with an average credit quality of BB, which is at the upper end of noninvestment grade bonds.Nearly one third of that fund\u2019s holdings are in debt tied to health care or education and civic organizations. Among its top holdings recently were B-rated debt issued by the Chicago Board of Education at a coupon of 7 percent and AA-rated debt issued by the University of Kansas Hospital Authority with a coupon of 5 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Health Care Policy Is So Hard", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn fact, anyone who has spent some time thinking about the issue sees its complexity. With the collapse of the Senate health care bills this week, the president has certainly been reminded of it.But Mr. Trump\u2019s epiphany raises some questions: Why is health care so complicated? How does it differ from most of the other goods and services that the economy produces? What makes health policy so vexing?Yet the magic of the free market sometimes fails us when it comes to health care. There are several reasons.Take vaccines, for instance. If a person vaccinates herself against a disease, she is less likely to catch it, become a carrier and infect others. Because people may ignore the positive spillovers when weighing the costs and benefits, too few people will get vaccinated, unless the government somehow promotes vaccination.Another positive spillover concerns medical research. When a physician figures out a new treatment, that information enters society\u2019s pool of medical knowledge. Without government intervention, such as research subsidies or an effective patent system, too few resources will be devoted to research.The inability of health care consumers to monitor product quality leads to regulation, such as the licensing of physicians, dentists and nurses. For much the same reason, the Food and Drug Administration oversees the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals.Health insurance solves this problem by pooling risks among the population. But it also means that consumers no longer pay for most of their health care out of pocket. The large role of third-party payers reduces financial uncertainty but creates another problem.To mitigate this problem, insurers have co-pays, deductibles and rules limiting access to services. But co-pays and deductibles reduce the ability of insurance to pool risk, and access rules can create conflicts between insurers and their customers.Adverse selection can lead to a phenomenon called the death spiral. Suppose that insurance companies must charge everyone the same price. It might seem to make sense to base the price of insurance on the health characteristics of the average person. But if it does so, the healthiest people may decide that insurance is not worth the cost and drop out of the insured pool. With sicker customers, the company has higher costs and must raise the price of insurance. The higher price now induces the next healthiest group of people to drop insurance, driving up the cost and price again. As this process continues, more people drop their coverage, the insured pool is less healthy and the price keeps rising. In the end, the insurance market may disappear.The best way to navigate the problems of the health care marketplace is hotly debated. The political left wants a stronger government role, and the political right wants regulation to be less heavy-handed. But policy wonks of all stripes can agree that health policy is, and will always be, complicated.N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren professor of economics at Harvard University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bathroom Bill Tests Clout of Rare Moderate in Increasingly Conservative Texas", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut something else will be on the line, too: whether moderate Republicans have a role to play in a state party increasingly dominated by far-right Christian conservatives, and whether the last powerful moderate Republican in Texas can keep his job and his influence.State Representative Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas House, has long employed a mild-mannered, commerce-focused brand of Republican politics in the mold of former Gov. George W. Bush.Since 2009, when legislators first elected him speaker, he has been effectively minding the store of Texas. He has kept a relatively low profile and focused on issues like public education while his fellow Republican leaders, including former Gov. Rick Perry, now the energy secretary, and Ted Cruz, the former state solicitor general and now a United States senator, set their sights on higher office and seized the spotlight.Mr. Straus, 57, has put himself publicly at odds with the two most powerful Republicans in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both of whom support the bathroom restrictions. And on the eve of the special session, his ability to hold onto power is under fierce attack.\u201cHis days are numbered as speaker,\u201d said Jared Woodfill, the president of Conservative Republicans of Texas, which has spent a small fortune in recent years to defeat Mr. Straus and his lieutenants in the House. \u201cThis is one man who has a liberal agenda for the state of Texas, and who has done everything he can to stop the good work that\u2019s being done by the lieutenant governor and our State Senate and the governor.\u201dPro-business, Bush-style, country-club Republicans no longer set the agenda in Texas. What happens in the session \u2014 and particularly what form the bathroom bill takes and whether it passes or fails \u2014 will provide the clearest signal of whether there is any effective brake left on social-conservative Republicans in Texas.Mr. Straus shows no outward signs of feeling the pressure. In a recent interview in his office on the second floor of the Capitol behind the empty House chamber, Mr. Straus sat on a sofa with a tall glass of ice water and calmly paused for several seconds when asked whether Texas had shifted further to the far right since 2009.\u201cWell, a lot of the politicians have,\u201d Mr. Straus replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think Texas has. And as the Republican Party continues to dominate all the statewide offices, the competition has been focused, really, on the small-turnout primaries.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed to say that I know how to govern without being an extremist.\u201dThe marquee item on the special-session agenda is the bathroom bill. But it is one of 20 pieces of legislation that will be debated, including property-tax reform, teacher pay raises and a ban on abortion coverage by private insurance plans.The intraparty intrigue heated up a notch on Monday when Mr. Abbott told a conservative policy forum that he planned to publicize a list of lawmakers who support his 20-item agenda and those who oppose it, a list likely to have more political ramifications for Republicans than for Democrats.Mr. Patrick, the lieutenant governor, effectively forced Mr. Abbott to call a special session, by holding a mundane piece of legislation hostage that must pass to keep a handful of state agencies operating, including the Texas Medical Board, which licenses the state\u2019s doctors. Because the bathroom bill failed to pass during the regular session, Mr. Patrick used that legislation, known as a sunset bill, as leverage to get Mr. Abbott to order the 30-day session.Opponents of the bathroom bill in Texas predict similar fallout, and those concerns drive much of the moderate-Republican opposition to it.Few symbolize the disunity among Texas Republicans better than Mr. Straus and Mr. Patrick, whose inability to compromise on the bathroom bill set the stage for a special session that will cost Texas taxpayers at least $1 million.Mr. Patrick, a former talk-radio host, was the Texas chairman of President Trump\u2019s campaign. Perhaps more than any other Republican, he has come to define post-Perry Texas politics.The elder Mr. Bush as well as John Tower, the first Republican United States senator from Texas since the Reconstruction era, were two of Mr. Straus\u2019s early political mentors.\u201cI had the great privilege as a very young man to spend time with both of them, so when I think about some of the more ambitious, kind of out-there Republicans today, I always do go back to those, if you want to call them, old-school pioneers and founders,\u201d Mr. Straus said.Mr. Straus has taken a more subtle tack but has grown bolder in publicly criticizing Mr. Patrick, including on the bathroom bill.\u201cPutting aside some of his invectives, I\u2019m always happy to meet with the lieutenant governor, and with the governor for that matter,\u201d Mr. Straus said, adding, \u201cI also believe that too many of our state leaders spend too much of their focus and attention on divisive social issues, so if that\u2019s what the meetings are going to be about, you can count me out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yanis Varoufakis: A New Deal for the 21st Century", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorATHENS \u2014 The recent elections in France and Britain have confirmed the political establishment\u2019s simultaneous vulnerability and vigor in the face of a nationalist insurgency. This contradiction is the motif of the moment \u2014 personified by the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 made him a darling of the elites but who rode a wave of anti-establishment enthusiasm to power.A similar paradox is visible in Britain in the surprising electoral success of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in depriving Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives of an outright governing majority \u2014 not least because the resulting hung Parliament seemingly gives the establishment some hope of a change in approach from Mrs. May\u2019s initial recalcitrant stance toward the European Union on the Brexit negotiations that have just begun.Outsiders are having a field day almost everywhere in the West \u2014 not necessarily in a manner that weakens the insiders, but neither also in a way that helps consolidate the insiders\u2019 position. The result is a situation in which the political establishment\u2019s once unassailable authority has died, but before any credible replacement has been born. The cloud of uncertainty and volatility that envelops us today is the product of this gap.For too long, the political establishment in the West saw no threat on the horizon to its political monopoly. Just as with asset markets, in which price stability begets instability by encouraging excessive risk-taking, so, too, in Western politics the insiders took absurd risks, convinced that outsiders were never a real threat.One example of the establishment\u2019s recklessness was releasing the financial sector from the restrictions that the New Deal and the postwar Bretton Woods agreement had imposed upon financiers to prevent them from repeating the damage seen with the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Another was building a system of world trade and credit that depended on the booming United States trade deficit to stabilize global aggregate demand. It is a measure of the sheer hubris of the Western establishment that it portrayed these steps as \u201criskless.\u201dWhen the ensuing financialization of Western economies led to the great financial crisis of 2007-8, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic showed no compunction about practicing welfare socialism for bankers. Meanwhile, more vulnerable citizens were abandoned to the mercy of unfettered markets, which saw them as too expensive to hire at a decent wage and too indebted to court otherwise.As more and more voters became mad as hell, governing parties lost elections between 2008 and 2012 in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and elsewhere. The problem was that the incoming administrations were as much part of the establishment as the outgoing ones. And so they made bipartisan the very approach that had caused the wave of anger that carried them into office.Unsurprisingly, though, these central bank money-creation schemes and the Chinese credit bubble proved unable to prevent severe regional depressions, which struck from Detroit to Athens. Nor could they prevent sharp global deflation from 2012 to 2015.By 2014, voters had begun to give up on the new administrations they had voted for after 2008 in the false hope that the establishment\u2019s loyal opposition could provide new solutions. Thus, 2015 saw the first challenges to the insiders\u2019 authority start to surface.In Greece \u2014 a small country, yet one that has proved to be a bellwether thanks to its gargantuan and systemically significant debt \u2014 protests against the debt bondage imposed on the population evolved into a progressive, internationalist coalition led by the Syriza party that came from nowhere to win government. In Spain, a similar movement, Podemos, began to rise in the polls, threatening to do the same.In Britain, a left-wing internationalist tendency that had been marginal in the Labour Party coalesced around the leadership campaign of Jeremy Corbyn \u2014 and surprised itself by winning. Soon after, the independent socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, carried the same spirit into the Democratic Party primaries.Everywhere, the political establishment treated these left-of-center, progressive internationalists with a mixture of contempt, ridicule, character assassination and brute force \u2014 the worst case, of course, being the treatment of the Greek government in which I served during the first half of 2015. Historians may mark that year as when the establishment turned truly illiberal.By 2016, the establishment\u2019s arrogance met its first, frightful nemesis: Brexit. The shock waves from the insiders\u2019 unheralded defeat in that referendum rippled across the West. They brought new energy to Donald Trump\u2019s outsider campaign in the American presidential election, and they invigorated Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France.From the West to the East, a new Nationalist International \u2014 an allied front of right-wing chauvinist parties and movements \u2014 arose.The clash between the Nationalist International and the establishment was both real and illusory. The venom between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was genuine, as was the loathing in Britain between the Remain camp and the Leavers. But these combatants are accomplices, as much as foes, creating a feedback loop of mutual reinforcement that defines them and mobilizes their supporters.The trick is to get outside the closed system of that loop. The progressive internationalism of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party, Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters and the Greek anti-austerity movement came to offer an alternative to the deceptive binaries of establishment insiders and nationalist outsiders. An interesting dynamic ensued: As the insiders defeated or sidelined the progressive internationalist outsiders, it was the nationalist outsiders who benefited. But once Mr. Trump, the Brexiteers and Ms. Le Pen were strengthened, a remarkable new alignment took place, with a series of unstable mergers between outsider forces and the establishment.In Britain, we saw the Conservative Party, a standard-bearer of the establishment, adopt the pro-Brexit program of the tiny, extreme nationalist U.K. Independence Party. In the United States, the outsider in chief, Mr. Trump, formed an administration made up of Wall Street executives, oil company oligarchs and Washington lobbyists. As for France, the anti-establishment new president, Mr. Macron, is about to embark on an austerity agenda straight out of the insiders\u2019 manual. This will, most probably, end by fueling the current of isolationist nationalism in France.Where does this prey-predator game between the globalist establishment and the isolationist blood-and-soil nationalists leave us?The recent elections in Britain and France confirm that both strands are alive and kicking, reinforcing each other, as they tussle, to the detriment of a vast majority of their populations. Both Mrs. May\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s negotiating teams in Brussels are investing their efforts in an inevitable impasse, which each believes will bolster their political authority, even though it will disadvantage the populations on both sides of the English Channel that must live with the consequences.In the United States, Mr. Trump is pursuing an economic policy that, if it has any effect, will set off a run on Treasury bonds at a time when the Fed is tightening monetary policy. A result will be a panicked administration whose reflex will be to impose austerity measures before the midterm elections. Those policies will further disadvantage precisely the regions and social groups that carried Mr. Trump into the White House.So, what will it take to end this destructive dynamic of mutual reinforcement by the largely liberal establishment insiders and the regressive nationalist outsiders?The answer lies in ditching both globalism and isolationism in favor of an authentic internationalism. It lies neither in more deregulation nor in greater Keynesian stimulus, but in finding ways to put to useful purpose the global glut of savings.This would amount to an International New Deal, borrowing from Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s plan the basic idea of mobilizing idle private money for public purposes. But rather than through tax-and-spend programs at the level of national economies, this new New Deal should be administered by a partnership of central banks (like the Fed, the European Central Bank and others) and public investment banks (like the World Bank, Germany\u2019s KfW Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and so on). Under the auspices and direction of the Group of 20, the investment banks could issue bonds in a coordinated fashion, which these central banks would be ready to purchase, if necessary.Today\u2019s false feud between globalization and nationalism is undermining the future of humanity, and spreading dread and loathing. It must end. A new internationalist spirit that would build institutions to serve the interests of the many is as pertinent today across the world as Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was for America in the 1930s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Perry Praises \u2018Clean Coal,\u2019 but Trump Administration Policies Don\u2019t Promote It", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMORGANTOWN, W.Va. \u2014 On his first official visit to this coal-seam state that voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump, Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised the work of the scientists at a federal laboratory devoted to figuring out how to burn more coal with less pollution.But in the Trump administration\u2019s ideal economy, where the energy sector would be freed from regulatory mandates, international climate change obligations and environmental rules, what scientists at the West Virginia lab do would not matter very much. And that might explain why, despite his effusive praise, Mr. Perry has proposed to cut by 54 percent the budget of the Energy Department\u2019s Office of Fossil Energy, which focuses on researching technologies to use coal, oil and natural gas more cleanly and safely.Grace Bochenek, the director of the National Energy Technology Laboratory, was blunt about her interests as she led Mr. Perry\u2019s tour: \u201cToday was about educating, giving him perspective, so he can make a better decision.\u201dMr. Perry\u2019s appearance here neatly illustrated the contradictions between the Trump administration\u2019s message on energy and the scientific and economic realities of lighting and fueling the country. Last month, President Trump and his cabinet began trumpeting the catchphrase \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in speeches promoting his support of increased coal mining and oil drilling.The Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has taken the lead in Mr. Trump\u2019s push to dismantle climate change regulation on coal pollution, has called for the United States to export \u201cclean coal\u201d technology.But some experts say that Trump administration proposals would probably fail to deliver on those promises.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Perry have regularly proclaimed their support for clean coal \u2014 a broad, nontechnical term that is generally understood to refer to coal that is burned in conjunction with technology that strips away pollutants such as soot, mercury and carbon dioxide \u2014 exactly the technologies developed in the Morgantown lab that Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes to cut.The global economy will increasingly demand cheap electricity produced with minimal toxic or planet-warming pollution. For coal to survive, it will need more technologies that extract the pollutants that foul the air and warm the planet. In the United States, government research labs like the one in Morgantown have focused in particular on \u201ccarbon capture and storage\u201d technology, which strips out and stores carbon dioxide from burning coal. While the technology is too expensive to use commercially, researchers hope to reduce costs and keep coal viable in a carbon-constrained world.\u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to be able to use the majority of fossil fuel assets in the United States while also addressing climate change concerns is to use this technology,\u201d said Howard Herzog, an expert on carbon capture technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.But Mr. Trump has shown little concern for climate change. He has announced the withdrawal of the United States from the international Paris climate accord and has instructed Mr. Pruitt to dismantle Mr. Obama\u2019s climate-related regulations.The Trump budget for the fiscal year that begins in October also seems to have given up on clean coal. It would cut research and development for carbon capture and storage technology to about $35 million from more than $200 million.\u201cWe\u2019re heavily dependent on coal, and if coal is more environmentally friendly, electric utilities are more willing to burn it,\u201d said John Deskins, the director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University. \u201cHelping find ways to burn coal more cleanly is really important. If we diminish research in that area, we diminish hope for West Virginia.\u201dCoal state lawmakers from both parties are pushing to increase government tax credits for carbon capture research. West Virginia\u2019s senators, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, and Joe Manchin III, a Democrat, introduced a bill last week to expand a government tax credit program to pay for carbon capture research. The bill has the backing of more than 20 senators from both parties.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s position on the bill.Some West Virginia voters see Mr. Perry\u2019s budget as a betrayal of Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to help their region.\u201cWe want to see coal prevail, but cutting something like that lab, which helps both coal and the environment, is like shooting us in the foot,\u201d James Smyth, a retired salesman of coal mining equipment, said over a cocktail at Crockett\u2019s Lodge in Morgantown.Not all West Virginia voters agree. \u201cThat funding \u2014 is it working towards an endgame or is it just part of the liberal agenda?\u201d asked Daniel Bulian, a biologist and Trump supporter with a tattoo of his home state, West Virginia, on his right biceps. \u201cI support President Trump because he supports the coal that built this state.\u201dAlthough he is a scientist, Mr. Bulian, like Mr. Trump, appeared largely unconcerned about human-caused global warming. \u201cClimate change is a null issue for me. It\u2019s too early to know if there are any serious impacts,\u201d he said.Meantime, Mr. Perry offered an unconventional option for reviving the coal market. \u201cHere\u2019s a little economics lesson: supply and demand,\u201d Mr. Perry said during his West Virginia visit. \u201cYou put the supply out there, and demand will follow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

About half of Ethiopia\u2019s youth are thought to chew it. Officials consider the problem an epidemic in all but name.The country\u2019s government, which rules the economy with a tight grip, is worried that the habit could derail its plans to transform Ethiopia into a middle-income country in less than a decade \u2015 a national undertaking that will require an army of young, capable workers, it says.Khat is legal and remains so mainly because it is a big source of revenue for the government. But there are mounting concerns about its widespread use.As many as 1.2 million acres of land are thought to be devoted to khat, nearly three times more than two decades ago. And the amount of money khat generates per acre surpasses all other crops, including coffee, Ethiopia\u2019s biggest export, said Gessesse Dessie, a researcher at the African Studies Center Leiden at Leiden University.That payoff, and the dwindling availability of land, has pushed thousands of farmers to switch to khat, he said. The changes have come as the government has pushed farmers off land that it has given to foreign investors in recent years.Often associated with famine and marathon runners, Ethiopia is trying to change its global image by engineering a fast-growing economy, hoping to mimic Asian nations like China. It has poured billions of dollars into industrial parks, roads, railways, airports and other infrastructure projects, including Africa\u2019s largest dam.In cities across the country, skyscrapers grow like mushrooms, and along with them, dance clubs, restaurants and luxury resorts. According to government statistics, the country\u2019s economy has been growing at a 10 percent clip for more than a decade.But for all the fanfare surrounding what is often described as Ethiopia\u2019s economic miracle, its effects are often not felt by the country\u2019s young people, who make up about 70 percent of the nation\u2019s 100 million people. There simply are not enough jobs, young people complain, often expressing doubt over the government\u2019s growth figures.It is because of this lack of jobs, many say, that they take up khat in the first place \u2015 to kill time.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d said Shidigaf Haile, a public prosecutor in Gonder, a city in northern Ethiopia, which was rocked by violent protests last year, mainly by young people over the absence of jobs.More than half of the city\u2019s youth now chew khat, Mr. Shidigaf said. Many gather in khat dens away from prying eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s because there is a lack of work,\u201d he added, saying there were numerous cases of people who were so dependent on the leaves, sold in packs, that they turned to petty crime. The government recognizes the problem, he said, but so far it has not been tackled directly.\u201cIt\u2019s bad for Ethiopia\u2019s economic development because they become lazy, unproductive, and their health will be affected,\u201d he said.Dependency on khat is more psychological than physical, according to Dr. Dawit Wondimagegn Gebreamlak, who heads the psychiatry department at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia\u2019s capital. Chewing it \u201cis quite a complex cultural phenomenon,\u201d he said, adding that simply banning it would be difficult, given its role in cultural rites among certain religious groups.Mulugeta Getahun, 32, studied architecture but works as a day laborer.\u201cI chew khat when I don\u2019t have a job,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing entertains me more than khat.\u201d Sitting in a bar here in Bahir Dar, about 340 miles from Addis Ababa, where he was coming off a high, he drank \u201cchepsi,\u201d a home-brewed millet wine that helps neutralize the effects of stimulation.A group of men sat around drinking the homemade liquor and chewing khat, an act that could be considered illegal under the current state of emergency.After last year\u2019s protests, and their subsequent violent crackdown by security forces, the government prohibited communal activities because meetings were seen as a threat to public order and a potential gathering place for dissidents.Still, the young are defiant.There are \u201cbercha-houses,\u201d secret khat dens, where young people congregate in cramped rooms, bobbing their heads to Teddy Afro, a popular Ethiopian pop singer whose lyrics are considered veiled criticisms of the government.There are hide-outs on the banks of the Nile River, where young people stretch themselves out under mango and banana trees, chewing khat and throwing peanuts in their mouths.Even a guesthouse where Mengistu Haile Mariam, the authoritarian ruler ousted by the current governing party 26 years ago, stayed during the summers was recently overrun by young people celebrating the end of their studies, some chewing khat in one of the bleak Soviet-style rooms with the curtains drawn.Yared Zelalem, 17, and Yonas Asrat, 27, chewed khat on the side of a street in Addis Ababa, waiting for the odd job of washing cars to come their way. They had been chewing for five hours already, and it was still early afternoon.They both arrived in the capital 10 years ago looking for work, they said, after Mr. Zelalem\u2019s parents died and Mr. Asrat\u2019s family was kicked off its farmland to make way for a resort hotel.Mr. Asrat looked morose. \u201cNothing has changed in the past 10 years except for my physical appearance,\u201d he said, showing his home, a beat-up taxi with a foam mattress inside. \u201cThis country is only for investors.\u201dMr. Zelalem, the 17-year-old, lives next door, in a boxlike structure with just enough space to fit his small frame. He was more determined.\u201cI want to become prime minister and change the country, and give jobs to young people,\u201d he said, the words \u201cNever Give Up\u201d tattooed on his arm. He opened the door to his abode, which was fashioned out of corrugated metal. A backpack hung on a nail, next to a cutout of Jesus pasted on one wall. He took out his school notebooks, full of his meticulous handwriting.\u201cI want to study natural sciences, then become a doctor. Then I want to study social sciences to learn about politics,\u201d he said, listing off his ambitions.\u201cIn 20 years, you\u2019ll see,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll invite you to my office.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Runde at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who previously worked at the United States Agency for International Development.\u201cThe U.S. is not the strong, solitary economic power that it was in the past. It was so overwhelming in its economic power that it could almost unilaterally determine what was going to happen,\u201d said Tom Bernes, a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation who was previously a Canadian representative at international financial institutions. \u201cBut the world is changing.\u201dBoth institutions have worked to ingratiate themselves with the administration.Last week, Mr. Trump proclaimed his support for Mr. Kim, whose legitimacy came into question after his presidency was extended hurriedly ahead of the November election.The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative unveiled at the Group of 20 meeting came out of Ms. Trump\u2019s conversations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and then Mr. Kim. According to the World Bank, the idea was formally brought to the organization during a March meeting by a German official, who said the proposal came from the White House.The facility was set up with a speed unusual at the World Bank and will use the $325 million raised through donors to draw commercial finance. Its goal is to help women in developing countries gain access to the funding, technical assistance and networks needed to start businesses.While there are obvious governance concerns around Ms. Trump\u2019s role, the new project is viewed by some as a pragmatic exercise in courting the bank\u2019s largest shareholder: the United States government.\u201cThat\u2019s the job in some sense of the leadership of the banks, whether you like it or not, to keep their shareholders on board,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who previously served as assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to say the leadership of international organizations should ignore the politics of their nation members. It would be suicidal.\u201dDouglas Rediker, who represented the United States on the executive board of the I.M.F. under President Obama, pointed to the country\u2019s interests \u201cbeing openly prioritized by the I.M.F. in a way that you didn\u2019t see in 2016.\u201d\u201cThat is not either good or bad \u2014 it\u2019s a reflection of the institution\u2019s largest shareholder requesting a deeper dive on issues that are within the I.M.F. mandate and are meaningful to the U.S., and I don\u2019t think there is anything more shocking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIronically, you could argue the U.S. is asserting more of an affirmative agenda.\u201dHis appointment as deputy under secretary of the Treasury for international finance awaits Senate confirmation. And many other senior positions are yet to be filled with consequences for the pace of decision-making.\u201cBy failing to appoint officials to senior positions \u2014 to the Treasury, State Department \u2014 there is nobody for other governments to talk to on these issues,\u201d Mr. Bernes said.\u201cThis is the first G-20 where the United States has not been at the forefront of helping to shape the debate,\u201d he said.Republican administrations have historically questioned multilateral institutions. The I.M.F. is viewed as a lumbering relic bailing out reckless nations. The purpose of the World Bank, providing loans and technical assistance to low-income countries, comes into question as emerging markets more easily gain access to capital in global markets.Pointing to President George W. Bush\u2019s term, Lawrence H. Summers, former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, says it is often the leaders who \u201chuff and puff\u201d against the Bretton Woods institutions that turn to them in crisis.\u201cThe international financial institutions are the cheapest and best lever we have to push to further defense of our economic and geoeconomic interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a shame if these institutions either stagnated or their leadership came to embody values very different to those of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Presses Putin on Russian Meddling in U.S. Election", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to raise the issue \u2014 at the start of their long-anticipated meeting \u2014 was a big shift. Only a day earlier, Mr. Trump expressed his doubts about the extent of Russian meddling.\u2022 Much of the time was spent on Syria. The meeting went on so long that Melania Trump, the first lady, checked in to get Mr. Trump back on his schedule. It didn\u2019t work; the meeting continued for another hour.\u2022 Mr. Putin denied interfering in the election, and he asked for evidence. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the disagreement might be \u201cintractable,\u201d but that the two countries should try to \u201cmove forward.\u201d\u2022 The larger gathering of the G-20 leading economies will focus on high-profile issues like climate change, global trade, North Korea, Syria and Ukraine.In a major shift, Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Putin on his country\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters after a long meeting between the two leaders on Friday.But his Russian counterpart spun the exchange differently \u2014 claiming that the president \u201caccepts\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s oft-repeated denials that he had anything to do with attempting to swing the 2016 election to Mr. Trump.\u201cHe began by raising the concern of the American people of Russian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Mr. Tillerson, who was present at the meeting, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe pressed him more than once.\u201dSpeaking separately to Russian reporters in Hamburg, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, cast Mr. Trump in a more forgiving light.\u201cPresident Trump said that this campaign has already taken on a rather strange character, because over the many months that these accusations have been made, not a single fact has been presented,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said. \u201cPresident Trump said that he had heard the clear statements from President Putin about this being untrue, that the Russian leadership did not interfere in the election, and that he accepts these statements.\u201dMr. Lavrov, a veteran diplomatic infighter, added one more detail: Mr. Trump, he said, had conceded \u201cthat certain circles in the U.S. are still exaggerating, although they cannot prove this, the topic of Russia\u2019s interference with the U.S. election.\u201dAn email to a spokesman for Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t immediately returned.As recently as Thursday, Mr. Trump \u2013 who has vehemently denied that Moscow played any role in his victory \u2014 conceded that Russia might have had some hand in trying to sway the election, but he also left open the possibility that other countries had taken similar actions.Mr. Tillerson said that after Mr. Putin asked for evidence of Russian meddling, Mr. Trump moved on to other topics, notably Syria. Mr. Trump, he said, was more concerned with the future than the past.American officials would continue to discuss a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement with Mr. Putin to forswear such actions in the future, he added.Mr. Tillerson was less than sanguine about the prospects of ever getting Russia to admit meddling. \u201cIt may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point,\u201d he said.\u2014 Glenn Thrush and Neil MacFarquharMr. Trump and Mr. Putin met for so long that not even Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, could get between them.A lengthy back and forth on Syria took up much of the time, Mr. Tillerson said.At one point, after an hour of talk, the first lady stuck her head through the door to announce that Mr. Trump needed to wrap the meeting up because of his other scheduling demands. Her interruption was not heeded.The United States and Russia have agreed to a cease-fire in a limited area of southwestern Syria beginning on Sunday, a senior Trump administration official said on Friday after the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.The move would be the latest effort by American and Russian officials to facilitate an agreement to end the six-year civil war in Syria.Trump administration officials had said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would discuss the idea of partnering to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria as part of his efforts to usher in a new era of cooperation with Moscow.The news was first reported by The Associated Press and confirmed by a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the agreement had not been officially announced.Mr. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, spoke about the ceasefire agreement later in Hamburg. He said the ceasefire would take effect from midnight to noon local time on Sunday in the areas of Daraa, Quneitra and Sweida. \u201cAt first, security around this de-escalation zone will be guaranteed by the forces and means of the Russian military police, in coordination with the Americans and Jordanians,\u201d he said.Before the meeting, both leaders sat side by side for photographs as journalists shouted questions.\u201cPresident Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe look forward to a lot of very positive happenings for Russia and for the United States, and for everyone concerned.\u201dMr. Putin said he was happy to have the chance to meet Mr. Trump in person. \u201cWe spoke over the phone,\u201d he said, \u201cbut phone conversations are never enough, definitely.\u201dHe added: \u201cI hope that, as you have said, our meetings will yield positive results.\u201dOnly six people attended the meeting: Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson; Mr. Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov; and two interpreters.The Russians had agitated to include several more staff members in the meeting, but Mr. Trump\u2019s team had insisted that the meeting be kept small to avoid leaks and competing accounts later, according to an administration official with direct knowledge of the carefully choreographed meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity around the matter.Hamburg awoke on Friday to the buzz of helicopters and the wailing of sirens, as police officers rushed to keep up with protesters who had gathered at the city\u2019s major intersections in an effort to block the routes G-20 leaders were to take to the Messehallen Convention Center, the site of the meeting.Protesters burned several vehicles and set fire to trash hauling bins overnight, and columns of smoke could be seen rising over the city again early Friday. Taxi drivers were avoiding the city center, some in protest, others to protect their vehicles.\u201cWe remind you that gatherings in the transit corridors will not be tolerated,\u201d the police said on Twitter. The authorities used water cannons to stop the protesters from advancing.The police presence was enormous near the convention center. In black riot gear including helmets, padding and sometimes face masks, the police stood in small groups in a quiet face-off with civilians who might or might not have been demonstrators. The authorities have said that 20,000 police officers would be deployed.Many streets in and around the city center \u2014 which is famous for its extreme left-wing scene \u2014 were blocked to ordinary traffic, though nearby public transport stations were open, albeit with increased security patrols.After finally corralling the leaders to stand for the official \u201cfamily photograph,\u201d and persuading them to stop schmoozing with one another and take their seats, Ms. Merkel delivered a short and relatively anodyne opening statement.The German chancellor said she hoped that the summit meeting would \u201ccontribute to allaying\u201d the \u201cfears, needs and anxieties\u201d of the world\u2019s peoples. \u201cWe all know the great global challenges,\u201d she said, \u201cand time is pressing.\u201dThose in the room represent two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, four-fifths of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and three-quarters of the world\u2019s trade, she said, and the rest of the world expected results.Mr. Trump was on the side of the group photo, where leaders were mostly arrayed by seniority. Ms. Merkel stood at the center, flanked by the leaders of China, which hosted last year\u2019s G-20 summit meeting, and Argentina, which will host next year\u2019s.Ms. Merkel noted that the symbol of this meeting \u2014 a naval reef knot \u2014 was intended to show that the world is interconnected.On a day in which he might \u2014 or might not \u2014 confront Mr. Putin on Russia\u2019s attempts to sway the 2016 election, Mr. Trump decided to mount a diversionary attack against an American adversary.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet was off the mark on three counts:\u2022 Mr. Podesta was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman at the time and had no authority to turn over anything, much less someone else\u2019s emails, to the F.B.I. and C.I.A.\u2022 Mr. Podesta \u2014 whose own emails were targeted by hackers \u2014 fully cooperated with law enforcement agencies.The first lady, Melania Trump, scrapped her public schedule on Friday because the local police, who are dealing with protests, would not allow her to leave the guesthouse where she and Mr. Trump are staying because of security concerns, her spokeswoman said.Mrs. Trump, who was to attend a boat tour, a luncheon and a visit to a climate-control facility with the spouses of other G-20 leaders, instead stayed cloistered in the residence, away from the mayhem. \u201cShe was very much looking forward to the day,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham.While other world leaders and their delegations stayed in hotels near the site of the summit meeting, the Trumps are staying at a guesthouse in another area.Protesters poured through the streets near the convention center on Friday carrying banners with anti-globalization messages and some anti-Trump slogans. \u201cRefugees welcome,\u201d one sign said, while others read \u201cNo G-20\u201d and other still insulted Mr. Trump in colorful terms.Walking along the river in Hamburg, hundreds of students skipped their classes to take part in a peaceful demonstration, chanting, \u201cOne solution, revolution\u201d and protesting against education systems in Germany and elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m here because I oppose how education in Germany is structured, that they\u2019re training us to be workers and not thinkers,\u201d said Hendro Myrow, 18, a student in Hamburg.Lisa M\u00fcller, who helped organize the march, said its leaders had tried to draw as many students as possible. \u201cThe whole system of capitalism is the problem, because you need losers and winners, and that goes on at school as well,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning one thing but not what you want to learn.\u201dThe Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank Health, Imperiled", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHold the applause. The banks are certainly healthier now than they were in 2011, when the Fed began annual \u201cstress tests\u201d to assess their ability to withstand financial and economic downturns. But to the extent they are healthy, credit belongs in large part to banking reforms enacted after the crisis. And it is precisely those reforms that are now in the cross hairs of the Trump administration.The reforms were aimed at improving lending standards, restricting trading practices and strengthening capital requirements. Better loan standards and less trading have kept banks away from the reckless practices that precipitated the crash, while more capital helps to ensure that the banks can absorb any losses that may occur.A more stable financial system and greater protection against economically ruinous booms and busts have resulted.That\u2019s wrong. Bank lending has expanded at a decent pace in recent years; economic growth has suffered largely from Congress\u2019s failure to provide fiscal support. What the banks and their enablers in the administration and Congress want is a return to the days when excessive risk-taking led to outsize profits. They want to turn back the clock by rolling back the rules.History tells us that things won\u2019t end well if that happens. Deregulation led to the financial crash in 2008. It\u2019s safe to assume that repeating the mistake will lead to the same result.Knee-jerk deregulation is not the only threat to financial stability. It\u2019s entirely possible that the system is more fragile than the Fed\u2019s stress tests indicate. By the Fed\u2019s calculations, capital held by the nation\u2019s eight largest banks was nearly 14 percent of assets, weighted by risk, at the end of 2016.Alternative calculations of capital, including those that use international accounting rules rather than American accounting principles, put the capital cushion much lower, at 6.3 percent. The difference is largely attributable to regulators\u2019 differing assessment of the risks posed by derivatives, the complex instruments that blew up in the financial crisis and that still are a major part of the holdings of big American banks.The passing grades on the Fed\u2019s stress tests pave the way for banks to pay their largest dividends in almost a decade. The hands-down winners will be shareholders and bank executives, who could see their stock-based compensation packages expand further.But without continued bank regulation, and heightened vigilance of derivatives in particular, the good fortune of bank investors and bank executives is all too likely to come at the expense of most Americans, who do not share in bank profits but suffer severe and often irreversible setbacks when deregulation leads to a bust.It has happened before.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Candidates for Virginia Governor Employ Trump as a Barometer", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOT SPRINGS, Va. \u2014 Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia on Saturday used the first debate of the state\u2019s race for governor to assail President Trump as a liar and a \u201cdangerous man,\u201d wagering that the growing backlash against the president will overwhelm Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee, in a state drifting to the political left.\u201cWhat are you going to do as our governor, call the White House and say, \u2018Please put me through to the narcissistic maniac, we\u2019ve got to get more of our ships and submarines built here in Virginia\u2019?\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, invoking Mr. Northam\u2019s signature attack line against the president.\u201cIf the shoe fits, wear it,\u201d Mr. Northam, a neurologist, shot back, adding that his assessment \u201ccomes quite close to an accurate diagnosis.\u201dMr. Northam, a low-key Army veteran who twice voted for President George W. Bush before entering politics, is hardly the picture of the so-called liberal \u201cresistance\u201d to the president. But as he attempts to succeed Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a fellow Democrat who, by law, cannot seek consecutive terms, Mr. Northam is using strikingly caustic language to galvanize Virginia voters who are appalled by the president, but may be reluctant to vote in an off-year governor\u2019s race.\u201cAs we say on the Eastern Shore, he lies like a rug,\u201d Mr. Northam, who grew up across the Chesapeake Bay, said of Mr. Trump in his thick Tidewater drawl.Targeting the president on the health care proposal of congressional Republicans \u2014 which he called \u201cTrumpcare\u201d \u2014 and on climate policy and abortion rights, the lieutenant governor said his rival, Mr. Gillespie, had \u201cstood there and said nothing.\u201dBut if Mr. Northam was energetic about injecting national issues into the 90-minute forum, Mr. Gillespie did his best to return the focus of the conversation to state policy. Virginia was the only Southern state last year that favored Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Trump has become less popular since taking office.\u201cI am very focused on what\u2019s going on in Virginia,\u201d he said, winning applause from an audience largely composed of attorneys gathered for the annual summer meeting of the Virginia Bar Association, which hosted the debate.Mr. Gillespie even made sure to localize his areas of disagreement with the president. He said he opposed the administration\u2019s plans to cut funding to programs dedicated to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay and to bolstering economic development in Appalachia.Mr. Gillespie spent much of the forum focused on job creation and economic issues, the centerpieces of his campaign. He is proposing an income-tax cut that he argued would bolster the state\u2019s sluggish growth.The Republican candidate also got help in his attempt to drive a wedge between Mr. Northam and his progressive base. A heckler approached the stage in the opening minutes of the debate to castigate the Democratic nominee as \u201cgrotesque\u201d for backing a controversial energy pipeline through Virginia.Mr. Northam sought to link himself to Mr. McAuliffe, the popular governor, by trumpeting the \u201cnew Virginia economy,\u201d while criticizing Mr. Gillespie for talking down the state\u2019s progress since the Great Recession.\u201cTo hear him talk, the economy is going to hell in a handbasket,\u201d Mr. Northam said.But Mr. Gillespie repeatedly claimed that Virginia ranked 39th of 50 states in economic growth and was on the verge of becoming closer to the \u201crusty\u201d states of the northeast than it was other Sun Belt dynamos.The two candidates also differed on a range of flash points, including gun control, immigration and offshore drilling.The forum here was held at The Homestead, an upscale resort in the Allegheny Mountains, far from Virginia\u2019s population centers and mostly for the benefit of the state\u2019s legal and political elite who made up the crowd. While the debate was live-streamed, few Virginia voters are closely following the race at this point, and neither candidate has started airing TV ads.Officials in both parties recognize that Mr. Northam enjoys an advantage because of the political environment, but it was clear why Democrats have only agreed to two more debates.Mr. Gillespie is a practiced and articulate messenger of the kind of pre-Trump mainstream Republicanism that is popular enough in Virginia to have nearly lifted him to an upset victory over Senator Mark Warner in 2014. And the folksy Mr. Northam is not nearly as deft, particularly when it comes to seizing openings to press his opponent.The smooth presentation Mr. Gillespie has honed over decades as a political strategist, state and national party chairman, and as a lobbyist, may be his best chance to overcome the array of challenges he is facing.After the debate, it seemed he was only half-joking when he said he wanted to do 10 more.An earlier version of this article misstated the occupation of Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam. He is a neurologist, not a neurosurgeon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands Protest in Hamburg as Trump Meets With Merkel Before G-20", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 About 12,000 protesters gathered Thursday night in Hamburg. There were reports that dozens of police officers suffered minor injuries as a small group of protesters attacked them with bottles, poles and iron bars in running clashes that lasted until midnight.\u2022 Mr. Trump held a low-key private meeting with Ms. Merkel, who perhaps best symbolizes the deep skepticism shared by Western leaders toward Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\u2022 Earlier on Thursday, during a speech in Warsaw, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,\u201d and he explicitly expressed support for NATO.The crowds massed on Thursday just beyond the area cordoned off by the police where the summit meetings were scheduled to take place. On Wednesday night, several peaceful protesters filled the streets, gyrating to techno dance beats. But the crowds on Thursday were larger and more aggressive.Protesters clad in black and wearing balaclavas, which are forbidden by law during protests in Germany, threw bottles and stones at helmeted police officers who responded with water cannons and pepper spray.Residents and workers at businesses in the area were anxious.\u201cWe\u2019re a bit worried that the protesters will destroy the shop, and I\u2019m worried about being able to get home,\u201d said Jennifer Gand, who works at a retail kiosk in the St. Pauli district in central Hamburg. \u201cBut what can you do other than treat the protests like they don\u2019t matter and carry on?\u201dAbout a dozen armored police trucks formed an extended barricade near the main train station in St. Pauli and riot police officers took up positions on the streets.Mr. Trump delivered a message on Thursday of determination in the face of terrorism to the Polish people in a speech in Krasinski Square, where a monument commemorates the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis, calling on the West to defend itself in a good-versus-evil fight against extremism.\u201cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,\u201d he said, employing the same life-or-death language as his inauguration speech, which promised a war against the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d of urban crime.In the strongest terms that he has used to date, Mr. Trump used his speech to urge Russia to stop its \u201cdestabilizing activities\u201d and its support for \u201chostile regimes\u201d including Iran and Syria, delivering a broadside on the eve of his meeting with Mr. Putin, and he said that Poland had agreed to buy the Patriot missile defense system from the United States.Mr. Trump made the remarks during a visit calculated in part to signal his backing for a NATO ally, Poland, that is facing Russian aggression on its eastern flank. And he made an explicit pledge to honor the collective defense principle that undergirds the trans-Atlantic alliance, something he pointedly refused to do in May when he spoke at NATO headquarters in Brussels.While Mr. Trump made mention of the terrible toll wreaked by the Nazis on Poland and its once thriving Jewish population, many of his comments were targeted at the onetime invaders from the East. The president noted that Joseph Stalin had halted his troops outside the city during the uprising, allowing German forces to exterminate or capture Polish partisans fighting in the ruins of the city.In the same piece, however, he also appealed to the West to lift sanctions \u201cwhich have no future\u201d or place in the digital global economy of the 21st century.President Trump got a full dose of adulation from the overflow crowd that greeted him in Krasinski Square, which was filled with Polish and American flags and dominated by the imposing monument to the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.\u201cI respect Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigrants,\u201d said Slawomir Famulski, 38, who brought his two children, Zofia, 10, and Tomasz, 8, to \u201cteach them about patriotism.\u201dMr. Famulski\u2019s family clustered near a giant television screen on a side street. The choice of the square, with its monument to the heroic but doomed uprising against Nazi occupation, sent a clear message, he said. \u201cHe is letting both Germany and Russia know to back off Poland,\u201d Mr. Famulski said of Mr. Trump.While opinions about the current American president are split, Poland is perhaps the most fiercely pro-American country in Europe.Mr. Trump drew criticism from Polish Jews for failing to visit a monument at the site of the Warsaw Ghetto that memorializes an uprising by Jews against the Nazis in 1943.Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the chief rabbi of Poland; Anna Chipczynska, president of the Jewish Community of Warsaw; and Leslaw Piszewski, the president of Union of Jewish Communities of Poland, called Mr. Trump\u2019s omission \u201ca slight.\u201dEvery American president and vice president who has visited Warsaw since the fall of communism in 1989 has visited the monument to the doomed but heroic ghetto uprising.Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday that he still was not convinced that Russia was solely responsible for interference in the 2016 election, breaking with American intelligence agencies who have agreed that the effort emanated from Moscow and was directed by Mr. Putin.\u201cI think it was Russia, and it could have been other people in other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said when asked for a yes-or-no answer to the question about Russian meddling.What made Mr. Trump\u2019s sermon against the mainstream media different this time was the fact Mr. Duda\u2019s center-right party, Law and Justice, proposed restricting media access to Parliament last year. The government backed down after street protests.\u201cThey have been fake news for a long time, and they have been covering me\u201d in a dishonest way, Mr. Trump said of CNN when asked about the tweet at the news conference with Mr. Duda at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. \u201cWe don\u2019t want fake news,\u201d he added, as Mr. Duda nodded vigorously in agreement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China and India File Rival Claims Over Tibetan Medicine", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two countries\u2019 latest struggle is over which one will be able to formally tie the ancient practice of Tibetan medicine to its national patrimony. The prize: international cachet and the possibility of significant commercial rewards.Tibetans who live in exile and Western anthropologists who study Tibetan medicine said that it was difficult to predict what tangible effects Unesco recognition might have on the field.Recognition could be beneficial, they said, if it led to greater access to medical care for rural Tibetans, recruitment of more Tibetan medical practitioners for high-level advisory roles or laws to regulate the production of pharmaceuticals.The worry, however, is that Unesco recognition could lift the industry\u2019s commercial development without addressing some of its underlying problems, such as the watering-down of traditional medicinal formulas and the over-harvesting of medicinal ingredients in the wild.Sowa rigpa is practiced in China, India and neighboring countries including Bhutan, Mongolia and Nepal. The name is often translated into English as \u201cthe science of healing,\u201d and the present form of the discipline\u2019s founding text, \u201cThe Four Tantras,\u201d is attributed by many Western scholars to a 12th-century Tibetan physician, with antecedents stretching to the eighth century or earlier.As late as the early 1990s, there was no discernible competition between China and India to claim Tibetan medicine as cultural patrimony, Western scholars say. But about 20 years ago, they say, people began to recognize its potential commercial value.But this same economic potential concerns experts who say the industry, which has traditionally relied on the gathering of wild plants and animals in mountainous areas, is not really built for large economies of scale.Western scholars say there are clear historical links between ayurvedic and Tibetan medical traditions. But India\u2019s recent application for Unesco recognition prompted ripostes from Chinese experts.In April, the state-run newspaper Global Times quoted Qin Yongzhang, an ethnologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, as saying, \u201cThe truth is that Tibetan medicine not only originated but has developed in China.\u201dChina\u2019s recent Unesco application said that Tibetan hot-spring and herbal-bath therapies \u2014 known as lum medicinal bathing \u2014 were \u201cdeveloped by the Tibetan people\u201d and are popular across much of western China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region.A Unesco designation would raise awareness of the bathing tradition \u201camong the Chinese population, while encouraging dialogue on health and respect for nature among different ethnic groups,\u201d the application said.\u201cBut to claim that somehow China has been the origin of the tradition is, frankly, just silly,\u201d Mr. Thurman wrote in an email.A woman who answered the phone at the office of China\u2019s Unesco commission, who would not give her name, said that the government was working on its Unesco paperwork and that all related information was confidential.Unesco said it could not comment on files it was processing. A spokesman in Bangkok, Noel Boivin, said in an email that the agency encouraged multinational intangible cultural heritage nominations.In interviews, two prominent Tibetans took a mixed view of the Unesco process and said Tibetans had no easy options to safeguard their cultural heritage.However, she said, \u201cif you do not take advantage of funds and opportunities, Tibetan medicine, together with much of traditional Tibetan culture, will gradually disappear.\u201dMr. Kloos, the medical anthropologist in Vienna, said that countries where sowa rigpa was practiced should work together if their goal was to have it recognized internationally.\u201cBut politics creep in,\u201d he said, \u201ceven though it should really only be about medical considerations.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai, India, and Karoline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson Tries Shuttle Diplomacy in Qatar Dispute", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUWAIT CITY \u2014 Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson signed a memorandum of understanding Tuesday with Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, outlining ways the tiny gas-rich state could fortify its fight against terrorism and address terrorism funding issues.On Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson, in his first effort at shuttle diplomacy, will take the memorandum to leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to see if it will be enough to end a standoff that has led four Arab nations to blockade Qatar for more than a month. But as temperatures here hovered around 120 degrees, the chances that anything might cool down appeared dim.\u201cI applaud the leadership of his highness, the emir of Qatar, for being the first to respond to President Trump\u2019s challenge at the Riyadh summit to stop the funding of terrorism,\u201d Mr. Tillerson at the news conference, adding, \u201cQatar, I think, has taken the initiative to move out on things that had been discussed but had not been brought to a conclusion, and to put in place a very, very strong agreement.\u201dFew in the region believe Qatar\u2019s government will accede to most of the demands. So far, one result of the embargo, which has squeezed the Qatari economy and put at risk a host of American priorities in the region, has been to push Qatar closer to Iran, which has stepped in with planeloads of fresh vegetables and other support.Before beginning this week\u2019s effort, Mr. Tillerson stopped by the World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul on Sunday to accept a lifetime achievement award for his 41-year tenure at Exxon Mobil. He retired as chief executive at the company to take the job as the nation\u2019s top diplomat.\u201cI miss all of you,\u201d he told the gathered oil executives. \u201cI miss you as colleagues, I miss you as partners, I miss you as competitors.\u201dHe may have also missed the way his trips here often concluded. For oilmen, the Middle East is a land of fortune and opportunity, and Mr. Tillerson struck some of the most important and lucrative deals of his career here. For secretaries of state, however, it is a place of frustration and failure, where tribal, religious and political differences have stymied some of the most persistent and patient diplomatic campaigns in American history.With Mr. Trump squarely on their side, Saudi Arabia and its allies have done little to resolve the dispute.But many crucial American policy priorities depend on Arab unity, including the defeat of the Islamic State and the rebuilding of devastated portions of Iraq and Syria. Qatar is home to the largest United States military base in the Middle East, while Bahrain hosts the Fifth Fleet, American installations caught in opposite sides of the dispute.Last week, after the State Department warned that the dispute could drag on for months and possibly intensify, Mr. Tillerson announced that he would travel to the region for talks.\u201cThe purpose of the trip is to explore the art of the possible of where a resolution can be found,\u201d said R. C. Hammond, a spokesman for Mr. Tillerson.But with failure all too likely, Mr. Hammond said that Mr. Tillerson was maintaining his distance and not trying to act as a mediator.\u201cNo, a mediator says this is what the final resolution is going to be, we\u2019ll decide it for you, that\u2019s a mediation,\u201d Mr. Hammond said, and then added: \u201cThe emir of Kuwait is leading these efforts. Our job is to make sure everybody continues to talk to each other.\u201dMr. Tillerson has largely sided with Qatar since the beginning.Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim that Qatar has an unusually bad record of funding terrorism has been met with skepticism among American diplomats, since the Saudis have long been the principal financier of mosques around the world that teach a stark form of Islam associated with extremism.The memorandum signed Tuesday with Qatar might make Saudi Arabia\u2019s claims that the dispute is all about terrorism funding more difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d Mr. Hammond said. \u201cThere are no clean hands here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central Bankers Play Waiting Game on Inflation", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsCentral banking increasingly looks like an act of faith.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and his Bank of Japan counterpart, Haruhiko Kuroda, have spent trillions of euros and yen without generating as much inflation as they want. Yet they have little choice but to insist their policies will eventually work.The eurozone is finally experiencing a robust recovery and the only things lacking are a pickup in wages and inflation, Mr. Draghi said on Thursday. On the other side of the globe, Mr. Kuroda is playing the same waiting game. The Bank of Japan raised forecasts for growth in the world\u2019s third-largest economy on Thursday. But it lowered its projections for inflation, postponing by a year the timetable for hitting its 2 percent target. It is the sixth delay since Mr. Kuroda started the central bank on huge purchases of government bonds and other assets in 2013.Both central bankers insist their policies will work in the end. Mr. Draghi cited the need for persistence, patience and prudence several times. Yet they have no way of knowing for sure whether the failure of stronger growth to feed through to higher wages and inflation is from temporary or deeper structural reasons.The financial crisis may have damaged the economy in ways that take a long time to heal. Productivity growth has slowed, and it is unclear whether it will bounce back. The labor market may also contain more slack than headline unemployment rates suggest. A recent European Central Bank working paper said 3 percent of the eurozone\u2019s working-age citizens were spending fewer hours at work than they would like. An additional 3.5 percent are labeled inactive but are actually just competing less actively in the labor market. Workers may be more concerned about landing \u2014 or keeping \u2014 a secure job with good benefits, rather than pushing for higher pay.There is more than a trace of doubt about how long such factors will hold back inflation. But central bankers cannot admit uncertainty if they want households and investors to remain confident. They can only keep the faith, and keep trying.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Convicted of Murder, and Now Swept Up in U.S.-Cuba Shift", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than 30 years, Ishmael Muslim Ali has lived a relatively full and unremarkable life in Cuba. He taught English in the nation\u2019s public schools, worked as a translator and raised a family \u2014 a quiet coda for an international fugitive.\u201cThey want their sovereignty respected,\u201d Mr. Ali said in a telephone interview from Cuba, among his first public comments in three decades. \u201cThey are not going to let anybody bully them.\u201dHe said he felt reassured that the Cuban authorities would not let him be sent back. After all, he said, Mr. Trump\u2019s stance is a return to the old Cold War animosity that further hardened the Cuban government\u2019s positions.Beyond that, experts say that if the United States requests the extradition of its wanted criminals, Cuba may do the same. That could include a request for Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban with ties to the C.I.A. who lives in the United States but is wanted in Cuba for, among other things, his possible role in the bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people.The story began on Sept. 6, 1972, in St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, when five masked individuals killed eight people at the Fountain Valley Golf Course. The murders rocked the small island and summoned a wave of law enforcement authorities from the United States to conduct the investigation.The club, owned by the Rockefeller family, was frequented by the wealthy.Soon after the murders, Mr. Ali, at the time known as Ronald Labeet, and four others were arrested and charged with the crime. The trial drew some of the most prominent liberal legal figures of the time, including William Kunstler, who defended the activists known as the Chicago Seven, as well as William Estridge, a lawyer for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Mr. Ali, who was considered the leader of the group, and the others convicted maintained their innocence, arguing that their original trial was unfair. The film raises allegations that the suspects were tortured while in custody and that the judge presiding over the trial was biased because he had represented members of the Rockefeller family in his private practice.After being convicted, Mr. Ali spit on the floor, and he and his accomplices struck out at the marshals who took them into custody, according to news accounts at the time.\u201cEven at the trial, we were freaked out on an emotional basis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt anger and desperation that we had a judge who didn\u2019t care about the law.\u201dHe added: \u201cI would be different now. I would be with my defense in a much different way than I was at the time. But you can\u2019t go back. Life isn\u2019t that way. You have to go forward. The way we tried to get justice, how we acted in our desperation to seek justice, it don\u2019t justify what was done to us.\u201dMr. Ali\u2019s conviction was upheld on appeal. And despite his proclamations of innocence, many feel his conviction, and the sentence, were justified.\u201cProclaiming his innocence is ridiculous,\u201d said Jeffrey Resnick, the chief prosecutor in St. Croix in 1972, who said there was overwhelming forensic evidence \u2014 as well as witness identification and confessions \u2014 of Mr. Ali\u2019s guilt. \u201cThere is no doubt that they did it.\u201dMr. Joseph, a lawyer in St. Croix, says the events he details in the book, which specify Mr. Ali\u2019s role in the murders as well as that of his brother, are based on conversations he had with Raphael after he was pardoned.In a presentation he gave on the book in 2015, he described Mr. Ali as a \u201cwicked man\u201d and claimed that he held a gun to his brother\u2019s head to make him participate in the robbery-turned-massacre.Following his conviction, Mr. Ali fought to be returned to St. Croix. After more than a decade in prison, he was sent back to the island, though only for proceedings in a civil suit he had filed, asserting that his rights had been violated when he was placed in solitary confinement for 90 days. He was awarded $12,000 in damages and placed aboard an American Airlines passenger plane bound for New York on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1984.The Cuban authorities convicted Mr. Ali of hijacking the plane, and sentenced him to 10 years in jail. He served seven years and got an early release for good behavior. Afterward, on the petition of Ms. Shakur, Mr. Ali says he was granted asylum, the beginning of an entirely new chapter for him.\u201cI have a quiet life. I\u2019ve been married two times. I have kids and a family here,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m really thankful to the Cuban government and the Cuban people for the way I have been treated.\u201dIn Cuba, he says he has found a peace he never experienced in the United States, where race was an issue in every facet of life.\u201cThe thing about race here is that it\u2019s not an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the U.S., you are always aware of the race difference. There was always someone or something you had to be fighting against. Here in Cuba, that has been wiped out by the revolution for ages now. I just feel like another citizen here.\u201dHis reasoning for participating in the film, he said, was to raise awareness about his co-defendants, arguing that they have spent their lives in prison for a crime they did not commit. It is not quite guilt that he feels for being the only one to escape, he says, but rather a consciousness that he is the only one who was able to live a real life.\u201cIt hurts me every day to think about them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I think about my co-defendants, what they have suffered bothers me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congressional Democrats Promise a \u2018Better Deal\u2019 for American Workers", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Democratic Party wants to pick a fight with corporate America to win back Congress.\u201cOld-fashioned capitalism has broken down to the detriment of consumers,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Monday afternoon in Berryville, Va., about an hour west of Washington.Yet there were some striking omissions in the plan. There was no talk about health insurance beyond prescription drug prices. There was no discussion of trade policy beyond a placeholder sentence promising more details later; Mr. Schumer\u2019s office said Democrats planned to roll out a detailed trade agenda in the fall. And party leaders did not embrace liberal concerns about the outsize economic role of the financial industry.The focus, instead, was on a fairly small set of battle-tested ideas. And though Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was not present on Monday, the imprint of his presidential campaign was unmistakably present. Democrats proposed to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour \u2014 an idea the party\u2019s 2016 nominee, Hillary Clinton, never heartily embraced.The \u201cFight for $15\u201d has energized parts of the Democratic base, and it has racked up impressive victories in states including New York and California and cities from Seattle to Washington. But raising the price of work could reduce demand for workers, and some economists see a particular danger in states like Alabama, where average wages are lower and employment has not recovered from the 2008 recession.Democrats also proposed new tax credits for job training, an old idea that has been tried many times before.The party\u2019s proposal to reduce the cost of living was its freshest set of ideas. That part embraces an emerging concern among liberal economists and activists that corporate concentration is damaging the American economy.\u201cThis matters because giant corporations jack up prices and cut corners on quality,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been a highly visible advocate of the issue. She said at the event on Monday that consolidation also allowed corporations to increase profits while holding down wages, and to exercise outsize political influence.The Democrats proposed changing the merger rules, instructing regulators to presume that consolidation is bad for consumers. They suggested the creation of a federal office, a \u201cconsumer competition advocate,\u201d that would report problems to regulators.But the emphasis on new protectors, rather than improved performance, raises the question of why existing agencies cannot be relied upon. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, was created to protect consumers and police anti-competitive behavior. The Democrats are essentially creating a new arm of government to make sure that an old arm of government fulfills its duties.Democrats also took on the pharmaceutical industry, proposing a number of measures they said would help reduce the cost of medications.One proposal would give Medicare greater latitude to negotiate drug prices, an idea that Mr. Trump has also endorsed. The intuitive appeal is clear: Medicare\u2019s drug plans cover more than 40 million people \u2014 surely it can obtain a decent group discount.Democrats also proposed the creation of a federal agency that would police drug prices, \u201cdedicated to stopping this outrageous behavior in its tracks.\u201dBut the broader reality is that the federal government has sought to encourage innovation by codifying the industry\u2019s profitability, for example by maintaining stronger intellectual property protections than drug companies enjoy in the rest of the world.On that, the Democrats did not propose any fundamental changes.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Dominant, the United States Finds Itself Isolated at G-20", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 For years the United States was the dominant force and set the agenda at the annual gathering of the leaders of the world\u2019s largest economies.But on Friday, when President Trump met with other leaders at the Group of 20 conference, he found the United States isolated on everything from trade to climate change, and faced with the prospect of the group\u2019s issuing a statement on Saturday that lays bare how the United States stands alone.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the host of the meeting, opened it by acknowledging the differences between the United States and the rest of the countries. While \u201ccompromise can only be found if we accommodate each other\u2019s views,\u201d she said, \u201cwe can also say, we differ.\u201dMs. Merkel also pointed out that most of the countries supported the Paris accord on climate change, while Mr. Trump has abandoned it. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see how we formulate the communiqu\u00e9 tomorrow and make clear that, of course, there are different opinions in this area because the United States of America regrettably\u201d wants to withdraw from the pact, she said.Mr. Trump seemed to relish his isolation. For him, the critical moment of Friday was his long meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, which seemed to mark the reset in relations that Mr. Trump has been desiring for some time. It also provided Mr. Putin the respect and importance he has long demanded as a global partner to Washington.Where previous American leaders saw their power as a benevolent force, and were intent on spreading prosperity through open markets and multilateral cooperation, Mr. Trump has portrayed himself as a nationalist, a unilateralist and a protectionist, eager to save American jobs.What recent events have underscored, though \u2014 and especially at the G-20 \u2014 is that no nation is today large or powerful enough to impose rules on everyone else. In advancing his views, Mr. Trump has alienated allies and made the United States seem like its own private island.Nowhere was Mr. Trump\u2019s isolation more evident than on the issue of trade.Mr. Trump thinks the United States has been unfairly disadvantaged by sweeping free-trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He believes the steel industry in particular has been savaged by globalization.Within days, he could impose restrictions and new tariffs on steel imports. Doing so would be a provocative move that could affect trade with more than a dozen major countries even while lifting the spirits of his most ardent supporters.The tariffs could very well provoke a global trade war.European officials here reacted astringently, threatening to retaliate. \u201cWe will respond with countermeasures if need be, hoping that this is not actually necessary,\u201d the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said on Friday. \u201cWe are prepared to take up arms if need be.\u201dTargets could include American whiskey imports. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you in detail what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. \u201cBut what I would like to tell you is that within a few days \u2014 we won\u2019t need two months for that \u2014 we could react with countermeasures.\u201dThe Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, warned that new protectionist trade measures could bring \u201ccontagion\u201d that would slow the growth of the world economy. \u201cWe cannot waste this moment of recovery, giving signals of protectionism or of incorrect trade behavior,\u201d he said.But as Mr. Trump contemplates protectionism, Europe and Japan reached a landmark free trade agreement this week. Mexico and China, two of the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, have been mulling their own deal. The world is moving ahead regardless.Mr. Trump and his economic team have been delaying the decision on steel in recent weeks because of disagreement among his advisers.For weeks, trade lawyers, industry leaders and members of Congress have been anxiously awaiting a recommendation on the matter from the Department of Commerce. They view Mr. Trump\u2019s decision as a moment that will illuminate whether he is ready to make good on his campaign promises to protect flagging American industries with tariffs.Among those most on edge are economists, many of whom have been uneasy about Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox views on trade because they have seen the damage from such actions before.The United States imported 30.1 million metric tons of steel last year, making it the world\u2019s largest steel importer, according to the International Trade Administration. Canada, Brazil and South Korea are the three biggest exporters to the United States, followed by Mexico and Turkey. China, the target of much anti-globalization rhetoric, is not such a major factor, at least not in steel.The Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, worries that retaliation from China and Europe to any steel tariffs would be particularly painful for American exporters and could lead to job cuts when Mr. Trump is trying to bolster employment and labor force participation.While the steel industry, which Mr. Trump promised to revive, could benefit, other industries like construction and housing would probably suffer. Many of the workers in these industries and the consumers who buy their goods are likely to be the types of moderate-income voters who backed Mr. Trump.\u201cIt will hurt the people it\u2019s designed to help through higher prices,\u201d Mr. Strain said. \u201cUltimately the economy will lose.\u201dOn Friday, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, warned the Trump administration that new tariffs would face a challenge in the World Trade Organization. A similar challenge led to a rollback of tariffs imposed by President George W. Bush in 2002.\u201cIf global trade rules are not upheld, the E.U. will retaliate, but I cannot say now exactly how and when,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said. \u201cWe understand that the U.S. has concerns about overcapacity in China but we don\u2019t think this is the right way to go, as you cannot fight protectionism with protectionism,\u201d she added.But Mr. Trump has even contemplated pulling the United States out of the World Trade Organization itself.On climate, too, the United States \u2014 just a year ago a leading voice in favor of global action to reduce carbon emissions \u2014 is on its own path.Negotiators haggled late into Friday night over language declaring that 19 of the G-20 members consider the Paris accord \u201cirreversible,\u201d an effort to cast the United States as an outlier for jettisoning the pact while glossing over friction about the decision.But American officials were pressing language saying the United States would work with other nations to help them gain access to and use fossil fuels \u201cmore cleanly and efficiently.\u201d This suggestion met with stiff resistance from President Emmanuel Macron of France.Mr. Trump did little to paper over the disagreement, although his staff made sure that he did not have to listen to much criticism on climate change. His meeting with Mr. Putin was scheduled to begin just 15 minutes after the start of a G-20 working session on \u201cSustainable Growth, Climate, and Energy,\u201d so he left after making a brief statement on the matter.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, Peter S.

{"Headline": "Iran Dominates in Iraq After U.S. \u2018Handed the Country Over\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTehran's TurnBAGHDAD \u2014 Walk into almost any market in Iraq and the shelves are filled with goods from Iran \u2014 milk, yogurt, chicken. Turn on the television and channel after channel broadcasts programs sympathetic to Iran.A new building goes up? It is likely that the cement and bricks came from Iran. And when bored young Iraqi men take pills to get high, the illicit drugs are likely to have been smuggled across the porous Iranian border.And that\u2019s not even the half of it.Across the country, Iranian-sponsored militias are hard at work establishing a corridor to move men and guns to proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon. And in the halls of power in Baghdad, even the most senior Iraqi cabinet officials have been blessed, or bounced out, by Iran\u2019s leadership.When the United States invaded Iraq 14 years ago to topple Saddam Hussein, it saw Iraq as a potential cornerstone of a democratic and Western-facing Middle East, and vast amounts of blood and treasure \u2014 about 4,500 American lives lost, more than $1 trillion spent \u2014 were poured into the cause.From Day 1, Iran saw something else: a chance to make a client state of Iraq, a former enemy against which it fought a war in the 1980s so brutal, with chemical weapons and trench warfare, that historians look to World War I for analogies. If it succeeded, Iraq would never again pose a threat, and it could serve as a jumping-off point to spread Iranian influence around the region.In that contest, Iran won, and the United States lost.Over the past three years, Americans have focused on the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq, returning more than 5,000 troops to the country and helping to force the militants out of Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul.But Iran never lost sight of its mission: to dominate its neighbor so thoroughly that Iraq could never again endanger it militarily, and to use the country to effectively control a corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean.\u201cIranian influence is dominant,\u201d said Hoshyar Zebari, who was ousted last year as finance minister because, he said, Iran distrusted his links to the United States. \u201cIt is paramount.\u201dThe country\u2019s dominance over Iraq has heightened sectarian tensions around the region, with Sunni states, and American allies, like Saudi Arabia mobilizing to oppose Iranian expansionism. But Iraq is only part of Iran\u2019s expansion project; it has also used soft and hard power to extend its influence in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, and throughout the region.Iran is a Shiite state, and Iraq, a Shiite majority country, was ruled by an elite Sunni minority before the American invasion. The roots of the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, going back almost 1,400 years, lie in differences over the rightful leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. But these days, it is about geopolitics as much as religion, with the divide expressed by different states that are adversaries, led by Saudi Arabia on one side and Iran on the other.Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq is not just ascendant, but diverse, projecting into military, political, economic and cultural affairs.At some border posts in the south, Iraqi sovereignty is an afterthought. Busloads of young militia recruits cross into Iran without so much as a document check. They receive military training and are then flown to Syria, where they fight under the command of Iranian officers in defense of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Passing in the other direction, truck drivers pump Iranian products \u2014 food, household goods, illicit drugs \u2014 into what has become a vital and captive market.Iran tips the scales to its favor in every area of commerce. In the city of Najaf, it even picks up the trash, after the provincial council there awarded a municipal contract to a private Iranian company. One member of the council, Zuhair al-Jibouri, resorted to a now-common Iraqi aphorism: \u201cWe import apples from Iran so we can give them away to Iranian pilgrims.\u201dPolitically, Iran has a large number of allies in Iraq\u2019s Parliament who can help secure its goals. And its influence over the choice of interior minister, through a militia and political group the Iranians built up in the 1980s to oppose Mr. Hussein, has given it substantial control over that ministry and the federal police.Perhaps most crucial, Parliament passed a law last year that effectively made the constellation of Shiite militias a permanent fixture of Iraq\u2019s security forces. This ensures Iraqi funding for the groups while effectively maintaining Iran\u2019s control over some of the most powerful units.Now, with new parliamentary elections on the horizon, Shiite militias have begun organizing themselves politically for a contest that could secure even more dominance for Iran over Iraq\u2019s political system.To gain advantage on the airwaves, new television channels set up with Iranian money and linked to Shiite militias broadcast news coverage portraying Iran as Iraq\u2019s protector and the United States as a devious interloper.Partly in an effort to contain Iran, the United States has indicated that it will keep troops behind in Iraq after the battle against the Islamic State. American diplomats have worked to emphasize the government security forces\u2019 role in the fighting, and to shore up a prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, who has seemed more open to the United States than to Iran.But after the United States\u2019 abrupt withdrawal of troops in 2011, American constancy is still in question here \u2014 a broad failure of American foreign policy, with responsibility shared across three administrations.Iran has been playing a deeper game, parlaying extensive religious ties with Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority and a much wider network of local allies, as it makes the case that it is Iraq\u2019s only reliable defender.Iran\u2019s great project in eastern Iraq may not look like much: a 15-mile stretch of dusty road, mostly gravel, through desert and scrub near the border in Diyala Province.But it is an important new leg of Iran\u2019s path through Iraq to Syria, and what it carries \u2014 Shiite militiamen, Iranian delegations, trade goods and military supplies \u2014 is its most valuable feature.It is a piece of what analysts and Iranian officials say is Iran\u2019s most pressing ambition: to exploit the chaos of the region to project influence across Iraq and beyond. Eventually, analysts say, Iran could use the corridor, established on the ground through militias under its control, to ship weapons and supplies to proxies in Syria, where Iran is an important backer of Mr. Assad, and to Lebanon and its ally Hezbollah.At the border to the east is a new crossing built and secured by Iran. Like the relationship between the two countries, it is lopsided.The checkpoint\u2019s daily traffic includes up to 200 Iranian trucks, carrying fruit and yogurt, concrete and bricks, into Iraq. In the offices of Iraqi border guards, the candies and soda offered to guests come from Iran.No loaded trucks go the other way.\u201cIraq doesn\u2019t have anything to offer Iran,\u201d Vahid Gachi, the Iranian official in charge of the crossing, said in an interview in his office, as lines of tractor-trailers poured into Iraq. \u201cExcept for oil, Iraq relies on Iran for everything.\u201dThe border post is also a critical transit point for Iran\u2019s military leaders to send weapons and other supplies to proxies fighting the Islamic State in Iraq.After the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, swept across Diyala and neighboring areas in 2014, Iran made clearing the province, a diverse area of Sunnis and Shiites, a priority.It marshaled a huge force of Shiite militias, many trained in Iran and advised on the ground by Iranian officials. After a quick victory, Iranians and their militia allies set about securing their next interests here: marginalizing the province\u2019s Sunni minority and securing a path to Syria. Iran has fought aggressively to keep its ally Mr. Assad in power in order to retain land access to its most important spinoff in the region, Hezbollah, the military and political force that dominates Lebanon and threatens Israel.Uday al-Khadran, the Shiite mayor of Khalis District in Diyala, is a member of the Badr Organization, an Iraqi political party and militia established by Tehran in the 1980s to fight against Mr. Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war.On an afternoon earlier this year, he spread a map across his desk and proudly discussed how he helped build the road, which he said was ordered by General Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the branch of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps responsible for foreign operations. General Suleimani secretly directed Iran\u2019s policy in Iraq after the American invasion in 2003, and was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in attacks carried out by militias under his control.\u201cI love Qassim Suleimani more than my children,\u201d he said.Mr. Khadran said the general\u2019s new road would eventually be a shortcut for religious pilgrims from Iran to reach Samarra, Iraq, the location of an important shrine.But he also acknowledged the route\u2019s greater strategic significance as part of a corridor secured by Iranian proxies that extends across central and northern Iraq. The connecting series of roads skirts the western city of Mosul and stretches on to Tal Afar, an Islamic State-controlled city where Iranian-backed militias and Iranian advisers have set up a base at an airstrip on the outskirts.\u201cDiyala is the passage to Syria and Lebanon, and this is very important to Iran,\u201d said Ali al-Daini, the Sunni chairman of the provincial council there.Closer to Syria, Iranian-allied militias moved west of Mosul as the battle against the Islamic State unfolded there in recent months. The militias captured the town of Baaj, and then proceeded to the Syrian border, putting Iran on the cusp of completing its corridor.Back east, in Diyala, Mr. Daini said he had been powerless to halt what he described as Iran\u2019s dominance in the province.When Mr. Daini goes to work, he said, he has to walk by posters of Iran\u2019s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, outside the council building.Now, Diyala has become a showcase for how Iran views Shiite ascendancy as critical to its geopolitical goals.\u201cIran is smarter than America,\u201d said Nijat al-Taie, a Sunni member of the provincial council and an outspoken critic of Iran, which she calls the instigator of several assassination attempts against her. \u201cThey achieved their goals on the ground. America didn\u2019t protect Iraq. They just toppled the regime and handed the country over to Iran.\u201dThe lives of General Suleimani and other senior leaders in Tehran were shaped by the prolonged war with Iraq in the 1980s. The conflict left hundreds of thousands dead on both sides, and General Suleimani spent much of the war at the front, swiftly rising in rank as so many officers were killed.\u201cThe Iran-Iraq war was the formative experience for all of Iran\u2019s leaders,\u201d said Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization. \u201cFrom Suleimani all the way down. It was their \u2018never again\u2019 moment.\u201dA border dispute over the Shatt al Arab waterway that was a factor in the hostilities has still not been resolved, and the legacy of the war\u2019s brutality has influenced the Iranian government ever since, from its pursuit of nuclear weapons to its policy in Iraq.\u201cThis is a permanent scar in their mind,\u201d said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a lawmaker and former national security adviser. \u201cThey are obsessed with Baathism, Saddam and the Iran-Iraq war.\u201dMore than anything else, analysts say, it is the scarring legacy of that war that has driven Iranian ambitions to dominate Iraq.Particularly in southern Iraq, where the population is mostly Shiite, signs of Iranian influence are everywhere.Iranian-backed militias are the defenders of the Shiite shrines in the cities of Najaf and Karbala that drive trade and tourism. In local councils, Iranian-backed political parties have solid majorities, and campaign materials stress relationships with Shiite saints and Iranian clerics.If the Iraqi government were stronger, said Mustaq al-Abady, a businessman from just outside Najaf, \u201cthen maybe we could open our factories instead of going to Iran.\u201d He said his warehouse was crowded with Iranian imports because his government had done nothing to promote a private sector, police its borders or enforce customs duties.Raad Fadhil al-Alwani, a merchant in Hilla, another southern city, imports cleaning supplies and floor tiles from Iran. He slaps \u201cMade in Iraq\u201d labels in Arabic on bottles of detergent, but the reality is that he owns a factory in Iran because labor is cheaper there.\u201cI feel like I am destroying the economy of Iraq,\u201d he said. But he insists that Iraqi politicians, by deferring to Iranian pressure and refusing to support local industry, have made it hard to do anything else.Najaf attracts millions of Iranian pilgrims each year visiting the golden-domed shrine of Imam Ali, the first Shiite imam. Iranian construction workers \u2014 many of whom are viewed as Iranian spies by Iraqi officials \u2014 have also flocked to the city to renovate the shrine and build hotels.In Babil Province, according to local officials, militia leaders have taken over a government project to set up security cameras along strategic roads. The project had been granted to a Chinese company before the militias intervened, and now the army and the local police have been sidelined from it, said Muqdad Omran, an Iraqi Army captain in the area.Iran\u2019s pre-eminence in the Iraqi south has not come without resentment. Iraqi Shiites share a faith with Iran, but they also hold close their other identities as Iraqis and Arabs.\u201cIraq belongs to the Arab League, not to Iran,\u201d said Sheikh Fadhil al-Bidayri, a cleric at the religious seminary in Najaf. \u201cShiites are a majority in Iraq, but a minority in the world. As long as the Iranian government is controlling the Iraqi government, we don\u2019t have a chance.\u201dIn this region where the Islamic State\u2019s military threat has never encroached, Iran\u2019s security concerns are mostly being addressed by economic manipulation, Iraqi officials say. Trade in the south is often financed by Iran with credit, and incentives are offered to Iraqi traders to keep their cash in Iranian banks.\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the Iranians to maintain corruption in Iraq,\u201d he said.For decades, Iran smuggled guns and bomb-making supplies through the vast swamps of southern Iraq. And young men were brought back and forth across the border, from one safe house to another \u2014 recruits going to Iran for training, and then back to Iraq to fight. At first the enemy was Mr. Hussein; later, it was the Americans.Today, agents of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards openly recruit fighters in the Shiite-majority cities of southern Iraq. Buses filled with recruits easily pass border posts that officials say are essentially controlled by Iran \u2014 through its proxies on the Iraqi side, and its own border guards on the other.While Iran has built up militias to fight against the Islamic State in Iraq, it has also mobilized an army of disaffected young Shiite Iraqi men to fight on its behalf in Syria.Mohammad Kadhim, 31, is one of those foot soldiers for Iran, having served three tours in Syria. The recruiting pitch, he said, is mostly based in faith, to defend Shiite shrines in Syria. But Mr. Kadhim said he and his friends signed up more out of a need for jobs.\u201cI was just looking for money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the youth I met fighting in Syria do it for the money.\u201dHe signed up with a Revolutionary Guards recruiter in Najaf, and then was bused through southern Iraq and into Iran, where he underwent military training near Tehran.There, he said, Iranian officers delivered speeches invoking the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the revered seventh-century Shiite figure whose death at the hands of a powerful Sunni army became the event around which Shiite spirituality would revolve. The same enemies of the Shiites who killed the imam are now in Syria and Iraq, the officers told the men.After traveling to Iran, Mr. Kadhim came home for a break and then was shipped to Syria, where Hezbollah operatives trained him in sniper tactics.Iran\u2019s emphasis on defending the Shiite faith has led some here to conclude that its ultimate goal is to bring about an Iranian-style theocracy in Iraq. But there is a persistent sense that it just would not work in Iraq, which has a much larger native Sunni population and tradition, and Iraq\u2019s clerics in Najaf, including Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the world\u2019s pre-eminent Shiite spiritual leader, oppose the Iranian system.But Iran is taking steps to translate militia power into political power, much as it did with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and militia leaders have begun political organizing before next year\u2019s parliamentary elections.In April, Qais al-Khazali, a Shiite militia leader, delivered a speech to an audience of Iraqi college students, railing against the United States and the nefarious plotting of Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Then, a poet who was part of Mr. Khazali\u2019s entourage stood up and began praising General Suleimani.For the students, that was the last straw. Chants of \u201cIran out! Iran out!\u201d began. Scuffles broke out between students and Mr. Khazali\u2019s bodyguards, who fired their rifles into the air just outside the building.\u201cThe thing that really provoked us was the poet,\u201d said Mustafa Kamal, a student at the University of al-Qadisiya in Diwaniya, in southern Iraq, who participated in the protest.Mr. Kamal and his fellow students quickly learned how dangerous it could be to stand up to Iran these days.First, militiamen began threatening to haul them off. Then media outlets linked to the militias went after them, posting their pictures and calling them Baathists and enemies of Shiites. When a mysterious car appeared near Mr. Kamal\u2019s house, his mother panicked that militiamen were coming for her son.Then, finally, Mr. Kamal, a law student, and three of his friends received notices from the school saying they had been suspended for a year.\u201cWe thought we had only one hope, the university,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then Iran also interfered there.\u201dMr. Khazali, whose political and militia organization, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, is deeply connected with Iran, has been on a speaking tour on campuses across Iraq as part of an effort to organize political support for next year\u2019s national election. This has raised fears that Iran is trying not only to deepen its influence within Iraqi education, but also to transform militias into outright political and social organizations, much as it did with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201cIt\u2019s another type of Iranian infiltration and the expansion of Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d said Beriwan Khailany, a lawmaker and member of Parliament\u2019s higher-education committee. \u201cIran wants to control the youth, and to teach them the Iranian beliefs, through Iraqis who are loyal to Iran.\u201dWhen a group of Qatari falcon hunters, \u201cincluding members of the royal family, were kidnapped in 2015 while on safari in the southern deserts of Iraq, Qatar called Iran and its militia allies \u2014 not the central government in Baghdad.For Mr. Abadi, the prime minister, the episode was an embarrassing demonstration of his government\u2019s weakness at the hands of Iran, whose proxy militia Kataibb Hezbollah was believed to be behind the kidnapping.So when the hostage negotiations were about to end, Mr. Abadi pushed back.Around noon on a day in April, a government jet from Qatar landed in Baghdad, carrying a delegation of diplomats and 500 million euros stuffed into 23 black boxes.The hunters were soon on their way home, but the ransom did not go to the Iranian-backed militiamen who had abducted the Qataris; the cash ended up in a central bank vault in Baghdad.The seizure of the money had been ordered by Mr. Abadi, who was furious at the prospect of militias, and their Iranian and Hezbollah benefactors, being paid so richly right under the Iraqi government\u2019s nose.\u201cHundreds of millions to armed groups?\u201d Mr. Abadi said in a public rant. \u201cIs this acceptable?\u201dIn Iraq, the kidnapping episode was seen as a violation of the country\u2019s sovereignty and emblematic of Iran\u2019s suffocating power over the Iraqi state.In a post on Twitter, Mr. Zebari, the former finance minister, who was previously foreign minister, called the episode a \u201ctravesty.\u201dMr. Zebari knows firsthand the power of Iran over the Iraqi state.Last year, he said, he was ousted as finance minister because Iran perceived him as being too close to the United States. The account was verified by a member of Parliament who was involved in the removal of Mr. Zebari, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Iran.Mr. Zebari, who recounted the events in an interview from his mountainside mansion in northern Iraq, said that when President Barack Obama met with Mr. Abadi last September at the United Nations, the American leader personally lobbied to save Mr. Zebari\u2019s job. Even that was not enough.Mr. Abadi now finds himself in a difficult position. If he makes any move that can be seen as confrontational toward Iran, or as positioning himself closer to the United States, it could place a cloud over his political future.\u201cHe had two options: to be with the Americans or with the Iranians,\u201d said Izzat Shahbander, a prominent Iraqi Shiite leader who once lived in exile in Iran while Mr. Hussein was in power. \u201cAnd he chose to be with the Americans.\u201dMr. Abadi, who took office in 2014 with the support of both the United States and Iran, has seemed more emboldened to push back against Iranian pressure since President Trump took office.Some are seeing an American troop commitment as a chance to revisit the 2011 withdrawal of United States forces that seemingly opened a door for Iran.When American officials in Iraq began the slow wind-down of the military mission there, in 2009, some diplomats in Baghdad were cautiously celebrating one achievement: Iran seemed to be on its heels, its influence in the country waning.\u201cOver the last year, Iran has lost the strategic initiative in Iraq,\u201d one diplomat wrote in a cable, later released by WikiLeaks.But other cables sent warnings back to Washington that were frequently voiced by Iraqi officials they spoke to: that if the Americans left, then Iran would fill the vacuum.Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, said that if the United States left again after the Islamic State was defeated, \u201cit would be effectively just giving the Iranians a free rein.\u201dBut many Iraqis say the Iranians already have free rein. And while the Trump administration has indicated that it will pay closer attention to Iraq as a means to counter Iran, the question is whether it is too late.\u201cIran is not going to sit silent and do nothing,\u201d said Sami al-Askari, a senior Shiite politician who has good relationships with both the Iranians and Americans. \u201cThey have many means. Frankly, the Americans can\u2019t do anything.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted Ali Vaez, an analyst at the International Crisis Group. He described the Iran-Iraq war as \u201cthe formative experience for all of Iran\u2019s leaders,\u201d not \u201cthe formidable experience.\u201dFalih Hassan and Omar al-Jawoshy contributed reporting from Baghdad, and employees of The New York Times from Diyala Province, Hilla and Najaf.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Thoreau\u2019s 200th Birthday, a New Biography Pictures Him as a Man of Principle", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.More than 50 years have passed since the publication of the last major biography of the iconic American author, naturalist, philosopher and social activist Henry David Thoreau, and this superb new book could not have come at a better time.The author of \u201cWalden\u201d \u2014 an account of living for two years, two months and two days on the shores of Walden Pond in Concord, Mass. \u2014 was a mid-19th-century visionary besotted with the wonders of the natural world. Thoreau laid the groundwork for a field that would come to be known as ecology. He was one of the first advocates for the establishment of a system of national parks. He was a passionate champion of the ethical treatment of all living things and embraced the tenets of Eastern religion, incurring the wrath of fundamentalists who accused him of blasphemy.And he was a man devoted to science who compiled 12 volumes of notes on the Native Americans of the northeastern United States, faithfully chronicled the dates of the flowering of plants (an important record today as the climate changes) and performed groundbreaking research into the succession of trees in burned and logged forests. Asked once why he was so eternally curious about things, Thoreau responded, \u201cWhat else is there in life?\u201dLaura Dassow Walls\u2019s exuberant biography, \u201cHenry David Thoreau: A Life,\u201d leaves the reader in no doubt how Thoreau might react to the current administration in Washington, filled as it is with people who deny the established physical science of global warming. Thoreau would pick up his pen to skewer them mercilessly, and \u2014 practicing what he preached in his essay \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d \u2014 would probably take to the streets in protest. Born 200 years ago today, Thoreau, like his fellow Transcendentalists, propounded the philosophy of living \u201cdeliberately,\u201d by which they meant weighing the moral consequences of one\u2019s actions. We can easily imagine, then, what Thoreau might have to say about those who worship at the altar of fossil fuels, given the indisputable evidence that their combustion is now beginning to disrupt the stability of the climate and the very rhythm of the seasons.Walls, the William P. and Hazel B. White professor of English at Notre Dame, paints a moving portrait of a brilliant, complex man. As she painstakingly demonstrates, Thoreau \u2014 who never married (\u201cAll nature is my bride\u201d) and who died at the age of 44 \u2014 was anything but the recluse that some have made him out to be. He was a key member of the vibrant intellectual community of Concord and played an important public role in some of the great events of his time, notably the fight to abolish slavery.One of the many pleasures of Walls\u2019s book is how it transports us back to America in the first half of the 19th century, a time when remnants of Native American culture still existed in the Northeast, when New England\u2019s forests were being destroyed and its rivers dammed (shall we \u201cgrub up\u201d all our \u201cnational domains,\u201d Thoreau asked) and when death from all manner of disease was ever-present. Born in Concord to a freethinking mother and a father who eventually became a prosperous pencil manufacturer, Thoreau entered Harvard as a retiring boy of 16 and emerged as a budding intellectual who read at least five languages. Returning to Concord, he came under the sway of the poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, the founder of Transcendentalism, who believed that each individual contained a divine spark and had a responsibility to cultivate the higher aspects of his or her nature. Emerson urged Thoreau to seek solitude and keep a journal, and so the young man did, eventually writing more than two million words in his diaries, books, reports and articles.He and his beloved older brother, John, founded an academy that was a notable early experiment in American education \u2014 a school that rejected corporal punishment and sought to teach not by rote but by igniting a student\u2019s own love of learning. But it was John\u2019s agonizing death at 26 \u2014 he contracted tetanus after slicing off a tiny piece of a finger while stropping a razor \u2014 that set Thoreau on the path that eventually led him to Walden Pond.In his mid-20s, Thoreau \u2014 who worked periodically as a surveyor \u2014 enjoyed limited success publishing articles, some of them based on his travels in Maine and Massachusetts. These pieces were the start of a body of work that would make Thoreau a pioneer in what today is called nature writing. But he longed to be a pioneer of a different sort, Walls writes, \u201cnot a Western one, but an inward one.\u201dAnd so, seeking to \u201csimplify, simplify,\u201d he repaired to the shores of Walden Pond, where he built a one-room structure measuring 10 feet by 15 feet by 8 feet. On July 4, 1845, just shy of his 28th birthday, Thoreau moved in, opening his journal with the line, \u201cYesterday I came here to live.\u201dThese words laid the groundwork for an American masterpiece, one in which Thoreau revels in the wonders of nature, his book echoing a theme he had sounded in an earlier work: \u201cSurely joy is the condition of life!\u201d Walls deftly sketches how Thoreau lived anything but a monastic life at Walden, noting that his cabin was in sight of the main road, that he entertained many guests, that trains regularly rumbled past on the new rail line to Boston and that he took dinner with his family once a week. Indeed, Walls writes, Thoreau was so much in the public eye at Walden that his retreat there \u201cwould forever remain an iconic work of performance art.\u201d Thoreau continued to write and lecture after he left Walden Pond. He and his family were active in the abolitionist movement, their home a stop on the Underground Railroad. Thoreau refused to pay a poll tax and spent a night in jail because he believed the tax funded the state-sponsored violence of slavery and the mistreatment of Mexicans and Native Americans. \u201cLet your life,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbe a counter-friction to stop the machine.\u201d Witnessing the widespread destruction of nature as America\u2019s industrial economy boomed, Thoreau lamented, \u201cTrade curses everything it handles.\u201d \u201cWalden\u201d was published in 1854, and though it received generally favorable reviews, only about 2,000 copies of the book were sold during Thoreau\u2019s lifetime. Indeed, he never enjoyed widespread popular or commercial success while he was alive. But he carried on, optimistic until the end, always remaining deeply rooted in Concord, Walden Pond and the surrounding woods that were not under assault. Thoreau needed nature as he did oxygen itself; in a book he was preparing for publication as he succumbed to tuberculosis, he wrote, \u201cIn wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201dHe died with great equanimity. When asked by an aunt if he had made peace with God, Thoreau replied, \u201cI did not know we had ever quarreled.\u201dThe day before his death, Thoreau was visited by an old friend, who mentioned that he\u2019d heard robins singing on his way there. In a whisper, Thoreau replied: \u201cThis is a beautiful world, but soon I shall see one that is fairer. I have so loved nature.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kasich: The Way Forward on Health Care", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Washington\u2019s approach to health care over the past decade is yet another example of our lawmakers\u2019 increasing distance from the rest of America. First one party rams through a rigid, convoluted plan that drives up costs though unsustainable mechanisms that are now unraveling. Then the other party pursues fixes that go too far the other way \u2014 and again ignores ideas from the other side.Neither extreme is cutting it, and the quick opposition that doomed the Senate plan reflects how unacceptable its ideas are to so many. The American people want and deserve reasonable, balanced, sustainable health care so that they can live without the fear of bankruptcy if they get sick, our most vulnerable neighbors are treated with compassion and those who seek to improve their lives can get healthy, confront addiction and get work.Despite weeks of hard effort, the Senate plan was rejected by governors in both parties because of its unsustainable reductions to Medicaid. Cutting these funds without giving states the flexibility to innovate and manage those cuts is a serious blow to states\u2019 fiscal health at a time when most \u2014 Ohio included \u2014 are feeling headwinds from a softening national economy. And, unlike the federal government, states must balance their budgets. Particularly problematic was the bill\u2019s failure to adequately meet addiction and mental health needs \u2014 which often occur together. Diverting funds away from the comprehensive, integrated physical and mental health care that is proving effective is a step backward.The Senate plan also failed to repair Obamacare\u2019s damage to the insurance markets. Insufficient tax credits would make coverage unaffordable for many lower income Americans: Two of the subsidies in the bill would be temporary and a third would likely be unsustainably underfunded. Congress should avoid doing anything likely to cause further instability in the huge and complex private insurance market.In the uncertainty created by the Senate plan\u2019s collapse, Congress should guard against a hasty next step. Just taking up the fatally flawed House plan is not an answer, and this idea should be immediately rejected for the same reasons senators rejected the Senate\u2019s own proposal. Also, simply repealing Obamacare without having a workable replacement is just as bad. Both would simply yank health coverage out from under millions of Americans who have no other alternative.After two failed attempts at reform, the next step is clear: Congress should first focus on fixing the Obamacare exchanges before it takes on Medicaid. If we want to move Americans off Medicaid, there must be somewhere stable for them to go. For all its faults, at least Medicaid is currently a stable system for those who need it. The exchanges are anything but, and need immediate improvements.One vital improvement would be to provide adequate tax credits, which would help keep health plans in the individual market and encourage \u2014 not undermine \u2014 robust competition. Companies should also be required to continue following reasonable guardrails like ensuring minimum coverage that is genuinely useful and covers pre-existing conditions. Once we see these repairs taking hold, Congress should then take up needed improvements to Medicaid as part of comprehensive entitlement reform.States are willing to assume greater financial risk by transitioning to a block grant or per-capita cap, but will also need new flexibilities, such as tools to manage the rising cost of pharmaceuticals \u2014 the fastest growing component of Medicaid. And states cannot expect the federal government to continue paying 90 percent of Medicaid expansion costs given our nation\u2019s historic debt; they must accept a gradual return to traditional cost-sharing levels.Finally, we can never truly fix the rising cost of health care unless we start paying for value rather than volume. We are making this transition in Ohio by paying physicians for providing better care, not simply more care, in order to pursue better health outcomes.In resetting health care reform in these ways \u2014 and I don\u2019t rule out that other, balanced approaches bear consideration also \u2014 Congress can surmount the fatal flaws of both Obamacare and the current approaches: the reflection of a single partisan point of view. Health care policy is only partisan in the abstract. When you or your loved one is sick and needs care, ideology is irrelevant; getting well is all that matters. That same common sense must be reflected in the way we fix Obamacare. Another one-sided plan, driven hard by one party against the wishes of another, can never succeed because it will essentially maintain the status quo: partisan opposition and no real solutions.The best next step is for members of both parties to ignore the fear of criticism that can come from reaching across the aisle and put pencil to pad on these and other ideas that repair health care in real, sustainable ways. America needs it, and I know that a bipartisan group of governors, including myself, stands ready to help in any way we can to provide an affordable, sustainable and responsible system of health care for the American people.John Kasich is the Republican governor of Ohio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain Aggressively Courts $2 Trillion Saudi Aramco Listing", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 London and New York have been battling for months over what could be the biggest public offering in history, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state energy company Saudi Aramco.Britain looks to be working hard to land it, with regulators unveiling proposals on Thursday that aim to make it easier for state-owned companies to list on the London Stock Exchange.Saudi Arabia wants to list 5 percent of Aramco, at a valuation of around $2 trillion, a blockbuster listing that has set stock exchanges around the world competing against one another. Analysts say the final decision is likely to come down to London and New York.The fight for Saudi Aramco\u2019s listing is well underway.The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed creating a new category of premium listings specifically geared toward state-owned companies.The bottom line: Any interaction between public sector firms and the sovereigns that control them will not require approval by other shareholders.\u201cSovereign owners are different from private sector individuals or companies \u2014 both in their motivations and in their nature,\u201d Andrew Bailey, the conduct authority\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cInvestors have long recognized this, and capital markets are well adapted to assess the treatment of other investors by sovereign countries.\u201dThe regulator has called for feedback, before issuing more detailed proposals.Ultimately, though, it will all depend on confidence in Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and the kingdom\u2019s stability. Investors considering purchases of Aramco shares will need to take into account how closely intertwined the company is with the government\u2019s economic and political strategies.For instance, Aramco sells all of the natural gas it produces to domestic customers at below market prices that underpin the country\u2019s industrial base.The price of oil is crucial because it is a critical variable in determining the value of future Saudi cash flows.Riyadh had been keeping production high to squeeze out lower-cost oil producers. But some analysts believe the kingdom agreed to trim production late last year not just to lift oil prices but also because of worries that a low price would affect the I.P.O. valuation. In a worst-case scenario, sustained low prices could force Saudi Arabia to postpone, or even abandon, the public offering.Investors might recognize this problem and lower their calculations of the value of Aramco\u2019s cash flows, according to Mr. Fattouh, who is close to the Saudi energy leadership.Listing in New York would give Saudi Aramco access to what is seen as the biggest market in the world, with the investor capital available to support trading in such a huge company.Debuting on the New York Stock Exchange also carries with it the prestige of a listing on the Big Board, and market debutantes still ring the bell on their first day of trading.But concerns remain about a New York listing.Shareholders in American companies also frequently file lawsuits against companies for perceived regulatory violations.For now, nothing has been announced.Much still remains unresolved \u2014 the listing is not expected before next year, and the company has not yet chosen all of its bankers.It is worth noting that Saudi Aramco is likely to be listed on its home country\u2019s exchange, the Tadawul. But the kingdom is still deciding between London and New York.The New York Stock Exchange had reportedly been favored for its deeper pool of available capital and its prestige.Whether the proposals announced in Britain on Thursday sway Aramco, though, is so far unclear.Advertisement"}

They include fierce critics of European integration, like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, and pro-European politicians, such as Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister.Negative publicity surrounding the European Union \u2014 much of it inflated or plain erroneous \u2014 helped its critics to persuade Britons to vote in a referendum last year to leave.But the decision appears to have united the 27 other member states and helped to stabilize the European project.It would be a further irony if Britain\u2019s departure were to help heal the running sore about Strasbourg\u2019s role.\u201cIt is one of the few positive things in an otherwise lose-lose \u2018Brexit\u2019 situation,\u201d said Ms. Corazza Bildt, of the possibilities now opening up. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a symbol of peace to become a symbol of waste,\u201d she added.Her comments highlight the extent to which the Parliament\u2019s seat in Strasbourg has become associated with the most idealistic and the most extravagant facets of the European Union.To many in France and Germany, the location in a city once fought over regularly by their two nations is a physical symbol of the reconciliation that European integration was intended to foster.Moving the Parliament to Strasbourg full-time would be difficult because other European bodies that the lawmakers scrutinize are in Brussels.For the situation to change, several obstacles would have to be overcome.The French government maneuvered in 1992 to enshrine the monthly plenary sessions in Strasbourg in European Union treaties, and there can be no change without Paris\u2019s approval.France has resisted every previous attempt to amend the rules, and last week Nathalie Loiseau, a French minister for European affairs, told reporters that there was \u201cno ambiguity\u201d over her country\u2019s support for Strasbourg as the Parliament\u2019s seat.However, Ms. Corazza Bildt believes that Mr. Macron, an advocate of modernization, might be persuadable. One possibility might be to offer France not only the medicines agency, but also something of greater political significance \u2014 perhaps a new military planning headquarters, or the right to host occasional European Union summit meetings.\u201cThe ball is in the court of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e,\u201d she said, referring to the French president\u2019s office. \u201cThe decision belongs to France, what we are asking for is dialogue.\u201dFor the city of Strasbourg, there could be benefits. The Parliament brings visitors to the city for only a few days every month, requiring large numbers of hotel rooms and taxis that are not needed for much of the rest of the year.By contrast, the European Medicines Agency, which oversees the approval of drugs across Europe in much the same way that the Food and Drug Administration does in the United States, has around 890 staff members and hosts a steady stream of meetings of experts. On most weekdays, those activities fill around 350 London hotel rooms.For the medicines agency, relocating to Strasbourg could complicate life because the city\u2019s transport links are poorer than those of London. (Members of the European Parliament have managed there for decades, of course, albeit while often grumbling.)That included \u201cthe availability, frequency and duration of flight connections from the capitals of all E.U. member states to the airports close to the location; the availability, frequency and duration of public transportation connections from these airports to the location; as well as the quality and quantity of accommodation facilities.\u201dOther national governments have their eyes on the medicines agency, too. Several cities have made clear their desire to host it, with formal submissions requested by the end of the month and a decision expected by the end of the year.And few things energize European leaders as much as the competition to host agencies, which bring both prestige and cash for local economies.In 2001, Silvio Berlusconi, then the prime minister of Italy, blocked plans to locate the European Food Safety Authority in Finland, while promoting an alternative site in the Italian city of Parma. He told fellow leaders: \u201cParma is synonymous with good cuisine. The Finns don\u2019t even know what prosciutto is.\u201dA photograph with an earlier version of this article, using information from Agence France-Presse, was published in error.

{"Headline": "When Will Electric Cars Go Mainstream? It May Be Sooner Than You Think", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the world\u2019s automakers place larger bets on electric vehicle technology, many industry analysts are debating a key question: How quickly can plug-in cars become mainstream?The conventional view holds that electric cars will remain a niche product for many years, plagued by high sticker prices and heavily dependent on government subsidies.Between 2025 and 2030, the group predicts, plug-in vehicles will become cost competitive with traditional petroleum-powered cars, even without subsidies and even before taking fuel savings into account. Once that happens, mass adoption should quickly follow.\u201cOur forecast doesn\u2019t hinge on countries adopting stringent new fuel standards or climate policies,\u201d said Colin McKerracher, the head of advanced transport analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic analysis, looking at what happens when the upfront cost of electric vehicles reaches parity. That\u2019s when the real shift occurs.\u201dIf that prediction pans out, it will have enormous consequences for the auto industry, oil markets and the world\u2019s efforts to slow global warming.The Bloomberg forecast is far more aggressive, projecting that plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles will make up 54 percent of new light-duty sales globally by 2040, outselling their combustion engine counterparts.The reason? Batteries. Since 2010, the average cost of lithium-ion battery packs has plunged by two-thirds, to around $300 per kilowatt-hour. The Bloomberg report sees that falling to $73 by 2030, without any significant technological breakthroughs, as companies like Tesla increase battery production in massive factories, optimize the design of battery packs and improve chemistries.For the next decade, the report notes, electric cars will remain reliant on government incentives and sales mandates in places like Europe, China and California. But as automakers introduce a greater variety of models and lower costs, electric cars will reach a point where they can stand on their own.\u201cBut we tried to be fairly conservative in our estimate of where battery prices are going,\u201d Mr. McKerracher said, \u201cand we don\u2019t see barriers to electric vehicles\u2019 becoming cost competitive very soon.\u201dOther experts caution that falling battery costs are not the only factor in determining whether electric cars become widespread. Sam Ori, the executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, noted, \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy cars based solely on the price tag.\u201dMany owners charge their cars overnight in their garages, but that is much harder for people living in cities who park their cars on the street.As a result, the Bloomberg report warns that plug-in vehicles may have a difficult time making inroads in dense urban areas and that infrastructure bottlenecks may slow the growth of electric vehicles after 2040.Another potential hurdle may be the automakers themselves. While most manufacturers are introducing plug-in models in the United States to comply with stricter fuel-economy standards, they do not always market them aggressively, said Chelsea Sexton, an auto industry consultant who worked on General Motors\u2019 electric vehicle program in the 1990s.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of announcements about electric vehicles, but that doesn\u2019t matter much if automakers are just building these cars for compliance and are unenthusiastic about actually marketing them,\u201d Ms. Sexton said.Yet the Bloomberg report also shows how much further countries would need to go to cut transportation emissions.Even with a sharp rise in electric vehicles, the world would still have more traditional petroleum-powered passenger vehicles on the road in 2040 than it does today, and it will take many years to retire existing fleets. And other modes of transportation, like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, will remain stubbornly difficult to electrify without drastic advances in battery technology.Which means it is still too soon to write an obituary for the internal combustion engine.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We Shouldn\u2019t Think About College as a Business", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe conventionally think of college as a place where you can discover new ideas, indulge curiosities and learn for the sake of learning. As tuition skyrockets and becomes less accessible for everyone, however, students have been compelled to think of college from a business perspective instead. In the 2010s, much of the discussion surrounding higher education is less about education and more about its suitability as an investment, like real estate or publicly traded stock.While there are conflicting opinions on the cause of rising tuition, students are relying on loans now more than ever to fund their education, leading student debt in the United States to top $1 trillion.\u201cIn absolute dollars, the price of college has increased by 1,120 percent since 1978, more than any other good or service in the entire U.S. economy,\u201d said the filmmaker Andrew Rossi, who directed the student debt documentary \u201cIvory Tower.\u201d \u201cThe entire model of American higher education is predicated on a constantly expanding cost structure which has resulted in a broader cultural transition from viewing college as a public good to a private benefit pursued by students and parents as consumers.\u201dIn her book, Ms. Wapnick writes about a concept called multipotentiality, the ability to excel in multiple fields that are typically unrelated to each other. Multipotentiality has a handful of practical benefits. For example, learning skills in one area can translate to skills in another.\u201cIn university, I took film classes, philosophy classes, geology classes, music classes,\u201d Ms. Wapnick said. \u201cI was exposed to so many new ideas, which was in and of itself great. But many of the skills I acquired in these classes also ended up being useful in real, albeit unexpected, ways. The improvisation skills I learned in a music class ended up being useful years later when giving presentations. And the legal classes I took made me a more persuasive writer.\u201dPsychologists refer to this learning style as broad learning. As children, and even in college, we\u2019re encouraged to embrace many different subjects, immerse ourselves in them and explore. This is in contrast to specialized learning, which \u201crefers to tailored learning for a specific purpose, such as for a particular job,\u201d said Rachel Wu, a professor and researcher at the University of California, Riverside.\u201cUndergraduates often have to take general or breadth classes, which serve the purpose of allowing for broad learning,\u201d Dr. Wu said. \u201cUniversities typically try to strike a balance between helping the student hone some skills in a particular area, while encouraging the student to take classes outside of their major.\u201dWe gradually switch from broad learning to specialized learning in our 20s as we home in on a specialty, then pick a job and adopt a special set of skills, Dr. Wu said. But when students are forced to see college as a means to an end, they potentially switch from broad learning to a specialized learning mind-set even sooner.In a paper recently published in Human Development, Dr. Wu theorizes that this switch from broad to specialized learning plays a role in cognitive function. In other words, specialized learning might lead to cognitive decline as we age \u2014 the feeling that you\u2019re just \u201cnot as sharp\u201d as you used to be.\u201cAccording to my new theory, specialized learning encourages efficiency in the short term,\u201d Dr. Wu said. \u201cTo be efficient in the short term, we have to prioritize what we already know. When we prioritize what we already know for a long time, we may have more difficulty adapting to new unfamiliar situations. And this difficulty in adapting to new situations may lead to decline first in unfamiliar situations, and eventually in familiar situations.\u201dDr. Wu and her colleagues theorize that in both children and adults, broad learning increase abilities like working memory, inhibition and attention. When higher education becomes less about learning and more about specializing, finding a major and picking a job, we may miss out on the benefits of broad learning.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to deepen our existing knowledge rather than develop new skills or consider how disparate ideas relate to one another,\u201d Ms. Wapnick said. \u201cThis can lead to a sense of boredom and dissatisfaction. It also stifles healthy interdisciplinary dialogue that fuels innovation.\u201dDespite the specialized focus in higher education, it\u2019s possible to embrace broad learning at any age. This can be as simple as picking up a hobby or a personal project in your spare time. If you\u2019re a student, it might be as simple as joining a campus group unrelated to your major.\u201cI think we sometimes forget that activities don\u2019t have to be profitable to be valuable,\u201d Ms. Wapnick said. \u201cLearning enriches our lives and allows us to look at the world and our work from new angles. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone who is yearning to broaden your focus, set some time aside to try a new activity, start a personal project or take a class.\u201dBroad learning focuses on new, unfamiliar subjects and the ability to develop new skills and abilities with effort. It also emphasizes learning these skills simultaneously and in a forgiving environment, meaning you\u2019re encouraged to make mistakes, fail, then learn from those mistakes. In short, it\u2019s learning for the sake of learning. So approaching new subjects with this mind-set will help.\u201cAt the very least, keeping an open mind about learning new information probably will always be beneficial,\u201d Dr. Wu said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Lofty Versailles Speech, Macron Tells the French to Prepare for Change", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Declaring that citizens had an \u201coverwhelming thirst for renewal,\u201d President Emmanuel Macron urged France\u2019s legislators in a speech on Monday to live up to the \u201cgravity of the circumstances,\u201d warning against the fear and cynicism wrought by poverty, terrorism, new forms of labor and ecological change.The new president cast himself both as the agent of change France wanted and as his country\u2019s rampart against a newly uncertain world order.He gave a lofty outline of his five-year term, setting a tone but largely eschewing specifics.Instead, the president reverted to campaign mode: an extended, high-flown discourse centered largely on the ordinary citizen\u2019s almost mystical relationship to political power. That relationship had been damaged, he suggested.Along the way he ranged widely, with morale-boosting praise for France\u2019s cultural heritage, a plea for \u201chumane and just\u201d treatment of refugees, demands for a less technocratic European Union, and a semidisguised dig at the United States under President Trump when he warned against those \u201cdemocracies, longtime allies, now menacing the established order.\u201dBy the standards of American speechmaking, it was abstract. But Mr. Macron was making a point: French citizens were demanding change after years of stagnation, change was needed and he was the man to bring it about.\u201cIt\u2019s about nothing less than reweaving, between French citizens and the republic, the relationship that has dissolved under the mechanical exercise of power,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\u201cA contractual relationship,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom efficiency, representativity and responsibility, I want the emergence of a contractual republic.\u201d\u201cOur democracy can only be nourished in action, and in our ability to change what is everyday, and real,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t five years of adjustments and half-measures that we have in front of us,\u201d Mr. Macron said. The French were \u201cexpecting a profound transformation.\u201dFor a start, he proposed shrinking by a third the body that was listening to him, France\u2019s plethoric Parliament of over 900 members. Then, he told the lawmakers that they had to legislate less.\u201cLet\u2019s try to put an end to the proliferation of legislation,\u201d he said \u2014 which was not consistent with the rapidly changing economy and society that confronts France.That plea was consistent with the disdain Mr. Macron has shown from the beginning for the world of conventional French politics.\u201cThe French people have shown their impatience with a political world made up of sterile quarrels and hollow ambitions in which we have lived up until now,\u201d he said on Monday.Polls show the French are now more optimistic than they have been in some years. Mr. Macron aimed to encourage this optimism about the future on Monday.He called for France to become \u201cthe center of a new humanist project for the world,\u201d telling citizens to beware \u201cthe cynicism that lies dormant in all of us.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnd it is within each one of us that we must shut it up, day after day.\u201dHe got in a dig at the French news media, which he has largely shunned since his election, calling for \u201can end to these manhunts,\u201d the \u201cincessant search for scandal\u201d and a \u201cfrenzy that is unworthy of us\u201d \u2014 and that has already cost him several ministers, tainted by potential financial misdeeds.The Versailles speech was boycotted by members of Parliament on the far left, already taking up arms against Mr. Macron over his plans to overhaul France\u2019s labor codes, and already casting the new president as the destroyer of the nation\u2019s social protections. He touched only briefly on his labor overhaul plans on Monday.But unusually for a French politician, he warned against the encroachments of the welfare state on the citizens\u2019 sense of personal responsibility.Mr. Macron has been criticized \u2014 most recently over the weekend \u2014 for slighting references to the less fortunate in French society, and to those who are not economically successful. That criticism did not appear to faze him in Monday\u2019s speech.\u201cProtecting the weakest\u201d should not make of them \u201cpermanent wards of the state,\u201d he said.\u201cCertainly, we\u2019ve got to recognize the essential role of public service, and of our civil servants,\u201d he said. \u201cBut protecting the weakest doesn\u2019t mean transforming them into helpless minors,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery French person has a responsibility and a role to play in the conquests to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back in Afghan Hot Spot, U.S. Marines Chase Diminished Goals", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMP SHORAB, Afghanistan \u2014 The last time American Marines were in Helmand Province, they had a sweeping mission and the resources to carry it out.Tens of thousands of Marines flooded the southern villages here, and they had tens of millions of dollars in cash to throw into projects that would bolster local support. They spearheaded some of the bloodiest battles of this long war, losing 349 dead in the process, but they succeeded in turning much of what had been prime Taliban and opium territory over to the Afghan government.After days of traveling and talking with Marines and their Afghan allies, it is clear there is little glory. Instead, the new mission is a treacherous grind in temperatures well over 100 degrees \u2014 described as a \u201chair dryer in your face\u201d \u2014 to achieve expectations lowered to the most basic.The mission is no longer about complete control of Helmand. Old efforts to establish local governance and rule of law here have so clearly failed that they are no longer in the picture. The Marines are simply trying to keep Lashkar Gah from falling to the Taliban, and to help the Afghan forces come out of their barracks and put up a fight.There is no withdrawal deadline this time, and no clearly defined strategy to end the war \u2014 other than hoping to persuade the Taliban to give up and eventually talk of peace.As the Pentagon has drawn up its plans, its leaders have studiously refused to talk about timetables. To describe how long this new mission may take, in a war that has already stretched over nearly 16 years, the Marines in Helmand repeatedly referred to American efforts in Germany and Japan after World War II.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who visited Helmand for a couple of hours last month, put it more simply: \u201cWe are staying.\u201dTask Force Southwest, consisting of about 300 Marines and some sailors, has taken up quarters in a corner of what had been a British base and is now the headquarters of the Afghan Army\u2019s 215th Corps.Many of the senior American officers have served in Helmand before.The last time Brig. Gen. Roger B. Turner Jr., the commanding general of the task force, was in Helmand, in 2011, he was leading a regimental combat team responsible for four southern districts. There they established about 175 outposts. His current deputy, Col. Matthew S. Reid, was in Helmand then, too, leading clearance operations in Garmsir District, establishing about 50 outposts across a 30-mile stretch.Now most of the areas they cleared and held have been retaken by the Taliban. Many of the tribal elders and government leaders General Turner worked with have been killed.For weeks after arriving in April, he struggled with the burden of that past.\u201cYou carry that baggage with you \u2014 of the places we fought and sacrificed, and to see it rolled back,\u201d he said. \u201cDwelling on the past is just not useful, because we have a job to do going forward.\u201dColonel Reid said he was not surprised by the reversals. \u201cIt went back to what, I think, you could have reasonably predicted it would have \u2014 because, fundamentally, we weren\u2019t here long enough,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a generational fix.\u201dCapt. John D. Quail, an American operations officer, sat next to the Afghan Army corps\u2019 operations chief, Lt. Col. Abdul Latif. They discussed the dots covering the map on the wall in front of them, representing Afghan presence.\u201cIt is easy for us to take Nawa, but difficult to hold,\u201d Colonel Latif said about a Taliban-controlled district bordering the provincial capital. He looked at his gold watch now and then as the session ran deep into lunchtime.\u201cWe need at least 300 police, but they cannot provide that,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have a lot of guys on paper, but in reality not enough guys.\u201dCaptain Quail agreed. \u201cWe can\u2019t choose a course of action completely dependent on the police \u2014 that might fail.\u201dThe Marines are essentially gearing up for an occupation of the province\u2019s crucial areas by an Afghan Army that has close to zero local soldiers in its ranks. Most of the soldiers come from Afghanistan\u2019s north and east.As one Marine officer put it: \u201cIt\u2019s like sending the New York or Massachusetts Guard to control Texas cowboy country in the 1800s.\u201dBut they have little choice. Despite years of Western training, the police forces, crucial to establishing government rule, are still seen as corrupt, tangled in tribal rivalries and the opium economy. They have little presence beyond the provincial capital.Still, the Marines have been able to call on some old relationships.During a recent operation in Marja, Omar Jan, an Afghan police colonel who in 2011 had served along with Colonel Reid in Garmsir, played an instrumental role. He marshaled his forces to fight aggressively in a way that the battered police had not displayed through the losses over the past year, the Americans say.To thank him, and \u201cleverage the strong leaders,\u201d Colonel Reid had the police commander come to Lashkar Gah for a senior security meeting, along with the top provincial leadership.Later in the evening in Lashkar Gah, as the Marines waited for helicopter rides back to their base, they had more visitors from the old days, including a senior intelligence official who had also served in Garmsir. They all sat on the floor, some Marines removing their boots out of respect.Over bottled water and energy drinks, and in cellphone light since the electricity went off briefly, the men compared aches and pains and receding hairlines, and told stories of the good times they had together.Then, they moved to future operations, and how to try to expand the security belt around Lashkar Gah.The threat next door in Nawa District, which was overrun by the Taliban last year, would have to be addressed. The river that served as a natural barrier around part of Lashkar Gah was also failing them \u2014 water levels had subsided so much in places that the Taliban could easily cross. So more men would have to be deployed there.For the Marines, the new mission is close to no action \u2014 a lot of talking over maps with little good news on them.Outside those sessions, though, is a reminder the risk could be all around. Young Marines, called \u201cguardian angels,\u201d keep watch outside offices and outposts for potential green-on-blue attackers \u2014 Afghans who snap, or are recruited by the insurgents, and turn their weapons against their allies.During a recent visit with the police advisory unit, Sgt. Maj. Darrell L. Carver warned that the Taliban wanted a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d attack to sow mistrust between the Americans and the Afghans they are advising.\u201cAll it takes,\u201d he said, \u201cis for a couple of you to drop your jaw.\u201dIf the job is to be done, it will in large part fall on the shoulders of newer Afghan commanders, elevated after stark failures by their predecessors in the past three years.In Helmand, it is Brig. Gen. Wali Mohammed Ahmadzai, 47, recently promoted out of the commando forces.He took command of the 215th Corps about nine months ago and leads a force of about 18,000 soldiers. That is the number on paper, anyway. In reality, it is more like 14,000, the Marines say.When he arrived here, the corps was on the verge of collapse.The Taliban had seized so many weapons and so much equipment \u2014 purchased with American military aid \u2014 that one commander said they could \u201cfight for another 50 years.\u201dGeneral Ahmadzai replaced the top cadre and arrested about 200 corps officials. Two battalion commanders, who lost a lot of men, face 12 to 16 years in prison.The general has now turned to what the Marine advisers have laid out as a priority: The Afghans need to get out of their bases and barracks.Sergeant Major Carver insisted that the Afghan troops outnumbered the Taliban and had better training and equipment. \u201cIf only they shot back, and didn\u2019t do this,\u201d he said, displaying a duck-and-cover position.The Marines say they are trying to change the Afghan forces\u2019 \u201ccheckpoint mentality,\u201d a hesitant mind-set largely induced by an older generation of leaders.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can control Helmand,\u201d Sergeant Major Carver said. \u201cBut what you can do is force the enemy to react to you, as opposed to the other way around.\u201dOver the past couple months, the Afghan soldiers have managed to carry out two operations while the Taliban\u2019s offensive was slowed by Ramadan and another huge poppy harvest. The missions have been basic: reinforcement of forces in Sangin District, and resupply of units that had been surrounded in Marja District.That basic missions have been turned into such great undertakings, even requiring extensive air support, suggests just how little control the Afghan forces have.No convoy had made it to Marja for more than a year. On the way there, the forces had to continuously engage the Taliban and clear improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.s. On the return trip, they found that the Taliban had re-carpeted the roads with I.E.D.s.\u201cWe dug up about 75,\u201d General Ahmadzai said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have the ability to dig up more..\u201dSometimes, just how different the current mission is from what the younger Marines expected has left them disoriented. Many of them had heard stories of the Marine surge here that started in 2009, and of the years of counterinsurgency tactics that followed.Now, they are not being asked to lead the fight, but to train a local force in hopes it will hold out against the Taliban.When Cpl. Allan Oshea, a heavy-equipment operator from Alabama, arrived in April, he described it as a proud moment as he joined a unique club: American Marines in Helmand.Two months later, he admitted that the routine could get boring at times, and that he \u201cwas hoping to do more of my job.\u201d His routine includes going around asking whether anyone needs help with anything.Corporal Oshea said he realized that what they were doing was different from what previous Marines did in Helmand, but he will still have a story to tell back home.\u201cEverybody who\u2019s been here before me has a story \u2014 \u2018I did this, I did that.\u2019 With them it turned into an ego trip in a way,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, you came here and you performed your mission. But now I am here to help the Afghans perform their mission.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As anyone who followed last year\u2019s election knows, Mr. Trump is no boy scout \u2014 but he boasted that 10 members of his Cabinet were, including some he brought with him.\u201cBy the way, just a question,\u201d Mr. Trump said mischievously. \u201cDid President Obama ever come to a jamboree?\u201dHe knew the answer was no. While Mr. Obama, like every president since the founding of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, served as its honorary president, he never came to the jamboree, which is held once every four years, because of policies barring gay scouts and scoutmasters.Those policies have since changed, and Mr. Trump enjoyed ribbing Mr. Obama. He also needled Hillary Clinton, recalling the time he spent with voters in Michigan during last year\u2019s campaign while she did not. \u201cMy opponent didn\u2019t work hard there,\u201d he said.It paid off on election night, he pointed out, despite pundits and pollsters. \u201cDo you remember that incredible night with the maps?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that map was so red it was unbelievable and they didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201dHe also trumpeted the economy and leaned on Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, to vote to open debate on repealing Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. And he said that \u201cunder the Trump administration, you\u2019ll be saying Merry Christmas again when you go shopping.\u201dAs the expected script called for, Mr. Trump offered the advice that speakers traditionally offer: Work hard, do what you love, never give up.\u201cJust like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know the values that you live by,\u201d he said. \u201cYour values are the same values that have always kept America strong, proud and free.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Henry James, a Pooh-Bah Who Painted With Words", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewStevens did, potentially at least. He went on: \u201cI suppose that it would be possible to study poetry by studying painting or that one could become a painter after one had become a poet, not to speak of carrying on in both m\u00e9tiers at once, with the economy of genius, as Blake did.\u201dJames was born in New York City in 1843 into a family of nomadic blue bloods. Childhood trips to Europe gave him an early exposure to art. As a teenage in Newport, R.I., he met the American artist John La Farge, who doused him in French literature (notably Balzac), portrayed him in plush-lipped Byronic profile (the picture is in the show) and encouraged him to start painting. But where La Farge was a dazzler, James was a dabbler, and he soon knew it. And after exploring another option \u2014 law school, of all things \u2014 he picked up a pen, never to lay it down again except in exchange for a typewriter.Yet his absorption in art remained active and constant. In the late 1860s and through the 1870s, while moving between London, Paris and Rome, he wrote criticism for American publications. The initial reviews were those of a precocious, attention-hungry beginner: too many words, too much personality, too much hyperbole and too much look-at-me meanness. And the opinions could be off-base. His trashings of Impressionism and of James McNeill Whistler say more about his own convention-bound self than they do about the art. (Later, smarter, he rethought his take on both; he and Whistler became friends.)Variations on this story form the basis of other James novels \u2014 \u201cWashington Square,\u201d for example \u2014 in which an interrupted father-daughter bonding plays a crucial role. In these books, James functions as an omniscient designer-director and as an intimate portraitist, blocking out complex compositions with epic precision and pushing figures forward for expressively pitiless close-ups. The Morgan show similarly animates the lives of James\u2019s models.In an 1860s studio photograph, a still-young father and daughter gaze at each other like a newly betrothed couple. From the early 1880s comes a still life by Lizzie Boott, possibly done under Duveneck\u2019s eye, and one by Duveneck himself: a flattering likeness of Francis Boott as a Titianesque grandee. In a group photograph taken after the Boott-Duveneck marriage in 1886, Lizzie hovers consolingly over her father, while her husband stands, a defiant bantam, in the background. The presence in the Morgan gallery of a bronze cast of the effigy made by Duveneck for Lizzie\u2019s tomb \u2014 she died, suddenly, in 1888 \u2014 brings the story, told entirely through images, to a close.Despite his deep aesthetic investment in these people, James never warmed up to the \u201cterribly earthy and unlicked\u201d Duveneck. He was far more comfortable with another young painter, the European-born John Singer Sargent, who, when they met in Paris in 1884, was already what James later became: a long-term expatriate who maintained Yankee roots. There were other similarities too. Both men took as their subjects the social and economic elite of their Gilded Age day. And both were gay.James\u2019s corpulent face, with its still-sensuous lips and coolly \u2014 wearily? regretfully? arrogantly? \u2014 appraising eyes, radiates a modern ambiguity. At the same time, his monumental bulk, starched collar, gold watch chain and jeweled papal ring present him as a patrician remnant of an overblown age that World War I would soon do its best to deflate.James was shaken by the attack, writing to a friend about \u201cthe vicious hag\u201d who \u201cgot at me thrice over before the tomahawk was stayed. I naturally feel very scalped and disfigured.\u201d He was relieved to learn that the gashes could be mended. It was probably beyond him, though, to appreciate other, more abstract but interesting things Mary Wood had done. In reading his portrait as a political metaphor, she had, indeed, connected it directly to life. And she had spoken what are surely among the least silly words the picture will ever hear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aiming to Do Good, Not Just Well", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you want to invest in companies that are not just making a profit but are also doing good in the world (or, at least, doing no harm), you may find yourself overwhelmed by confusing choices.It\u2019s like searching for new headphones or a restaurant in a strange city \u2014 too many options, too much information \u2014 but more stressful because the stakes are so much higher.The vocabulary of this kind of investing is arcane. It is known as environmental, social and governance (or E.S.G.) investing, or sometimes simply as \u201csocially responsible investing.\u201d These labels encompass a wide array of options and criteria, which have been used for years among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, focused on companies in the United States.Lately, this kind of investing has surged in the international sector, too. EPFR Global, an investment information provider in Cambridge, Mass., says traditional mutual funds and E.T.F.s involved in international E.S.G. investing have been pulling in new money for much of the last three years, with an uptick in the last few months.George Serafeim, a Harvard Business School professor, said the recent profusion of international options springs partly from today\u2019s deluge of data. These days, information is more accessible on foreign companies and on the performance of strategies oriented to environmental, social and governance investing, he said. That has helped fund managers prove that their approach can compete with common ones like buying domestic value or small-cap stocks.Todd L. Rosenbluth, senior director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA, an investment research firm, said he likes to see at least three years of performance when assessing an actively managed fund. That can give a sense of its ability to weather the market\u2019s ups and downs. His rule of thumb would eliminate some of the offerings in this niche; they\u2019re too new. But a few E.S.G. pioneers have offered international funds for years.When evaluating index funds, Mr. Rosenbluth doesn\u2019t worry as much about an offering\u2019s age. With such funds, an investor can check the performance of the underlying index \u2014 MSCI, for example, provides data on its many indexes on its website.Mr. Rosenbluth added that, before investing in any international E.S.G. index fund, you should compare its performance to that of a broader, well-established index like MSCI\u2019s EAFE, which includes stocks from 21 developed countries excluding the United States. A fund need not beat a broader index, but its performance should be reasonably close, he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you are hoping your money will appreciate,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said.People eyeing international E.S.G. funds may also want to add another layer of evaluation that\u2019s not needed with ordinary investments: assessing whether it meets your own definitions of social responsibility. You could call that its \u201cE.S.G.-ness.\u201dThe old-fashioned way of doing that is to check the fund\u2019s holdings, typically available on its website. If you worry about climate change and find a clutch of oil drillers, even ones with good E.S.G. reputations, you might think twice about buying in.\u201cThe rating doesn\u2019t tell you if the fund is an intentional E.S.G. fund,\u201d Mr. Hale said. \u201cIt just tells you what\u2019s in the portfolio. We did it this way because there\u2019s a lot of interest in E.S.G. among retail investors but, relatively speaking, a lack of product. There are only about 150 E.S.G. funds in the U.S. market, and we have about 8,000 mutual funds.\u201dCosts can consume the returns of international E.S.G. investors, just as they can for everyone else. And funds in this niche can cost more than counterparts outside it. That\u2019s a frustration for Daniel M. Flannery, owner of Balanced Rock Investment Advisors in Boston.Mr. Flannery said he directs his clients to low-cost index funds because ample evidence shows investors do better when they keep costs down. But he has had trouble finding E.S.G. funds with rock-bottom expense ratios. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking carefully and trying to get E.S.G. exposure, you get stuck at expense ratios of around 0.3 to 0.5 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see options that can drive that down to the 0.1 or 0.2 percent you can get with non-E.S.G. index funds.\u201dHigher prices for newer international E.S.G. funds are no surprise: New funds often charge more than older ones, partly because they\u2019re often smaller and don\u2019t enjoy the same economies of scale.Mr. Hale of Morningstar predicted that expense ratios would fall as international E.S.G. funds and E.T.F.s grow and even more offerings crowd into the sector. \u201cAny fund out there that truly wants to build a significant asset base is going to have be price-competitive,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It would leave 15 million more Americans without insurance next year, the Congressional Budget Office said.\u2022 Speaker Ryan tried to reassure senators balking at the narrow bill, but he left the door open for \u201cskinny\u201d passage.The Senate on Friday rejected a new, scaled-down Republican plan to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, seemingly derailing the Republicans\u2019 seven-year campaign to dismantle the health care law.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, cast a decisive vote to defeat the proposal, joining two other Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, in opposing it.The 49-51 vote was a huge setback for the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has spent the last three months trying to devise a repeal bill that could win support from members of his conference. It was also a blow to President Trump, who lashed out.The truncated Republican plan was far less than what Republicans once envisioned. Republican leaders, unable to overcome complaints from both moderate and conservative members of their caucus, said the skeletal plan was just a vehicle to permit negotiations with the House, which passed a much more ambitious repeal bill in early May.The so-called \u201cskinny\u201d repeal bill, as it became known at the Capitol this week, would still have broad effects on health care. The bill would increase the number of people who are uninsured by 15 million next year compared with current law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Premiums for people buying insurance on their own would increase by roughly 20 percent, the budget office said.But President Trump backed it to the hilt, pressuring, cajoling and threatening wavering Republicans.Shortly before the vote, he took to Twitter.Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, pulled in his sails on repealing the Affordable Care Act, and unveiled a more narrow measure that would:Republicans on Thursday released a narrow measure to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act.The measure would decrease federal budget deficits by about $179 billion over a decade, according to the budget office.With senators pleading for reassurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan did his best.\u201cIf moving forward requires a conference committee, that\u2019s something the House is willing to do. The reality, however, is that repealing and replacing Obamacare still ultimately requires the Senate to produce 51 votes for an actual plan.\u201dHe then said whatever compromise comes out of the House-Senate conference would have to pass the Senate first before the House picks it up.That was not all that reassuring. If the Senate failed to pass that conference agreement, the House could have still passed the Senate\u2019s \u201cskinny repeal\u201d and sent it to President Trump for the signing ceremony he desperately wants.That was decisive for Mr. McCain.That\u2019s who Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said were dictating the terms of the latest Republican health care bill. It does have a ring to it \u2014 could be a rock band.Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin declared Thursday evening that they would not vote for a slimmed-down partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act that is being pushed by Senate leaders without ironclad guarantees that the House will negotiate a comprehensive measure.The senators were unsparing in their criticism of the so-called skinny repeal, which would repeal the mandates that most individuals have health insurance and large employers cover their employees but leave most of the health law in place. Such a bill would crater the health insurance market and send premiums skyward, they said.A state-by-state look at who could lose insurance under the proposed Republican health care plans.\u201cThe skinny bill as policy is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cThe skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud.\u201dSenator Johnson said: \u201cThe skinny bill in the Senate doesn\u2019t come close to meeting our promises.\u201dBut they feared that House Republican leaders could just take the stripped-down bill, pass it and send it to President Trump.\u201cRight now, I am voting no,\u201d Mr. McCain said.Mr. Graham was emphatic.\u201cI need assurances from the speaker of the House and his team that if I vote for the skinny bill, then it will not be the final product,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for a pig in a poke.\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s assurances may just win the night. For all his bluster, Mr. Graham said he would trust the speaker.Sen. Johnson also looked like a yes.But Mr. McCain was holding out.The turmoil came as Senate Republicans, unable to reach consensus on broad legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, looked instead at chipping away at it.Besides the mandates, Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, said the other item under discussion for the so-called Skinny Repeal is rolling back a tax on medical devices imposed by the health law.But to avoid a 60-vote threshold for passage, the bill must meet specific deficit reduction targets. It\u2019s still not clear how those targets will be reached.Then there\u2019s the question of what would come next. Republican leaders are assuring senators that the narrow repeal would be merely a vehicle to begin negotiations with House Republicans on a broader compromise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But some senators worry that they are being asked to vote for legislation they don\u2019t like on a promise that it won\u2019t become law \u2014 but they have no guarantee that the House won\u2019t take it up and pass it.As Republican senators seek assurances that the bill they are being asked to vote on won\u2019t become law, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, may have sent shivers down a spine or two in the upper chamber with this announcement.\u201cWhile last votes are currently scheduled to take place tomorrow, Members are advised that \u2014 pending Senate action on health care \u2014 the House schedule is subject to change. All Members should remain flexible in their travel plans over the next few days. Further information regarding potential additional items will be relayed as soon as possible.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man preparing for lengthy House-Senate negotiations on a comprehensive health care bill. So maybe the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d could become law after all?Senate Republicans also would have liked the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d to include a measure that would make it much easier for states to waive federal requirements that health insurance plans provide consumers with a minimum set of benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs.Then the Senate parliamentarian stepped in. The parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, objected on Thursday to the waiver provision, saying it appeared to violate Senate rules being used to speed passage of the bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act.Republicans want to make it easier for states to get waivers for two reasons: State officials can regulate insurance better than federal officials, they say, and the federal standards established by the Affordable Care Act have driven up insurance costs.\u201cThe function of reconciliation is to adjust federal spending and revenue, not to enact major changes in social policy,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. \u201cThe parliamentarian\u2019s latest decision reveals once again that Republicans have abused the reconciliation process in an attempt to radically change one-sixth of the American economy by repealing the Affordable Care Act.\u201dThe Senate bill would give states sweeping new authority to opt out of federal insurance standards established by the Affordable Care Act. It builds on a section of the law that allows states to obtain waivers for innovative health programs. But it would relax many of the requirements for such waivers that Democrats put into the law, signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.\u201cWe would oppose an approach that eliminates the individual coverage requirement, does not offer continuous coverage solutions, and does not include measures to immediately stabilize the individual market,\u201d the group wrote.AHIP played a major role in getting the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 but has been reluctant to intervene in the fight over its repeal. On Wednesday, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a narrower insurance lobby, weighed in with a similar warning.Both groups were pulled into the fray by expectations that the Senate could end up voting in the early morning hours of Friday on a narrow bill that repeals a few important parts of the Affordable Care Act but leaves much of the law in place. Two of the pieces that would be repealed are the mandates that individuals have health insurance and that large employers cover their employees. The Senate had intended to repeal those mandates but create a new rule that anyone who allows coverage to lapse would have to wait six months before getting a new policy.That lock out period was supposed to be enough to convince people not to simply wait until they were sick to buy insurance, a prospect that could send insurance markets into a tailspin, since only sick people would have insurance.This chart shows what a narrower repeal would do.But it looks certain that any bill that can emerge from the Senate would not have the lock out provision, a deep concern to insurers who say that without it, insurance premiums would soar.\u201cThere has been considerable speculation regarding a so-called \u2018skinny package\u2019 that would primarily eliminate penalties related to the individual and employer mandates and provide tax cuts to device manufactures and the health insurance industry. Eliminating the mandate to obtain coverage only exacerbates the affordability problem that critics say they want to address. Instead, it leads to adverse selection that would increase premiums and destabilize the individual market.\u201cWe again urge the Senate to engage in a bipartisan process \u2013 through regular order \u2013 to address the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act and achieve the goal of providing access to quality, affordable health care coverage to more Americans.\u201dAcross the Capitol on Thursday, supporters of the Affordable Care Act tried to reach out to senators, sometimes through mass protests, sometimes through their stories.\u201cI had epilepsy as a kid. I would not have been able to be covered under what you\u2019re proposing,\u201d one man told Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama.The senator replied: \u201cI think we need to have \u2014 not just for you but for any group that is underserved medically \u2014 we ought to protect them.\u201dVigils broke out throughout the Capitol and around lawmakers\u2019 offices.Protesters in the Senate gallery chanting \u201ckill the bill\u201d disrupted proceedings on Tuesday just before the Senate voted, 51-50, to begin the health care debate. Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, spoke to crowds on the steps of the building. Hundreds of protesters flooded the lawns outside the Capitol.\u201cThe message was: we are not backing down,\u201d Nora Franco, campaign organizer at Planned Parenthood, said in the Capitol. She added, \u201cNow is not the time to throw in the towel. Now is the time to literally be harassing your senators.\u201dSeven years ago, similar scenes unfolded before the votes on the Affordable Care Act, but then, the passion came from the opponents. Those voices now are little in evidence.But that might not be the end of it.\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said, according to the newspaper.But the leverage goes both ways.Ms. Murkowski is the chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has oversight of the Interior Department. She is also the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the department.She likely can do more to Mr. Zinke than he can do to her.Tracked down by reporters on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sullivan called for the administration and Alaska\u2019s small but powerful congressional delegation to \u201cget back to cooperation.\u201dNo word yet from Ms. Murkowski.Wednesday\u2019s big vote was on a measure to repeal major parts of the existing health law \u2014 but without swapping in something new.Republicans have struggled to agree on the contents of a replacement for the law, so a \u201cclean repeal\u201d bill seemed like a good alternative to some of them.But the measure was soundly rejected. Seven Republicans \u2014 including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate health committee \u2014 joined Democrats in voting against it.The repeal-only measure was expected to fail. But the episode demonstrated the problem facing Republican leaders: They don\u2019t have enough votes to pass a broad replacement of the health law. They also don\u2019t have the votes to simply repeal major parts of it.Comparing how the plans would affect key measures like the number of uninsured and the deficit.Senate Republicans have been trying to push through a repeal by using special budget rules that limit debate to 20 hours. That time is expected to be exhausted on Thursday.Typically, Democrats would be expected to offer a barrage of amendments. But on Wednesday night, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Democrats would not offer any amendments until Mr. McConnell revealed the final bill he wants the Senate to consider.\u201cWe ought to see it soon, in broad daylight, not at the 11th hour,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.The vote-a-rama could begin late in the day on Thursday. If Democrats do offer a blizzard of amendments, it could stretch overnight. But it remains unclear when, exactly, Mr. McConnell plans to reveal his legislation.Republicans seem increasingly likely to try to pass a slimmed-down bill that would repeal only a small number of the existing health law\u2019s provisions. By passing a so-called \u201cskinny\u201d repeal bill, Senate Republicans would keep the repeal effort alive long enough to try to negotiate a broader compromise bill with the House of Representatives.Avantika Chilkoti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yellen Treads Carefully on Regulatory Issues in Senate Panel Appearance", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The American economy is doing well enough that senators largely ignored the subject as they questioned Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, for two hours on Thursday morning.Instead, her appearance before the Senate Banking Committee was devoted mostly to regulatory issues.Republicans sought Ms. Yellen\u2019s support for proposals to loosen or eliminate some strictures imposed on financial institutions after the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats pressed her to affirm the importance of those regulations.Ms. Yellen, who has played a crucial role in rebuilding the regulations, made it clear that she was proud of her work.At the same time, Ms. Yellen was carefully conciliatory, repeatedly agreeing that some rules might be too strict, and expressing a general willingness to consider changes. She also reiterated her support for reducing the regulation of community banks, a popular idea among members of both parties, though specifics are hard to come by.Ms. Yellen said little about monetary policy, the stated purpose of the biannual hearing. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in June for the third consecutive quarter, and it plans to begin reducing its bond holdings this year.Ms. Yellen said the economy remained in good health. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything inherent in the nature of the expansion that suggests it will come to an end anytime soon,\u201d she said.Senator Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who leads the banking committee, opened the hearing Thursday by expressing concern that regulators, including the Fed, were impeding growth by constraining bank lending.\u201cI regularly hear from Idaho businessmen and women who are concerned about access to loans that would create jobs and build a healthy economy,\u201d Mr. Crapo said.He focused in particular on a requirement that imposes additional regulations on banks with at least $50 billion in assets. Republicans want to raise the threshold to exclude regional lenders like Huntington National Bank, Comerica and Zions Bancorporation.Ms. Yellen said the Fed supported a higher threshold, but she declined to specify what the new number should be.Democrats have expressed a willingness to reduce the regulation of smaller banks, but they pressed back Thursday against any weakening in the rules for the largest banks.\u201cLobbyists are using the success of these reforms as proof that they should now be gutted,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. Referring to Ms. Yellen\u2019s former life as an economics professor, he added, \u201cI\u2019m sure that every college student you taught in your long, distinguished academic career who struggled in class would have wanted the same thing. But they, unlike our nation\u2019s largest banks, would have been too embarrassed to ask their professor.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked Ms. Yellen why the Fed had not removed members of Wells Fargo\u2019s board after a scandal involving the opening of fake customer accounts.Ms. Yellen said the matter remained under investigation. \u201cThe behavior that we saw was egregious and unacceptable,\u201d she said.Senators did take advantage of Ms. Yellen\u2019s presence to explore some issues related to the health of the economy, including the sluggishness of inflation and productivity growth and the high level of the federal debt.A couple of senators expressed particular concern that the Trump administration\u2019s trade policy was already weighing on the American economy. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, asked Ms. Yellen to comment on a decline in sales of American corn to Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m going to pass, if you don\u2019t mind, on this question,\u201d she responded.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, expressed similar concern about the impact on agricultural exports. Ms. Yellen again declined to comment on the specific issue. Ms. Heitkamp then asked if Ms. Yellen would at least agree that trade has been an important engine of economic growth.To this much, Ms. Yellen assented.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Close Digital Divide, Microsoft to Harness Unused Television Channels", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Silicon Valley has dreamed up hot air balloons, drones and constellations of mini-satellites to connect the world to the internet. Now Microsoft is adding its own moonshot to solve the digital divide into that mix.The United States has long grappled with uneven internet access. Many remote and less-populated areas have had particular trouble obtaining fast internet service because providers often cannot justify the cost of building out infrastructure to isolated locales with few people to serve.White-spaces technology has emerged as a potential solution to that problem. Since 2008, Microsoft and other companies have been involved in tests of television white spaces for internet access.The technology is sometimes known as \u201csuper Wi-Fi\u201d because it behaves like regular Wi-Fi but uses low-powered television channels to cover far greater distances than wireless hot spots. It is also more powerful than cellular service because the frequencies can penetrate concrete walls and other obstacles.Promoting the white-spaces technology could reap rewards for tech companies: The remaining 24.3 million people in rural areas without internet are potential customers of cloud applications, search and other digital services.To support the white-spaces plan, Microsoft is appealing to federal and state regulators to guarantee the use of unused television channels and investments in promoting the technology in rural areas.But the company faces many hurdles with the technology. For one, few manufacturers are making devices compatible with white-spaces technology, and some devices that can be used with the technology cost more than $1,000 each. The National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group, said that only 800 devices that worked with white-spaces technology had been registered with regulators.\u201cWhite spaces has tremendous opportunity to help with broadband coverage in rural areas, but it\u2019s hard to justify the cost to device makers who don\u2019t see economies of scale in rural areas,\u201d said Doug Brake, a senior analyst at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a research organization that is sponsored by tech companies including Microsoft.Mr. Smith said that he would demonstrate four devices that work with white-space technology at Tuesday\u2019s event, adding that prices for such gadgets would fall below $200 by next year.Another challenge is a battle with television broadcasters who have long argued that devices on the unused airwaves can interfere with the broadcasts run on neighboring channels. This week, the National Association of Broadcasters filed comments with the Federal Communications Commission arguing against Microsoft\u2019s request for one nationwide channel to be set aside for white-spaces use.\u201cMicrosoft has been making promises about white-spaces technology for well over a decade,\u201d Patrick McFadden, an associate general counsel for the association, wrote in comments to the commission. \u201cAt what point do we finally conclude that the white spaces project is a bust?\u201dMicrosoft said its goal was not to become a telecom provider. It will work with local internet service providers like Mid-Atlantic Broadband Communities in Virginia and Axiom Technologies in Maine by investing in some of the capital costs and then sharing in revenue. It has also opened its patents on the technology and teamed with chip makers to make devices that work with white spaces cheaper.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this to be price competitive for people in urban areas,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThere is no reason people in rural areas need to spend more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Inflation Remains Low, and That\u2019s a Problem", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States has a problem: not enough inflation.That notion is a bit of a head-scratcher. Most people don\u2019t like inflation. They would prefer that a dollar tomorrow be worth the same as a dollar today.But a recent drop in inflation may be a sign of fresh economic weakness and is perplexing to Federal Reserve officials who are now wrapping up the central bank\u2019s stimulus campaign.The Federal Reserve thinks modest inflation has important economic benefits, and it has aimed since 2012 to keep prices rising at an annual pace of 2 percent. The problem is that the Fed is on track to fail for the sixth straight year. Inflation has been stubbornly sluggish.A little inflation can brighten the economic mood, causing wages and corporate profits to rise more quickly. Economists like to point out that this is an illusion. If everyone is making more money, then no one can buy more stuff. Prices just go up. But the evidence suggests people enjoy the illusion and, importantly, they respond to the illusion by behaving in ways that increase actual economic growth, for example by working harder.The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told Congress this month that she expects inflation to rebound. But she said the Fed could change course if weakness persists, by, for example, not moving forward with additional interest rate increases.The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee will meet Tuesday and Wednesday but it is expected to defer major decisions until later in the year. Analysts expect the Fed to announce in September that it will start to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at least until December.\u201cIf you see inflation running below target persistently, for so long, it\u2019s really hard to get around the idea that, despite everything, monetary policy has actually not delivered sufficient accommodation,\u201d said Peter Ireland, an economist at Boston College. \u201cIt\u2019s a reason not to clamor for additional rate hikes on top of what we\u2019ve already seen.\u201dThe United States learned to fear inflation in the 1970s. It was a period of profound economic uncertainty. Prices rose up to 10 percent a year, and restaurants used stickers to update prices on menus. High inflation encouraged people to borrow heavily and spend quickly; it discouraged long-term planning and investment, and corporate profits fell sharply.Under Paul Volcker, the Fed gradually brought inflation under control by driving the economy into a deep recession. By the mid-1990s, it seemed plausible the Fed could eliminate inflation completely. But Ms. Yellen, then a new Fed governor, was among those who argued successfully that it would be better to maintain moderate inflation.A little inflation helps the economy rebound from recessions. It gives the Fed more room to reduce borrowing costs, and it also eases necessary economic adjustments. Employers, for example, can cut costs by holding wage increases below the inflation rate.Inflation can also brighten the economic mood by raising wages and profits more quickly.And a little inflation also keeps the economy at a safe distance from deflation. When prices fall, growth tends to stall as people wait for even lower prices.The current debate, however, is mostly about inflation\u2019s role as an economic barometer.The persistent sluggishness has convinced some Fed officials to revise their thinking.Last month, Mr. Bullard said he was still waiting for inflation to return to 2 percent.Most Fed officials, however, continue to predict that inflation is around the corner.Another theory, more popular among liberal economists like Ms. Yellen, holds that prices rise as unemployment falls. Companies compete for workers by raising wages, workers want to spend the money and businesses respond to the demand for their products by raising prices.Ms. Yellen has attributed the recent weakness to declines in the prices of particular goods, like cellphone-service plans and prescription drugs, that are not likely to continue. She and other officials also have noted that the weakness of the global economy allowed the United States to import foreign goods at low prices.This theory, too, is increasingly difficult to reconcile with recent evidence.The unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent in June, was below the level that Fed officials regard as inflationary for the fourth straight month. Meanwhile, inflation weakened.So where does that leave us? Once again, as it was in the days of high inflation, public expectations might be determining the level of inflation, some economists think. The Fed\u2019s repeated failure to achieve its stated goals may be training people to expect lower inflation, making it harder for the Fed to achieve those goals.Another countervailing view emphasizes the importance of real economic conditions. Low inflation has become the standard condition across the developed world, and some economists see the rise of the developing world as the most likely explanation. The threat of outsourcing helps to hold down wages, while the flood of cheap goods from foreign countries helps to hold down prices.Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the bottom line is that the last few years have raised doubts about all of the standard explanations. Policy makers are sailing without the guidance of a convincing model.\u201cIt\u2019s reached the point where the only decision is how freaked out you want to be by how much this contradicts previous knowledge or previous theory,\u201d Mr. Posen said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain\u2019s Long Economic Nightmare Is Finally Over", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "After nearly a decade of economic crisis, Spain is finally growing again, underscoring hopes that the eurozone has reached a healthier place.Supported byMARTORELL, Spain \u2014 Inside a factory as cavernous as an airport terminal, half-built cars glide down the assembly line in a parade that never ends. Workers in coveralls sidle up on queue, attending to the meticulously timed tasks of turning steel into road-ready sedans.The bustling activity at the SEAT auto factory in this industrial town just west of Barcelona attests to the new reality coloring life in Spain. The economy is growing again, expanding at around 3 percent pace over the last year, producing goods for export, generating jobs and restoring a sense of normalcy to a nation that has been saturated in despair.Now, Spain\u2019s economy has returned to its pre-crisis size, according to data released by the government on Friday. This seemingly puts the finish to one of the worst economic catastrophes to play out in Europe in the years since World War II. It suggests that the continent, still grappling with formidable, even existential challenges, has finally achieved recovery.Spain\u2019s experience offers lessons for Europe, though in precisely what way depends on one\u2019s views on how things went so wrong.Under one school of thought, Spain was a victim of the budget austerity imposed by European leaders in a wrongheaded effort to choke the crisis. Faced with the bursting of the real estate bubble combined with a global downturn, the government should have unleashed money on infrastructure projects to generate jobs.Instead, rules governing the euro forced Spain to limit spending, extending the agony. Spain\u2019s newfound global competitiveness is in large part a function of how wages have remained depressed even as jobs have returned. In this telling, Spain\u2019s resurgence is less cause for celebration than a grim reminder of how long it took.The pain is etched in the numbers. The unemployment rate remains above 18 percent and is near 39 percent for younger workers. Some 4.25 million people in a nation of 47 million are officially looking for work. Even in areas of growth, fraught labor negotiations and frequent strikes attest to the insecurity of work and the pain of diminished wages.Spain\u2019s economic reconfiguration is widely hailed as a key driver of growth. A decade ago, the country was hopelessly addicted to a credit-fueled construction boom that produced a shattering bust, leaving banks collapsing in the face of bad loans.Today, construction is at half its previous weight in the Spanish economy. Exports have swelled to close to one-third from about one-fourth of the national economy.The massive SEAT (pronounced say-AHT) factory, part of the Volkswagen Group, is a prime example of how Spain has seen its fortunes lifted by exports. Back in 2010, the plant was losing money while producing 300,000 cars a year. Last year, it rang up profits of 153 million euros (about $172 million) making 450,000 cars and exporting more than 80 percent of those vehicles. It has shifted to manufacturing higher-profit products like Audi sedans.\u201cThey have become a model industry in Spain in terms of how to become successful, and reform, and compete abroad,\u201d said Angel Talavera, a senior eurozone economist with Oxford Economics in London.The SEAT plant is midway through a five-year upgrade, injecting some \u20ac3.3 billion (about $3.8 billion) worth of new machinery into its operations. When company executives touted their VW overseers on the merits of investing such an enormous sum in Spain, they pointed to the labor reforms.\u201cIt was a relevant sign,\u201d said Joachim Hinz, director of financial planning at the SEAT complex. \u201cThis country is moving in the right direction.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at the factory, driverless carts roll quietly, carrying parts to workers just as they are needed. Computer sensors send alerts when anything goes awry; a screw left loose, an electrical connection not made.\u201cIf you\u2019re a loss maker, you\u2019re fighting like hell every day, 365 days of the year, to get better,\u201d Mr. Hinz said. \u201cA crisis holds an opportunity.\u201dMany of SEAT\u2019s finished autos are loaded onto rail cars and conveyed to the port of Barcelona, where stevedores drive them onto ships destined for Italy, Germany and beyond. Over the first six months of this year, record volumes of traffic moved through the Barcelona port, an increase of 18 percent compared to the same period a year earlier.On a recent morning, hundreds of men and women gathered at the union hall, drinking coffee out of cardboard cups and hollering greetings as they watched numbers flashing on a board overhead. The numbers determined who gets which jobs on this day \u2014 foreman, mobile crane operator, reach stacker.During the crisis, more than half of the 700 stevedores seeking assignments went home with no job, subsisting on their guaranteed minimum pay. These days, 600 working people are pulling daily assignments.\u201cWe are now at a similar point as before the crisis,\u201d said Xavier Tarraga, coordinator for the regional branch of the sea workers union. \u201cEverybody has a job.\u201dSpain\u2019s swelling exports have aided once-struggling companies, helping restore the government\u2019s tax revenues, which plummeted during the crisis. Barcelona\u2019s local tax revenues have grown modestly, from \u20ac2.5 billion in 2013 to an anticipated yield of more than \u20ac2.7 billion this year.The money is slowly flowing back into the economy.Less than a mile away from the Barcelona port, workers donning safety jackets and dusty boots prepare to descend bare concrete steps to their jobs building a new subway station. Work on the long-planned expansion of the Barcelona system, a \u20ac6.8 billion ($7.6 billion) undertaking halted some three years ago, has resumed.For Tom\u00e1s L\u00f3pez Medina, who oversees safety programs at the site, this has meant rescue from the dire math of joblessness.He had been living on unemployment benefits worth about \u20ac1,100 a month, less than half what he and his wife had earned back in 2007. His wife had lost her own job as an administrative assistant at a construction company, when that business folded.They had relinquished their apartment, in a vibrant neighborhood of Barcelona where his wife had grown up and where she still had family and friends. They moved into an industrial void on the outskirts of the city.\u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Medina said, swallowing back tears. \u201cThere\u2019s no life in this neighborhood. There\u2019s no shops. Where we live now, people just sleep and go back to work.\u201dHe and his wife had not bought clothes for years. They had forsaken seafood for chicken. His unemployment benefits were about to expire.\u201cWe talked about the need to stay in the apartment and not pay the rent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel good. That\u2019s not the kind of people we are.\u201dThen the Barcelona subway extension started back up. One of the companies building stations offered him a job at \u20ac1,500 a month.\u201cI gave a hug to my wife,\u201d he said.A complete revival is still a ways off.The Spanish government carries enormous debt, reaching 100 percent of the economy\u2019s annual output, the leftover cost of paying out unemployment benefits during the crisis while also bailing out crippled banks. Government investment in infrastructure remains weak.The spoils of even a tenuous recovery remain the subject of bitter acrimony. The port workers recently went on strike, seeking to secure a three-year job guarantee after absorbing a major setback in the new contract, assenting to wage cuts and allowing employers to hire outside their ranks. For those who operate existing subway lines, the strain of lower wages remains, prompting a series of labor actions that have disrupted service this summer.And yet other opportunities have emerged. The crisis knocked down the cost of living in Spain, making Barcelona one of the most affordable, highly-desirable metropolitan areas in Europe \u2014 a realm of glorious architecture, inventive food, and pleasing weather.Young professionals have arrived from around the world. Some have landed amid a growing crop of start-up companies, not unlike those in other cities full of sunshine and gourmet coffee.The city of Barcelona has opened an incubator, offering steeply discounted rents to new companies while stocking the usual trappings of the start-up realms; irregularly shaped, low-to-the ground, uncomfortable furniture in neon hues, glass walls, open floor plans.Among the current occupants is Meller, a company that designs and sells sunglasses aimed at young people with a whimsical sense of style on a limited budget. Begun in 2014, its sales have swelled to more than \u20ac5 million last year from \u20ac40,000 in the first said Marco Grandi, a founder.Meller\u2019s two dozen employees include people from Venezuela and Germany. The company uses Instagram to ferret out new looks, like their retro embrace of tortoise shell frames accented with modern, rose-colored lenses. \u201cWe are \u2018cool hunters\u2019,\u201d Mr. Grandi, 27, said.Recruiting would have been more difficult were it not for Spain\u2019s epidemic of youth unemployment. Sunglasses carrying designer looks for less than \u20ac100 would not have had the same appeal.\u201cA crisis is probably the best moment to start a new business,\u201d said David P\u00e9rez, who ditched a career at IBM to start Go\u2014PopUp, a platform that matches owners of commercial spaces with retailers seeking to establish pop-up stores.The crisis has also increased Spanish innovation, by forcing companies steeped in tradition to reconceive their businesses.Ficosa, an auto parts business based outside of Barcelona, has expanded beyond its core pursuit (making rearview and side view mirrors) to focus on driverless car technology.A similar process of reconception is playing out in the tourism industry, where a start-up company, TripUniq, is tapping local experts to customize travel itineraries for visitors.Food and wine are experiencing a refashioning, too.For years, the Virgili brothers \u2014 the identical twins Alex and Albert, 27, and their older brother, Jordi, 32 \u2014 hectored their father to modernize the family winery, Casa Berger. It had long churned out mass-produced, undistinguished wines, to be shipped over the border and folded into table wines bearing a label that fetched money, \u201cProduct of France.\u201dThe brothers had visions of bottling their own wines. But their father rejected their entreaties as foolhardy. He and his own father had done it the same way for a half-century. The business had sustained them.Yet even before the crisis, Casa Berger\u2019s sales were slipping. The crisis threatened it with bankruptcy. For the brothers, here was an opportunity.They conceived of an idea that seemed at once ridiculous and sublime. They would bottle white wine made from the xarel-lo grape, a local varietal of no particular distinction. They would label their bottles with a crude Catalan pun, calling it El Xitxarel-lo, which roughly translates to \u201cyoung, stupid guy.\u201d They covered their bottle with six dozen other Catalan insults.\u201cWhen we told our father and our uncle that we wanted to launch a bottle with 77 different Catalan insults, they said \u2018O.K., but please don\u2019t put our brand on the bottle,\u2019\u201d Albert recalled.Today, El Xitxarel-lo, marketed through a homespun and irreverent social media campaign, amounts to the blockbuster that has saved the family business. Starting with 3,000 bottles in the fall of 2013, it now sells 85,000 bottles a year.The brothers recently opened La Festival, a retailer of organic wines set up in a Barcelona neighborhood full of hardware stores turned into gastro pubs. One wall is devoted to taps that draw from tanks full of wine. One tap offers wine from Finca Parera, the work of Rub\u00e9n Parera, a 37-year-old vintner who persuaded his own reluctant father to chop down cherry, plum and peach trees at his struggling orchard to make room for grapes.Customers at La Festival bring in refillable growlers and leave with wine to carry home. Which means the Virgili Brothers have engineered success by reinventing the very commodity their family began with: bulk wine.On a recent evening, they were readying for a trip to New York to seek new customers, potentially adding their wine, bearing Catalan insults, to the wave of cars, auto parts, olive oil and other Spanish wares headed to points far away, lifting the country out of the doldrums.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Driving While Undocumented, and Facing the Risks", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeading to church one evening in late March, a farmworker and her sister were stopped for speeding in the village of Geneseo, N.Y. They were driving with their five children in the back of the minivan. Two were not in car seats, as required.The police officer, trying to cite the driver for the infractions, discovered she had no driver\u2019s license, so he called Border Patrol to review her Guatemalan passport. Both sisters were undocumented immigrants. They were detained and are facing deportation.Under a Trump administration that has taken an aggressive stance on illegal immigration, the moving car has become an easy target. A broken headlight, a seatbelt not worn, a child not in a car seat may be minor traffic violations, but for unauthorized immigrants, they can have life-altering consequences.Routine traffic stops have always carried the threat of deportation, but during the last years of the Obama administration, when serious crimes were prioritized, the stops that simply revealed unlawful status often resulted in deferment. No longer.Rachael Yong Yow, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said it did not keep statistics on traffic stops that have led to detention. But over the last several months, there has been an increasing number of reports of traffic stops, whether in upstate New York, Florida or Minnesota, in which drivers have been taken into ICE custody. Even passengers have been detained and face deportation.\u201cIf there was a valid licensed driver driving the vehicle,\u201d the Geneseo police chief, Eric Osganian, said in a statement after the two sisters were pulled over, \u201cthere would have been no need to call Border Patrol to confirm the ID of the driver.\u201dIn large sections of the United States, unauthorized immigrants drive without a license anyway \u2014 to work, to shop or to take their children to school or other activities. Carlos Cardona, 28, who works on a dairy farm outside of Rochester, said he had no choice the night his infant daughter\u2019s fever spiked. He drove to get her medicine. \u201cI know we are in another country that is not our own, and I don\u2019t like breaking the law,\u201d he said in an interview in Spanish, \u201cbut when it comes to my family, I have to take risks.\u201dLuis Jimenez, 33, another dairy worker who said that he drove without a license, said: \u201cWe are workers. We are not here to harm anybody. We need things to advance.\u201dSupporters of efforts to allow those who are undocumented to get driver\u2019s licenses say that public safety would improve because they would be required to pass road tests and obtain insurance. But critics said that licenses represented a privilege that unauthorized immigrants should not hold, because they should not be here in the first place.Outside of Rochester, Tony Bartolucci, a pastor, and his daughter were struck by an unlicensed, undocumented driver on their way to buying a Christmas tree on Christmas Eve in 2015. His daughter, Giana, 14, died six months later after brain surgery.\u201cIt was the second time that he was caught in the country illegally,\u201d Mr. Bartolucci said. \u201cAnd both times were due to his being drunk while driving. Obviously, if he wasn\u2019t in the country illegally, it wouldn\u2019t have happened either. But I\u2019m not going to make a political point about it.\u201dHe believes in restricting illegal immigration and thinks that giving driver\u2019s licenses to people in the country illegally is just \u201ca non sequitur.\u201d But at the same time, Mr. Bartolucci said, he has forgiven his daughter\u2019s killer.While Connecticut and Vermont enacted laws in 2013 that allow noncitizens to obtain licenses, a similar effort in New York has made little progress in more than a decade.Advocates for a grass-roots campaign, \u201cGreen Light NY: Driving Together,\u201d to offer the licenses considered this year\u2019s effort a test run for next year. They emphasized the public safety aspect of having noncitizen licenses so that all drivers know the rules of the road and carry insurance.\u201cDriving without a license should not give you a right to have a driver\u2019s license when you are already breaking the law in two instances,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying if a kid is drinking at 16 years old, we might as well let him.\u201dSenator Marchione said that the association\u2019s main objection in 2007 still stands: that creating a license designated for unauthorized immigrants could enable would-be terrorists to obtain identification. (Some of the Sept. 11 hijackers used state driver\u2019s licenses to check in for their flights.)The Assembly bill, proposed by a Queens Democrat, Francisco Moya, however, would ensure that the card would not be legal for federal purposes \u2014 boarding an airplane or entering federal buildings.In New York State, driver\u2019s licenses are offered to green card holders with Social Security numbers, and those with temporary visitor or work visas, including recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Applicants must provide proof of residence and forms of identification that are weighted on a point scale.Anne Doebler, a private immigration lawyer in Buffalo, said that undocumented immigrants want to follow traffic laws, and that civil law and immigration law should be kept distinct. \u201cWhy do we want to use our vehicle and traffic laws to enforce an immigration policy when it\u2019s detrimental to public safety?\u201d she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t want someone to hit me who doesn\u2019t have insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what their immigration status is.\u201dThe Westchester villages of Mamaroneck, Ossining and Port Chester issued resolutions in support of the State Assembly bill earlier this year. So did Ithaca, Hudson and Irvington.\u201cWe think that people should be able to drive so that they can be productive members of the community, as well as being properly licensed and insured,\u201d said Nancy Seligson, the Mamaroneck town supervisor.Recently, Alberto, a 32-year-old Mexican man living in Ulster County for the last 11 years, was on his way to visit his sick mother-in-law in Florida when a police officer pulled his car over. His wife had been breast-feeding their infant while the car was moving. That was illegal.Alberto, who declined to give his last name because of his immigration status, said in a recent interview that he was arrested that night in Georgia. His car was impounded because he had no license to drive it. He was able to get the car back and plead to lesser charges, he said, but those charges have not yet been reduced. He could still face deportation.Back in New York, he continues to drive, always looking over his shoulder. \u201cI have to be perfect,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated where a recently arrested 32-year-old driver lived. He lives in Ulster County, not Westchester.Sandra E. Garcia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Top Prosecutors Used to Go After Top Executives. What Changed?", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.On April 27, 2010, Senator Carl Levin summoned the Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein and his lieutenants before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to answer allegations that the bank had misled investors prior to the 2008 financial crisis. Upon completing its investigation, Levin\u2019s committee recommended that the Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into both Goldman\u2019s business practices and the denials made by its executives before Congress.Why was virtually no one prosecuted for causing the 2008 financial crisis, which devastated the global economy and cost the United States almost nine million jobs? Some people think the fix is in: Bankers control the government, so they can get away with anything. Others claim that the banks did nothing wrong to begin with \u2014 or, alternatively, that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that anyone in particular committed a crime. In this new book, the ProPublica reporter Jesse Eisinger tells a different story: Since the turn of the century, changes in the political landscape, the defense bar, the courts and most important the Justice Department have undermined both the ability and the resolve of America\u2019s top prosecutors to go after corporations or their executives.This solicitous attitude toward corporations was part of a larger cultural shift in the business and legal world. Defending executives became an increasingly lucrative practice for elite law firms, which recruited star prosecutors from the Justice Department. Corporations accused of misconduct lawyered up, offering extensive internal investigations but erecting imposing defenses around individual executives. Banks cultivated plausible deniability, their internal oversight systems too feeble to pin responsibility on any individual; Goldman executives used the abbreviation LDL \u2014 \u201clet\u2019s discuss live\u201d \u2014 to hide their traces. Prosecutors and regulators could either negotiate a modest settlement and declare victory or take on the daunting task of bringing actual people to trial \u2014 with the significant risk of losing. \u201cA symbiotic relationship developed between Big Law and the Department of Justice,\u201d Eisinger writes. Corporations got off paying symbolic penalties, defense firms raked in huge fees, and prosecutors earned P.R. victories \u2014 as long as everyone played along.Increasingly, the prosecutors and the defense attorneys on opposite sides of the table are the same people, just at different points in their careers. Conducting a criminal investigation of an executive isn\u2019t just risky; in addition to jeopardizing a future partnership at a prestigious law firm, perhaps most important, it incurs \u201csocial discomfort,\u201d especially for the well-mannered overachievers who now populate the Justice Department. No one wants to be a class traitor, especially when the members of one\u2019s class are such nice people.In the eyes of the elite establishment, businesses are now job creators and pillars of the community. Executives who bend the rules are \u201cgood people who have done one bad thing,\u201d in the words of one S.E.C. lawyer reluctant to bring charges against individuals. Prosecutors no longer punish lawbreakers, but instead make corporations promise to behave better in the future \u2014 in the end amounting to \u201cat most a tollbooth on the bankster turnpike,\u201d as the longtime S.E.C. attorney Jim Kidney lamented.With its broad historical scope, Eisinger\u2019s book lacks the juicy, infuriating details of \u201cChain of Title,\u201d David Dayen\u2019s chronicle of foreclosure fraud \u2014 another instance of white-collar crime that went largely unpunished. With its emphasis on institutions and incentives, it doesn\u2019t serve up the red meat of Matt Taibbi\u2019s \u201cThe Divide,\u201d a stinging indictment of the justice system\u2019s unequal treatment of corporate executives and street-level drug offenders. But for someone familiar with the political landscape of the contemporary United States, Eisinger\u2019s account has the ring of truth.After decades in which Wall Street masters of the universe were lionized in the media and popular culture, star investment bankers \u2014 rich, usually white men in nice suits \u2014 just don\u2019t match the popular image of criminals. Democrats as well as Republicans cozied up to big business, outsourcing the Treasury Department to Wall Street and the Justice Department to corporate law firms. Even after the financial system collapsed, the Obama administration\u2019s priority was to bail out the megabanks \u2014 to \u201cfoam the runway,\u201d in Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner\u2019s words. The Justice Department became increasingly staffed by intelligent, status-seeking, conformist graduates of the nation\u2019s top law schools \u2014 all of whom had friends on Wall Street and in the defense bar. In that environment, the easy choice was to play along, strike a deal with an impressive-sounding fine (to be absorbed by shareholders) that held no one responsible, and avoid risking an acquittal or a hung jury. (The book\u2019s title comes from then-U.S. Attorney James Comey\u2019s name for prosecutors who had never lost a trial.) Corruption can take many forms \u2014 not just bags of cash under the table, but a creeping rot that saps our collective motivation to pursue the cause of justice. As Upton Sinclair might have written were he alive today: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 depends upon his not understanding it.There\u2019s just one problem. While the \u201cunelected permanent governing class\u201d may have been willing to look the other way when highly paid bankers wrecked the economy, many of the workers who lost their jobs and families who lost their homes were not. Outside the Beltway, the fact that the Wall Street titans who blew up the financial system suffered little more than slight reductions in their bonuses only reinforced the perception that the \u201csystem\u201d is \u201crigged\u201d \u2014 with the consequences we know only too well. Many people simply want to live in a world that is fair. As Eisinger shows, this one isn\u2019t.James Kwak is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law and the author of \u201cEconomism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Future in Doubt", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHong Kong has long been considered an Asian jewel, a vibrant free-market economy and global financial center known for its rule of law and democracy. Yet now, after 20 years as a semiautonomous Chinese city, there are more reasons than ever to worry whether it will be able to retain the special character that has been central to its success.In July 1997, when Britain gave its former colony back to China, there were high hopes that Hong Kong would eventually expand its freedoms and prosperity under Beijing\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rubric, perhaps inspiring reforms across the authoritarian mainland.China promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy when it negotiated the transfer of sovereignty from Britain and agreed that the economic and political systems would not be changed for 50 years. At that time, the stock market, property prices and foreign investment were rising, and more people were staying in Hong Kong than were leaving. The Hong Kong \u201cof tomorrow must look like the Hong Kong of today,\u201d Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on the eve of the handover. \u201cThat is, a Hong Kong that is free and a Hong Kong in which personal freedoms exist and will not be squeezed out.\u201dYet, there were disquieting signs from the start, as when Beijing replaced Hong Kong\u2019s elected Legislative Council with an appointed one, prompting a protest by Britain and the United States. Since then, critical institutions that Britain nurtured, including a vigorous press, independent courts and a respected civil service, have been weakened as the Chinese Communist Party interfered in the city\u2019s affairs.The situation has worsened under President Xi Jinping, who has also intensified efforts to reduce international acceptance of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province that one day, like Hong Kong, must be brought under its control. Disputes between Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed leadership and the pro-democracy opposition have impeded the ability of the city\u2019s government to make hard decisions and complete major construction projects. Affordable housing is scarce, the education system is troubled and a high-speed rail line is delayed.Britain and the United States have not made Hong Kong enough of a priority in recent years. Meanwhile, China and Mr. Xi, who at last week\u2019s Group of 20 meeting in Germany was angling to replace America as a global leader, have grown more economically and militarily powerful, more committed to repressive ways and less tolerant of places like Hong Kong that aim to set their own path.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting Radical About Inequality", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m not in the habit of recommending left-wing French intellectuals, but I\u2019m beginning to think that Pierre Bourdieu is helpful reading in the age of Trump. He was born in 1930, the son of a small-town postal worker. By the time he died in 2002, he had become perhaps the world\u2019s most influential sociologist within the academy, and largely unknown outside of it.His great subject was the struggle for power in society, especially cultural and social power. We all possess, he argued, certain forms of social capital. A person might have academic capital (the right degrees from the right schools), linguistic capital (a facility with words), cultural capital (knowledge of cuisine or music or some such) or symbolic capital (awards or markers of prestige). These are all forms of wealth you bring to the social marketplace.In addition, and more important, we all possess and live within what Bourdieu called a habitus. A habitus is a body of conscious and tacit knowledge of how to travel through the world, which gives rise to mannerisms, tastes, opinions and conversational style. A habitus is an intuitive feel for the social game. It\u2019s the sort of thing you get inculcated with unconsciously, by growing up in a certain sort of family or by sharing a sensibility with a certain group of friends.For example, in his surveys of French taste, Bourdieu found that manual laborers liked Strauss\u2019s \u201cThe Blue Danube\u201d but didn\u2019t like Bach\u2019s \u201cThe Well-Tempered Clavier.\u201d People who lived in academic communities, on the other hand, liked the latter but not the former.Your habitus is what enables you to decode cultural artifacts, to feel comfortable in one setting but maybe not in another. Taste overlaps with social position; taste classifies the classifier.Every day, Bourdieu argued, we take our stores of social capital and our habitus and we compete in the symbolic marketplace. We vie as individuals and as members of our class for prestige, distinction and, above all, the power of consecration \u2014 the power to define for society what is right, what is \u201cnatural,\u201d what is \u201cbest.\u201dThe symbolic marketplace is like the commercial marketplace; it\u2019s a billion small bids for distinction, prestige, attention and superiority.Every minute or hour, in ways we\u2019re not even conscious of, we as individuals and members of our class are competing for dominance and respect. We seek to topple those who have higher standing than we have and we seek to wall off those who are down below. Or, we seek to take one form of capital, say linguistic ability, and convert it into another kind of capital, a good job.Most groups conceal their naked power grabs under a veil of intellectual or aesthetic purity. Bourdieu used the phrase \u201csymbolic violence\u201d to suggest how vicious this competition can get, and he didn\u2019t even live long enough to get a load of Twitter and other social media.Different groups and individuals use different social strategies, depending on their position in the field.People at the top, he observed, tend to adopt a reserved and understated personal style that shows they are far above the \u201cassertive, attention-seeking strategies which expose the pretensions of the young pretenders.\u201d People at the bottom of any field, on the other hand, don\u2019t have a lot of accomplishment to wave about, but they can use snark and sarcasm to demonstrate the superior sensibilities.Sometimes, the loser wins: If you\u2019re setting up a fancy clothing or food shop you go down and adopt organic and peasant styles in order to establish the superior moral prestige that you can then use to make gobs of money.Bourdieu helps you understand what Donald Trump is all about. Trump is not much of a policy maven, but he\u2019s a genius at the symbolic warfare Bourdieu described. He\u2019s a genius at upending the social rules and hierarchies that the establishment classes (of both right and left) have used to maintain dominance.Bourdieu didn\u2019t argue that cultural inequality creates economic inequality, but that it widens and it legitimizes it.That\u2019s true, but as the information economy has become more enveloping, cultural capital and economic capital have become ever more intertwined. Individuals and classes that are good at winning the cultural competitions Bourdieu described tend to dominate the places where economic opportunity is richest; they tend to harmonize with affluent networks and do well financially.Moreover, Bourdieu reminds us that the drive to create inequality is an endemic social sin. Every hour most of us, unconsciously or not, try to win subtle status points, earn cultural affirmation, develop our tastes, promote our lifestyles and advance our class. All of those microbehaviors open up social distances, which then, by the by, open up geographic and economic gaps.Bourdieu radicalizes, widens and deepens one\u2019s view of inequality. His work suggests that the responses to it are going to have to be more profound, both on a personal level \u2014 resisting the competitive, ego-driven aspects of social networking and display \u2014 and on a national one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Officials Are Divided Over When to Reduce Its Debt Holdings", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on schedule during the first half of 2017, but its plans for the second half of the year are less clear, according to minutes of the Fed\u2019s most recent meeting in June.Officials debated how soon to start reducing the Fed\u2019s securities portfolio, as the sluggishness of inflation and the exuberance of investors continued to concern them.The Fed has said that it wants to begin the balance sheet plan this year. The minutes of the June meeting said several officials wanted to start \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d while others favored waiting, suggesting that officials are debating whether to begin in September or wait until December. The Fed published the meeting account Wednesday after a standard three-week delay.Officials also disagreed about the likely impact of the plan. Some argued that balance sheet reductions were effectively the same as rate increases, while others predicted the plan would have only a modest economic effect.But there are signs of emerging differences among Fed officials about the importance of two unexpected developments.Some Fed officials worry that investors are not responding to the recent rate increases. It has become cheaper and easier to borrow money in many cases, according to measures of financial conditions. That is the opposite of the effect the Fed intended. The minutes said some participants saw evidence that investors were taking larger risks, and a few were concerned about \u201ca buildup of risks to financial stability.\u201dWilliam Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has suggested the Fed might need to raise rates more quickly if markets continue to brush aside its retreat. But Ms. Yellen played down the extent of the Fed\u2019s concerns at a news conference after its June meeting.\u201cWe\u2019re not targeting financial conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that meet our mandated objectives.\u201dThe low level of inflation, on the other hand, is causing some officials to question whether the Fed is moving too quickly. The pace of price increases has slowed in recent months, forcing the Fed to back away from its predictions that this would be the year that inflation approaches the Fed\u2019s desired 2 percent annual pace.The minutes acknowledged what were described as \u201csurprisingly low recent readings\u201d on inflation, but said most officials continued to expect a return to normal.One reason for this optimism is that Fed officials attribute the recent sluggishness to lower prices on a few kinds of products, including cellphone service and prescription drugs. The minutes noted, however, that \u201cseveral participants expressed concern that progress toward the committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective might have slowed and that the recent softness in inflation might persist.\u201dNeel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, cited his concern about weak inflation as a reason that he voted against a rate increase at the June meeting. The minutes said Mr. Kashkari \u201cpreferred to await additional evidence that the recent decline in inflation was temporary.\u201dWhile he was the only member of the Federal Open Market Committee to dissent, the minutes noted that \u201ca few\u201d Fed officials who supported the rate increase cautioned the weakness of inflation might require the Fed to slow its rates increases.They also noted that some large companies are curtailing spending \u201cin part because of uncertainty about changes in fiscal and other government policies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At least 90 people have died since the demonstrations began in April, and the volunteer medics have found themselves treating a range of injuries, from major head wounds to minor scrapes.Video showed Green Cross volunteers crowding around the injured teenager, Neomar Lander, 17, and carrying him out of the worst of the fighting.Mr. Lander later died.But group organizers say they treat dozens of patients daily, and believe that the first aid they deliver has been crucial in saving lives. The Venezuelan economy\u2019s near-collapse has devastated medical facilities and supply lines, and limited state-run emergency care at demonstrations, according to the group.The volunteer group of young doctors and medical students has become a symbol of how Venezuelans are trying to replace critical government functions.Federica Davila, a medical student who helped found the Green Cross, said demonstrators surround the volunteers before every protest, singing and praying over them for protection.\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing experience because we start walking around with the team, and while we walk people just start clapping and crying,\u201d Ms. Davila said.Ms. Davila and a handful of medical students from Central University of Venezuela organized in 2014 to respond to earlier anti-government demonstrations, where they saw the need for additional volunteers on top of the local ambulance corps.\u201cA group of friends decided that they wanted to help,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cWhat better way than just do what we know to do and practice every day?\u201dShe said that the group\u2019s cross was a nod to the well-known symbol for first aid, but that members had chosen \u201cGreen\u201d for a name to differentiate themselves from the International Red Cross.They are organized and methodical when they arrive at each protest, Ms. Davila said, setting up several \u201czones\u201d where they can assess people in need of care.\u201cWe walk with the protesters accompanying them, we walk all together in one line,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cEach leader of the group has a flag, and we wave it so people can see where we are if they need medical attention.\u201dThe group doesn\u2019t align with a particular political party, though some of the authorities see them as part of the protest movement. The volunteers sometimes find themselves at odds with the police and the National Guard members deployed to protests.She said some of the authorities let them help people \u201cand even sometimes let us assist them when they get injured,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cBut others are very violent and make us leave.\u201dMs. Davila described how in the earliest days of the protest, the volunteers had to use their nails to pick debris from wounds. \u201cWe had nothing, not even gauze,\u201d she said.The group has donation boxes set up in public spaces, and support from Venezuela and other countries has kept supplies well stocked.Many of the volunteers are students in their 20s. Dozens of qualified doctors have also joined their ranks, which number around 200 in Caracas. They have smaller affiliated groups that attend protests around the country.But getting in the middle of the protests is dangerous, and several Green Cross medics have been injured. At least one was killed while volunteering.Pa\u00fal Ren\u00e9 Moreno, 24, died after he was hit by an armored vehicle at a protest in the northwestern city of Maracaibo in May.During his funeral, his fellow volunteers laid their white and green helmets on his coffin.With the demonstrations drawing huge crowds and occurring so frequently, risks to the medics have grown.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to go to the streets, and as you go to help those people, you are at risk as well,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cYou are exposed as well.

The hotels will instead be sold to R&F Properties, based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.The hasty reorganization of the deals has raised concern about the due diligence conducted by many of China\u2019s first-generation dealmakers as they seek to become bigger players domestically and around the world. It is also further evidence that Chinese companies have been under greater official pressure to reduce their piles of loans, because the financial authorities have been alarmed that debt-fueled acquisitions by conglomerates could put the broader Chinese economy at risk.\u201cI have not heard of such a dramatic turnabout,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, who specializes in the politics of Chinese banking policies. \u201cIf it turns out to be government pressure, it would be typical of what we have been seeing \u2014 the government becoming more interventionist in the financial markets,\u201d he said.The event itself began in disarray, with sheepish Wanda employees initially telling journalists the briefing would be delayed for about an hour, hurriedly ushering the news media out of a hotel ballroom.The Chinese news media later posted photographs showing that the logo of R&F Properties had been removed from the sign announcing the deal. A Chinese journalist described hearing a glass break, while other news media reported seeing people angrily storming out of a room.Wang Jianlin, Wanda\u2019s chairman, acknowledged the delay, but blamed a slow printer and said reports of a \u201cquarrel\u201d were inaccurate. \u201cIn fact, we were talking and laughing,\u201d he said.The revision of the deal came in the wake of volatile stock movements for both Wanda and Sunac.Both companies have seen their shares slump in recent days over questions about their debt levels and corporate strategies. The ratings agency Fitch cut Sunac\u2019s credit rating, while Standard & Poor\u2019s put Wanda on negative credit watch.\u201cEveryone is concerned about Wanda Commercial\u2019s debt problems,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThe vast majority are really concerned, but very few people are really just spreading rumors.

{"Headline": "Confidence Boomed After the Election. The Economy Hasn\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsAfter Donald J. Trump won the presidential election, Americans\u2019 optimism about the economic future soared. But midway through the year, that optimism has not translated into concrete economic gains.This seeming contradiction exposes a reality about the role of psychology in economics \u2014 or more specifically, how psychology is connected only loosely to actual growth. It will take more than feelings to fix the sluggishness that has been evident in the United States and other major economies for years. Confidence isn\u2019t some magic elixir for the economy: Businesses will hire and invest only when they see concrete evidence of demand for their products, and consumers intensify their spending only when their incomes justify it.But the economy is plodding along at the same modest rate it has for the last eight years nonetheless \u2014 at least when you look at \u201chard\u201d data around economic activity instead of \u201csoft\u201d data like surveys, as analysts put it.But in overall measures of economic activity, the expansion looks much as it has for years, with steady growth of around 2 percent. The Trump economy so far looks an awful lot like the Obama economy.For all of business executives\u2019 apparent enthusiasm, the nation is adding jobs more slowly in 2017 than it did in 2016, and investment spending by businesses is growing modestly; new orders for capital goods are up only 0.7 percent so far in 2017.Consumers\u2019 spending was 2.7 percent higher in the first four months this year than in the same period of 2016, adjusted for inflation \u2014 which is slower than the 3.2 percent year-over-year gain at the end of 2016.There is no sign a recession is brewing, but neither is there evidence for the kind of boom you might expect if you believe that confidence is a crucial driver of economic growth.This is less surprising when you look at the historical record of confidence surveys.When financial commentators talk about the economy, they often use the elusive concept of confidence as part of their narrative. It\u2019s hard to describe what is happening in the global economy, with billions of people producing trillions of dollars of goods and services. Using a vague psychological concept is a tidy way of describing why things happen when the underlying drivers are uncertain.To say that \u201cthe economy is slowing down because people are less confident\u201d sounds a lot better than \u201cthe economy is slowing down for a whole bunch of complex reasons that I\u2019m not really sure about.\u201d Confidence has a kind of mystical explanatory power thanks to its vagueness.But \u201cconfidence\u201d isn\u2019t really some psychological pixie dust that determines the economic future. Rather, it often reflects underlying fundamentals \u2014 whether consumers see job opportunities readily available, for example, and whether businesses are seeing strong advance orders.\u201cConfidence generally goes up when we see strong income growth or big gains in household wealth,\u201d said Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics whose former work for the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve included forecasting consumer spending. \u201cYou\u2019ll typically see higher consumption spending after that happens. But it\u2019s caused by the rise in income and wealth, not the rise in confidence.\u201dSometimes these surveys can pick up on shifts in those fundamentals before they are evident in more concrete data points. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they do a fantastic job on their own of predicting the economic future.Since 1999, there has been a fairly strong correlation between the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index and the growth in personal consumption expenditures over the ensuing six months, just as you might expect. (And if the past relationship holds, spending levels will accelerate.)But that chart looks about the same if you instead look at the relationship between growth over the preceding six months and the next six months. In fact, that correlation was stronger than confidence. In other words, if you had just predicted that the immediate future would be similar to the recent past, you would have done a better job projecting consumer spending during the last couple of decades than if you had relied only on a confidence survey.Confidence surveys can make economic forecasts more accurate, according to some analysis \u2014 but only in certain circumstances, and if used correctly.For example, Michelle L. Barnes and Giovanni P. Olivei of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that forecasts were more accurate when they built in data from the Reuters/University of Michigan survey (now the Bloomberg/Michigan survey) that is also used to calculate consumer sentiment. And St\u00e9phane D\u00e9es and Pedro Soares Brinca of the European Central Bank found that confidence surveys can provide information about the future that economic fundamentals do not at economic turning points, and may be a factor in how crises spread between countries.For example, from July through November of 2007, consumer sentiment and confidence numbers plummeted, even as measures of consumer spending and employment were relatively steady. Credit was tightening and the housing crisis was worsening, but consumers seemed to pick up that the economy was on the verge of a recession (which began in December 2007) before it was at all clear from official data.For every example like that, though, you can also find the reverse. Those same measures of confidence fell precipitously in September 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. That disaster ultimately had no major impact on the overall economy.The Trump administration\u2019s promises of major tax cuts, infrastructure spending and pro-growth regulatory policy have been slow in coming, but could conceivably change that over time.But history shows that confidence alone won\u2019t cut it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Emissions Scandal Widens, Diesel\u2019s Future Looks Shaky in Europe", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 The latest victims of noxious diesel fumes may be the fuel technology itself.\u201cThe tide has been turning against diesel for some time,\u201d said Peter Wells, a professor at Cardiff Business School in Wales who follows the auto industry. \u201cThis will make matters even worse.\u201dFor carmakers, diesel is not just another option that has gone out of style, like tape players or fog lights. Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and others spent decades persuading European buyers that diesel was not only more economical than gasoline, but also more environmentally friendly.They succeeded. Until recently, diesel accounted for more than half of cars sold in Europe, in contrast to the United States and Asian countries, where diesel has only a sliver of the market. Politicians, especially in Germany, helped by passing legislation that ensured diesel was cheaper at the pump than gasoline.More Europeans are realizing that the \u201cclean diesel\u201d claim was only half true. Diesel engines burn fuel more efficiently than the gasoline engines that prevail in the United States, and produce less planet-warming carbon dioxide. But they also emit more nitrogen oxides, which can cause asthma and other serious lung ailments and are responsible for urban smog.Carmakers haven\u2019t helped their case by operating in a regulatory gray area in Europe, where porous rules allow manufacturers to manipulate emissions tests for their own benefit. Authorities have said automakers were cheating, just in a legal way.The diesel scandals have even become an issue in the German national elections scheduled for September. Chancellor Angela Merkel is under fire from critics who say she has been the German auto industry\u2019s de facto chief lobbyist. Berlin pushed in Brussels for subsidies for diesel fuel, and Ms. Merkel once complained directly to California officials about the state\u2019s strict nitrogen oxide limits.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cIn light of the diesel scandal, forbidden collusion creates a kind of super meltdown for the credibility of the German auto industry,\u201d Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, said in a statement.European automakers have felt the pressure. During the first six months of the year, sales of diesels declined 10 percent in Britain; 9 percent in Germany; and 7 percent in France.The sagging popularity of diesel undermines a pillar of the German automakers\u2019 strategy.\u201cThat was crucial for the high end of the market,\u201d Mr. Wells said.The big, premium cars have been essential to automakers, since they are more profitable than mass-market economy cars. It will be harder to sell gasoline versions of SUVs like the Audi Q7 or BMW X7.The focus on diesel meant German carmakers were slow to develop the hybrids that could serve as a substitute. Now, they lack other products to sell instead.Manufacturers of lower-priced cars like Fiat, Renault, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn are also threatened. They must upgrade emissions equipment in the cars they sell because of stricter regulatory scrutiny. Within a few years, the cost is likely to become prohibitive to make such vehicles.The backlash against diesel began in 2015 after Volkswagen admitted to programming engine software to dupe regulators about nitrogen oxide emissions. Then, studies last year by the British, French and German governments showed that diesel models from almost all manufacturers spew excess pollution in everyday use.On Saturday, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that for decades Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW had colluded to hold down the price of key technologies, including emissions equipment. Among other things, Der Spiegel said, the carmakers agreed in 2006 to limit the size of tanks used to hold a liquid required to neutralize nitrogen oxide fumes.At least for Volkswagen and its Audi division, the tanks were not big enough to adequately purify the emissions without frequent refills.Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss the matter. German political leaders and auto executives will hold a \u201cdiesel summit\u201d next month in Berlin.Carmakers face another quandary as diesel vehicles become a tougher sell. They must find another way to meet stricter limits on greenhouse gases.The potential bans are a major cause of the exodus from diesel. Customers fear they may not be able to drive into city centers.City officials are responding to data showing that nitrogen oxide levels in urban areas remain stubbornly high even though diesel cars have supposedly gotten cleaner in the past decade. In London, leaders are drawing a connection between the rising rates of respiratory problems and diesel cars.One city considering a diesel ban is Munich. \u201cThat shows what a profound shift is underway,\u201d Mr. Wells said. Munich is the headquarters of BMW.Advertisement"}

When the planning for the gallery began, she was only 51. \u201cThat made me too old to be viable at other galleries because I hadn\u2019t had that big success,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d come up in the world like hundreds of artists. We\u2019re pretty good. But none of our names are above the title, you know?\u201dBut at the Burden gallery, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take that chance on somebody who doesn\u2019t have collectors.\u201dIt has had more than 100 solo shows and more than 50 group shows. \u201cSummer in the City\u201d features works by 14 artists. The prices start at $425 and run to $3,000, which Ms. Vaccaro said is the normal range at the gallery. The most expensive was $9,000.\u201cOur mission is aging services,\u201d said William J. Dionne, the network\u2019s executive director. Running a gallery, he said, \u201cwas an issue for our board: \u2018Is this mission drift?\u2019\u201dThe network has eight locations, including four senior centers that serve meals daily. A separate program arranges classes and activities for people in the early to middle stages of dementia.But the art gallery idea was appealing. \u201cWe thought, \u2018We\u2019ll give it a try,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dionne said, and the response from artists was immediate. Ms. Vaccaro said she now receives 50 submissions every 60 days. She has a standard reply to those younger than 60: \u201cThe good news is: You\u2019re not 60. The bad news is: You\u2019re not 60.\u201dMs. Vaccaro doubles as associate executive director of the Carter Burden Network. She joined the staff when it was known as the Carter Burden Center for Aging and she was looking for a change. \u201cI thought it was going to be a one-year, let-me-figure-out-my-life, there\u2019s-got-to-be-a-world-beyond-TriBeCa thing,\u201d she said.When the idea for a gallery for the over-60 set came up, \u201cbecause of my earlier real life, we were able to do it,\u201d she said.A conversation with Ms. Vaccaro and several of the artists exhibited in \u201cSummer in the City\u201d turned to how, before they had discovered Ms. Vaccaro and she discovered them, they struggled to get galleries to look at their work.\u201cI never bother to take my slides anywhere,\u201d Ms. Valeria said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother to look.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still talking about slides,\u201d Ms. Vaccaro said. \u201cA lot of what we do is bringing people up to speed technologically. Our artists are 60 to 95.\u201d The gallery brought in college students to help with artists\u2019 websites and Instagram accounts.\u201cPeople are not thinking, \u2018How old is this artist?\u2019\u201d when they see an image of a painting on Instagram, Ms. Massa said.Ms. Massa, 71, said the Carter Burden Gallery was a \u201ccommunity\u201d where artists could be themselves.So she dropped her first name. \u201cI said, \u2018If Picasso can do it, I can do it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNow I can use my first name.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Reporting on North Korea, Tech Helps Break Through Secrecy", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Choe Sang-Hun, The Times\u2019s Korea correspondent who is based in Seoul, discusses the tech he\u2019s using.As our Korea correspondent, what are some challenges you face reporting on North Korea, and how do you use tech to overcome them? North Korea is a difficult topic to report for a simple reason: Journalists are not allowed to visit and do independent reporting there. Even when they get there with a tourist visa, they are not allowed to travel, visit places and interview people the way they do in democratic countries. So journalists try to figure out what is going on inside North Korea and interpret it the best they can from the outside.And they monitor North Korea\u2019s official news media.In fact, the North\u2019s state-run news outlets, especially the websites of its ruling Workers\u2019 Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun and its Korean Central News Agency, are the single most important sources of information. When North Korea has something to say to the outside world, it almost invariably speaks through K.C.N.A. The official news media is filled with propaganda. Still, if you read it over a period of time, you can develop insights into the country\u2019s ideology, policy goals and world views.But there is a problem.South Korea blocks its people, or anyone using the internet in the country, from accessing North Korean websites. If you try to open the K.C.N.A. website, a government warning pops up. It\u2019s the same warning the government issues to internet users when it restricts access to pornographic materials online.What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for doing your job?With a few clicks, you can clip a news article, commentary, analyst paper, PDF file, video link and other contents you find on the web and want to save for a later reference, and store them in a designated online \u201cnotebook.\u201d I find this \u201cWeb Clipper\u201d function particularly useful when researching a certain topic, say North Korea\u2019s market reforms, for weeks or longer; I create a \u201cNorth Korea Economy\u201d notebook and save related contents there for easy access.What is Samsung\u2019s influence on South Korea, since the tech company\u2019s revenue accounts for a significant portion of the country\u2019s gross domestic product? Samsung is the biggest among the chaebol, a handful of family-run conglomerates that have dominated the South Korean economy for decades. The country\u2019s top 10 chaebol generate the equivalent of more than 80 percent of the country\u2019s G.D.P. Samsung\u2019s flagship company, Samsung Electronics, alone is responsible for 20 percent of the country\u2019s exports.How does Samsung affect the way you live and work?I use only three Samsung products in my office \u2014 a Samsung TV set, a Samsung fax/printer and the Samsung monitor for my Dell desktop \u2014 though many of the tech products around me at home and in my office may contain Samsung components, like computer chips.I used to use a Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone until I switched to an iPhone three years ago. I like my iPhone, but I have a major complaint about it: It doesn\u2019t allow you to record your phone conversations. What if a spokesman calls you back and dictates a statement while you are driving a car or standing in a crowded subway car? With my old Samsung phone, I could just tap the screen a couple times to record the conversation. You can\u2019t do that with an iPhone.Recording phone conversations is legal in South Korea, and journalists and others routinely do it. Samsung and others market smartphones with a built-in phone-recording function. Apple doesn\u2019t. I am thinking seriously of switching back to an Android phone when I retire my iPhone.Beyond your job, what tech product are you obsessed with in your daily life?I\u2019m not savvy with tech products. I have my desktop, my company-issued MacBook Air and my iPhone. That\u2019s about all the tech hardware I use. Online, though, I use the Naver and Daum maps all the time when I travel and go to an appointment. They are like Google maps, but more convenient to use in South Korea. Naver and Daum are the country\u2019s two biggest web portals and search engines. Google holds only a minor share in the search engine market of South Korea.I used to use my Kindle a lot, but not anymore. I have switched back to paper books. But Kindle is still very convenient when I am traveling and want to keep my bag light.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Health Care, Republicans Could Learn From Rwanda", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAs you regroup after the collapse of your bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, hoping to figure out some new approach to dismember it, you might want to think not about Denmark, but about Rwanda.Rwanda\u2019s economy adds up to some $700 per person, less than one-eightieth of the average economic output of an American. A little more than two decades ago it was shaken by genocidal interethnic conflict that killed hundreds of thousands. Still today, a newborn Rwandan can expect to live to 64, 15 years less than an American baby.Republicans, I know Rwanda \u2014 with its poverty, illiteracy and autocratic government \u2014 is not in the same peer group as the United States. But in some dimensions of health care, it gives the United States a run for its money.A comparison of the Senate health care with the Affordable Care Act.Every country has followed its own path and run into its own walls. Yet collectively, these nations offer a few basic lessons that might help you understand how health care in the United States could be improved.One is that it is hard to finance a universal system with voluntary payments. The young and the healthy will be reluctant to pay, leaving only the sick in the insurance pool, which would push the cost of premiums to unaffordable heights and ultimately cause the system to collapse. \u201cNo country has attained universal population coverage based on a system organized around voluntary prepayment,\u201d the World Bank researchers wrote.In fact, they said, in 2012 there were only five countries with more than 600,000 people where voluntary payments accounted for more than one-fifth of total health spending. (The United States was one.) Several developing countries that initially leaned on voluntary premiums to finance their push toward universal health care have turned increasingly to direct government funding, either from earmarked taxes or general budget revenues.Another rule of thumb is that it is best to consolidate the health care system into one big risk pool for the entire population, as Ghana, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam are aiming to do.Having several different pools \u2014 one for the poor, another for the aged, another for employees of this or that company \u2014 blocks the cross-subsidization from the rich to the poor, the young to the old and the healthy to the sick upon which insurance relies. It makes it tougher to control costs, as doctors and hospitals facing a cost-control squeeze in one pool might simply charge more to patients or insurers in the other.A critical third point is that it will be prohibitively expensive to provide universal health care access without cost controls and mechanisms to pare back unnecessary care. Rwanda, for instance, introduced a results-based financing approach that pays providers based on performance.Try proposing the use of effectiveness metrics to pare back the 17 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product sucked into the maw of the health care industry. You won\u2019t have to wait long to hear about \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Want to propose a single-payer health care system financed with higher taxes, maybe one that pays doctors a wage instead of a fee for service? It probably won\u2019t take long for the American Medical Association to call you a communist.But Republicans, the imperfections of the Affordable Care Act in dealing with an unwieldy, expensive health care system do not add up to a reason to throw its achievements away. Prosperity lies in the opposite direction. Just take a look around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Partisan Conflict Is High, but the Market Doesn\u2019t Care", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe United States is so sharply divided that political consensus appears to fray almost daily. Yet two truths about politics can be demonstrated with hard numbers.The first is that partisan conflict doesn\u2019t just seem to have become more intense this year: It has actually reached new levels of nastiness.The second is that the stock market simply doesn\u2019t care. In fact, the rising acrimony has been a fine environment for stocks, though possibly detrimental to the economy itself.Nearly everything is quantified these days: how much we eat, how frequently we exercise, how much time we spend glancing at a Facebook post or reading an article. In the age of Big Data, why not measure trends in political vituperation?\u201cThe long-term trend is pretty impressive,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s safe to say that this year, partisan conflict in the United States has reached an all-time high.\u201dDespite periodic spikes around elections and specific political battles, conflict generally declined from 1891 until the early 1920s, remained fairly stable until 1965 \u2014 the year that the landmark Voting Rights Act was signed into law \u2014 and then began a long climb to its current stratospheric levels, she has found. One striking discovery is a clear \u201crally \u2019round the flag\u201d effect: Conflict ebbed in the early crisis of the Great Depression, in World War I and World War II.But contentiousness increased in the 1960s, accelerated during the Great Recession and leapt during the debt ceiling crises and health care battles of the Obama administration. It catapulted to previously unexplored levels with the election of President Trump and kept moving higher, the monthly Philadelphia Fed index shows.\u201cYou might not have expected that, with both branches of Congress and the presidency controlled by the same party,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. But the kinds of conflict measured by her indexes require three basic ingredients: disparate political preferences or views; the power to block or obstruct; and constraints, usually fiscal, that cause political eruptions. All of those are abundant now, she said.The widespread shock among many Democrats when Mr. Trump won the election in November appeared as a spike in the monthly index. \u201cI thought the index would go down after the election, but that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d she said.Instead, the index rose further after Mr. Trump issued widely contested executive orders on travel and on undocumented immigrants, she said, and the continuing emotional battles over the Affordable Care Act have intensified conflict.What\u2019s more, she said, fiscal constraints mean that even if the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress pivot toward the relatively popular goal of tax reform, the partisan conflict thermometer is likely to stay elevated.\u201cThe index picks up conflict over fiscal issues, and since the Great Recession, with debt levels so high, it\u2019s not easy to just cut taxes,\u201d Professor Azzimonti said. \u201cA tax cut, even a simple one, raises questions about expenditures. What spending are you going to cut? Medicaid? Not without a lot of conflict.\u201dYou don\u2019t need a fancy index to know that people are angry and divided. But converting the shouting into numbers makes it possible to conduct comparative quantitative analysis. What scholars have found are negative correlations between partisan conflict and a variety of economic factors.And Professor Azzimonti has found negative correlations between conflict and foreign direct investment. \u201cIt makes sense that foreigners will be reluctant to invest in the United States when they don\u2019t know what Congress or the president are going to do, or what specific policies are going to be enacted,\u201d she said.Her econometric models suggest that increased conflict is associated with slower economic growth, perhaps because partisan conflict leads economic decision makers to defer productive risk-taking. But she can\u2019t prove cause and effect. \u201cCorrelations, yes, we see them, but causation is difficult to pin down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that others will pursue that.\u201dOne thing is clear, though: The stock market has gone on one of the greatest bull runs in history despite rising levels of partisan conflict. Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist with Ned Davis Research Group, and Alex Sun, a market analyst with that firm, pointed out in a recent note to clients that stocks tend to rise more rapidly when the Partisan Conflict Index soars. The title of their note was: \u201cStock Market to Politicians: Keep Arguing.\u201dProfessor Azzimonti says she can\u2019t explain it. \u201cWe economists don\u2019t really understand the stock market,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t. I\u2019m the worst trader in the world.\u201dEven in the era of Big Data, some mysteries have not been unraveled with numbers. Right now, the sublime indifference of the stock market is one of them.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands Evacuate Outer Banks After Power Outage", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThousands of people were evacuated from Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands in North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks after a construction mishap damaged the area\u2019s main power line, plunging the islands into darkness and shutting off air-conditioners.The outage began early Thursday morning, and when it became clear power would not quickly be restored, county governments ordered nonresidents to evacuate the islands. The evacuation order for Ocracoke went into effect on Thursday night and the order for Hatteras on Saturday morning.Those numbers probably understate the true extent of the exodus from the Outer Banks: While Ocracoke can be reached only by sea or by air, Hatteras is connected to the mainland, which means visitors can arrive \u2014 and evacuate \u2014 in their own cars.A transmission line that supplied power to both islands was severed when \u201cPCL Construction, the company building Bonner Bridge, accidentally drove a steel casing\u201d into an underground transmission cable run by the Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative, the statement said.PCL said in a statement on Sunday that it was \u201cmaking the necessary repairs quickly and safely,\u201d adding that it was working as quickly as possible to minimize the impact to the community.\u201cThis is an incredibly frustrating time for Hatteras and Ocracoke residents and visitors and repairs have to be completed as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Cooper said in the statement. \u201cSafety is our top concern, but getting power restored quickly is also key for local businesses and our tourism economy during the peak summer travel season.\u201dStacie Osborne, 35, visited Hatteras from Ohio and said she was in the middle of \u201cthe best family vacation we\u2019ve ever had\u201d when the outage hit. It was a minor inconvenience at first.The family got supplies from a shop called the Blue Whale, but sleep was elusive.\u201cThat first night was pretty hot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all changed sleeping arrangements to try to find a breeze. Some parts of the house were unbearable.\u201dMs. Osborne and her family did not stay another night.Hatteras is receiving some power from generators supplied by the electric cooperative. Ocracoke has also gained electricity from mobile generators.Officials have asked residents to limit their power use.The Blue Whale remains open, said Laura Fiscus, who runs the store with her family. She said the outage, particularly the lack of air-conditioning, had \u201cmade everyone grumpy.\u201dThe real problem was that the outage drove visitors away during peak tourist season, she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hurting us small businesses very badly.\u201dOfficials said they were unsure how long it would take to restore electricity to the islands and were still investigating the extent of the damage to the underground transmission lines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How We Make Black Girls Grow Up Too Fast", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIt was over a plate of ribs at my aunt\u2019s dining room table when I learned that being a woman is about what men are allowed to do to you. I was 15 years old. Mike Tyson was the most famous boxer in the world.\u201cY\u2019all act like she\u2019s a woman,\u201d my cousin said. \u201cShe is \u2014 excuse me, Auntie \u2014 a ho.\u201dThat\u2019s what I remember most, next to the ribs. My cousin was defending a convicted rapist to a room full of black women, all but one related to him. The elder women shook their heads. The elder men left the room, knowing a fool\u2019s errand when they saw one unfolding.My cousin was feeling himself. Young and approaching fatherhood, he stood his ground. Desiree Washington was a ho, bringing down a black man who had made it.\u201cWhat was she doing in the hotel room?\u201d he asked.\u201cShe could have been butt naked in that room and it shouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d I replied.He explained how I was different from Ms. Washington mainly by telling me that she was a ho, and implying that I was not a ho by what he left unsaid. There are hoes and then there are women. As a teenager I could go either way. But as a relative I could go only one way: I would not be a ho.I was not angry, but I was hurt. \u201cWhat if your girlfriend is pregnant right now with your daughter?\u201d I asked. \u201cA girl?\u201d\u201cNo daughter of mine would be raised to go to a hotel room. I ain\u2019t raising no ho.\u201dIt was then that I learned black girls like me can never truly be victims of sexual predators. And also that the men in my life were also men in the world. Men can be your cousin, men can be Mike Tyson, and men can be both of them at the same time.I was older when R. Kelly became the sexual predator du jour. Still, I heard the stories. I lived in Chicago for a year in the early 2000s, and the rumors were everywhere. I heard about the McDonald\u2019s near a middle school where he supposedly liked to troll for young women who could go either way.I remember the stories about Aaliyah. That was before the internet when we had to work much harder to spread salacious innuendo. And I fought with friends, men who I adored and respected, when videotapes of R. Kelly having sex with what appeared to be an underage girl were being peddled on street corners.At a house party, the men laughed when I announced I didn\u2019t want us to watch the video, but they finally acquiesced when I displayed the telltale signs of female rage. It was as if a \u201ccrazy woman\u201d was a fair reason not to watch child pornography, but my request was not. I still remember the one guy whose comment about the girl on the cover of the videotape cut through the nervous laughter.\u201cLook at that body. She almost ready,\u201d he said.Almost ready.That\u2019s the kind of comment I have heard hundreds, if not thousands, of times, from men and women, to excuse violence against black women and girls. If one is \u201cready\u201d for what a man wants from her, then by merely existing she has consented to his treatment of her. Puberty becomes permission.All women in our culture are subject to this kind of symbolic violence, when people judge their bodies to decide if they deserve abuse. But for black women and girls that treatment is refracted through history and today\u2019s context.New research corroborates what black women have long known: People across gender and race see black girls as more adultlike than their white peers. In her book \u201cPushout,\u201d Monique W. Morris shows that teachers and administrators don\u2019t give black girls the care and protection they need. Left to navigate school by themselves because they are \u201cgrown,\u201d these girls are easily manipulated by men.This cycle of neglect and abuse is mostly ignored in social and education policy because the violence is often sexual and it happens to girls whom society views as disposable. We rarely focus on how programs are failing black women and girls, or how we could intervene to help.When President Barack Obama created a task force for young black men in 2014, it took months of demands by black women for a similar task force to be created for young black women. Even then, the girls\u2019 task force did not receive equal attention or funding.Watching men I love turn a girl into a woman and a woman into a ho has never left me. That conversation at my aunt\u2019s dinner table was not the first time I felt deeply afraid, but it left a cut that will never heal. It\u2019s the kind of wound that keeps you alert to every potential doorway through which you might enter as a friend, sister or woman, but leave as a bitch or a ho.People of color are similarly hypervigilant when we navigate a white social world. We screen our jokes, our laughter, our emotions and our baggage. We constantly manage complex social interactions so we aren\u2019t fired, isolated, misunderstood, miscast or murdered. We can come home, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a home, and turn off that setting.But for black girls, home is both refuge and where your most intimate betrayals happen. You cannot turn off that setting. It is the dining room at your family\u2019s house, served with a side of your uncle\u2019s famous ribs. Home is where they love you until you\u2019re a ho.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Wants to Run That Mom-and-Pop Market? Almost No One", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN LUIS, Colo. \u2014 Each morning as the sun curves over Main Street in this isolated desert town, Felix Romero takes the worn wooden steps from his upstairs apartment to his downstairs grocery.He flips open the lock on a scratched blue door, turns on the lights and begins to sweep, just as his family has done since 1857.But R&R Market \u2014 the oldest business in Colorado, built by descendants of Spanish conquistadors in the oldest town in the state \u2014 is in danger, at the edge of closing just as rural groceries from Maine to California face similar threats to their existence.\u201cIf that little store closes, it\u2019s going to be catastrophic,\u201d said Bob Rael, director of the economic development council in Costilla County, where San Luis is the seat. \u201cReality is going to set in. Who let this happen?\u201dAcross the country, mom-and-pop markets are among the most endangered of small-town businesses, with competition from corporations and the hurdles of timeworn infrastructure pricing owners out. In Minnesota, 14 percent of nonmetropolitan groceries have closed since 2000. In Kansas, more than 20 percent of rural markets have disappeared in the past decade. Iowa lost half of its groceries between 1995 and 2005.Mr. Romero and his wife, Claudia, have worked in this shop seven days a week for 48 years, doling out bread and tamal flour, diapers and fishing rods, medicines and ranch tools. Now, they have reached their 70s and are trying desperately to sell.The problem is finding a buyer at a time when owning the local grocery is a high-risk endeavor, and when President Trump\u2019s budget proposal for 2018 calls for billions of dollars in cuts to aid for rural America, including programs like food stamps and business loans that help small groceries.The White House has said the plan is intended to reduce the debt burden for future generations. But it has Republicans and Democrats alike expressing fear for rural districts.To visit San Luis is to enter a world that has persisted despite, or perhaps because of, the most extreme of circumstances.Six hundred forty-five people live in this village just north of the New Mexico border. Most bear the names of the Mexican settlers who came here in the tense days of the Wild West: Gallegos. Mondragon. Romero.In town, residents still speak the Spanish of their ancestors. And on the outskirts, fields of alfalfa sip from an irrigation ditch that those settlers dug by hand.This is high desert country, where a few inches of rain fall in a year, winters dip far below zero and the big city nearby is Alamosa, population 9,918. There is no bank, no gas line, and the electricity sometimes goes out for hours.The market was built in 1857 by Jos\u00e9 Dario Gallegos, a merchant and Mr. Romero\u2019s great-great-grandfather, who turned his store into a hub. His descendants have operated it since, filling the shelves with vegetables, locally grown bolita beans and hand-packed chiles.With few jobs available beyond farming and the two new marijuana shops on Main Street, a third of the town and two-thirds of the children live in poverty.Food stamps are common currency. Thirty percent of the county receives them.Mr. Romero and his wife offer food on credit, supply baptisms and funerals, cash checks, issue hunting licenses, pay local taxes. But they are exhausted. And yearning to retire.\u201cClaudia and I have given up our lives for this,\u201d Mr. Romero, 71, said. He adjusted his now-gray ponytail and pulled out the pages of a novel he wants to finish writing.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one to break tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t be here the rest of my life, either.\u201dCustomer bases are declining. The cost of upkeep can be overwhelming. Slow internet means inventory orders can take all day. Old refrigerators suck up electricity and money.Because San Luis has no natural gas line, residents use propane tanks or wood stoves, and Mr. Romero\u2019s utility bills are now $1,300 a month.Those who want to take on these stores can find it impossible to buy. If you\u2019re poor \u2014 and many people in these towns are \u2014 and interested in a risky deal, few banks will give you a loan.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for 2018 includes a $4.7 billion cut in discretionary spending at the Department of Agriculture, including a 25 percent reduction in food stamps over a decade and the elimination of the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, a program that has extended credit to people who want to buy businesses like R&R Market.And the administration\u2019s new head for rural development, Anne Hazlett, said in an email that the Agriculture Department would prioritize small-town America, regardless of reductions. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, she noted, proposes a new program dedicated to rural distance learning, broadband and community facilities. This would cost $162 million.Some see this as small comfort in the face of such drastic cuts. \u201cMany in agriculture and rural America are likely to find little to celebrate within the budget request,\u201d Representative Robert B.

{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Strongman Economics", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India has strong views on economics. Speaking to a big crowd of tycoons, investors and journalists in New Delhi, Mr. Modi once admitted that he is \u201cnot a big economist.\u201d Yet he promptly set out an economic vision for India to be a global manufacturing power. Investors should rush to \u201cmake in India,\u201d he said. He claimed that his strong leadership would usher in economic revival and 100 million new manufacturing jobs by 2022.During the prime ministerial campaign in the 2014 national elections, Mr. Modi mocked the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, for supposedly presiding over economic failure. He jeered that Mr. Singh \u2014 who has a doctorate in economics from Oxford University and was the architect of the liberalization of the Indian economy in the early 1990s \u2014 could not stop onion prices rising and that economic growth was jobless, both popular concerns.Later, as prime minister, Mr. Modi told me that India\u2019s economic performance had been embarrassing under Mr. Singh. (In fact, Mr. Singh\u2019s record was pretty good: In his full decade as prime minister, economic growth was on average 7.8 percent a year.) The world, Mr. Modi told me, saw that \u201cthe \u2018I\u2019 in the BRICS had become a burden,\u201d meaning India had fallen behind Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa. He bragged he was restoring India\u2019s image.Parts of India\u2019s $2.3 trillion-strong economy are in better shape today than they were three years ago. Onion prices are down. Deficits are lower. Businesses face somewhat less red tape. Foreign investment has come \u2014 over $160 billion in the first three years, compared with just $38 billion in the first three years of Mr. Singh \u2014 even if Indian firms are reluctant to spend.Local business leaders quietly grumble there is no dynamism on the ground, little consumer demand. Much infrastructure, such as wobbly roads and slow freight trains, needs improving. Indebted banks \u2014 state-run and vulnerable to political meddling \u2014 won\u2019t lend without reform.Almost no new jobs have been created under Mr. Modi. In the late Singh years, economists say, at least 400,000 extra jobs were added yearly. In the last three years of Mr. Singh\u2019s government, from 2011 to 2014, on average 579,000 extra jobs were added yearly in India.That was far too few, considering roughly one million people join the labor force every month. But under Mr. Modi the job-creation rate has fallen, in effect, to zero. Data for 2015, the latest year for which they are available, suggest that little more than 100,000 jobs were added to India\u2019s economy.In public, some business leaders have gushed that the \u201calmighty\u201d sent Mr. Modi, blessing his \u201cwisdom.\u201d That encourages Mr. Modi to think his personal role is immensely important. He recalls his 13 years running Gujarat, the western Indian state, where he corralled investors, offering land and attractive terms to set up factories. He is tempted to think a country of 1.3 billion might be run in the same way.Mr. Modi\u2019s approach could be called \u201cstrongman economics\u201d \u2014 the idea that a dominant leader\u2019s sweeping promise is more powerful than deep-set, complicated, economic problems.Experts who dare to disagree are dismissed as out of touch. When Mr. Modi chose to withdraw most bank notes from the economy last November to fight corruption, economists gave plenty of warning that a nasty shock would follow. \u201cDemonetization\u201d was a big reason growth slowed this year, as many workers went unpaid and consumers delayed spending.Official gross domestic product statistics show first-quarter growth in the economy, at an annual rate, was just 6.1 percent \u2014 unimpressive for a big, poor country with much catching up to do. It is also slower than when Mr. Singh, supposedly such an embarrassment, left office.Global economic conditions are remarkably benign right now. Oil prices are less than half what they were in 2014, when Mr. Modi came to power. They are crucial for India, which is a huge oil importer. Monsoon rains have been relatively kind. Else, India\u2019s recent story would be much harsher.Mr. Modi remains popular, partly because India\u2019s opposition is hopeless and because many Indians like his bombast. Nationalists talk of their country \u2014 which will soon be more populous than China \u2014 as an emerging superpower. Just as railway officials call dawdling trains \u201csuperfast,\u201d or as fawning broadcasters call Mr. Modi the \u201cfirst 24x7 prime time prime minister,\u201d such claims are overdone.Mr. Modi\u2019s economic promises are so extraordinary they must be taken with a deep slurp of salty lime juice. He vowed India would train apprentices by the hundreds of millions to service that manufacturing boom. He said internet networks would get to all of the country\u2019s 600,000 villages shortly. He promised to clean the polluted Ganges River and build 100 million extra toilets by 2019. And, he said, India will have 100 new \u201csmart cities\u201d and a network of high-speed trains, and the World Bank will rank it as one of the 50 countries friendliest to businesses \u2014 up from 130th now.Such promises are bold, but few are plausible, given the strongman economist\u2019s limited efforts to deliver. It is good to see, at long last, the start of a national Goods and Service Tax. It is supposed to create a single market, replacing lots of local taxes with national ones. But the system, with six tax rates for different goods, looks overly complicated and some in business complain it has been implemented poorly. A welcome new law on bankruptcy should help the financial system. It has grown a bit easier for foreigners to invest in some sectors.Much else is no nearer to happening under Mr. Modi than under Mr. Singh. Few formal jobs have been created, as labor laws remain painfully restrictive. Nobody dares talk about creating freer markets in agriculture, lest that upset villagers. It is still hard, without political help, to buy land to build a factory. And in too many sectors \u2014 such as makers of steel, fighter jets and even sex toys \u2014 state-owned firms crowd out private ones. Mr. Modi has not done much to fix such problems, beyond telling state governments to try.Especially worrying are the consequences of Mr. Modi\u2019s political character. For all his strongman economist posturing, he never repudiates his longstanding Hindu nationalist views. Members of religious minorities fear growing intolerance. Mob violence has increased. Mr. Modi, a lively Twitter commentator, remains quiet for too long and does little to stop the violence.Sectarian strife and instability, a worry in itself, also matters for the economy. Who wants to invest if arbitrary political decisions can threaten whole industries? Crackdowns on alcohol sales in much of India badly hurt the tourism industry. Attacks on the trade in cow and buffalo meat threaten an industry that creates jobs for many and that last year earned India much-needed exports worth $4 billion.India\u2019s tolerant, secular character forms the bedrock on which a strong economy can be built. You need not be a big economist to grasp that it would be crazy to weaken that foundation.Adam Roberts, the European Business and Finance correspondent and former South Asia correspondent for The Economist, is the author of \u201cSuperfast Primetime Ultimate Nation: The Relentless Invention of Modern India.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Fees Are Great, if You Actually Get Them", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith investment costs, less is more. Many investors are getting the message that paying less for mutual funds (or for any investment, really) will put more money in their pockets in the long run.But investment costs are full of unpleasant surprises, and academic studies have found that many people aren\u2019t taking advantage of better-priced alternatives.\u201cIn one part of the market there is enormous cost competition, and investors there have never had it better: They can buy funds almost for free,\u201d said Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel with the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.\u201cBut outside of that space, there isn\u2019t as much competition,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors need better information about what they\u2019re paying and what they\u2019re getting.\u201dBy now, many people understand that fund fees take a toll on returns.Now, many cost-conscious investors are voting with their wallets.Last year, there were $326 billion in outflows from the highest-cost actively managed funds, and a record $429 billion in inflows to the lowest-cost index funds, according to Morningstar\u2019s analysis of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the United States.As a result, the market share of low-cost passive funds swelled to 32 percent in 2016, from 23 percent in 2012.On the face of it, there is a benevolent domino effect happening: As more investors choose cheaper funds, the assets in those funds grow \u2014 and the corresponding costs further decline. Or they should.But positive as this trend may be, it masks some glaring, persistent differences in fund costs throughout the industry, said Michael J. Cooper, a professor of finance at the University of Utah. \u201cExpense ratios are dropping, which is wonderful,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the disparity between high-cost funds and low-cost funds hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dEven controlling for characteristics like a fund\u2019s style, size and risk level, the study revealed a constant disparity in fund pricing over time \u2014 and the risk of lower returns for those who buy pricier funds, because of the compounding effect of fees.\u201cThe costs for getting it wrong \u2014 investing in high-expense funds when close-to-identical low-expense funds are available \u2014 are large,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe show that a low-expense fund investor could have earned 70 percent to 145 percent more\u201d than someone who chose comparable funds at a higher price.The authors looked at the effect of fees over a 48-year horizon, which helped to show the potentially dramatic toll of investment costs over decades.The analysis built on work by other researchers who had found that Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index funds, which merely track the S.&.P. 500, show a surprisingly wide price gap, \u201cdespite being basically the same peanut butter,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. He found that, for the period of 2000 to 2014, an investor in the lowest-cost S.&.P. 500 index funds would have ended up with a balance 22 percent higher than someone who invested in the highest-cost funds.\u201cIt\u2019s baffling,\u201d said Mr. Hauptman of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cYou have nearly identical funds, yet one can cost 1 percent more than the other. In a competitive environment, why do these products exist?\u201dYet they do. Even confining one\u2019s view to the landscape of S.&.P. 500 index funds \u2014 often referred to as plain vanilla funds because they simply mirror the performance of big companies \u2014 the range of choices is dizzying. There are about 50 different S.&.P. 500 funds, with over 150 different share classes, according to Morningstar, and fees vary widely.What can account for such stark differences? One reason Vanguard maintains such low fees is the economy of scale of its equity index funds, which are among the biggest and cheapest in the industry.Rydex funds, by contrast, have fewer assets under management, which can drive up costs. And the Rydex S.&.P. 500 fund \u201cis more expensive than some other index funds because it is priced twice a day and designed for tactical fund traders,\u201d said Ivy McLemore, a spokesman for Guggenheim Investments, which offers the Rydex funds.Advertisement"}

The Chinese-made rubber boats, available for a couple of hundred dollars, had \u201cgood capacity of anti-sinking,\u201d the item\u2019s order page claimed, even if \u201cthe boat is filled fully with water.\u201dSummer is here, and it\u2019s once again high season for North African human traffickers, who send tens of thousands of migrants a year across the Mediterranean to Europe \u2014 in boats very different from those found on Alibaba. Scores of them sink, killing thousands every year.At least 2,300 migrants have drowned in the first half of 2017, and the number of crossings is increasing. During the last week of June alone, more than 10,000 migrants from Africa reached Italy, bringing the total so far up to around 100,000, according to the International Organization for Migration. Amnesty International fears that 2017 will become \u201cthe deadliest year for the deadliest migration route in the world.\u201dUnable to reach a comprehensive solution, the European Union has taken to piecemeal steps, like an agreement last week to clamp down on the export of inflatable boats and marine motors to Libya \u2014 hence their disappearance from Alibaba.The union\u2019s boat ban is laughable, given the root causes behind the surge of south-north migration: war, unemployment, social unrest, terror, religious oppression, all worsened by Africa\u2019s skyrocketing birthrates. Youth unemployment already stands at around 50 percent. With an average age of 18 years and a population set to double by 2050, the continent needs roughly 20 million new jobs each year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Europe, though, has a proclivity to blame the wrong things. Especially for the left, the root causes of Africa\u2019s problems include Western exploitation, unfair trade and capitalism itself \u2014 a diversion of attention that is welcomed by corrupt African governments, many of which have figured out how to profit off their people\u2019s endless misery.In fact, Africa does not need less capitalism, but more.Of course Europe has a historical debt to Africa, and it has a practical interest in helping the continent through aid and a generous migration policy. But unless the prevailing mentalities on both sides \u2014 guilt in Europe and victimhood in Africa \u2014 change, the 60-year chain of disappointments known as \u201cdevelopment aid\u201d will continue.The main reason Africa is doing so poorly is that many of its leaders are unable or unwilling to provide the fundaments of a market economy: education, property rights, rule of law, reliable tax schemes, a proper banking sector.Take Egypt. European diplomats in Cairo recently told me they feared the country was on the brink of collapse. Its population (92 million, crammed in an inhabitable space the size of the Netherlands) is growing by 2.5 million a year, while energy and water are in short supply and food prices are rising. Only 74 percent of its citizens are literate, and the country needs an extra 90,000 teachers just to keep up with the population growth.Corruption and legal uncertainty make for a hostile business climate. Many women marry young and become pregnant before they even think about contraception, a medical aid worker in the Egyptian countryside told me. Things are made worse by an inheritance law and a culture that privileges male offspring, he said: \u201cA family that has three daughters naturally wants a son next.\u201dAn African farmer who can neither read nor own land will not be able to get a loan to buy a tractor, and without a tractor he\u2019ll never be able to become an exporter. European protectionism, or the impositions of Western market liberalism generally, are a very secondary problem.In their impressive book \u201cWhy Nations Fail,\u201d the economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson pinned down the crucial difference between European/Northern American and African/Latin American societies: The former have built inclusive institutions that reward initiative and performance, whereas the latter cling to extractive institutions that rob people of the fruits of their labor.\u201cLeaders of African nations that have languished over the last half-century under insecure property rights and economic institutions, impoverishing much of their populations,\u201d they write, \u201cdid so because they could get away with it and enrich themselves at the expense of the rest.\u201d Africa\u2019s political systems, in other words, often don\u2019t produce the basic prerequisite of productivity: the incentives to make a country prosperous.That\u2019s why development aid has often been as effective as pouring water into a bucket riddled with holes.In the best-case scenario, this approach will move Europe away from its own addiction to development aid as a moral salve and an easy solution to a complex problem. Whether Germany can actually make it happen \u2014 can actually rally its fellow union states behind a free-market, investment-led approach \u2014 is hard to predict.

{"Headline": "Building Boom in Boston Casts Shadows on History and Public Space", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "Laws that restrict new construction from creating shadows on two of the city\u2019s cherished public parks may be changed for a proposed 775-foot tower.Supported byBOSTON \u2014 Children splashed in a shallow pool in Boston Common as a guide in a tricorner hat led a tour last week, pointing out Revolutionary War sites. Yet here, in the nation\u2019s oldest park, some people worry that this city is closing in around its open spaces, with skyscrapers blanketing its parks in shadow.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hidden, buried within the buildings,\u201d Sonuschka Pierre-Mike, 38, said of the beloved Common, as she strolled through it the other day.Boston is riding the crest of what city officials say is the biggest building boom in its history, with cranes lifting glassy towers into place and raising the city\u2019s unassuming profile.The surge of construction is also plunging some of its most cherished sites into deepening shadow, testing state laws that have long balanced economic development with protection of sunlight and open space.The concern is not merely about preserving a glimpse of sky in the increasingly vertical downtown or about the risks of darkness to plants, historic buildings and even humans. It is also about whether the city is going down a road of no return by trading away, one piece at a time, its intangible assets, like sunlight on its signature parks and public access to its gleaming waterfront.\u201cA booming economy is always hard on heritage and heritage values,\u201d said Jean Carroon, a preservation architect at the firm Goody Clancy, who is helping to restore the historic Trinity Church in Copley Square.Boston has been transforming itself through bursts of construction since colonial days. By the 1970s, as the city became denser and buildings rose higher, residents opposed a proposed downtown skyscraper that would have thrown long shadows across the Common and the adjacent and equally beloved Public Garden. That protest led to the state\u2019s passage of laws in the 1990s that restricted new buildings, outside one downtown district, from casting shadows on the two parks for more than one hour a day.For a quarter-century, those laws worked, allowing development while limiting shadow creep.But now, as part of the city\u2019s latest rush of construction, the developer Millennium Partners has proposed a $1 billion skyscraper that could soar 775 feet \u2014 and cast new shadows lasting 90 minutes or more on the Common and the Public Garden.The tower, to be built in the financial district due east of the Common, would violate the shadow laws for 264 days of the year on the Common and 120 days on the Public Garden, according to the Friends of the Public Garden, which oversees both parks.So the developer, in concert with Mayor Martin J. Walsh, a Democrat, is trying to change the shadow laws.The city stands to benefit because it owns the tower site, a condemned garage in Winthrop Square, and would receive $153 million for it.The mayor says he will plow that money back into the Common and other parks, and into needed renovations to public housing throughout the city. In addition, Millennium Partners has promised to build about 100 new housing units in Chinatown, which faces a severe shortage. These pledges have helped create a diverse coalition that supports changing the shadow laws.\u201cOpponents have expressed concern over shadows, but in Chinatown, more and more people can\u2019t find places to live,\u201d Angie Liou, executive director of the Asian Community Development Corporation, told state legislators last month.In exchange for allowing the tower to cast additional shadows on the parks, the city said it would block future developments from bringing new, prolonged midday shadows to the parks and add new shadow protection for Copley Square Park, a popular plaza surrounded by landmark buildings.The City Council overwhelmingly approved the change to the shadow laws in April. The matter is now before the state legislature, which could vote later this month.The decision to upend the laws for a single tower \u2014 while Boston has 100 projects worth $9.2 billion under construction \u2014 has made the Winthrop Square development perhaps the most contentious on the rapidly changing skyline.Preservationists say the city is being blinded by the financial rewards, and warn that more darkness can do long-term harm to the parks by inhibiting photosynthesis and keeping soil too cold for germination.\u201cThe ultrarich will get great views, but there will be permanent damage to the people\u2019s parks,\u201d said Elizabeth Vizza, the executive director of the Friends of the Public Garden, which recently removed eight cherry trees that did poorly in the shade.The Common and the Public Garden are almost sacred sites in Boston, lush oases in the urban landscape that unfurl beneath the gold dome of the State House on Beacon Hill. The more formal Public Garden, the first public botanical garden in the country, is known for its sculpture that pays tribute to the children\u2019s book \u201cMake Way for Ducklings\u201d and has served as the backdrop in the wedding photos for generations of families here. The Common has long been a central gathering place for civic activity \u2014 events like public hangings for witchcraft in Puritan days and, in January, the women\u2019s march that drew 175,000 people.In the Common last week, Gail and Dave Wick, retirees from Acton, Mass., were watching their grandchildren totter around the park\u2019s Frog Pond. They said they worried about how the flood of development might change the city.\u201cIf buildings are encroaching on the Freedom Trail, that\u2019s really a problem,\u201d said Ms. Wick, 72, referring to the two-and-a-half-mile path that leads to 16 Revolutionary-era sites.But others here said shadows were a small price to pay for all that would be gained \u2014 including new funds for several parks \u2014 for a booming city. \u201cYou have to allow new development,\u201d said Lee Bell, 63, who lives just off the Common and was pushing her aging dachshund Lilly in a stroller on the way to the veterinarian. Besides, others here said, on days of intense sunshine on the Common, new shadows might actually create welcome respite.The latest flood of construction is unlike anything Boston has seen in its nearly 400-year history, said Brian P. Golden, director of the Boston Planning and Development Agency.But in the midst of this growth, critics say, questions about shadows and waterfront access are often put aside in favor of piecemeal zoning for new development.\u201cWe are seeing the public being walled off,\u201d said Bradley Campbell, the president of the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy group.As the shadow issue moved to the State House last month, a change in the laws appeared likely.But opponents found an unexpected ally in William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth. At a recent hearing, he surprised state lawmakers by asking them to delay a vote to allow more scrutiny of the idea. They agreed.Mr. Galvin warned that changing the shadow laws would set a dangerous precedent. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that because someone is going to make a buck, we should look the other way,\u201d he said.Other opponents asked what it would take for Boston to say no to a developer at this point. Greg Galer, the executive director of the Boston Preservation Alliance, wondered if the city would turn down $1 billion if a developer wanted to build on the Common itself.\u201cTo support this petition is to say that Boston\u2019s rules are up for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cMore offers will be made \u2014 offers that yes, have benefits, but at what cost?\u201dJess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi King\u2019s Son Plotted Effort to Oust His Rival", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 As next in line to be king of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Nayef was unaccustomed to being told what to do. Then, one night in June, he was summoned to a palace in Mecca, held against his will and pressured for hours to give up his claim to the throne.By dawn, he had given in, and Saudi Arabia woke to the news that it had a new crown prince: the king\u2019s 31-year-old son, Mohammed bin Salman.To strengthen support for the sudden change in the line of succession, some senior princes were told that Mohammed bin Nayef was unfit to be king because of a drug problem, according to an associate of the royal family.The decision to oust Mohammed bin Nayef and some of his closest colleagues has spread concern among counterterrorism officials in the United States who saw their most trusted Saudi contacts disappear and have struggled to build new relationships.And the collection of so much power by one young royal, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has unsettled a royal family long guided by consensus and deference to elders.\u201cYou may have now such a concentration of power within one branch and within one individual who is also younger than so many of the cousins and sons of former kings that it may begin to create a situation where the family is out of whack,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, who studies Persian Gulf politics.In response to questions from The Times, a written statement by a senior Saudi official denied that Mohammed bin Nayef had been pressured and said that the Allegiance Council, a body of senior princes, had approved the change in \u201cthe best interest of the nation.\u201dThe rivalry between the princes began in 2015, when King Salman ascended the throne and bestowed tremendous power on his favorite son.Mohammed bin Salman was named deputy crown prince, or second in line to become king, as well as defense minister; put in charge of a powerful economic council; and given oversight of the state oil monopoly, Saudi Aramco.The prince has risen at the expense of his elder relatives, including Mohammed bin Nayef, 57. As the head of the Saudi Interior Ministry, Mohammed bin Nayef led the dismantling of Al Qaeda in the kingdom after a deadly bombing campaign a decade ago. While he kept a low public profile, even after becoming crown prince in 2015, his work won him allies in the United States and other Western and Arab nations.But while his removal struck many as sudden, it had been planned out.On the night of June 20, a group of senior princes and security officials gathered at the Safa Palace in Mecca after being informed that King Salman wanted to see them, according to United States officials and associates of the royal family.It was near the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, when Saudis were preoccupied with religious duties and many royals had gathered in Mecca before traveling abroad for the Eid al-Fitr holiday. That made it advantageous for a change, analysts said, like a coup on Christmas Eve.Before midnight, Mohammed bin Nayef was told he was going to meet the king and was led into another room, where royal court officials took away his phones and pressured him to give up his posts as crown prince and interior minister, according to United States officials and an associate of the royal family.At first, he refused. But as the night wore on, the prince, a diabetic who suffers from the effects of a 2009 assassination attempt by a suicide bomber, grew tired.Meanwhile, royal court officials called members of the Allegiance Council, a body of princes who are supposed to approve changes to the line of succession. Some were told that Mohammed bin Nayef had a drug problem and was unfit to be king, according to an associate of the royal family.For years, close friends of Mohammed bin Nayef had expressed concern about his health, noting that since the assassination attempt, he had experienced lingering pain and shown signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. His condition led him to take medication that some friends worried he had become addicted to.\u201cThe weight of the evidence I have seen is that he was more injured in the assassination attempt than was admitted and that he then got onto a pain killer routine that was very addictive,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer and director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI think that problem got progressively worse.\u201dOne American official and one adviser to a Saudi royal said Mohammed bin Nayef opposed the embargo on Qatar, a stand that probably accelerated his ouster.\u201cGood luck, God willing,\u201d the older prince replies.Mohammed bin Nayef then returned to his palace in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, and he was barred from leaving it.Also confined to his home was Gen. Abdulaziz al-Huwairini, a colleague of Mohammed bin Nayef who was crucial to the security relationship with the United States, according to current and former United States officials.Days later, C.I.A. officials briefed the White House on their concern that the ouster of Mohammed bin Nayef and the possible removal of General Huwairini and other security officers could hamper intelligence sharing, United States officials said.The senior Saudi official\u2019s statement said General Huwairini was still in his job and had pledged allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman along with senior officers.Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as interior minister by his 33-year-old nephew, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef, who was an adviser to his uncle and who is believed to be close to Mohammed bin Salman.The extent of support for the elevation of Mohammed bin Salman in the family remains unclear.

{"Headline": "German Carmakers Face Potential New Scandal Over Antitrust Issues", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Germany\u2019s high-end carmakers face a potentially destructive new scandal after European antitrust authorities said on Saturday that they were looking into allegations that Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW colluded illegally to hold down the prices of crucial technology, including emissions equipment.Growing awareness of the harmful effects of diesel fumes has prompted European cities to consider bans of diesel cars and has led consumers to reject cars with diesel engines, a largely German innovation that traditionally accounted for half the market.The backlash could take on a new, far broader dimension if it turns out that the excess emissions were the result of illegal collusion by a de facto cartel. The investigation could also lead to billions of euros in fines.In a statement on Saturday, the European Commission partially confirmed a report in Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine that said the authorities were investigating evidence that representatives of the automakers met regularly to agree on technical specifications for everything from brakes to clutches to emissions systems. The collusion began in the mid-1990s and continued until recently, according to Der Spiegel, which said it had seen documents that were part of an antitrust investigation.The commission said that it and the German Cartel Office \u201chave received information on this matter, which is currently being assessed by the commission.\u201d The statement gave no details. \u201cIt is premature at this stage to speculate further,\u201d the commission said.Spokesmen for Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW declined to comment on Saturday. Volkswagen and Daimler have admitted some of the allegations to the authorities, according to Der Spiegel.BMW, Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz unit and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi and Porsche divisions dominate the global market for luxury cars, a crucial pillar of the German economy. Drivers around the world are willing to pay a premium for the German brands because of their reputation for precision and craftsmanship.\u201cSince the diesel scandal began two years ago trust in the German auto industry has been sinking on a daily basis,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the industry, said in an email on Saturday. \u201cDiesel was the Germans\u2019 great innovation, but it\u2019s beyond rescue.\u201dThe crisis has also taken on political dimensions. Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to distance herself from the auto industry amid criticism that her government has lobbied for lax European emissions regulations that contributed to the scandal.\u201cThe diesel scandal came about because our politicians passed bad laws,\u201d Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.The broad conspiracy described by Der Spiegel included dozens of working committees that discussed how to limit competition on new technologies, including emissions systems.Though allegations of collusion are new, it was already clear that vehicles sold by almost all carmakers in Europe pollute more in everyday use than in tests. As a result, levels of harmful nitrogen oxides are higher in urban areas than they would be if carmakers were adhering to pollution standards.Studies last year by the British, French and German governments found that carmakers exploited gaping loopholes in European Union regulations to evade emissions standards. For example, many reduced pollution controls at temperatures below 68 degrees Fahrenheit, supposedly to protect engines from damage.Regulators did not notice because they only test cars at temperatures above 68 degrees.Some of the allegations contained in the Spiegel report fit in with what is already known about Volkswagen\u2019s cheating.In 2006, according to the magazine, the German carmakers agreed to limit the size of the tanks used to hold a chemical solution that helps neutralize diesel emissions. Volkswagen and its Audi division have previously admitted in court documents that the tanks they installed in their cars did not hold enough of the solution, known as AdBlue, to last between oil changes. The company did not want the tanks to take space from the cars\u2019 sound systems, according to a criminal complaint against an Audi engineer filed earlier this month in the United States.Rather than install bigger tanks, Volkswagen and Audi illegally programmed cars to ration the chemical solution \u2014 and produce excess emissions \u2014 except when engine software detected that an official test was underway.While only Volkswagen and Audi have admitted wrongdoing, all the main German carmakers have acknowledged that their vehicles may produce excess levels of nitrogen oxides during everyday driving.Advertisement"}

The cash from the deal, with the property developer Sunac China, would be used to pay down debt.Wanda appears to be caught in a political and financial downdraft that has hit many big Chinese deal makers. For years, the Chinese government encouraged the global ambitions of corporate giants like Wanda. Mr. Wang muscled into Hollywood\u2019s domain, buying the AMC Theaters chain and the struggling production company Legendary Entertainment.The combination of forces at home and abroad has put global deal makers on the defensive.Wanda has not been immune to the pressure.Investors\u2019 confidence has been shaken.Shares of Wanda Film, a unit listed in the Southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, have fallen about 11 percent in the last month. In December, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the long-term corporate credit rating for Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties and Wanda Commercial Properties, both listed in Hong Kong, citing high leverage and capital expenditures.The deal announced on Monday would help Wanda pay off some of its debt.Sunac would pay $4.4 billion for a 91 percent stake in each of the 13 tourism projects, all in China, and would take over the loans for the projects. Wanda also agreed to sell 76 hotels for $4.9 billion.\u201cThrough the sale of these assets, Wanda Commercial\u2019s debt-to-asset ratio will drop dramatically,\u201d Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman, told the Chinese business weekly Caixin. \u201cAll the cash will go to repaying loans.\u201dThe move also plays into a broader shift by Wanda in recent years, to a so-called asset-light strategy that could free up more capital. Under this model, Wanda is looking to own fewer properties outright and to collect more money from management fees and other services.In the deal with Sunac, Wanda would continue to operate all of the projects under the company\u2019s brand name, and it would own fewer underperforming hotels.\u201cWanda is selling the noncore part of its cultural tourism business,\u201d said Deng Haozhi, a real estate economist with Fineland Assets Management Company based in Guangzhou, China. \u201cUltimately, what they are selling are properties that the market doesn\u2019t like.\u201dEven so, the deal amounts to an about-face for Wanda. The company had made tourism central to its focus, looking to capitalize on China\u2019s growing middle class.But Wanda\u2019s record with theme parks has been mixed: Only four of the 13 theme parks being sold are up and running; most are in the planning stages. Wanda opened its first theme park, an indoor one, in the Chinese city of Wuhan. But it closed after 19 months for \u201cupgrades and renovations,\u201d and it has yet to reopen.For the first half of this year, Wanda said its cultural segment, of which tourism is a component, rose 5.9 percent from a year earlier, to $4.5 billion.\u201cGiven all the talk about how this was the centerpiece of the strategy for moving away from more traditional commercial real estate, it\u2019s hard not to see it, to some degree, as a form of capitulation,\u201d said Ronald Merriman, managing director of planning and advisory services for Pro Fun Management Group, a firm based in California that provides management services for theme parks and that has advised Wanda.Mr. Merriman said Sunac had paid a steep price for \u201cwhat are a handful of good but not stellar performers.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand this move by Sunac,\u201d Mr. Deng said. \u201cWhere are they getting this endless flow of money?\u201d\u201cLast year, they were the property developer that bought the most number of properties,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this year, they\u2019ve spent a lot of money to save LeEco.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a real estate economist with Fineland Assets Management Company.

In a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed said it would start reducing its bond holdings \u201crelatively soon\u201d so long as moderate economic growth continues.The Fed remains officially sanguine about lower than expected inflation. The stance is likely to reinforce market expectations that the Fed will take action to increase borrowing costs at its next meeting, in September. Rather than raising its benchmark rate, the Fed is expected to announce it will begin to reduce its bond holdings.The Fed has held borrowing costs at low levels since the financial crisis to increase economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. The agency is now trying to raise costs to reduce those incentives.By the end of the year, the Fed projects that interest rates could return to a level that would neither encourage nor discourage economic activity.So far, however, markets have largely shaken off the Fed\u2019s retreat. Borrowing costs remain low and loan terms have shown little sign of tightening. Some measures show financial conditions have eased since the Fed began its retreat.Those steps reflected the Fed\u2019s confidence in the health of the economy.Since then, however, some Fed officials have expressed concern about continued weakness in inflation. The agency\u2019s preferred measure declined in the last three monthly reports, to 1.4 percent in May from an annualized pace of 2.1 percent in February.Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has been the most vocal among Fed officials in warning that the agency may be raising interest rates too quickly. He voted against the quarter-point rate increases in March and in June. Several other members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee have expressed concern about weak inflation in recent weeks.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, has acknowledged the recent weakness, but she has said that she expects inflation to rebound. Job growth remains strong, with most Fed officials seeing a tight labor market that is likely to result in higher prices.The Fed has predicted one more rate increase this year, but analysts do not expect a decision earlier than December, so the Fed has time to consider the incoming data.Some investors saw evidence in the Fed\u2019s statement that the central bank is a little less likely to raise rates in December. The dollar weakened against foreign currencies, continuing a recent trend. The dollar\u2019s exchange value reflects market perceptions of the relative strength of the American economy compared with the rest of the world.Stock indexes rose after the 2 p.m. announcement, as equity investors like low rates. The S.&P. 500 index ended the day up very slightly at 2,477.83. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell slightly because bond investors like high rates.Analysts saw little evidence of a shift in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy plans.\u201cWe think the Fed has laid out its policy plans quite clearly and it is unlikely to deviate from them unless there is a very dramatic change to inflation and employment trends,\u201d said Rick Rieder, BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer of global fixed income.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said investors were overanalyzing minor changes in the Fed\u2019s wording.\u201cWe don\u2019t sense a significant loss of confidence from the FOMC that inflation will return to target over time,\u201d he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s policy panel.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

Germany is Turkey\u2019s main trading partner, and more than 3.3 million German tourists visited Turkey last year, more than came from any other country.On Friday, Mr. Erdogan scoffed at the ministers\u2019 warnings.\u201cI want to remind my German friends, and to all the world, you do not have the power to defame Turkey,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said at a fund-raising event for a hospital. \u201cYou do not have the power to scare us with these kinds of things.\u201dThis week, the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, called Mr. Steudtner\u2019s arrest \u201cabsurd\u201d and said it showed \u201cthat German citizens are no longer safe from arbitrary arrests\u201d in Turkey.In remarks published Friday in Bild, the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said that if Turkey \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop these games, we will have to tell people: \u2018You are traveling to Turkey at your own risk, we can no longer provide guarantees.\u2019\u201dAlso on Friday, two German news channels said they would no longer run ads that feature the soccer star Lukas Podolski encouraging investors: \u201cCome to Turkey.

Mr. Erdogan also says that Germany harbors members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has waged an insurgency in southeastern Turkey for several decades.\u201cThe government who is hiding Turkish terrorists in Germany should first explain this,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said on Friday. \u201cWhy are they hiding in Germany? How they can explain the material support given to them?\u201dMembers of the Turkish diaspora in Germany were also at the center of a dispute in the spring, when German officials refused to allow Mr. Erdogan\u2019s political party to hold rallies for German-Turks in the run-up to a referendum in April, when Turks voted to expand the president\u2019s powers.\u201cIf it was up to Turkey, actually, Turkey would prefer to remain \u2018strategic partners\u2019 forever,\u201d Kurtulus Tayiz wrote in his column in Aksam, a pro-Erdogan newspaper. But he said that Germany and the United States had become the \u201ccenter of activities that pose both internal and external threats to Turkey\u2019s survival.\u201dWhile Germany has been reluctant to antagonize Turkey because it relies on Turkey to stem the flow of refugees toward Europe, migration pressures have lessened in the past year, and Turkey is no longer seen as quite so essential. Additionally, as Germany prepares for federal elections, its politicians stand to gain domestically from taking a strong stance on Turkish issues.\u201cTurkey is playing a game of brinkmanship with the hope that Germany will back down because that is what has happened in the past,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. \u201cBut that may not be the case this time.\u201dEven if Turkey now has no realistic chance of joining the union, Mr. Dalay said, Ankara is unlikely to want to halt the membership talks entirely, since they provide some reassurance to foreign investors.\u201cThe E.U. process is dead, but the fact it isn\u2019t terminated is beneficial for Turkey,\u201d Mr. Dalay said. \u201cIf tomorrow the process is officially terminated, that will have economic consequences.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s title.

{"Headline": "The Next Economic Powerhouse? Poland", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf getting rich is hard for individuals, it is harder still for nations. Of more than 190 countries tracked by the International Monetary Fund, fewer than 40 count as wealthy or advanced economies. The rest are known as emerging nations, and many of them have been emerging forever. The last large country to make it into the advanced class was South Korea, 20 years ago. The next major nation likely to join that club could be Poland, an under-the-radar economic star that President Trump will visit this week on his second overseas trip in office.Mr. Trump will meet with leaders of the ruling Law and Justice party, who are thrilled that he has chosen to visit Warsaw before Berlin, Paris or Brussels, and participate in a meeting to promote regional economic ties in Eastern Europe. Other European leaders are unnerved by how Mr. Trump\u2019s populism echoes the right-wing nationalism of his Polish hosts \u2014 both have been attacked as illiberal threats to the postwar Western order. But so far, two years of populism has not derailed a quarter-century of steady economic progress in Poland.The I.M.F. has a complex definition of \u201cadvanced,\u201d but a common thread is that all the nations have a per-capita income of at least around $15,000. Since Poland completed the transition from Communism to democracy in 1991, its economy has been growing at an average annual rate of 4 percent and, remarkably, has not suffered a single year of negative growth. In those 25 years, Poland\u2019s average income has risen to near $13,000, from $2,300, and it is now on pace to pass the $15,000 mark by the turn of this decade.This is testimony to the long-term fiscal sobriety of Poland\u2019s leaders, and its sharp break with Communism. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Poland set out to distance itself as far as possible from Russia, and adopted the financial discipline and institutional reforms required to join the European Union.In the last decade, Warsaw emerged as the conservative opposite of decadent Moscow. Its staid tycoons are almost incapable of the flashy self-promotion common among the Russian oligarchs, and they have embraced American-style entrepreneurship with an enthusiasm rarely found elsewhere in Europe.This pro-American, anti-Russian streak runs deeper than the current populist mood, making Poland a natural and increasingly potent American ally. In the past the relationship has focused on military ties and geopolitics, but Poland is already one of the few NATO members meeting its commitment to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. This meeting shifts the focus to the regional economy at its breakout moment.Since World War II, the few poor nations that made it rich tended to do so in regional clusters, starting with Italy, Spain and other countries in Southern Europe, and then East Asia. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan went unheralded for years before they were recognized as the \u201cAsian miracle\u201d economies.Now Eastern Europe is rising, just as quietly, with small nations like the Czech Republic leading the way. Poland is close on its heels. With a population of nearly 40 million and a half-trillion-dollar economy that is already the world\u2019s 24th largest, it is now big enough to put all of Eastern Europe on the global economic map.Poland is working its way up just as the Asian miracles did, as a manufacturing power, even though this path is much harder now. Manufacturing is declining as a share of the global economy, and with China taking much of this shrinking pie, few other major manufacturing nations are still expanding their share of global exports. That select group of around half a dozen includes South Korea, the Czech Republic \u2014 and Poland.No other sector has as much impact as manufacturing in generating the jobs and productivity gains that can make a nation rich. With its cheap currency and relatively low wages \u2014 still one-third those in Germany \u2014 Poland is more than competitive with the Asian manufacturing powers. Exports from manufacturing account for 33 percent of G.D.P. in Poland, well above the average for emerging nations of 22 percent.Moreover, the secret to getting rich is less about speed than stability. Many emerging economies have managed to generate spurts of rapid growth, often well above Poland\u2019s 4 percent average, only to lose all their gains by running up debts and heading into a crisis \u2014 like Brazil and Mexico in the early 1980s, and Indonesia and Thailand in the late 1990s.Other emerging economies remain unstable partly because they still rely on exporting raw materials like oil or soybeans, and thus tie their fate to volatile swings in the global commodities market. Among the leading oil exporters, 90 percent are no richer today relative to the United States than they were the year they started producing oil. Most are poorer.Today, of the 13 middle-income countries with average incomes of $10,000 to $15,000, nine are still dependent on commodity exports, including Brazil, Russia and Argentina. The other four are all in Eastern Europe, led by Poland.None of the commodity-dependent economies is likely to grow steadily enough to become the next rich country, certainly not for long. Countries such as Argentina and Venezuela have in the past century become almost as rich as the United States, only to tumble after serial crises.Export manufacturing prowess can stabilize a rising economy by generating reliable foreign revenue, allowing countries to invest heavily without running up huge debts. This is what happened in Poland. An exception is the manufacturing giant of China. In a headlong effort to fuel growth after the 2007 financial crisis, the Chinese government has encouraged a domestic lending boom that has driven up debts to nearly 300 percent of G.D.P., a risk that reduces China\u2019s chances of becoming the next rich country.When Law and Justice took office, however, the concern was that it would derail growth by meddling in the private sector and trying to fulfill costly populist promises. While it has fulfilled pledges to lower the retirement age and subsidize families with two or more children, so far these policies have not caused much harm.The deficit and public debt remain manageable. The currency remains stable, exports continue to boom and the trade balance is in surplus. Since its winning streak began in 1991, around 80 percent of Poland\u2019s growth has been delivered by the private sector, and the momentum there remains strong.So look beyond China and India, Russia and Brazil. Poland, rising the old-fashioned way, through manufacturing, is likely to be the next rich nation. And, as Mr. Trump will see, Poland is a vital ally not only on the NATO front line, but also as a leader of the world\u2019s most vibrant economic bloc.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London\u2019s New Subway Symbolized the Future. Then Came Brexit.", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "Critic\u2019s NotebookCrossrail is a megaproject meant to bind London together. But in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, it may signal the end of an ambitious era.Supported byLONDON \u2014 Up an alley, beyond some hoarding, through what can feel like Harry Potter\u2019s secret portal, the underworld of an unfinished Crossrail station sprawls beneath the traffic and commotion of Tottenham Court Road. Escalator banks descend through a sleek, silent black ticket hall where towering, empty, white-tiled passageways snake toward the new, vaulted train platform, curving like a half moon into the subterranean darkness.But standing one recent morning on that empty Crossrail platform, where construction workers in orange gear and hard hats hauled shiny metal panels to line the walls, I still couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the new train leads toward another glorious era for this city, or signals the end of one.Before Britain voted last summer to leave the European Union, Crossrail was conceived for a London open to the world and speeding into the future. Now, with Brexit, the nightmare scenario is that this massive project, to provide more trains moving more people more quickly through a growing city, ends up moving fewer people more quickly through a shrinking city.It was an especially unpromising sign this spring when Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative government, as if fearing exactly what anti-Brexiters predicted about an economic downturn, issued a campaign manifesto that conspicuously omitted funding for Crossrail 2, the long-planned, $39 billion critical north-south sequel to Crossrail\u2019s east-west line.Since then, the government\u2019s transport secretary has endorsed the project \u2014 provided that the city pay half the whopping cost, upfront. The semi-reversal suggested a grudging acknowledgment that, whatever the political fallout or economic prospects, Britain ultimately needs a thriving London all the more after Brexit.These megaprojects, in different ways, helped remake London into the great global city-state of Europe, a 21st-century melting pot and Sybaris of culture and free-market prosperity \u2014 at the same time that they clearly exacerbated underlying urban inefficiencies and stirred resentment elsewhere in England toward the city.Crossrail was intended as a kind of democratizing corrective, at once shrinking the city and expanding on a vision of London as a great, inclusive metropolis. While it will whisk bankers at new speeds from their office towers and multimillion-dollar aeries to Heathrow, it will also help millions of now-marginalized, lower-income workers, unable to afford runaway home prices in and around the center of the city, to live in cheaper neighborhoods often far from their jobs.And as London goes, so goes Britain.I spent a few days traveling the Crossrail route, trying to decipher what it might mean for London. In one respect, the train underscores and extends the city\u2019s centuries-old, traditional identity as a sprawling, horizontal capital, an agglomeration of disparate, far-flung villages.Extending roughly 70 miles, it is built to speed about 200 million passengers a year in a kind of Y from far to the west of the city, in the county of Berkshire, through Heathrow, to the heart of London, forking east to Shenfield in Essex and to the neighborhood called Abbey Wood, on the historically neglected southeast side of the River Thames. Linked with the existing Underground subway network, it will be rechristened the Elizabeth Line, inserting what is in effect a new steel-and-wheels spine into Britain\u2019s capital.\u201cCrossrail is a culmination of years of serious thinking by experts and public officials about what London needs, the imbalance of east and west and how to unite the city,\u201d said Ricky Burdett, an architect, city adviser and director of LSE Cities at the London School of Economics.London, Mr. Burdett noted, is historically poor in the east, rich in the west and along the periphery, although that east-west distinction has eroded as gentrification has seeped outward. Underserved and long-disconnected East London neighborhoods like Shoreditch and Whitechapel in recent years have become chic and largely unaffordable to many Londoners. The city has added light-rail lines to help some of those areas, but only Crossrail is capable of \u201ctying together many of the developments that have transformed London,\u201d Mr. Burdett said.No development on the west end of the Crossrail line is more ambitious than Heathrow. John Holland-Kaye, the airport\u2019s chief executive officer, met me one morning in an empty conference room near the airport and instantly ticked off some figures.\u201cWhen Crossrail is done, our employees could just as easily come from East London as from our local community,\u201d Mr. Holland-Kaye said. \u201cThe train effectively opens up the whole of the city.\u201dKing\u2019s Cross today is home to an art school, The Guardian, a cluster of high-tech medical research centers and Google\u2019s future European headquarters. The point: Major, long-term infrastructure projects support game-changing investments. Crossrail proves Britain\u2019s continuing commitment to this steel and concrete approach, Mr. Holland-Kaye said.From Heathrow, riders will need just over a half-hour via Crossrail to travel east to Canary Wharf, the defunct docklands turned world financial hub, which today employs more than 112,000 people. When the site opened in the late 1980s, the aptly named Narrow Street was its only real access road. Canary Wharf went belly up. Then London broke ground for the Jubilee subway line, linking Canary Wharf by mass transit to the heart of the city, and international banks started moving in.It illuminated Crossrail.\u201cThe danger with Brexit,\u201d he added, \u201cis that if Britain gets out of the European Union and doesn\u2019t keep the U.K. an attractive place for financial institutions, they will think twice about growing here. The issue isn\u2019t banks leaving Canary Wharf. Most of them have long-term leases. The issue will be the pace of growth.\u201dBut that\u2019s not quite true. Because of Brexit worries, construction plans for several of Canary Wharf\u2019s new buildings have already been put on hold. And long-term leases can always be broken.\u201cThe bottom line is that nobody has the faintest idea yet what the Brexit effect will be,\u201d Tony Travers, a veteran urban policy expert, told me. \u201cInvestments from the European Union may shrink. But why would investors from India or Canada or the United States be put off? If anything, Brexit may make Britain more likely to give them what they want.\u201d\u201cThe trajectory of real estate investment here is not only based on Europeans,\u201d Mr. Burdett stressed.\u201cThamesmead was built on a promise of transit connectivity that never happened,\u201d Teresa Pearce, a member of Parliament who represents the district, told me. \u201cYou see the results.\u201dChange is even more acute one stop before Abbey Wood, in Woolwich. The Berkeley Group, a big British real estate company, is building 5,000 sleek, mostly high-end apartments around the future Crossrail station, which the developer paid millions to help construct.Hugging the Thames, Woolwich is the former site of the Royal Arsenal and Henry VIII\u2019s dockyard, where Charles Darwin\u2019s Beagle was built. Historically working-class, it, too, used to be all white but has come to attract Caribbean and Asian immigrants, with nearly 40 percent of residents today living in social housing. Berkeley\u2019s development and the Woolwich Crossrail station are separated from the rest of Woolwich by a highway called Plumstead Road. On one side of the road, old Woolwich is a warren of modest shops and aged social housing.On the other, baristas now dispense macchiatos on leafy patios. Signs advertise luxury apartments. A single, 31-year-old corporate lawyer employed in the City, Calum Docherty, who is hunting for a home, was intrigued by the Berkeley development. \u201cBut I\u2019m still looking,\u201d he told me. \u201cWoolwich wasn\u2019t anywhere on my radar before Crossrail. The train has expanded my concept of London.\u201cThat said, it\u2019s a bit of a mental jump to commit to borrowing half a million pounds,\u201d he added. \u201cWith Brexit and all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the $20 billion train line opening in London next year. It is one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Europe, but not necessarily the largest. (It bills itself as such, but so does a project in France.) In addition, the article misstated the time period during which New York built four new subway stations. It is nearly three decades, since 1989, not \u201cabout a half-century.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It saves items for customers until they can pay for them. It anticipates their needs with air-conditioners in summer, heaters in winter and roses on Valentine\u2019s Day. And it even offers a self-serve coffee stand where they can linger.\u201cIt\u2019s evolved beyond just being a 99-cent store,\u201d said Habib Abdul Musiwir, the manager of 99\u00a2 & Up Millenium Discount & Party Supply in East New York, whose customers have gone to check out the Dollar Tree stores only to return. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting the needs of the community.\u201dSmall family-owned dollar stores are under enormous pressure to hold onto customers and remain solvent as national chains like Dollar Tree expand their footprint in New York City and elsewhere, a trend underscored by Dollar General\u2019s recent move to open stores in the city for the first time. Some independent stores have emphasized their neighborhood roots, while others have raised prices or tweaked their inventories beyond party supplies and off-brand shampoos to include household staples like bread and milk and even organic foods.But just as supermarket and drugstore chains have reshaped local economies and wiped out many small businesses, dollar store chains are beginning to take over neighborhoods where mom-and-pop dollar stores have traditionally dominated. Many independent store owners and workers say they are facing a bleak future as their customers have more choices, and rising rents and operating costs further cut into their dwindling profits.\u201cThe chains are growing rapidly at the expense of the independents \u2014 when they open up one chain store, they destroy five or 10 independent stores,\u201d said David Emrani, the owner of Pride Products Corporation, which imports general merchandise and distributes it to about 3,000 independent dollar and discount stores nationally, about half the number from a decade ago.Mr. Emrani himself owned six dollar stores on Long Island in 2008, but closed all but one of them after Dollar Tree chain stores opened nearby and not only poached some of his workers but also took away his customers. \u201cYou constantly have to ring up \u2014 if you don\u2019t, you die,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have more and more customers every day to survive.\u201dIn the Bronx, where independent stores compete against one another as well as the chains, the 99\u00a2 Super Star Discount store is not as busy as it used to be, even though it caters to its largely Hispanic and black neighborhood by carrying Goya agua de coco, Jarritos mango drink, canned beans and guava-flavored snacks, said Sam Essaedi, the manager.Across the street, 99-Cent and Up Dollar R Us has raised some of its prices to eke out more profit. Muhammed Showaiv, the manager, counted five dollar stores just in the neighborhood, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough shoppers for the business.\u201dOver all, the dollar store industry is thriving at a time when the brick-and-mortar retail landscape is littered with shuttered stores. Promising deep discounts, these stores flourished during the recession and have continued to multiply at a time of seismic shifts in consumer habits and fierce competition from online retailers, especially Amazon, which recently started offering discounts to poorer families for its Prime membership, which covers the cost of shipping.Nationally, 30,496 dollar stores rang up $33.8 billion in sales of food and household items in 2016, up from 20,543 stores and $14.9 billion in sales a decade earlier, according to Inmar Willard Bishop, a data analytics firm.\u201cDollar stores are figuring out how to get people in,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research company. \u201cThey have done the best job of changing with the consumer than any other retail store.\u201dDollar stores can trace their roots to the mid-1800s, when one-price stores became a popular way to sell clothing, jewelry and knickknacks to thrifty shoppers, said Wendy Woloson, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University. Back then, there were also 25-cent and 49-cent stores. Frank Winfield Woolworth, the founder of F.W. Woolworth Company, later built a chain of five-and-dime stores, starting with a Great Five Cent Store in Utica, N.Y.Today, many dollar stores offer steep discounts by selling leftovers from other retail outlets. But as the stores have evolved, they have also expanded their inventory with bigger chains carrying their own brands and many stores adding perishable foods. Dollar Store Services, a developer of 3,000 independent dollar stores nationally since 1992, recently introduced a model for urban neighborhoods that is part dollar store, part bodega.These no-frills stores have become a refuge for people left behind by the economic recovery, including laid-off workers, middle-class families facing rising living costs and recent college graduates burdened by huge loans. \u201cA lot of customers who traded down to dollar stores can\u2019t trade back up, or see no need, because the dollar stores meet their needs,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, an adjunct professor and director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \u201cTo them, Walmart is a luxury store.\u201dLassina Sanogo, 40, a security guard from the Bronx who earns $30,000 annually, said he always bought his cleaning supplies from a dollar store. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose a dollar,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I used to get for a dollar, now that\u2019s up to two dollars.\u201dThere is no official tally of New York City\u2019s dollar stores. But there were 1,247 variety stores, including dollar stores, in 2015, a 24 percent increase from 1,002 stores in 2005, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College. Brooklyn had the largest number of stores, with 469, followed by Queens, with 355, and the Bronx, with 224.The chains have cropped up in neighborhoods where people are struggling in an ever more expensive city, as the gap between the rich and everyone else keeps widening. In East New York, which is dotted with public housing projects, eager shoppers lined up in May for the opening of a Dollar Tree store, where nothing costs more than $1.\u201cAnytime I\u2019m out, I\u2019ll stop in and see if they have anything new,\u201d said Jeraldine Whitehurst, 54, an unemployed child care worker who shops there three times a week.Along Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn, which is known for a string of 99-cent stores, independent owners are struggling to adapt as families are replaced by singles who shop less often and are more interested in buying organic than in saving a few dollars.\u201cBusiness is very slow,\u201d said Abdul Shran, a clerk at Java Discount, who sees between 20 and 40 customers a day, less than half the traffic of a few years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to make it another month.\u201dEven so, another dollar store opened on the avenue just five months ago. Saul Ahmed, the manager of Super Saver Discount Center, said his store aimed to serve newcomers to the gentrifying area by stocking cheap housewares and hardware, and eventually organic foods.\u201cThis is our way of helping to support the neighborhood,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Braces for Health Showdown With McCain on Hand but a Plan Unclear", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republican leaders, keeping alive their push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, are barreling toward a showdown vote on Tuesday to begin debating a repeal of the health law. And Senator John McCain announced Monday night that he will be on hand to cast his vote, despite a diagnosis of brain cancer.Before Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, announced that he was jetting in to cast what is expected to be a vote in favor of starting debate, President Trump spent Monday ratcheting up pressure on Republican senators to get onboard. Mr. Trump criticized their inaction and warned that they risked betraying seven years\u2019 worth of promises to raze and revamp the health law if they did not.\u201cRemember \u2018repeal and replace,\u2019 \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 \u2014 they kept saying it over and over again,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House, flanked by people who he said suffered as \u201cvictims\u201d of the \u201chorrible disaster known as Obamacare.\u201d\u201cEvery Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut so far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.\u201dTom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, countered, \u201cNo matter how many ways President Trump tries to twist or hide the truth, the facts won\u2019t change: The Affordable Care Act has been a lifesaver for millions of Americans.\u201dThe remarks from Mr. Trump, who has been largely absent from the policy debate, had the ring of a threat by a president who has grown frustrated watching Republicans repeatedly try, and fail, to reach consensus on his campaign promise to immediately roll back the health law and enact a better system.Comparing how the plans would affect key measures like the number of uninsured and the deficit.He said their constituents would exact a price for inaction \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019ll see that at the voter booth, believe me\u201d \u2014 and hinted that any Republican who did not support the bid to open debate on an as-yet-determined health bill would be painted as complicit in preserving a health law passed on the basis of \u201ca big, fat, ugly lie.\u201d\u201cFor Senate Republicans, this is their chance to keep their promise,\u201d Mr. Trump said, repeating the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d mantra on which Republicans campaigned last fall. \u201cThere\u2019s been enough talk and no action; now is the time for action.\u201dAfter months of planning, debating and legislating, much of it behind closed doors, the Senate this week has reached the moment when votes will have to be cast. The big question Monday was what exactly the Senate will be voting on.The fight on the Senate floor will unfold in stages.\u201cMany of us have waited literally years for this moment to finally arrive, and at long last, it has,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor.If that vote succeeds, the Senate would then be able to consider numerous amendments, including complete substitutes for the House bill. But it remains unclear what would take its place, and Senate Republican leaders have not said which substitute measure would be considered first.Under one possible series of events, Mr. McConnell could quickly move to replace the House bill with an entirely new measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.If that amendment vote fails, as it most likely would, he could move to replace the House bill with a version of the proposal he has been refining for weeks: to repeal the health law while also replacing it.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said there would be \u201cendless amendments\u201d if the procedural hurdle were cleared. He played down the significance of which substitute measure would come first.\u201cEverybody will get a vote on everything they want to vote on,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. He added, \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is convince everybody that if they\u2019d like to get a vote on their amendment, then they need to vote to proceed to the House bill.\u201dDemocrats were incredulous.\u201cWe are potentially one or two days away from a vote on a bill that would reorganize one-sixth of the American economy, impacting tens of millions of American lives, and no one knows what it is,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like Alice in Wonderland around here.\u201dWhat they will vote on will not matter if senators oppose beginning debate. Mr. McConnell can lose only two Senate Republicans, now that Mr. McCain intends to be in the chamber.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, is all but certain to vote no on the procedural vote, no matter what legislation Mr. McConnell promises to put before the chamber if the initial hurdle is cleared.While in West Virginia later on Monday, addressing the National Scout Jamboree, Mr. Trump teased the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, about whether he would be able to wrangle support from Ms. Capito and other Republicans. \u201cHe better get them,\u201d Mr. Trump said, smiling at Mr. Price to indicate he was joking \u2014 or at least seemed to be. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Tom, you\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201dHe then added, \u201cYou better get Senator Capito to vote for it.\u201dRepublican leaders are pressuring senators to go along at least with the procedural step, to bring them closer to delivering on their longtime promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which was adopted without any Republican votes.\u201cWhile disagreements remain on the best way to repeal and replace Obamacare, one thing is certain: The American people rightfully expect us to keep our promises and get the job done,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who said he would vote to begin debate.The repeal bill is being considered under special expedited procedures that apply to certain budget-related legislation. These rules limit debate, preclude a filibuster and allow passage with a simple majority vote. However, the rules stipulate that provisions of the bill can be removed if they would not change federal spending or revenue, or if the budgetary effects are \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to a policy objective.The Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, who serves as a sort of referee, has made a preliminary finding that a number of provisions of Mr. McConnell\u2019s repeal-and-replace bill appear to violate Senate rules.These provisions would, for example, cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood for one year; prohibit the use of federal subsidies to buy insurance that includes coverage for abortions; and require people who have experienced a gap in insurance to wait six months before obtaining coverage in the individual market.If a senator objects to any of these provisions, the presiding officer could sustain the objection, following the parliamentarian\u2019s advice. Republicans would then need 60 votes to keep that provision in the bill \u2014 a nearly impossible threshold for any significant issue.Reporting was contributed by Jennifer Steinhauer, Robert Pear and Avantika Chilkoti in Washington, and Peter Baker in Glen Jean, W.Va.Advertisement"}

A grove of Sottsass\u2019s looming ceramic totems, built from cylinders glazed in many colors, are in a gallery painted marigold yellow, alongside tiny Indian stupas with similarly stacked structures. The remaining Sottsass ceramics here mostly lose out to the antiquities, except for the more delicate, Deco-like black-and-silver vases of the Tenebre (Darkness) series from 1963.Initially a devotee of modernism, Sottsass designed one of its postwar classics: the Olivetti manual typewriter of 1968, intoxicatingly bright and enshrined in the Museum of Modern Art by 1969. Its form-follows-function economy is articulated by its magnetic color, but it was eventually cursed by its creator for overshadowing his other achievements (in an expletive probably never before seen in a Met wall text).The Met\u2019s insistence on mixing and matching, always pushing the relevance of its vast holdings to more contemporary developments, may become a tick. (It certainly diluted the recent show of Marsden Hartley\u2019s Maine paintings.) Mr. Larsen\u2019s add-ons here are usually effective and they point up a strength of this tactic: singling out historical works you might otherwise have missed in the flow of the collection galleries, like the terrific little painted-wood reliquary from New Kingdom Egypt that resembles a Romanesque chapel.Mr. Larsen has some revelatory decoy maneuvers. A black-and-white cane armchair from 1903 by Hoffmann and Moser is accompanied by what initially appears to be a Werkst\u00e4tte oddity but is actually a wood planter that Sottsass designed in 1961, more straightforward and less refined. One of the best juxtapositions is a vitrine that alternates three Sottsass glass objects with three kachina figures by unrecorded Hopi artists whose colorful geometric forms clearly relate. And the kachinas come racing back to mind in one of the high points in the show\u2019s final gallery: the akimbo, symmetrical semaphore of Sottsass\u2019s Carlton Room Divider, a standout from the 1981 Milan furniture fair. Here Sottsass, as in his other Memphis pieces, achieves a new friction between form and function, while slyly merging painting, sculpture and furniture with the spirit of architecture.The not-always-pertinent non-Sottsass material means that this exhibition sometimes feels padded. Sottsass could easily have filled the space at the Met Breuer if there had been more lead time. Nonetheless, it provides an invaluable introduction to his complex, resonating achievement.Advertisement"}

He worked for 13 years on drilling rigs at a crude oil company near his home in Dorton, Ky. Then it halted production, and he was laid off. At 33, with two children and a mortgage, he couldn\u2019t find a stable new job of the kind he had trained for, because all the oil and coal mining companies in the area were shutting down.Then things changed. He found a 16-week retraining program where he learned to program the computer numerical control, or CNC, machines used in advanced manufacturing. He got a job at a Lockheed Martin factory nearby, and it paid even more than his old one. \u201cIt was a little bit different, but it was easy for me,\u201d said Mr. Cornett, now 36. \u201cI worked with my hands in the oil fields doing things of that nature, so it was pretty easy to catch on.\u201dIf his story\u2019s ending sounds like a fairy tale, that\u2019s because it is for many workers like Mr. Cornett \u2014 people without college degrees who work in occupations that are shrinking, with few other local options for the skills they have. \u201cThe U.S. faces a serious skills gap,\u201d R. Alexander Acosta, the secretary of labor, said last month when the Trump administration introduced steps to address the challenge.But many of the skills needed to do fading jobs are applicable to growing jobs. A big part of the problem is the labor market does a poor job of matching employers with employees \u2014 in hiring, and in educating and retraining them to meet employers\u2019 needs.\u201cTo solve this problem, people will need to have more skills, but the generation of skills is more an effect than a cause,\u201d said Byron Auguste, co-founder of Opportunity@Work, a nonprofit for job seekers with nontraditional backgrounds. \u201cIt works for half our work force but not for the other half.\u201d\u201cThey have skills in what they do, but I\u2019m not sure they have other skills that are transferable to something else,\u201d said Rome Aloise, an international vice president for the Teamsters, which represents various workers whose jobs could be automated, including truck drivers and cashiers. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure where all these people would go.\u201dMeanwhile, employers hire based on credentials that job applicants can\u2019t change \u2014 a college degree or previous job title \u2014 rather than assessing the skills an applicant has developed, said Mr. Auguste, who was an economic adviser in the Obama administration.

{"Headline": "North Korea Tests a Ballistic Missile That Experts Say Could Hit California", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorth Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday that, for the first time, appeared capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States, according to experts \u2014 a milestone that American presidents have long declared the United States could not tolerate.The launch, the second of an intercontinental missile in 24 days, did not answer the question of whether the North has mastered all the technologies necessary to deliver a nuclear weapon to targets in the lower 48 states. But just a few days ago, the Defense Intelligence Agency warned the Trump administration that the North would probably be able to do so within a year, and Friday\u2019s test left little doubt that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is speeding toward that goal.The missile launched on Friday remained aloft for roughly 47 minutes, according to American, South Korean and Japanese officials, following a steep trajectory that took it roughly 2,300 miles into space. It then turned and arced sharply down into the sea near the northernmost Japanese island, Hokkaido.If that trajectory had been flattened out \u2014 a step the North may have avoided for fear of provoking an American military response \u2014 the missile could have put a number of major American cities at risk, experts say. The Pentagon was quick to declare that the \u201cNorth American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\u201d That statement, while true, ignored the potential long-term implications of the launch.\u201cDepending on how heavy a warhead it carries, this latest North Korean missile would easily reach the West Coast of the United States with a range of 9,000 to 10,000 kilometers,\u201d or 5,600 to 6,200 miles, said Kim Dong-yub, a defense analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul. \u201cWith this missile, North Korea leaves no doubt that its missile has a range that covers most of the United States.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s official news agency said Saturday that Kim Jong-un had called the test a \u201cstern warning\u201d to the United States. He also boasted that the North was \u201ccapable of the surprise launching of an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time and from anywhere and that all of the mainland United States is within the range of our missiles.\u201dIn a break with past practice, the White House turned out a statement in the name of President Trump, but it made no mention of the distance the missile flew or its implications. It read like many of President Barack Obama\u2019s and President George W. Bush\u2019s statements at similar moments.\u201cBy threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.\u201dMr. Trump hoped to end North Korea\u2019s provocations with the help of China, and he thought he had an agreement with President Xi Jinping to pressure Mr. Kim. But over the past two months, Mr. Trump discovered, as his predecessors did, that the Chinese are more concerned about preventing the collapse of North Korea\u2019s government, and the chaos that would ensue, than they are in trade and energy sanctions that might truly change its behavior.On Saturday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the North Korean missile test, but it also urged other countries to avoid responding in ways that could set off any tit-for-tat retaliation.Mr. Geng urged North Korea to abide by the United Nations Security Council resolutions banning its missile and nuclear tests, and said that North Korea should \u201chalt any actions that may lead to a further escalation of tensions on the peninsula.\u201d But Mr. Geng added, \u201cAt the same time, it is hoped that all parties act prudently, and prevent a spiraling escalation of tensions.\u201dShi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that the Chinese government would interpret the test as affirmation of its view that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward North Korea were failing.But China has not been able to change Mr. Kim\u2019s behavior either, Mr. Shi said. China has not demonstrated an ability \u201cto persuade Kim Jong-un to abandon what he is determined to do,\u201d he said.For Mr. Trump, the launch poses one of the biggest challenges of his presidency. Like Bill Clinton, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama before him, Mr. Trump declared that the North would not succeed in obtaining a missile that could put American cities at risk. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen,\u201d he declared in a Jan. 2 tweet, not long after Mr. Obama warned him that the North would probably pose the most urgent national security threat he would face.But such estimates are always subject to uncertainty. North Korea\u2019s aim is famously poor and it is unclear how long it would take the country to build a workable nuclear warhead that can survive re-entry into the atmosphere.And Dr. Wright cautioned that Western analysts have no idea how much the payload on the missile weighed. \u201cIf it was lighter than the actual warhead the missile would carry,\u201d he noted, the calculated ranges for a real warhead would be shorter.The Pentagon confirmed only that the missile was an ICBM, which means that it was capable of traveling at least 5,500 kilometers, or about 3,400 miles. Pentagon officials said that it was airborne for more than 40 minutes.Hours after the test, the United States and South Korea launched ballistic missiles off the east coast of the South on Saturday to test their abilities to counter the North. The drill involved the United States Army Tactical Missile System and the South\u2019s Hyunmoo-2 missile.It was not disclosed how many missiles were launched, but a video released by the United States\u2019 Eighth Army showed three fired from missile-launch vehicles.The exercise was in direct response to the North Korean missile test, Pentagon officials said.North Korea conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-14, on July 4, calling it a \u201cgift package for the Yankees.\u201d South Korean officials said that the July 4 test demonstrated that the missile was capable of reaching Alaska, but that it remained unclear whether the North had the capability of launching a nuclear strike against the contiguous United States.On Saturday in Seoul, the South Korean military said in a statement the latest test involved \u201ca more advanced ICBM-class missile\u201d than the July 4 launch.The South Korean military said that Friday\u2019s missile was launched from Jagang Province, a mountainous north-central area of North Korea bordering China, at 11:41 p.m. local time.South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in, called an emergency meeting of his National Security Council and ordered his military to conduct joint ballistic missile tests with the United States military in a \u201cstrong show of power,\u201d his office said. Similar missile exercises were held after the North\u2019s July 4 launch.The growing North Korean threat also prompted Mr. Moon to reverse his decision to halt deployment of an advanced United States missile defense system known as Thaad. In a statement issued early Saturday, he told his military to push ahead with it.North Korea is a closed society, and the secrecy of its government makes it difficult to tell exactly how far its weapons programs have advanced. But experts believe it is not yet capable of making nuclear warheads suitable for mounting on ICBMs.South Korean defense officials have said since the July 4 test that it was too early to determine whether North Korea had mastered long-range missile technology, especially re-entry, when a warhead must survive intense heat and the destruction of its outer shell as it plunges through the atmosphere from space.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of North Korea\u2019s leader. He is Kim Jong-un, not Kim Jung-un.Reporting was contributed by Helene Cooper, Jane Perlez, Chris Buckley and Eileen Sullivan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Showers Myanmar With Attention, as Trump Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 When Myanmar\u2019s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, wanted to hold a peace conference to end her country\u2019s long-burning insurgencies, a senior Chinese diplomat went to work.The official assembled scores of rebel leaders, many with longstanding connections to China, briefed them on the peace gathering and flew them on a chartered plane to Myanmar\u2019s capital. There, after being introduced to a beaming Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, they were wined and dined, and sang rowdy karaoke late into the night.A cease-fire may still be a long way off, but the gesture neatly illustrates how Myanmar, a former military dictatorship that the United States worked hard to press toward democracy, is now depending on China to help solve its problems.The pieces all fell into place for China: It wanted peace in Myanmar to protect its new energy investments, it had the leverage to press the rebels and it found an opening to do a favor for Myanmar to deliver peace.China is now able to play its natural role in Myanmar in a more forceful way than ever before as the United States under the Trump administration steps back from more than six years of heavy engagement in Myanmar, including some tentative contacts with some of the rebels. The vacuum left by the United States makes China\u2019s return all the easier.When Myanmar began to adopt democratic reforms in 2011, the Obama administration quickly reciprocated, loosening sanctions as part of a broader effort to strengthen relationships with Southeast Asian nations as a bulwark against China\u2019s rise.As Myanmar\u2019s relations with China cooled, the result of what many saw as heavy-handed intervention by Beijing, Barack Obama became, in 2012, the first American president to visit the country. He came again in 2014, promoting stronger trade and security relations, and counted Myanmar\u2019s opening as a foreign policy coup.But the United States did little to build on the new relationship, and now the tables have turned. As the Trump administration pays little attention, China is exercising strategic and economic interests that come from geographic proximity, using deep pockets for building billion-dollar infrastructure and activating ethnic ties with some of the rebel groups, all areas where the United States cannot compete.\u201cChina wants to show: \u2018We are doing our best at your behest,\u2019\u201d said Min Zin, executive director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy in Myanmar, who attended the peace gathering in May. \u201cAs the United States recedes, Aung San Suu Kyi is relying more and more on China in Myanmar and on the international stage.\u201dAnd not only Myanmar. Across Southeast Asia, China is energetically bringing nations into its orbit, wooing American friends and allies with military hardware, infrastructure deals and diplomatic attention.But nowhere is China\u2019s effort to win over Myanmar clearer than as mediator in Myanmar\u2019s ethnic civil wars, the mission Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi says is dearest to her heart.China is well positioned to help. Among the armed groups most resistant to peace talks are the United Wa State Army and the Kokang Army, both of which have been tacitly supported by China for years in their battles with the Myanmar military.The Wa, whose army is said to have 20,000 members, use Chinese currency in their autonomous region, where illegal narcotics are made and exported into China. Two Wa arms factories produce weapons with the help of former Chinese Army officers, and the Wa have received Chinese armored combat vehicles and tank destroyers, probably through Chinese middlemen, experts say.A third group, the Arakan Army, uses Chinese arms and vehicles provided by the Wa.China\u2019s special envoy for Asian affairs, Sun Guoxiang, brought the leaders of all three to the peace conference, as well as the leaders of four other rebel groups, most of whom use Chinese weapons.\u201cChina wants quiet in Myanmar,\u201d said Maung Aung Myoe, an expert on the Myanmar military at the International University of Japan. \u201cIt hurts their interests to have fighting because it disrupts China\u2019s trade. China now owns the peace process. The Myanmar military knows that.\u201dThe stakes are rising as a Chinese state-owned corporation negotiates final permissions to build a $7.3 billion deep-sea port at Kyaukpyu, a port town in Rakhine that will give China highly prized access to the Indian Ocean.Citic Construction of China is to start building the port early next year, having won the contract by covering 85 percent of the cost, said Oo Maung, vice chairman of the Kyaukpyu special economic zone management committee. Citic also won the right to build a $3.2 billion industrial park nearby, he said.The United States generally leaves construction projects and other investments abroad to private companies, and Myanmar, a frontier economy fraught with risks, is considered an unattractive destination, said Mary P. Callahan, associate professor of international studies at the University of Washington.\u201cAmerican companies haven\u2019t come because of the high price of land, and a difficult approval process,\u201d she said. \u201cThe labor force is cheap but not skilled.\u201dAmerica\u2019s loss may be China\u2019s strategic gain. China\u2019s ownership of the port \u2014 Citic will have the right to operate it for 50 years, with a possible 25-year extension \u2014 hands Beijing a giant boost in its long-term plans for supremacy in the Indian Ocean, analysts said.Once completed, \u201cKyaukpyu will be a Chinese naval base,\u201d said Mr. Maung Aung Myoe, the military analyst. \u201cChina desperately needs access on the eastern side of the Indian Ocean.\u201dChina is already building Indian Ocean ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and it is seeking approval for one in Bangladesh.Some hurdles remain. Frustration with China roils the scruffy town of Kyaukpyu, among the poorest in Myanmar. After a decade of Chinese pipeline construction in the area, ordinary people say they received few benefits. The schools built by China as part of a corporate responsibility project were empty shells, they said.\u201cI got a few cents a day for digging the pipeline and about $250 for the five-year use of my land,\u201d said Tun Aung Kyaw, 56, a farmer who was walking to herd his six cows in bare feet, a thin tarpaulin tied across his bare chest to protect him from the monsoon rain.Citic is aware of the hostility and is working with nongovernmental organizations in Kyaukpyu to avoid past mistakes, Mr. Yuan said. Citic will train Myanmar workers for 3,000 jobs for the park and the port, he said.A confidant of hers and a member of her political party, Mi Khun Chan, said China viewed aiding the peace process as part of the cost of winning a green light for the dam.For all the misgivings among her people about China, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi seems impressed with Beijing\u2019s power to assist in peace.Her father, Aung San, the leader of Burma after World War II, dreamed of a united country. He almost got there, presiding over an agreement with ethnic leaders in 1947 for a federation of states. Six months later he was assassinated.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi wants to finish the job. \u201cOur goal is the emergence of a democratic federal union based on democracy and federalism,\u201d she said at the opening of the peace conference.For the moment, she has China at her side.Wai Moe contributed reporting, and Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wisconsin\u2019s Lavish Lure for Foxconn: $3 Billion in Tax Subsidies", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFoxconn\u2019s plan for a $10 billion factory in Wisconsin is certainly good news for President Trump and Republican politicians Gov. Scott Walker and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose district the plant would call home.But the deal with Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier, comes with a heavy price tag for Wisconsin taxpayers: $3 billion in state tax credits that dwarf the typical incentive package companies receive from local governments.Even as Mr. Walker celebrated the news with Foxconn executives at a rally at the Milwaukee Art Museum on Thursday, experts on the political left and right alike said the rewards were not justified by the cost of the tax breaks.Over all, the subsidies for the Foxconn plant, which would produce flat-panel display screens for televisions and other consumer electronics, equal $15,000 to $19,000 per job annually.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very costly package, and I\u2019m skeptical that the benefits justify such big incentives,\u201d Mr. Bartik said. \u201cThis is well beyond the typical deal.\u201dThe White House and Wisconsin officials said Foxconn\u2019s investment will create at least 3,000 jobs initially, with up to 22,000 more coming indirectly in the future as suppliers spring up and other local businesses benefit from the new plant.If Foxconn lives up to its investment commitment and receives the full $3 billion tax break, it will be the fourth-largest incentive deal in United States history, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group in Washington that tracks economic development subsidies.\u201cWe can only describe this as a gift from Wisconsin taxpayers to Foxconn shareholders,\u201d Mr. LeRoy said. \u201cThis is a guaranteed loser for the state.\u201dLuring a high-tech, growing manufacturer like Foxconn will deliver economic gains for the state, especially for once-thriving factory towns in Mr. Ryan\u2019s district, like Racine and Kenosha. At the event on Thursday in Milwaukee, Mr. Walker cheered the project as \u201ctransformational\u201d for Wisconsin and acknowledged the state\u2019s significant financial commitment.\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than anything we\u2019ve done before,\u201d Mr. Walker said of the incentives. \u201cBut if you want to play in the big leagues, it\u2019s comparable with just about every other major financial incentive like this for a major project anywhere \u2014 not only in this country, but around the world.\u201dFoxconn executives approached the White House in the spring to talk about an array of policy issues, and began meeting regularly with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Reed Cordish, a top technology and innovation adviser, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss private talks.The company identified several states \u2014 including Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin \u2014 that would be potential sites for its facility, and Mr. Kushner and Mr. Cordish facilitated meetings between Foxconn executives and officials from those states. They hosted meetings at the White House between company executives and Mr. Walker and Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, the official said.But White House officials played no role in negotiations between Foxconn and state officials, leaving it to the company to determine which state would be most favorable as a location.Mr. Walker first contacted Mr. Ryan last month about the possibility of luring Foxconn to Wisconsin, and over the next few weeks, they began negotiating with Terry Gou, Foxconn\u2019s chairman, and executives to encourage them to choose the area, according to an aide to Mr. Ryan.Foxconn executives traveled to Washington later in the month to discuss the potential move to Wisconsin, and a few weeks later, Mr. Walker and Mr. Ryan, along with state elected officials, had dinner with Foxconn executives to hammer out details.Aides to Mr. Ryan also lobbied state officials including Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin assembly, to support an incentive package for Foxconn, and met with executives to talk about federal work force development and training programs that would be available if they made the move, a topic that Mr. Cordish had also emphasized in his meetings with Mr. Gou.A special session of the Wisconsin legislature is planned to approve the incentive package, which is projected to cost $200 million to $250 million per year. The tax benefits would be contingent on Foxconn\u2019s actual hiring and investment.Still, the package hardly conforms to the kind of fiscal conservatism that Mr. Walker and Mr. Ryan have long espoused.\u201cObviously, there is a strong desire for the state to land a company as big as Foxconn,\u201d said Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation in Washington. \u201cBut they\u2019re also forgoing the opportunity to make a more competitive landscape for other businesses.\u201dMr. Walker has been a lightning rod for Democrats after successfully taking on public employee unions in bitter state budget battles and backing cuts in government spending, and liberal experts were quick to criticize him on Thursday for providing Foxconn with billions in aid.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit with a governor that said we can\u2019t spend much money,\u201d said Martin Baily, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a member of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThis is a guy who decimated the University of Wisconsin by budget cuts. On the one hand, he\u2019s saying we can spend billions to pay Foxconn, but what about our own prized educational institution?\u201dMr. Baily added, \u201cIt certainly could be a boost to the economy, but it\u2019s just a big, big price to pay.\u201dFoxconn has expanded its ambitions in the flat-panel display industry in recent years, including acquiring Sharp, the big Japanese panel maker, last year.The Taiwanese company\u2019s main publicly traded unit, Hon Hai Precision Industry, has spent about $9.5 billion worldwide on all of its capital investments over the past five years.Foxconn is proposing to spend roughly the same amount \u2014 $10 billion over the next six years \u2014 just to build the Wisconsin plant. The company has also promised to spend billions around the world in the next few years.In 2012, the company said it would invest up to $10 billion to produce electronics in Indonesia. Two years later, it shaved that commitment down to $1 billion. No plant has been built.In a statement, Foxconn said the incentives had played a key role in the company\u2019s decision to locate in Wisconsin, along with the state\u2019s \u201ctalented, hardworking workforce, and a long track record in advanced manufacturing.\u201d\u201cCo-investment in large projects by the governments in the locations where we invest are essential for our company and any company in our industry that is committing billions of dollars for a greenfield project,\u201d Foxconn said.Unlike Wisconsin, Foxconn said, other states like Pennsylvania and countries like India and Indonesia had not given the company the incentives it considers necessary to make the projects work.Big companies like Foxconn possess leverage to extract concessions from state governments that smaller firms cannot, said Carl Davis, research director at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington.\u201cThis is not a comprehensive strategy for economic development,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Wisconsin were going to offer this kind of subsidy for every employer within its borders, the state would be bankrupt.\u201dVindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Reform, Reagan Style, May Be a Tougher Fit for Trump", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAs Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, put it this week, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move on to tax reform so we have a competitive tax system,\u201d and do it \u201cpretty quickly.\u201d The House Ways and Means Committee continued hearings on tax legislation on Wednesday.The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration, all anxious to demonstrate that a party that controls the White House and both houses of Congress can accomplish something significant and deliver on at least one major campaign promise.So what would be the elements of a tax reform plan that is fair and simple and will stimulate growth \u2014 not to mention attract at least 50 Republican votes in the Senate?A good place to start, say many Republicans and Democrats, is the Tax Reform Act of 1986, enacted under President Ronald Reagan with bipartisan support.Almost everyone, it now seems, loves it.\u201cPresident Reagan was willing to lead on tax reform,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs a result of that leadership and three years of difficult work in Congress, the United States emerged with one of the most modern, fair and competitive tax systems in the developed world \u2014 one that laid the foundation for decades of American job growth.\u201dByron Dorgan, a former Democratic senator and representative from North Dakota, and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee that approved the 1986 bill, wrote in The Hill this year: \u201cIt was widely celebrated as a major success. We eliminated many deductions and special deals in the tax code, used the savings to substantially lower the top tax rate to 28 percent, and also simplified the tax code.\u201dThe 1986 reform also achieved the elusive goal of being \u201crevenue neutral\u201d (meaning it neither expanded the deficit nor entailed an overall tax increase) even as it cut the top individual rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. The top corporate rate declined to 34 percent, at the time the lowest corporate rate in the developed world, from 46 percent. The legislation offset the loss of revenue by broadening the base \u2014 eliminating a host of deductions, exemptions and credits, including many abusive tax shelters. It also greatly simplified returns for millions of taxpayers.Legislators sold the bill to voters as a fair, efficient, simple spur to economic growth, and it proved enormously popular, one of Reagan\u2019s enduring accomplishments. The economy (and the stock market) soared. But over the years, much of it was undone as lobbyists and special interests pushed new preferences into the tax code.As Mr. Brady said this week: \u201cAmerica now has one of the most costly, unfair, and uncompetitive tax systems in the world. The need for pro-growth tax reform is urgent.\u201dSo why not go back to 1986 and simply restore the principle that worked so well then \u2014 lower tax rates, along with a broader base that avoids increasing the deficit?It turns out that many people have tried. The most recent example came in 2014, with tax reform legislation drafted by the Ways and Means Committee, led at the time by Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, a Republican who retired from politics in 2015. The legislation followed 30 congressional hearings dedicated to tax reform and 11 separate bipartisan tax reform working groups led by Mr. Camp and Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, then the ranking Democrat on the committee.The Camp reform proposal cut rates and closed loopholes. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would lead to the creation of 1.8 million jobs and add up to $3.4 trillion to the gross domestic product without adding to the deficit. The committee estimated that the bill would save an average middle-class family of four $1,300 per year in federal taxes.\u201cI took as inspiration the 1986 act,\u201d Mr. Camp told me this week. \u201cWe adopted the same structure and approach. We reduced rates and broadened the base. I felt good about that.\u201dMr. Camp\u2019s effort drew bipartisan praise. \u201cI applaud it,\u201d said C. Eugene Steuerle, a co-founder and fellow of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a key architect of the 1986 reform act and former deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy. While it needed a few amendments, he said, over all \u201cit was rigorous, based on clear principles, and didn\u2019t rely on magic money\u201d to avoid expanding the deficit.The Camp bill never even made it to the House floor.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go back to 1986 today,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a professor and tax specialist at Columbia and Yale law schools who has written extensively about the 1986 act. Then, there were numerous tax shelters, loopholes and other sources of revenue. Today, \u201cthere\u2019s no pot of gold to pay for the cuts, the way there was back in 1986,\u201d Mr. Graetz said.Even though it nominally cut corporate rates, the 1986 act actually shifted much of the tax burden from individuals to corporations. That\u2019s not feasible today, where lowering the tax burden on corporations is a major goal.That was a reality that Mr. Camp had to confront. \u201cThe Camp plan turned out to be a reality test,\u201d Mr. Graetz said. \u201cThere was a lot of pain in the Camp bill in terms of eliminating tax deductions and credits. And that only got you to a 25 percent corporate rate. President Obama used to say he could get us to 28 percent, also with a lot of pain. But it\u2019s hard to get the business community excited about 28 percent or 25 percent, especially now that the U.K. is moving to 17 percent and Canada is close to that.\u201dAnd Mr. Camp\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t able to lower individual rates much at all \u2014 devising three brackets, taxed at 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But it phased out certain deductions and exemptions for people making over $400,000 a year. The Tax Foundation calculated that some taxpayers making more than $400,000 would pay a marginal rate as high as 43.8 percent, in effect a tax increase on the wealthy. It also hit rich taxpayers by lowering the cap on mortgage deductions to $500,000, from $1 million.And the Camp plan actually raised the top effective rate on capital gains and dividends to 24.8 percent, from 23.8 percent, according to the Tax Foundation.That was anathema to many Republicans.Some of the \u201cpain\u201d inflicted by the Camp plan also hits especially close to the Trump White House, since it proposed closing some of the biggest loopholes for real estate developers. Mr. Camp\u2019s plan eliminated the break for so-called like-kind exchanges, which many real estate developers use to delay or avoid capital gains tax.And the Camp plan proposed longer depreciation schedules, reducing the deductions that businesses can take for capital investment and thus increasing taxes for most real estate developers. The Trump plan calls for immediate expensing of 100 percent of capital costs, eliminating depreciation altogether \u2014 an enormous windfall for real estate interests.It should probably come as no surprise that one person who didn\u2019t like the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was Mr. Trump. \u201cOne of the worst ideas in recent history,\u201d was how he described it in a 1999 op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal.Suffice it to say that anything resembling the 1986 act would appear to be dead on arrival with this administration and Congress, even though many tax experts support such an approach.\u201cCamp\u2019s approach is what responsible tax reform should look like, and he garnered no support from either Republicans or Democrats,\u201d Mr. Graetz said.That doesn\u2019t mean people are giving up hope. \u201cI\u2019m still optimistic we can conclude tax reform this year,\u201d said Mr. Camp, now a senior policy adviser at the tax, accounting and consulting firm PwC. He\u2019s been encouraged that Trump administration officials have recently reached out to him.\u201cThe issues are difficult but it\u2019s not nearly as partisan as health care,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of work done on tax policy over the years, and I think we can build on that. Most people agree there\u2019s an urgent need for tax reform, and I see this as a tremendous opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this column characterized a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Wednesday incorrectly. It was the latest of the committee\u2019s hearings on tax reform, not the first.The Common Sense column on Friday, about the legacy of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, misstated the year in which The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed article by Donald J. Trump criticizing that legislation. It was 1999, not 1986.First in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might take.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Russian Developer Helps Out the Kremlin on Occasion. Was He a Conduit to Trump?", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russian Island, near the port city of Vladivostok in the far east, was a decaying former military base and home to a scattering of cattle when President Vladimir V. Putin suddenly envisioned it as a $1.2 billion campus where he could welcome heads of state for an Asia-Pacific conference.That sent Kremlin officials scrambling to find a developer to transform a site lacking fresh water, a pier or roads. They rejected numerous bids before one of them took a flier on a man known mostly for his glamorous shopping malls: Aras Agalarov of the Crocus Group.Not long after, Mr. Putin pinned a blue-ribboned state medal, the Order of Honor, on Mr. Agalarov\u2019s chest at a dazzling Kremlin ceremony. Soon, a string of demanding, more prominent projects followed: a stretch of superhighway ringing Moscow; two troubled stadiums for the 2018 World Cup, including one in a Baltic swamp.Mr. Agalarov, 61, also worked on a project with a future president, Donald J. Trump. Last week, the Russian developer and his crooner son and heir, Emin, were thrust into the swirl of speculation about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election.\u201cThis is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d wrote Rob Goldstone, a music producer and publicist working for Emin.The American attorney for the Agalarovs, Scott S. Balber, contradicted Mr. Goldstone\u2019s version, asserting in an interview that the senior Mr. Agalarov\u2019s role was merely a matter of an introduction. \u201cPeople in the business world do favors for each other all the time. As a courtesy to a lawyer they had a relationship with, they made an introduction,\u201d Mr. Balber said. \u201cWe were not in possession of damaging info. We had no reason to believe this was in relation to the Russian government.\u201dWhile there is no indication beyond what was said in the emails that the Agalarovs were serving as a conduit between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, wealthy and well-connected businessmen are often called on to do the bidding of the Russian government.Kremlin analysts stress that its red, crenelated walls conceal not a well-oiled machine but a hornet\u2019s nest of interests and influences competing to dominate an Erector Set of ad hoc policies and sudden opportunities, many of them highly lucrative.When it comes to exploiting those opportunities, the Kremlin often ignores its own bureaucrats, diplomats and other agents in favor of someone it thinks will get the job done \u2014 a charmed group whose members rise and fall in status along with their usefulness to Mr. Putin and his top aides.In that context, analysts find it entirely plausible that the Kremlin would tap Mr. Agalarov, a construction tycoon with a web of contacts to Mr. Trump, as a way to pass information to the Trump presidential campaign.\u201cIn a sense, almost no one is a direct agent of the Kremlin, but almost anyone can become one if the need arises,\u201d said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.Aleksei A. Navalny, the leading opposition figure in Russia and an anticorruption campaigner, says he has no doubt that the Agalarovs would do the bidding of the Kremlin if asked.In a blog post, Mr. Navalny refers to Yuri Chaika, the Russian state prosecutor \u2014 a position equivalent to the United States attorney general \u2014 whom Mr. Goldstone identified in his emails as the source of the information on offer at the Trump Tower meeting. Mr. Chaika, a staunch Putin loyalist, has been in that position since 2006.In the view of Mr. Navalny, a bitter opponent of Mr. Putin, it makes perfect sense that information passed from the Kremlin through Mr. Chaika and Mr. Agalarov to Mr. Trump, as the security services could easily have used such a trusted channel to reach out to the Trump campaign.That is no more than informed speculation, yet there are deep connections among the men. After Mr. Navalny released a documentary in 2015 accusing Mr. Chaika of corruption, for example, Mr. Agalarov rose to his defense. Writing in the newspaper Kommersant, he said the film mixed fact and fiction and echoed the work of Joseph Goebbels, the chief Nazi propagandist.Ms. Veselnitskaya has done legal work connected to real estate for Mr. Agalarov\u2019s company in Russia, said Mr. Balber, the family lawyer.Mr. Trump entered this circle with the 2013 Miss Universe contest, carried out with the help of lower-level bureaucrats and Mr. Agalarov, who paid $20 million to bring the pageant to his family\u2019s Moscow concert pavilion, Crocus City Hall.It would be natural for the Kremlin, aware of that relationship, to reach down to that level to try to get something done with the Trump campaign, analysts said.\u201cIf you are a business person, you are supposed to do something that the Kremlin asks you; you are otherwise free to pursue your own interests. That is how Russia works,\u201d said Mrs. Schulmann, noting that most would be eager to respond to any such call as an expression of loyalty.In this particular case, the Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying it was not in touch with Mr. Agalarov and did not even know the lawyer, Ms. Veselnitskaya. It is unclear precisely what was discussed at the meeting with members of the Trump team. Participants have said that it dealt largely with an American law called the Magnitsky Act, which blacklists those suspected of human rights abuses in Russia, and a ban on the adoption of Russian children, and that nothing of significance was given to the campaign.Mr. Agalarov, in a Russian radio interview, called the story around the meeting \u2014 that it was about information damaging to Hillary Clinton \u2014 a \u201cfabrication.\u201dThe Crocus Group did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Agalarov.For Mr. Agalarov, the involvement in the Trump administration\u2019s Russia scandal is at best an unwelcome diversion in a career of steady if not always spectacular success.He was born in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, then part of the Soviet Union, where he studied computer engineering and was a member of the Baku City Committee of the Communist Party.He went to Moscow to study, and even before the collapse of the Soviet Union began trying to fill pent-up Russian demand for Western goods, especially computers.What started as a modest trading company grew into a business organizing trade fairs that eventually mushroomed into the Crocus Group, a real estate empire that encompasses mammoth shopping malls, a chain of hypermarkets, an exposition center, restaurants, luxury housing developments and other enterprises.\u201cHe is not the biggest retail guy, but Crocus City Mall was the first luxury mall to appear in Moscow,\u201d said Darrell Stanaford, a 20-year veteran of the Russian real estate world as the former managing director in Moscow for the CBRE Group, a Los Angeles-based commercial real estate firm. \u201cHe likes the glitz. It is high-end luxury, so that is why he becomes such a good matchup for Trump.\u201dAside from the 2013 Miss Universe contest, it is not known what business ties, if any, the Agalarovs have with Mr. Trump, or with any other American companies. They clearly have an affinity for the United States, however, naming one chain of shopping malls \u201cVegas\u201d and another luxury residential complex \u201cManhattan.\u201dIn November 2013, after the buzz of the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow had subsided, Mr. Trump met privately with a group of elite Russian businessmen, including the head of Russia\u2019s state-owned Sberbank at one of the Nobu restaurants in Moscow.The elder Mr. Agalarov had been talking with Mr. Trump about building a Trump Tower in Moscow as part of a $3 billion real estate project involving hotels, a shopping center and office space.Sberbank was ready to make it happen. About a week after the meeting, the bank announced a \u201cstrategic cooperation agreement\u201d with the Crocus Group to finance about 70 percent of the ambitious project, including, potentially, a building bearing the Trump name.\u201cIt was one of the 14 buildings that we planned to build here,\u201d Mr. Agalarov\u2019s son Emin said in a March interview with Forbes, adding that if Mr. Trump \u201chadn\u2019t run for president, we would probably be in the construction phase today.\u201dThe Sberbank financing \u2014 reported at the time as the biggest real estate development loan the bank had made \u2014 was another measure of the Agalarovs\u2019 increasingly close connections to the centers of power in Russia.In another indication, the Crocus Group was written into a 2014 bilateral treaty with the government of Kyrgyzstan to help that country integrate into Russia\u2019s regional alliance, the Eurasian Economic Union.In that deal, worth $127 million, the Crocus Group was designated the \u201csingle supplier\u201d of services to integrate the two countries\u2019 bureaucracies and reinforce the new customs common border, by, for example, building new border posts.By naming the company in an international treaty, the Russian government avoided opening the work to competitive bidding, ensuring that the Crocus Group won the contract, Edil Baisalov, a former Kyrgyz presidential chief of staff, said in a telephone interview.In Kyrgyzstan, he said, the apparent giveaway to Kremlin-connected insiders became known as \u201cCrocusgate.\u201dMr. Agalarov mentions occasionally how difficult it is to earn money on public works, telling the newspaper Vedomosti in 2015 that he had to buy a larger Gulfstream jet to make the cross-continental trek to Vladivostok to check on progress at the Far Eastern Federal University. On that project, he said, he spent more than $100 million of his own money because the official plans skipped significant costs like roads and landscaping. He won some of it back in court.Statements about losing money are all part of the game, analysts said, noting that construction costs on Russian infrastructure routinely run 30 percent higher than for comparable projects in Europe.\u201cIt is showing the wounds that he got in the service of the motherland,\u201d said Ms. Schulmann, the political scientist. \u201cYou see how indifferent I am to profit when I do a service for the Kremlin. I have to make sacrifices.\u201dMr. Agalarov, however, was more candid than most when asked whether it is altruism that leads him to respond when the Kremlin calls. In the interview with Vedomosti, he said, \u201cThere are things that you cannot turn down.\u201dReporting was contributed by Andrew E. Kramer and Sophia Kishkovsky in Moscow, Mike McIntire and Steve Eder in New York, and Sharon LaFraniere in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Top Fed Job, Slow and Steady Beats Wall Street Brash", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsOnly in Trumpland can Gary D. Cohn be considered a suitable Federal Reserve chairman.The registered New York Democrat did not have a government background when he became director of the National Economic Council. Still, he had honed his finance skills during more than 25 years at Goldman, and he quickly hired White House staff members with complementary experience. His operation contrasted with those of cabinet members like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who struggled to answer basic questions about school curriculums in her confirmation hearing.Choosing Mr. Cohn as head of the central bank would be an unconventional pick. Over the last 40 years, Fed chiefs have been economists and have also served at least two four-year terms. Ms. Yellen will have served only one if Mr. Trump does not renominate her. The last one-term, noneconomist Fed chairman was G. William Miller, who had been the chief executive of Textron before President Jimmy Carter tapped him. At a time of high inflation, his policies tanked the dollar and he lasted just over a year.Mr. Cohn spent much of his time at Goldman as a trader. He joined its J. Aron commodities unit and became the head of the divisions for fixed income, equities and global securities before he became the company\u2019s president. Goldman is known as the most alpha of the investment banks, and the hard-charging job fit Mr. Cohn\u2019s personality.Running the central bank is a more sedate affair. The staff consists of number crunchers with doctorates in economics who pore over various models to analyze growth and employment. News conferences after meetings by the interest-rate-setting committee are carefully scripted. Ms. Yellen, like her forebears, chooses her words carefully, knowing any hint of surprise can rattle markets.Her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, learned that in 2013, when he said the central bank would no longer be purchasing bonds, causing United States Treasury yields to surge in what became known as the \u201ctaper tantrum.\u201d Mr. Cohn, a blunt talker, may find such restrictions suffocating. Markets will prefer a more boring choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vlad, the Trump Impaler", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hark!What light from yonder West Wing window breaks. A bright idea has somehow emerged from the dysfunctional, dystopian Trump White House.And from the Grim Reaper, no less.Steve Bannon has not been partying in the Hamptons with Jared, Ivanka and Kellyanne. He has instead been lurking in his lair, scheming about a plan to raise taxes on the richest people in America and give tax cuts to the people who need them.Conservative craniums are exploding all over town. Mitch McConnell had already been worried that Donald Trump might revert to the pragmatist who gave Chuck Schumer and Hillary donations and triangulate with Democrats.And Bannon\u2019s fellow former Goldman Sachs money men, Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, are rushing to strip away the tax burdens on the rich and corporations because, in the immortal words of Mitt Romney, \u201cCorporations are people, my friend.\u201dAs Grover Norquist, the anti-tax evangelist, howled, \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly cruel thing for Bannon to do.\u201dIn his role as Keeper of the Essence, the one who tends the flame between Trump and his base, Bannon has been guilty of plenty of cruel things, from the botched travel ban to \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d to the fixation with the wall to the offensive tripe in Breitbart when he ran it.As the rumpled hero to white nationalists likes to say, \u201cDarkness is good.\u201dBut while this idea is going nowhere, it\u2019s not cruel. Bannon is right to challenge his colleagues\u2019 claim that the rich pour money from tax cuts back into the economy.If you give a tax cut to people who make a million a year or more, they save the money. But if you give a tax cut to working-class and poor people, they spend the money. So the multiplier effect for the economy is much higher with tax cuts for people who don\u2019t have a lot of money.Bannon understands that if President Trump gave a raspberry to plutocrats, including all the ones in his own administration, he would grow more popular. (It would be hard to grow less popular.)For all Trump\u2019s insanity, he is in a unique place to do some interesting things because he\u2019s not beholden to the usual suspects. He\u2019s barely even a Republican, so it would be a smart strategy to work with Democrats on the things he agrees with, that Democrats can\u2019t say no to.Why doesn\u2019t Trump indulge his predilection for acting against expectations in a way that could be a boon to his base, or \u201cmy people,\u201d as he calls them? Why squander all that combativeness and impulsiveness on Twitter insults? Why settle into an angry standoff with a majority of the country? It\u2019s an exhausting dynamic that breeds a siege mentality \u2014 a mind-set that was succinctly described by Kellyanne Conway at a recent Washington dinner as \u201cthey hate us and we hate them.\u201dWhy doesn\u2019t Trump channel all that bile against the establishment and show us his purported negotiating skills by sitting down and working out an actual deal that could benefit a lot of the people in Trump country who need health care rather than backing the \u201cmean\u201d House and Senate plans that are going to hit rural America particularly hard?Instead, he is down the rabbit hole with Vladimir Putin. Much of his base does not appreciate it when the American president stands in the Oval Office yucking it up with Russian diplomats, oversharing our secrets and calling the F.B.I. director he just fired \u201ca nut job.\u201dEven a lot of Trump voters are mystified about why Trump can\u2019t put a lid on his id long enough to acknowledge that Russia besmirched our elections.\u201cIt could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries, and I won\u2019t be specific but I think a lot of people interfere,\u201d President Trump said in Warsaw. \u201cNobody really knows.\u201dHe inanely tweeted from the G-20: \u201cEveryone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!\u201dEven for a U.F.O. believer like Podesta, Trump\u2019s claim was out of this world.In his attenuated first meeting with his side bae, Trump staged a Kabuki show of confronting the former K.G.B. agent.Their conversation boiled down to this:Trump: \u201cDid you do it?\u201dPutin: \u201cNyet.\u201dTrump: \u201cWhew! Glad that\u2019s out of the way. So let\u2019s do a joint cybersecurity program and share our passwords.\u201dPutin: \u201cDa.\u201dHe should have had a showdown to rival the one Adlai Stevenson had at the U.N. with the Soviet ambassador on the Cuban missile crisis. \u201cI am prepared to wait for an answer until hell freezes over,\u201d Stevenson snapped.Trump should have slapped down the evidence and doled out the punishment. Instead, he and Putin commiserated about bumptious journalists.\u201cPolonium works well,\u201d Putin was probably saying.\u201cSpasibo,\u201d Trump probably replied.In the end, Trump and fellow bumbling neophyte Rex Tillerson opened the portal wider for Putin to sneak through in coming elections.I don\u2019t know how much information the tyro pol in the Oval has absorbed \u2014 or even wants to absorb \u2014 in his dumbed-down briefings. But, brainwashed by his father\u2019s exhortation that the world belongs to \u201ckillers,\u201d Trump clearly doesn\u2019t recognize the danger before him.This is a simple fact he might want to let sink in: The Russians do not have our best interests at heart. They are conjuring Trump\u2019s worst \u201c1984\u201d fear: playing him for a sucker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Vision for America Abroad", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsPresident Trump just concluded a second overseas trip to further advance America\u2019s interests and values, and to strengthen our alliances around the world. Both this and his first trip demonstrated the resurgence of American leadership to bolster common interests, affirm shared values, confront mutual threats and achieve renewed prosperity.Discussions with world leaders highlighted extraordinary potential: vast supplies of affordable energy, untapped markets that can be opened to new commerce, a growing number of young people seeking the chance to build better futures in their homelands and new partnerships among nations that can form the basis for lasting peace. At every opportunity abroad, President Trump articulated his vision for securing the American homeland, enhancing American prosperity and advancing American influence.Meetings in Poland and at the Group of 20 summit conference in Germany focused on building coalitions to get the best possible outcomes for America and for our allies. The United States cannot be a passive member of international organizations. We are working with friends to confront common threats, seize mutually beneficial opportunities and press for solutions to shared problems.In Warsaw, President Trump spoke to the Polish people and reiterated our commitment to mutual support and defense of Poland and our NATO allies against common threats. He affirmed that a \u201cstrong Poland is a blessing to Europe\u201d and that \u201ca strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.\u201dHe also met with 12 leaders of the Three Seas nations and pledged America\u2019s commitment to expanding access to affordable and reliable energy in the Baltic States, Central Europe and the Balkans. Helping countries diversify their energy sources strengthens economies, creates jobs and prevents adversaries from using energy to intimidate or coerce. During a dinner President Trump hosted with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Hamburg, the leaders agreed on a common strategy to confront the threat of North Korea and ensure the security of Northeast Asia and the United States.The G-20 leaders agreed that a strong economy and a healthy planet are mutually reinforcing. America will continue to lead by example in demonstrating that market forces and technology-driven solutions are the most effective means of protecting the environment while fueling economic growth.On migration, the leaders reaffirmed the \u201csovereign right of states to manage and control their borders.\u201d They discussed the need to \u201caddress the root causes of displacement\u201d and create better opportunities for people to remain in their home countries and rebuild their communities.Perhaps most important, President Trump affirmed on this trip that America First is grounded in American values \u2014 values that not only strengthen America but also drive progress throughout the world. America champions the dignity of every person, affirms the equality of women, celebrates innovation, protects freedom of speech and of religion, and supports free and fair markets.For example, to help empower women across the globe, the United States joined with the World Bank in an initiative to provide more than $1 billion to advance entrepreneurship. This effort will help women in developing countries gain increased access to the capital, markets and networks needed to start and grow businesses in the modern economy. And the United States remains the world\u2019s single largest source of humanitarian assistance. At the G-20, we committed an additional $639 million to help save the lives of the millions of people threatened by famine \u2014 and called on other nations to join us in doing more to address this humanitarian catastrophe.America First is rooted in confidence that our values are worth defending and promoting. This is a time of great challenge for our friends and allies around the globe \u2014 but it is also a moment of extraordinary opportunity. The American delegation returned from the trip with tremendous optimism about the future and what the United States, our allies and our partners can achieve together.Gary D. Cohn is the director of the National Economic Council. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster is the national security adviser.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Gets a Tech Makeover", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlso last year, in a less publicized development, Jean Yang, 30, returned to this city after more than a decade of living in Boston, finding a Pittsburgh she hardly recognized from her 1990s childhood.These seemingly unrelated events have one thing in common: Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s School of Computer Science.Because of the top students and research professors at Carnegie Mellon, tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber have opened offices here.The big tech firms, along with their highly skilled, highly paid workers, have made Pittsburgh younger and more international and helped to transform once-derelict neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and East Liberty.\u201cI loved C.M.U., and that\u2019s the main reason why I stayed,\u201d said Mr. von Ahn, who, in addition to his role at Duolingo, is a consulting professor in the School of Computer Science.There were also business advantages to remaining: Duolingo is close to the engineering talent (\u201cC.M.U. is pumping out some of the best, at a rate of about 500 a year,\u201d Mr. von Ahn said), and for millennial job-seekers, Pittsburgh\u2019s quality-of-life-metric is looking better these days than ever-costlier, ever-more-crowded New York or San Francisco.For Mr. Wirth, the software engineer who started at Duolingo in February, Silicon Valley is a fun place to visit, but living and working in the Bay Area would be a grind.\u201cI was just there last week for a conference,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. \u201cI was talking to someone who told me, \u2018My commute is two hours on the bus.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do that.\u201dKamal Nigam, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who is the head of Google Pittsburgh, said that a decade ago, workers hired by the company had family or personal connections to the city. That is no longer the case. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people who are moving to Pittsburgh for the very first time, from all over the country and the world,\u201d Mr. Nigam said.He added, \u201cWith the growing number of start-ups and the big companies in the area, people realize they can have not just one job at a good tech company, but a tech career here.\u201dFor many years, Pittsburgh was a place 20-somethings fled or avoided. In the 1990s, Allegheny County, which includes the city, was the second-oldest large county in the United States, behind only a geriatric zone in Florida. It was a notoriously difficult place to be young and single, and an earlier generation of computer science students put in their four years at Carnegie Mellon, grabbed their diplomas and left.This is the sleepy city Jean Yang knew while growing up near the campus, where her father was a research scientist in the School of Computer Science. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize no one wanted to stay in Pittsburgh,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI was just leaving because I thought everyone wants to leave where they grew up. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come back as an adult.\u201dBut Ms. Yang\u2019s field of research is in computer programming languages, and, as she put it, \u201cC.M.U. is the best place for the kind of work I want to do.\u201d When she was offered an assistant professor position in the School of Computer Science and discovered a changed Pittsburgh on her visits back, Ms. Yang accepted the job and returned last August.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an excitement about being here,\u201d she said. \u201cI go out to eat and drink in East Liberty.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Siemens Says Russian Partner Violated Crimea Sanctions", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 One of Germany\u2019s biggest companies said Monday that it had become an unwitting pawn in a scheme to evade sanctions against Russia and break a de facto blockade of electricity to the annexed territory Crimea.The company, Siemens, a giant engineering and electronics conglomerate based in Munich, said a Russian customer had illegally shipped two power plant turbines to Crimea instead of their intended destination in southern Russia. The diversion of the turbines flouted what Siemens said was an agreement not to violate sanctions imposed by the international community after Russia annexed the territory from Ukraine in 2014.The incident also demonstrates how energy has become a weapon in Russia\u2019s continuing struggle with Ukraine, Crimea\u2019s main source of electricity until the conflict interrupted supplies. Moscow had apparently become so desperate to solve an acute power shortage that it was willing to risk inflaming tensions with Germany.\u201cRussia-E.U. relations are already not in a good place, not least because there seems to be no pathway for E.U. sanctions easing at this point,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political consultancy. \u201cIn this light, this is going to be seen as something of a provocative act by Russia and will further deteriorate relations between Berlin and Moscow.\u201dThe dispute will also do nothing to encourage foreign investment or repair Russia\u2019s reputation as a place where contracts are often ignored, property is subject to arbitrary seizure and there is little legal recourse.Siemens has been one of Russia\u2019s most reliable foreign investors. It has done business in Russia since the rule of the czars and usually avoids saying anything to offend the government.But abandoning any pretense of diplomacy, Siemens said it would begin criminal and civil proceedings in Russia against those responsible for what it called the fraudulent export of the turbines. The unusually sharp statement on Monday followed news reports about the violations, from what the company called \u201creliable sources.\u201dSiemens also said it had been lied to by its Russian customer. Technopromexport had repeatedly reassured Siemens that the turbines would not be sent to Crimea, Siemens said.The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, said Monday that the turbines had been made in Russia from Russian parts and were not subject to sanctions restrictions. According to Siemens, the turbines were made in Russia with a Russian partner but by contract subject to the sanctions.\u201cThis development constitutes a clear breach of Siemens\u2019s delivery contracts, which clearly forbid our customer from making deliveries to Crimea,\u201d Siemens said.While hurt by sanctions, Russia has been in a prolonged economic slump mostly because of low oil prices. Crimea is different. The peninsula, isolated and contested, is under a stricter regime, and electricity in particular has been politicized.Russia quickly unspooled an undersea cable, but it met only part of the region\u2019s demands. Ukraine then tried to write its claims to sovereignty into a new electrical supply contract, again rubbing in Russia\u2019s inability to power up Crimea.The attempt to smuggle in sanctioned generators is the most aggressive Russian move to solve the electrical shortage.Rumbling, inefficient diesel generators keep lights on. But they have already cost Kremlin-linked companies a fortune in fuel, adding to the overall cost of integrating the region under sanctions.For multinational companies like Siemens, the thicket of restrictions in Russia can be difficult to navigate. Russian local partners have a strong incentive to win favor by skirting the rules while the parent companies have an equally strong incentive to avoid punishing fines.And in Russia\u2019s murky legal system, compliance is never certain.The Siemens smuggling case is among the first of Ukraine-related sanctions busting to come to light. But earlier examples abound of rule bending in Russia by local subsidiaries, which caused headaches for parent corporations.Siemens said it built the turbines in Russia with a Russian partner and sold them to Technopromexport for a power generation project in Taman, a city on a peninsula in southern Russia that is separated from Crimea by a narrow section of the Black Sea.Technopromexport had agreed in writing not to ship the turbines to Crimea, or to export the power they generated to annexed territory, Siemens said.The European Union has barred its companies from exporting infrastructure equipment to Crimea since Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that angered the international community.The German government is almost certain to become embroiled in the dispute because of Siemens\u2019s size and importance to the economy. The economics ministry in Berlin declined to comment except to say that German companies were responsible for adhering to sanctions imposed on Russia.Siemens\u2019s history in Russia dates to the 1850s, when it built a telegraph network there. But recently, sales in Russia have declined because of the country\u2019s economic problems. Siemens\u2019s revenue in Russia last year was 1.2 billion euros (about $1.4 billion), half its figure for 2013.The company is highly sensitive to accusations of wrongdoing. In 2008, it paid more than $1.6 billion in penalties to the governments of the United States and Germany after admitting it routinely bribed foreign officials to win contracts.Siemens said it would review all its business activities in Russia to make sure there were no other violations of sanctions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Exports, Illegal for Decades, Now Fuel a Texas Port Boom", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "Crude from West Texas shale fields is increasingly making its way abroad as a pipeline system is expanded to take it to market through Corpus Christi.Supported byCORPUS CHRISTI, Tex. \u2014 In a twist that would have been unthinkable only two years ago, the oil tanker that arrives in China today may be carrying crude that left the South Texas port of Corpus Christi instead of Saudi Arabia.Chinese drivers most certainly don\u2019t care where their fuel comes from, but the export of American crude oil to dozens of countries over the last year is the latest chapter in a remarkable turnaround for the American oil and gas industry, about the only good news in three years of plummeting commodity prices, bankruptcies and layoffs.For 40 years it was virtually impossible to sell American oil to any country except Canada because of an export ban that was a bedrock of United States energy policy. The Obama administration slowly loosened the ban and Congress finally ended it in late 2015 in a compromise that also extended tax credits for renewable energy.Oil exports grew slowly through most of 2016, but this year there has been a surge reaching 1.3 million barrels a day \u2014 roughly 15 percent of domestic production \u2014 which even at today\u2019s depressed prices is worth more than $1.5 billion a month.That may be only the beginning. In a test a few weeks ago, the French-flagged supertanker Anne, empty but capable of holding more than two million barrels of oil, docked safely at Occidental Petroleum\u2019s year-old export terminal here. The docking of the 1,093-foot vessel, larger than any tanker to come into port previously in the Gulf of Mexico, is seen as the herald of an export boom, lifting the spirits of American oil executives despondent over the crumbling price of crude and sending ripples across global energy markets.\u201cThis is our chance, this is our turn to prosper,\u201d said Khalid A. Muslih, executive vice president of Buckeye Partners, a pipeline and terminal operator in the midst of a major export expansion. \u201cWe\u2019re working our way toward energy independence. We\u2019re grabbing market share, and we\u2019re doing our part to rectify our imbalance of trade.\u201dSuddenly buyers from all over the world are purchasing the new American supplies, from South Korea to India \u2014 even oil-rich Venezuela, which uses the light sweet crude that comes out of American shale to blend with its gooey heavy crude. The light crude is highly prized even while global oil markets are saturated. Canadian oil sands, which also tend to be heavy, are being increasingly produced and need to be mixed with lighter crudes.European countries are looking to American exports to reduce their dependence on oil from Russia and African countries that produce light crudes, particularly Libya and Nigeria, which are politically unstable and unreliable suppliers. And China, with slumping oil production and rising demand, wants a more reliable source than the Persian Gulf, which it now depends on.As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cuts production to prop up oil prices, American exports are beginning to elbow out Saudi crude in some markets, a development that would have been inconceivable four decades ago when OPEC oil embargoes threatened to cripple the American economy.And the world\u2019s energy leaders are noticing.\u201cU.S. oil exports are a game changer and are going to be a larger and larger changer in the markets,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Ortiz, a former Ecuadorean energy minister and former OPEC secretary general.The United States still imports far more oil than it exports, and probably will continue to do so for many years. But since many American refineries were designed for heavy crudes from Mexico, Venezuela and Canada, the light shale oil from Texas is an awkward mismatch. Meanwhile, that oil is coming out of the fields in a record gush, and despite persistently low oil prices, the Energy Department projects that domestic production next year will top 10 million barrels a day, an all-time high.That output, an increase of half a million barrels a day from current production levels, will need to find a market somewhere. With domestic demand flattening because of increased fuel efficiency in cars, oil executives say that somewhere is likely to be overseas.Oil and dock workers here say the new exports are all the chatter among their buddies at the kitchen table and during their fishing trips and deer hunts.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a vibe, there\u2019s a buzz \u2014 people are excited about it,\u201d said Kevin Craft, a terminal operator who got his job at NuStar Energy in April thanks to the company\u2019s export expansion. After losing a job with a contractor in 2015 when oil prices plummeted, Mr. Craft has rebounded and is making more money than ever. At 37, he said, he can now start saving for his retirement and put money away for his son\u2019s college education. \u201cA lot of people are going back to work,\u201d he added.Much of Texas has been in an economic slump in recent years, having lost about 100,000 oil jobs since late 2014, when the price of oil fell from over $100 a barrel to less than $50. But because of the exports, the job losses have been stemmed and there is the promise of new jobs to come. Oil executives said that if weren\u2019t for exports, so much oil would be stockpiled in already flush domestic inventories that the American benchmark price would be $10 to $20 below the current $45 a barrel, making most new drilling uneconomical.Even with prices lagging, lower oil field costs and new technologies have enabled producers in the dominant Permian Basin shale fields of West Texas and New Mexico to deploy 250 rigs over the last year or so, which has led to the hiring or retention of as many as 25,000 workers, according to Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of the Pioneer Natural Resources, a leading Texas producer.And here in Corpus Christi, a hub of refineries and pipelines between some of the country\u2019s richest oil fields and the Gulf of Mexico, the port is just beginning a $1 billion capital investment program that includes deepening and widening the shipping channel for bigger tankers to dock and load. Some of the program is dependent on final approval of funding from Congress.Occidental, NuStar and other companies have made major investments in additional dock and tankage facilities and are planning additional ones, while several pipelines between the Permian Basin and the port are in the planning stage.Crude exports from Corpus Christi have already increased from an average of 68,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2016 to 384,000 barrels a day this April, according to a recent report by RBN Energy, an analysis firm.Buckeye Partners alone has invested $1.2 billion since 2015 in docks and other export facilities here, putting to work 1,500 construction workers and 130 full-time employees. It has plans to put more than $1 billion into additional investments, including a pipeline system called South Texas Gateway that would connect West Texas with Corpus Christi and global markets. The system is expected to be finished in 2019, with the potential to move 400,000 barrels a day. In the meantime, it plans to add a sixth and seventh deepwater dock in the port capable of loading big tankers for export.The expansion has been nothing but good news for Rudy Dominguez, a pipeline technician who was laid off in early 2016 after working for the same pipeline company for 26 years. With two children to support, he was out of work for 15 months and living off his severance pay, savings and odd jobs. Friends brought him fish from boating trips to put on the table, and he learned more hamburger recipes then he cares to remember. Learning of Buckeye\u2019s expansion, he applied for several jobs and was finally hired a few weeks ago.\u201cGod closes doors and then opens them right up,\u201d Mr. Dominguez said. \u201cI just hope oil, gas, energy exports go on forever.\u201dMany more jobs may be on the way. Ray Perryman, a leading Texas economist and president of the Perryman Group, a consulting firm, estimated that expanded crude exports will add more than 30,000 jobs in Corpus Christi over the next couple of decades. For the nation, 484,000 jobs could be added, nearly 60 percent of which will be in Texas, even if oil prices remain moderate to low, he estimated.But oil executives still voiced concerns about the future, and many say that not all the pipelines planned to take crude to Corpus Christi will be built unless market conditions improve. Persistently low oil prices could squeeze the marginal price advantage \u2014 currently around $2.50 \u2014 that West Texas intermediate, the American benchmark, has over the international benchmark, Brent crude. The cheaper the American crude is relative to Brent, the more the price difference offsets the shipping costs to replace Saudi or Russian crude on global markets.And if the shale boom spreads internationally, there could be a further glut. Domestic refineries could invest more money to refine more light crude, leaving less to export. And if electric cars catch on, demand for gasoline could shrink.\u201cThe thing I worry about is price,\u201d said Danny Oliver, senior vice president for marketing and business development for NuStar Energy. Nevertheless Mr. Oliver expressed optimism. \u201cThe potential is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to export means we can continue to drill for new oil.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Believing the Fed \u2014 for Now", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWho are you going to believe, the Fed or your own eyes?But so far there is little evidence that Wall Street is worried. Despite the occasional swoon in technology stocks and the persistent decline in energy issues, the market continued to rise through the second quarter. The SPDR S.&P. 500 Trust, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, returned 3.1 percent for the period, including dividends.But the bond market did not completely ignore the erosion in economic data. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent and were as low as 2.1 percent in the last week of June.Investment advisers express concern about the worsening economic readings, but are willing, for the moment, to accept the Fed\u2019s contention that they represent a dip in an otherwise robust expansion. They warn, however, that if the weakness lingers, it may be time to start believing their own eyes and lighten up on stocks.The interest rate increases are not \u201cnegative or problematic yet,\u201d said Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer of multi-asset class investing at Neuberger Berman. But \u201cif economic growth and inflation continue to come in very soft and potentially roll over, it\u2019s possible that the Fed will engage in a policy mistake.\u201dA widely followed, continually updated forecast of national economic output from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta declined to 2.6 percent annual growth for the second quarter from an earlier 4.3 percent outlook around the beginning of May. That is after a meager 1.4 percent annualized growth announced for the first quarter.In another sign that the economy is flagging, demand for credit has moderated. After increasing at more than 7 percent a year in 2014 and 2015, the rate slipped to 6.5 percent last year and just 2.6 percent in April, according to the Fed.The yield curve has flattened, meaning long-term bond yields have fallen as short-term rates have risen. An inverted yield curve, in which short rates are higher than long rates, often heralds a recession.Meta indicators like the Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which compares economic readings with forecasts, went from its highest level in more than three years, recorded in mid-March, to a six-year low around the end of June.Investors are facing \u201ca little bit of a mixed message\u201d from the hawkish Fed and the feeble economic indicators, said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Sextant International Fund. Stocks have remained strong, in his view, because investors are choosing to believe messages coming from Washington, and not just from the Fed.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of hope in the marketplace, in particular hope for reforms from the federal government\u201d to overhaul the tax code and spend big money upgrading the nation\u2019s infrastructure, Mr. Klimo said. He cautioned that investors had become conspicuously complacent, but then added that \u201cabsent some external shock, it does seem as though things can cruise along for a little bit\u201d in the stock market.He envisions biotechnology and other health care stocks cruising along better than most, as effective ways to overhaul the provision of medical care continue to elude policy makers. The right blockbuster drugs can enrich the companies that make them while saving lives at lower cost than other treatments. Cancer drugs developed by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb are notably promising, he said.Health care was among the strongest groups of stock funds in the second quarter, with the average portfolio up 6.5 percent, according to Morningstar. Industrials and natural resources were notably weak. As well as the health funds did, they managed on average to trail the 7 percent return of Health Care Select Sector SPDR, a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector.The average domestic stock fund over all was up 2.7 percent in the period. Bond funds rose 1.4 percent.International stock funds beat their domestic counterparts handily. The average one gained 5.6 percent, led by portfolios that invest in Europe, China and India.Given their concerns about valuations and economic growth, it\u2019s no surprise that investment advisers are looking abroad for opportunities. Mr. Klimo is a fan of Chinese internet stocks, like Tencent and Alibaba. Like many investors, he is unenthusiastic about oil, he said.Tim Guinness, chief investment officer of Guinness Atkinson Funds, also likes stocks in China and the region around it.\u201cThe cheapest part of the world is the Far East\u201d excluding Japan, he said. \u201cChina is making a good transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.\u201dMr. Guinness foresees China following the same path of development that Japan did from 1970 to 1990, an excellent time to own Japanese stocks.\u201cWe\u2019re increasing our weightings significantly to the Far East and reducing them to the U.S.,\u201d he said.He is wary of American stocks because he finds them expensive. He has no concern about the Fed raising rates during a period of iffy economic growth.\u201cThe time is well past for stopping quantitative easing and increasing interest rates,\u201d Mr. Guinness said. Quantitative easing is the program of asset purchases that the Fed used to shore up the economy after the financial crisis. The Fed is expected soon to start disposing of the assets it bought, another source of worry for many investors.Mr. Guinness cited a number of largely overlooked difficulties resulting from extremely low rates. Low rates limit the earnings of banks, forcing them to be overly cautious in their lending. Low bond returns limit returns for savers and force companies to add more cash to their pension plans, reducing capital investment.\u201cYou\u2019ll be amazed that interest rates going up will be good for markets, not bad,\u201d he said.Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, maintains a bullish outlook on the stock market and a glass-half-full view of the economy. The yield curve may be flattening, but at least it\u2019s not inverted. As for the Citi surprise index, he finds it to be a volatile indicator that often bounces back quickly from plunges like the recent one as economists adjust their expectations after the data disappoints them.\u201cI think the economy is still performing pretty much the way it has been since 2010,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. The modest growth in the first quarter, the most recent one for which a figure has been released, \u201cseems slow, but you\u2019ve got slower growth in the labor force.\u201dThe number of people available to work is not expanding as much as it used to, limiting economic growth. He noted that the meager growth rate had been enough to keep unemployment below 5 percent. That should allow the Fed to nudge short-term interest rates to 2 percent next year, he predicted, from about 1 percent after the June increase, and give the central bank ammunition if the economy begins to stall.One benefit of the modest pace of growth is that even with so few out of work, Mr. Yardeni said, inflation remains low. Consumer prices rose just 1.6 percent in the 12 months through June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the unemployment rate was only 4.4 percent. For May, the Atlanta Fed recorded national wage inflation of 3.4 percent.\u201cAs long as inflation remains subdued, and as long as we don\u2019t have a recession, bonds and stocks should continue to work,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, wonders how long low inflation will continue to support the markets. He warned in a note to investors that inflation is a risk, despite the tepid economic growth.Wage growth has been tame, but with few suitable people left to hire for companies that need to expand to meet consumer demand, it could flare up, he said. Productivity growth, often a way to keep a lid on prices, has been low after years of modest capital investment, he added.\u201cInvestors should prepare for both wage and consumer price inflation to rise between 3 and 4 percent in the next couple years,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThis does not imply a recession is looming or a bear market for stocks is imminent,\u201d but \u201cit implies a major investor mind-set change.\u201dEven with inflation quiescent, the rich valuations and a so-so, or worse, economy make even some bulls less than enthusiastic about stocks.\u201cIf someone came into a lot of money and asked what to do with it, they have my condolences,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. \u201cEverything has been picked over.\u201d He added, though, that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee any particular reasons to get out of stocks or bonds at this point.\u201dHe encouraged investors to stick with stocks that have healthy dividend yields, and he prefers technology as a rare source of growth these days and energy stocks as \u201ca good contrary bet.\u201d He would also give emerging markets a chance. But not all of them.\u201cIndia stands out, China does not,\u201d he said, disagreeing with Mr. Guinness.Mr. Knutzen at Neuberger Berman recommended Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which are Treasury notes and bonds that rise in value if inflation goes up, and debt issued in emerging economies. He has been reducing exposure to stocks of large American companies and investing more in smaller companies and overseas markets where valuations are lower.\u201cWe have become more cautious in our views,\u201d Mr. Knutzen said. The economic backdrop provides \u201can O.K. environment for stocks, but there\u2019s not much margin for error.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Exodus From a Historic Puerto Rican Town, With No End in Sight", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLARES, P.R. \u2014 This picturesque mountain town, renowned for its rich coffee, peculiar ice cream and a historic, if short-lived, rebellion, now has a far less welcome distinction.\u201cIt\u2019s nurses, teachers, doctors, firefighters. The dentist left,\u201d said Elvin Cuevas, who manages the Lares Department Store, which offers furniture and jewelry, but does not sell much of either. \u201cThe two police officers who for years guarded that corner right there are in Texas. One day, they were gone.\u201dPuerto Rico is in the midst of a financial collapse with no end in sight. The government is unable to pay $123 billion in debt and pension obligations and recently declared a form of bankruptcy. Island affairs that were being controlled by a fiscal board in New York are now in the hands of a bankruptcy judge there. The largest government default in United States history came after a decade-long economic downturn that left Lares with a 22.7 percent unemployment rate.Puerto Rico was once the sixth-largest producer of coffee in the world; Lares\u2019s beans were so special that they were directed to the Vatican. But a long period of economic decay shuttered farms, making Lares one of the island\u2019s poorest municipalities. The government cut things like fertilizer subsidies; crop yields dropped, too.\u201cThe people who leave come back and tell everyone how hard it is in Orlando, that you can\u2019t survive there without three jobs,\u201d Mr. Cuevas said. \u201cThe difference is that over there you find the three jobs. Here, you find zero job.\u201dIn Lares, a central western town about an hour and a half from San Juan, the population declined 13.4 percent over the past six years, according to United States census figures. (In absolute numbers, Puerto Rico\u2019s capital, San Juan, has lost the most people, nearly 50,000.)People have always left Puerto Rico. Elite landowners left in the 1940s. Farm workers showed up in New York City in droves in the 1950s, and others took part in migrant worker programs in the \u201970s. But back then, a steady flow of people moved in both directions. Since then, both manufacturing and agriculture have declined precipitously, decimating places like Lares.\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that Lares, the cradle of Puerto Rican independence, the symbol of national identity, is No. 1 in losing population,\u201d said Jorge Duany, a professor who has studied Puerto Rican migration. \u201cWho is staying behind? The youngest and the oldest.\u201dMr. Duany left, too. While working as a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, he struggled to pay his bills, though his salary was much higher than that of most Puerto Ricans. He now works at Florida International University in Miami. \u201cI frankly don\u2019t know how people are surviving,\u201d he said.Alfredo Gonz\u00e1lez Ruiz, a retired history teacher in Lares, said statistics showed that 83,000 Puerto Ricans left the island last year \u2014 1,000 of them from Lares.\u201cA lot left,\u201d he said. \u201cVery few came back.\u201dAs he went through the centuries of government policies, many directed in recent decades by Washington, that drove out Puerto Rico\u2019s population, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez ran into a cousin, Jan M. Ruiz N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 19, who was off from school because of a two-month student strike at the public university.\u201cTo be in Lares is to be in nothing,\u201d the young man said. \u201cIf I find an opportunity, I\u2019m going.\u201dThe town\u2019s mayor, Roberto Pag\u00e1n Centeno, said he thought the dire figures of population loss were exaggerated. Census takers must have come counting during the times of the year when seasonal work is idle, and people temporarily leave to \u201ctry their luck\u201d in Florida, he said. Unemployment rates are so high, he said, because a lot of people work off the books so they can cheat and qualify for welfare.But even Mr. Pag\u00e1n, a three-term mayor, lamented the drop in school enrollment and attendance at sporting events and church.\u201cThose are all the ways you can tell people are gone,\u201d Mr. Pag\u00e1n said. \u201cAround 2008, 2009, you started to notice the difference.\u201dNowhere is the drop more noticeable than in the town square. When banks and government services offices pulled out, nobody had reason to go there. Shops started to close one by one.\u201cWe stay open in the afternoon to clean up and sell coffee, but we could just as well close at 1 p.m.,\u201d said Edgar Martinez, who owns a cafeteria that faces the plaza near the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cAfter 1 p.m., we sell nothing here.\u201dLuz P\u00e9rez, 74, spent a recent afternoon working at her sister\u2019s souvenir shop. Not a single customer came by. She reminisced about the childhood she spent in a town busy with commerce.\u201cKnock on any door in this neighborhood and ask how many people live there,\u201d she said. \u201cThen ask how many people used to live there.\u201dEdwin Soto, the head of the coffee growers\u2019 association, said it had become increasingly difficult to hold on to employees. For one, most people do not wish to earn the $5.25 minimum wage offered in the fields.\u201cA lot of my employees have left,\u201d Mr. Soto said, noting that even his major-domo, who earned $9 an hour with free housing, quit to try landscaping in Florida.Still, he doesn\u2019t feel all is lost.Another local businessman, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, is also betting on that future. He opened Heladeria El Grito, an ice-cream parlor right beside Heladeria Lares, the famous one that former President Bill Clinton once visited, and plans to rent eight beds on the floors above it on Airbnb.\u201cPeople say I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll just move into the house myself.

{"Headline": "Britain Cracking Down on Gender Stereotypes in Ads", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain\u2019s advertising regulator, reacting to these ads and similar ones, announced Tuesday that new rules would be developed to ban advertising that promotes gender stereotypes or denigrates people who do not conform to them; sexually objectifies women; or promotes unhealthy body images.The answer, the report found, is no. The agency found that stereotypes could \u201crestrict the choices, aspirations and opportunities\u201d of ad viewers, especially girls and teenagers who are figuring out their identities and goals.The Committee of Advertising Practice, which sets British advertising standards, in consultation with the industry, will develop new standards, starting later this year. The Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body, will then enforce those rules.\u201cWhile advertising is only one of the many factors that contribute to unequal gender outcomes, tougher advertising standards can play an important role in tackling inequalities and improving outcomes for individuals, the economy and society as a whole,\u201d said Guy Parker, the chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority.The specifics have yet be developed, but the regulator offered some examples.\u201cIt would be inappropriate and unrealistic to prevent ads from, for instance, depicting a woman cleaning,\u201d the report said. But, it said, \u201can ad which depicts family members creating mess while a woman has sole responsibility for cleaning it up\u201d might be banned under the new guidelines.According to GfK, a market research firm that gathered survey and other qualitative evidence used in the report, some participants felt the Asda ad \u201cfailed to demonstrate the mother\u2019s value to the family,\u201d although others felt the portrayal was accurate.Showing a father \u201ctrying and failing to undertake parental or household tasks\u201d could be deemed problematic under the new rules, according to the report.Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a feminist organization, said stereotypes were central to gender inequality \u201cfrom the gender pay gap to violence against women and girls.\u201d She added, \u201cThey are well past their sell-by date and cause significant harm.\u201dBut Lindsey Clay, chief executive of Thinkbox, a marketing group in Britain, called the report \u201ca wake-up call for the advertising industry.\u201d She said the new standards should not be regarded as a restriction, but as an opportunity for greater creativity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three New Books Discuss How to Confront and Reform Racist Policing", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionBlack people have never been truly safe in America. Police brutality and the use of excessive force have been enduring features of our history. Today social media has allowed us to make our collective vulnerability newly visible to the general public. Not since the civil rights era, when images of police officers beating peaceful protesters made the nightly news, have we engaged in this level of national conversation about racial inequality. With formal segregation behind us, the racism that pervades our society has pooled in the criminal justice and law enforcement strategies that developed in the wake of Jim Crow. We police black and brown citizens and lock them in cages like no other country in the world.Three new books lay out an alternative path. In \u201cCalled to Rise,\u201d by the former Dallas police chief David O. Brown, we learn how a black law enforcement officer ascended the ranks and reformed the department, helping to make the entire city safer. \u201cPolicing the Black Man,\u201d edited by the activist and law professor Angela J. Davis, brings together 11 essays from scholars and criminal justice practitioners who offer forward-thinking policy suggestions. And in the most readable and provocative account of the consequences of the war on drugs since Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d the law professor and former federal prosecutor Paul Butler argues that our society must be completely remade in \u201cChokehold: Policing Black Men.\u201dBrown, who is best known for his handling of the shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers by a sniper in July 2016, believes \u201cwe will make progress only when we set aside our assumptions and really start listening to each other.\u201d He admits he didn\u2019t always think this way. When Brown was a patrol officer in the 1980s, he ascribed to the dominant approach: \u201cPut the criminals in jail, and let God sort them out.\u201d In the 1990s, the Dallas police chief at the time assigned Brown to a community policing program. Brown had been \u201ca cop who gloried in locking away villains,\u201d but his \u201cinstincts had slowly shifted,\u201d and he began to see the value in having police officers \u201cconnect with the people they served.\u201dIn 2010, Brown became police chief, and he had his officers go door-to-door to meet the people they were charged with protecting, attending homeowners association meetings and block parties, hosting basketball games and offering counseling sessions at local schools. (He also lost his 27-year-old son that year, to police gunfire. His son, who had bipolar disorder, was killed after fatally shooting a bystander and a police officer.) Brown\u2019s approach, based not on arrest numbers but on police-community engagement, led to a historic decline in Dallas\u2019s crime rate between 2010 and 2015. Brown retired in 2016, after he noticed an uptick in the crime rate, which he attributes to budget cuts that led to staffing shortages.While Butler urges us to rethink the purpose and function of policing entirely, a number of the essays in Angela J. Davis\u2019s anthology suggest that the historical tension between low-income residents of color and the police charged with protecting them can be addressed with training programs. In one of the most popular of these programs, known as procedural justice, policemen are taught that if they treat people with dignity, respect and fairness, they will build trust and gain legitimacy. Meanwhile, implicit bias training encourages officers to recognize the set of racial assumptions they carry but do not consciously control. These measures can also save lives. As Yale Law School\u2019s Tracey Meares and Tom Tyler put it in their essay, the more trust communities have in the police, the more likely they are to report crime, provide testimony and help \u201cto hold offenders accountable.\u201dBarring fundamental legal reforms, however, these programs can have only a limited impact. Indeed, much of the discussion in \u201cChokehold\u201d and \u201cPolicing the Black Man\u201d highlights the impact of major Supreme Court decisions of the last 50 years, including ones that supported racial profiling and deemed statistical evidence of racial disparities insufficient to prove a \u201cdiscriminatory purpose\u201d on the part of police officers or the courts. As Jin Hee Lee and Sherrilyn A. Ifill, both from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, point out in their contribution to Davis\u2019s book, \u201cthe courts function in a distorted reality that only recognizes racial discrimination in a specific and distinct form: overt racial animus by a specific actor.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution has largely failed to extend African-American citizens protection from police abuse and sentencing disparities.Lee and Ifill suggest that hope might lie in pursuing \u201ca more effective body of equal protection and anti-discrimination law.\u201d Butler, however, remains skeptical of incrementalist measures. \u201cLiberal reforms, such as anti-discrimination laws, have not brought long-term change,\u201d Butler writes in \u201cChokehold.\u201d \u201cCivil Rights laws have helped stigmatize discrimination but have barely blunted its effect.\u201d He demonstrates that when citizenship rights are extended to African-Americans, policy makers and officials at all levels of government historically used law and incarceration as proxy to exert social control in black communities. Black Codes, convict leasing and Jim Crow segregation followed Emancipation; overpolicing and mass incarceration followed the civil rights movement. \u201cIn order to halt this wretched cycle we must not think of reform \u2014 we must think of transformation,\u201d Butler writes. \u201cThe United States of America must be disrupted, and made anew.\u201dFor Butler, remaking America entails abolishing both prisons and the conditions of segregated poverty that increase the likelihood of criminal justice supervision. Butler cites a study from New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice estimating that 40 percent of the nation\u2019s prisoners could be released without compromising public safety. This alone would save taxpayers $200 billion over 20 years, freeing up new opportunities for resources and outcomes. He suggests those funds could be used to hire 327,000 new public-school teachers, or to create jobs for low-income citizens who often have no options for survival outside of the informal economy. And since nearly 80 percent of people in prison suffer from drug addiction or mental health issues, Butler thinks it wise to reallocate funding from police departments and correctional authorities to community health care.If the prospect of this level of structural change sounds impossible or rash, at the very least we can heed the insights the public interest lawyer Bryan Stevenson provides in \u201cPolicing the Black Man.\u201d Stevenson looks to South Africa, where a series of truth and reconciliation hearings followed the end of apartheid, and Germany, where citizens are encouraged to visit the sites of Nazi concentration camps and reflect on the history of the Holocaust, as examples of the kind of historical reckoning we must also commit to as a nation. For it is only by fully confronting the traumatic and contradictory currents of American history that we can begin to change course. Past abuses must be repaired so that safety and justice can exist for us all.Elizabeth Hinton, a professor of history and African-American studies at Harvard, is the author of \u201cFrom the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Questions Putin on Election Meddling at Eagerly Awaited Encounter", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe meeting, which lasted for more than two hours on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting, was so all-consuming that even Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, failed in her attempt to pry the two leaders apart halfway through so Mr. Trump could keep his later appointments.Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, said that Mr. Trump had confronted Mr. Putin in a \u201crobust and lengthy\u201d discussion and that Mr. Putin had denied involvement in any election interference. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia, the only other official in the meeting, said Mr. Trump had accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial.Both aides were trying to present their leaders as having stood their ground.The relationship between the United States and Russia right now is so fraught, so mired in distrust, disruption, power plays and cybersabotage, that the best Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump could get away with was setting up mechanisms to talk about their differences.Mr. Trump entered the meeting hoping to put an end to the scrutiny over his election. Mr. Putin wanted a way out of the Western sanctions that have hobbled the Russian economy since he annexed Crimea and interfered in Ukraine.Neither got what they wanted.By the end of the day, the two countries had taken only baby steps. There was a newly appointed American special envoy implementing the accords reached on Ukraine. There was another cease-fire agreement for a slice of Syria. There was some kind of unspecified process for a new kind of arms control \u2014 not nuclear arms, but cyberarms, vaguely focused on everything from election interference to the sabotage of each other\u2019s computer networks.Mr. Trump knew that any concession to the savvy Russian leader would lead to accusations that he was, in the end, rewarding Russia\u2019s bold attempt to sway American voters. Mr. Putin, in the end, appears to have settled on a long game, convinced that his mix of information warfare, \u201cactive measures\u201d and low-level aggression will ultimately get him what he wants, a restoration of Russia\u2019s status.It is far too early to know if even those steps will amount to anything; they seemed intended to show that each man regarded the other as someone they could do business with.And Mr. Trump exited the meeting as he entered: with much of his country wondering why he has said far harsher things about his closest allies, including his host in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, than about the authoritarian leader he engaged for more than two hours.The Trump-Putin meeting eclipsed the rest of the agenda at the Group of 20 summit meeting. But the talks with Mr. Putin oddly turned into a bright spot for Mr. Trump on the first full day of the gathering, where the United States found itself increasingly ostracized by other Group of 20 members on major issues, including climate change, immigration and trade.For Mr. Trump, however, the main focus, at least for part of the day, was trying to move past an issue that has caused him political problems at home.American intelligence agencies have said that Russia conducted cyberattacks, hacking and propaganda designed to undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, to help him win the election last year. The Justice Department has named a special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s interference in the campaign and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia.\u201cThe president\u2019s rightly focused on, \u2018How do we move forward from what may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters after the meeting. He said the two focused on how the United States could secure a commitment from Russia that it would not seek to disrupt American democracy, or that of other countries, in the future.\u201cThere was not a lot of relitigating of the past,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.Russian officials provided an alternative account, asserting that Mr. Trump had accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of the election interference and had even said that some in the United States were \u201cexaggerating\u201d Moscow\u2019s role without proof.Mr. Lavrov told reporters that \u201cPresident Trump said that he heard the clear statements of President Putin that this is not true, and that the Russian leadership did not interfere in these elections, and that he accepts these statements.\u201dMr. Trump, according to Mr. Lavrov, \u201cmentioned that certain circles in the U.S. are still exaggerating, although they cannot prove this, the topic of Russia\u2019s interference with the U.S. election.\u201dBoth sides agreed that the two leaders had been eager to pivot from the dispute and discuss other matters, including a new effort to combat cyberthreats and a cease-fire to begin as early as Sunday in a limited area of southwestern Syria.While such a step in Syria would be small, it appeared to reflect a desire by American and Russian officials to move past their tense flare-ups over the Syria conflict and facilitate a way to end the six-year civil war there. Moscow has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria while the United States has sought to aid opposition groups fighting to oust him.\u201cI think this is our first indication of the U.S. and Russia being able to work together in Syria,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.Trump administration officials had said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would discuss the idea of partnering to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to usher in a new era of cooperation with Moscow.Announcing it on Friday gave Mr. Trump a tangible achievement coming out of a risky and heavily scrutinized meeting with Mr. Putin, which had been fraught with expectations and suspicion amid the Russia investigations. Members of Congress in both parties had said it would be diplomatic malpractice for Mr. Trump not to broach the issue of Moscow\u2019s election hacking during the session.The Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.And some signaled they were not satisfied even after Mr. Trump exceeded expectations by raising the election interference.Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said that Mr. Trump had \u201ccapitulated\u201d to Mr. Putin on the issue.\u201cPutin and Trump may both wish to \u2018move forward,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Reed said, quoting Mr. Tillerson\u2019s account of how the conversation unfolded, \u201cbut the American people and the rest of the free world are all saying \u2018wait a minute, let\u2019s figure out what happened here and how to protect ourselves from repeat offenses.\u2019 \u201dMr. Putin is known to prepare extensively for international meetings, surrounded by canny career diplomats like Mr. Lavrov, and in close contact with his old associates in the intelligence services. Mr. Trump, by contrast, was given relatively few written briefing materials, aides said, demanded that attendees be limited to two officials per side, and has publicly criticized American intelligence agencies during overseas trips.White House officials had been determined that Friday\u2019s meeting would not be a repeat of one Mr. Trump held in the Oval Office in May with Mr. Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak, when he was photographed in images broadcast by Russian state media grinning and clasping hands warmly with the Russian officials. In the end, though, Mr. Tillerson said the two leaders quickly bonded, and their body language indicated as much.Before they spoke privately, the presidents smiled, shook hands and praised each other in front of reporters, saying they hoped for a productive relationship.\u201cPresident Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it\u2019s going very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as both men sat spraddle-legged in chairs arranged side by side. They clasped hands and leaned in to listen to each other.\u201cWe look forward to a lot of very positive happenings for Russia, and for the United States, and for everybody concerned. And it\u2019s an honor to be with you,\u201d he told Mr. Putin.Mr. Putin said he was happy to have the chance to meet Mr. Trump: \u201cWe spoke over the phone, but phone conversations are never enough, definitely.\u201dHe added, \u201cI hope that, as you have said, our meetings will yield positive results.\u201dOfficials from both sides made sure that was the case. Shortly before the meeting, Mr. Tillerson announced he had named a new envoy, Kurt Volker, to negotiate a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, where Russia has backed separatists and continued to interfere in violation of a peace agreement. Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov discussed the situation in Ukraine, said Mr. Tillerson, who was to travel with Mr. Volker, a former NATO ambassador and official at the National Security Council, to Kiev on Sunday. The State Department said he would hold regular meetings with Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.There was no word on whether Mr. Putin asked Mr. Trump to consider lifting the sanctions the United States has imposed on Russia as a result of its activities in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea or the election hacking. There was also no indication of whether Mr. Putin raised the possibility of reclaiming two diplomatic compounds seized by the Obama administration as retaliation for Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 contest. Mr. Tillerson did not respond to a reporter\u2019s shouted question on the matter.But just as the lengthy closed-door talks were winding down, the Trump administration gave word of the cease-fire agreement on Syria, ensuring that the two presidents would have something productive to show for a session that was originally scheduled to last for just 30 minutes.\u201cThere\u2019s so much for us to talk about,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cAnd it was a good start.\u201dNeil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow, and Melissa Eddy from Hamburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Good Story About Israelis and Palestinians", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe strategic genius of the plan is that it weaves vital economic interests of these sometimes-antagonists together. Even should Jordan or the West Bank someday fall to radical rejectionists, it would be nearly impossible for those leaders to entirely break the water ties established here without creating substantial hardship for their populations.But the biggest news out of the press conference isn\u2019t what amounts to an update on the Red Sea-Dead Sea project. It is that senior water officials from Israel and the Palestinian Authority shared a stage and warmly engaged with each other. It is, so to speak, a high-water mark in Israeli-Palestinian history regarding this precious resource.Following its victory in the 1967 war, Israel took control of the local water infrastructure and administration of the West Bank, as it did nearly all other aspects of civilian life. That changed with the Oslo Agreement of 1995, which created both the Palestinian Authority and a Palestinian Water Authority, the latter being responsible for overseeing water projects in the West Bank and Gaza.Another transformative feature of the 1995 agreement was to alter the balance of power by giving Israel and the Palestinians veto power over each other\u2019s water projects in the West Bank. That encouraged cooperation and led to a steady improvement of water infrastructure for both Israeli settlements and every Palestinian city and town.But beginning in 2008, the Palestinian leadership decided to turn water into a political tool to bludgeon Israel. The claim, which gained currency among some in the human-rights community and the news media, was that Israel was starving Palestinians of water to oppress them and to break their economy. Never mind that Israel was scrupulously adhering to the Oslo Agreement and providing more than half of all the water used by Palestinians in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority and its supporters began to speak of Israel\u2019s \u201cwater apartheid\u201d and characterized attempts to point out the absurdity of that claim as \u201cbluewashing\u201d \u2014 an attempt to whitewash Palestinian grievances.Politics in service of the governed had given way to politics in service of ideology and obstruction.Quietly, the Palestinian business community made clear that the value of blackening Israel\u2019s name in some quarters was not worth the price being paid in quality of life and lost business opportunities.A few months ago, the Joint Water Commission began meeting again, and long-frozen projects are beginning to restart. The Palestinians\u2019 participation in the Red Sea-Dead Sea Project, and the public appearance of senior Israeli and Palestinian water officials with Mr. Greenblatt, is a further confirmation that Israel\u2019s delegitimization \u2014 at least over water \u2014 has failed. As the Palestinian Authority turns toward a more pragmatic approach in addressing water, but also the environmental and energy needs of their people, it will lead to an economically more secure Palestinian political entity and perhaps even to better outcomes in the larger political negotiations.Israelis and Palestinians may wish they were not each other\u2019s neighbors. But it may be their shared geography that leads the way toward a more profound reconciliation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congressional Budget Office Casts Doubt on Trump Spending Plan", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump had promised that his mix of tax cuts, deregulation and reductions in wasteful spending would spur economic growth and cure America\u2019s ailing fiscal health. On Thursday, an independent government analysis of those proposals effectively said, \u201cNot so much.\u201dOne of the biggest reasons the Trump budget fell short is that the budget office did not agree that its proposals would generate as much economic growth as the White House has suggested. It said that the average gross domestic product growth over 10 years is currently 1.8, and that under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan it would be 1.9 percent \u2014 far lower than the 3 percent the administration assumes.The lack of specifics in Mr. Trump\u2019s plans was also a problem for the Congressional Budget Office. It said that in many cases where Mr. Trump\u2019s policy initiatives lacked details, its analysts had to use place-holder figures.Tepid economic growth and an aging population have raised concerns about the future of those programs. The Trump administration said Thursday that the financial outlook for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund had slightly improved in the last year but that Social Security still faced serious long-term financial problems.The Medicare trust fund will be depleted in 2029, the administration said. Last year the government said that the trust fund would be exhausted in 2028.In a companion report, federal officials said the Social Security Trust Funds for old-age benefits and disability insurance could be depleted in 2034. Last year\u2019s report also said that the combined trust funds would be depleted in 2034, but that tax collections would still be sufficient to pay about three-quarters of promised benefits for a half-century more.More than 60 million people get money from Social Security, Medicare or both. The two programs account for about 40 percent of all federal spending.The Congressional Budget Office has been under fire from Republicans who claim it has provided faulty number crunching for the party\u2019s proposed health legislation.On Thursday, the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget found parts of the budget office\u2019s work worthy of praise.\u201cWe are thrilled that C.B.O. confirms that the president\u2019s proposed budget resulted in the largest deficit reduction they have ever scored,\u201d said Meghan Burris, a spokeswoman for the White House budget office. \u201cC.B.O. agrees that this is the largest deficit reduction package in American history.\u201dOver a decade, the Congressional Budget Office said, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposals would reduce the projected $10.1 trillion deficit by $3.3 trillion, not the $5.6 trillion that the White House has projected.Some fiscal hawks have not been impressed. After the budget office released its report on Thursday, they said Mr. Trump would have to address Social Security and Medicare spending and rely on more realistic economic projections to fulfill his campaign pledge to restore fiscal sanity.\u201cC.B.O.\u2019s analysis shows the president\u2019s claim of a balanced budget is built on a house of cards, reinforced by economic growth rates that are far outside of the mainstream consensus and would be unprecedented given today\u2019s demographic realities,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.Robert Pear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Nominates Randal K. Quarles to Oversee Wall Street Banks", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday named Randal K. Quarles, a former Treasury Department official, to serve as the Federal Reserve\u2019s top watchdog overseeing Wall Street and to play a leading role in the administration\u2019s plans to reduce financial regulation.Mr. Quarles would be the first person to serve in the role of vice chairman for supervision, which Congress created after the financial crisis to sharpen the Fed\u2019s focus on regulatory issues. As a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, he would also have a vote on monetary policy.The position requires Senate confirmation, but Republicans, who hold a majority, can confirm Mr. Quarles without support from Democrats, should that be necessary.Mr. Quarles, 59, would be a counterweight to the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who has led the Fed\u2019s postcrisis stimulus campaign and its efforts to strengthen financial regulation.Mr. Quarles has criticized some of those policies, including the focus on constraining the largest banks. He is regarded as more sympathetic than Ms. Yellen to the industry\u2019s view that regulation is restricting lending and impeding economic growth.Mr. Quarles has also publicly criticized the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy, and will probably push for the central bank to end those efforts more quickly.He has endorsed a Republican proposal to constrain monetary policy by requiring the Fed to publicly describe a mathematical formula for determining the level of interest rates.His wife\u2019s great-uncle is Marriner S. Eccles, the Fed\u2019s chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the Fed\u2019s marble headquarters on the National Mall in Washington.Mr. Trump must also decide whether to nominate Ms. Yellen for a second term as chairwoman.

{"Headline": "Q. and A.: If Workers Are Scarce, Is It the Work or the Wages?", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe labor market is stumping even the experts. The unemployment rate is near a 16-year low, and employers are fretting about their inability to find reliable workers. That shortage of workers should prompt an increase in wages. Remember that supply and demand curve: When the demand (for workers) exceeds the supply, prices should rise.Yet wages have stubbornly resisted the pressure. As Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, noted in congressional testimony this week, the relationship between a tight labor market and wage pressure \u201chas become more attenuated than we\u2019ve been accustomed to historically.\u201dMs. Smith\u2019s viewpoint, however, is echoed by thousands of employers, large and small, throughout the country. We asked this small-business owner to explain the financial constraints she confronts. Her answers shed some light on why wages are not going up. One reason is that while people want higher wages, they don\u2019t want to pay higher prices. Average hourly wages have increased only 2.5 percent since last year, but prices of most goods and services have not risen much either. Year-over-year inflation is under 2 percent.Ms. Smith\u2019s responses have been edited and condensed.How much does it cost to repair a roof in Omaha?Residential roofing jobs vary so much based on different factors, including the size, how high it is, how steep it is, the materials being installed. I would say, just by guessing, that our average roof replacement costs about $8,000. Usually we try to aim for 40 percent profit margin. A couple thousand for labor; the rest for materials, sales commission, taxes, insurance and overhead. How did you arrive at the $17-an-hour rate?We have offered the $17-an-hour wage because it is the prevailing wage determination for this type of work, according to the United States Department of Labor. We do offer incentives and bonuses above that. And just to note, Nebraska\u2019s minimum wage is $9 an hour. If you can\u2019t get workers at $17 an hour, why don\u2019t you offer higher pay?In response to the article, I got an email that said if we were to offer $35 an hour with health care benefits, we would definitely get people to apply; it said people who were highly qualified applicants with years of experience would probably line up at our door.We want to compensate our employees fairly for the work they do and the risk they take, but we wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in business if we doubled the hourly rate. It\u2019s not just their hourly wage that becomes a factor. Insurance in the roofing industry is extremely expensive. Not only are we required to carry expensive general liability insurance, we also have to have workers\u2019 compensation insurance for employees on the roof. That comes to 40 percent of their wage. And on top of that, there\u2019s payroll tax.We also do a lot of insurance restoration work like hail damage claims, and in those cases the insurance provider determines what they pay for labor and we work with it. If we come back saying it\u2019s going to cost us way more on labor to do the job, the homeowner isn\u2019t likely to want to cover the extra cost, especially not above their out-of-pocket deductible.What do you think would happen if you did raise your prices to pay your workers more?At the end of the day, if I were to say, \u201cWe\u2019re a great company; we pay people double the prevailing wage, pay our insurance and taxes, buy the best materials for your house, and we give back to our community (we donate a percentage of our profits to our raise-a-roof initiative to donate roofs to families in need), but that means we\u2019re going to charge you double for your roof,\u201d I\u2019m sure people (like the emailer) aren\u2019t going to say: \u201cOh, that\u2019s so great they pay their employees $35 an hour. Let\u2019s write them a check for twice as much as their competitor because it makes us feel good!\u201d They\u2019re going to do what\u2019s best for their bank account and their budget.If you want to have lower-wage people paid more, you have to expect the price of the services to cost more; it\u2019s not going to just come out of nowhere. That\u2019s where the literal buck stops because no one wants to pay more of their hard-earned dollars. We still want to make a profit and not risk losing business because of increased prices.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Superstar Athletes Make More Money and Run Their Leagues?", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SportsAs the sports world fell into the early days of its annual summer coma, a series of portentous moments were taking place. At a glance, and taken individually, they looked a lot like the peripheral or back-\u00adoffice goings-on that typically fill the quieter months until football season starts. But by the time Lonzo Ball, the Lakers rookie point guard, whose passing ability is exceeded by only his father\u2019s self-promotional thirst, lit up the N.B.A.\u2019s summer league in Las Vegas in early July, a pattern was emerging. Beyond all the insiderish commentary about N.B.A. free agency and where Gordon Hayward, a borderline All Star, might end up, there was a steady stream of news that seemed to call into question the structure of labor and compensation in American professional sports.It started on the first day of July, when Stephen Curry signed a five-year contract with the Golden State Warriors for just over $200 million. Over the course of Curry\u2019s previous contract, his play and his anodyne charm helped increase the value of the Warriors to $2.6 billion, from a sales price of $450 million in 2010. When news of Curry\u2019s deal came out, LeBron James, who has been the subject of studies on the economic impact a basketball player can have on a city\u2019s economy, tweeted: \u2018\u2018So tell me again why there\u2019s a cap on how much a player should get?? Don\u2019t answer that. Steph should be getting 400M this summer 5 yrs.\u2019\u2019A few days later, Ball walked onto the court of a summer-league game wearing his family-designed, family-marketed Big Baller Brand sneakers. A couple nights after that, former N.B.A. players gathered in Charlotte to play in the BIG3, a three-on-three league, one of whose founders is Ice Cube, that will be crossing the country this summer.Then, in mid-July, Leslie Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets, announced his team was for sale. The write-ups speculating on what the Rockets might fetch (more than a billion, easily) highlighted the fact that Houston had recently traded for Chris Paul, one of the league\u2019s best players. The implication was clear: Paul and his new teammate James Harden, who signed a $169 million contract extension this summer, would be baked into the Rockets\u2019 sales price.While Ball was testing whether his sneakers could hold up to the rigors of an N.B.A. game, Floyd Mayweather, one of the canniest boxers ever, got together with the profane mixed-martial artist Conor McGregor to put on a high-energy, four-city car wreck of a promotion that skidded past pretty much every established standard of taste and competition. In late August, the two men will box each other in Las Vegas, a prize fight so devoid of competitive intrigue that even the most imaginative fight pundits have all but given up trying to figure out how McGregor is even going to lay a glove on Mayweather.Boxing has had more near deaths than Fred Sanford, and after McGregor\u2019s laughable training videos began to leak online \u2014 from a skills perspective, he looks like a Wall Streeter sorting out some rage issues \u2014 it seemed possible for a moment that this bout might finally be the indignity that causes the sport to keel over into its grave. But fights have their own economy, one that relies heavily on personality and self-promotion, and after Mayweather and McGregor finished their tour, it seemed likely that millions would chip in for the $89-to-$99 pay-per-view price to watch the bout, generating what many predict will be a nine-figure payday for Mayweather. Boxing is still the best con going, especially for the top fighters, who get a healthy portion of the gate and broadcast revenue. In what other big-time sport can an athlete reap so much of the money he generates? As recently as 2015, even after boxing has endured all manner of ailments \u2014 rampant corruption, fading superstars, utter indifference from the media \u2014 the two highest-paid athletes in the world were Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, according to Forbes magazine.Mayweather-size paydays might seem impossible in the N.B.A., given that more than a dozen players on each team all need their own paychecks. But back in the 2011 N.B.A. lockout, one prominent player, Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, revealed that some players had discussed starting their own league. A handful of stars went on a barnstorming tour of local gyms and semipro tournaments, which in turn led many to ask why there was any need at all for the N.B.A. But labor eventually made big concessions, and when the games resumed, the players\u2019 share of the money generated by basketball had been cut significantly. The N.B.A. was thriving; franchise valuations were skyrocketing and the league had a stable of young, marketable stars. And yet, thanks to some creative accounting that showed a few teams operating at a loss, the players had to limit what they could earn to ensure the financial health of their billionaire owners. No reasonable answer ever explained this away. But then a new television-rights deal (worth a reported $24 billion) raised the cap, player salaries went up and the talk of alternative basketball leagues fizzled out.Now the expected rises in salary cap have leveled off \u2014 and small but significant grumblings like James\u2019s tweet can be heard. The summer\u2019s basketball developments are, to varying degrees, expressions of athletes\u2019 power. BIG3 and Big Baller Brand might fail, but their very existence shows the possibilities for enterprising pros. We\u2019ve now seen washed-up basketball players in the BIG3 sell 15,000 tickets in the Barclays Center in Brooklyn without a dollar going to the N.B.A. We\u2019ve seen one of the most hyped and well-publicized rookies to enter the N.B.A. play in a shoe that will not contribute a single penny to the profits of Nike or Adidas. Developments like these allow athletes to start thinking more seriously about how they can leverage their influence to change the economics of professional sports.In the past, when players pushed for significant changes in the name of safety, fair compensation or anything else, \u2018\u2018tradition\u2019\u2019 got in the way. The N.F.L. season has to last at least 16 games, because that\u2019s the way it has been for decades. N.B.A. teams have to play on back-to-back nights because that\u2019s the only way to fit in all 82 games, a number set decades ago. Baseball\u2019s drastic restrictions on what a player can make at the start of his career is just part of the sport\u2019s accepted business model; so are unguaranteed contracts in the N.F.L. We accept that players in the N.B.A. and N.F.L. will be drafted and have little say about where they\u2019ll go. We accept that leagues need to protect their owners from their worst spending impulses when it comes to answering the question why some 20-year-old superstar-in-the-making shouldn\u2019t be paid whatever someone will pay him. The N.B.A.\u2019s apparent philosophy is that if salaries were uncapped and the draft replaced by an auction system, average players would suffer because all the money would go to superstars and to exciting, yet ultimately unproven, prospects.We assume that the major sports leagues have to stay in power because we can\u2019t imagine a world without them. And when viewed entirely from a dollars standpoint, it\u2019s hard to get too worked up over whether a team pays James $25 million or $100 million per season. But a new, truly player-driven league could also address other problems dogging the N.B.A.: the interminable regular season that causes players to take entire games off, the dilution of talent over 30 franchises, the ever-changing relationship with its supplier, the N.C.A.A., and the competitive imbalance in which only a handful of teams can contend for a championship.In the six years since the N.B.A. lockout, fans have come to scrutinize players\u2019 tweets, Instagram posts and vacation plans. Every above-average free agent becomes his own three-day news cycle. The league promotes this rabid attention as proof of its strength, but the players\u2019 strength is mighty, too. Almost any reasonable iteration of a new league could work, as long as it has a handful of superstars.Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economy Needs Workers, but Drug Tests Take a Toll", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2014 Just a few miles from where President Trump will address his blue-collar base here Tuesday night, exactly the kind of middle-class factory jobs he has vowed to bring back from overseas are going begging.It\u2019s not that local workers lack the skills for these positions, many of which do not even require a high school diploma but pay $15 to $25 an hour and offer full benefits. Rather, the problem is that too many applicants \u2014 nearly half, in some cases \u2014 fail a drug test.The fallout is not limited to the workers or their immediate families. Each quarter, Columbiana Boiler, a local company, forgoes roughly $200,000 worth of orders for its galvanized containers and kettles because of the manpower shortage, it says, with foreign rivals picking up the slack.\u201cOur main competitor in Germany can get things done more quickly because they have a better labor pool,\u201d said Michael J. Sherwin, chief executive of the 123-year-old manufacturer. \u201cWe are always looking for people and have standard ads at all times, but at least 25 percent fail the drug tests.\u201dThe economic impact of drug use on the work force is being felt across the country, and perhaps nowhere more than in this region, which is struggling to overcome decades of deindustrialization.Indeed, the opioid epidemic and, to some extent, wider marijuana use are hitting businesses and the economy in ways that are beginning to be acknowledged by policy makers and other experts.A federal study estimated that prescription opioid abuse cost the economy $78.5 billion in 2013, but that does not capture the broader effect on businesses from factors like lost productivity, according to Curtis S. Florence, who led the research for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a conservative estimate,\u201d Mr. Florence said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to measure how it affects employers, but if we could, it would be in addition to what we see here.\u201dThe effect is seen not just in the applicants eliminated based on drug screening, but in those deterred from even applying. In congressional testimony this month, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, linked increased opioid abuse to declining participation in the labor force among prime-age workers.The Fed\u2019s regular Beige Book surveys of economic activity across the country in April, May and July all noted the inability of employers to find workers able to pass drug screenings.Were it not for the drug issue, said Mr. Krueger, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, workers trapped in low-wage jobs might be able to secure better-paying, skilled blue-collar positions and a toehold in the middle class.\u201cThis hasn\u2019t gotten as much attention as the participation issue, but we could potentially match perhaps 10 percent of the population in better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could have a positive, cascading effect on wages.\u201dPlants like Mr. Sherwin\u2019s can help provide that ladder. But workplace considerations \u2014 not social conservatism or imposition of traditional mores \u2014 make employee drug use an issue.\u201cThe lightest product we make is 1,500 pounds, and they go up to 250,000 pounds,\u201d Mr. Sherwin said as workers pulled a barrel-shaped steel container from a glowing forge amid a shower of sparks. \u201cIf something goes wrong, it won\u2019t hurt our workers. It\u2019ll kill them \u2014 and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t take any risks with drugs.\u201dEven as many states decriminalize recreational marijuana use, or allow access by prescription for medical use, \u201crelaxing drug policies isn\u2019t an option for manufacturers in terms of insurance and liability,\u201d said Edmond C. O\u2019Neal of Northeast Indiana Works, a nonprofit group that provides education and skills training.\u201cWe are talking to employers every day, and they tell us they are having more and more trouble finding people who can pass a drug test,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard kids say pot isn\u2019t a drug. It may not be, but pot will prevent you from getting a job.\u201dNew data compiled from hundreds of health agencies reveals the extent of the drug overdose epidemic last year. Our estimates show deaths rising faster than ever \u2014 up about 19 percent in 2016, and all evidence suggests they will rise again in 2017.At Warren Fabricating & Machining in Hubbard, Ohio, where at least four out of 10 applicants test positive for drug use, Regina Mitchell, a co-owner, has a workaround. She set up an apprentice program, enlarging her hiring pool by de-emphasizing experience or existing skills.\u201cIt takes more time and money to train and evaluate someone, but I can have confidence the person is drug-free, comes to work on time and won\u2019t call in sick,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.For smaller businesses like hers, the financial cost of the opioid epidemic in particular goes well beyond the inability to fill open positions.It has long been a point of pride for Ms. Mitchell that her company covers the cost of health insurance for its 150 workers and their families. But over the last three years, the company has paid for five dependents of employees to go through drug treatment, costing a quarter of a million dollars.Last year, when a member of an employee\u2019s family gave birth to a baby found to be addicted to opiates, the company paid $300,000 for three months of treatment in a neonatal intensive-care unit.\u201cImagine the money we could save or invest as a company if I were able to hire drug-free workers on the spot,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not the environment we are in.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if you smoked it this weekend or this morning,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cI can\u2019t take that chance.\u201dThe biggest employers face similar challenges in their search for suitable hires, especially with the national unemployment rate now at 4.4 percent, down from 8.2 percent five years ago.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing an increase in the percentage of failures,\u201d said Patrick Bass, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp North America. The company, whose regional headquarters are in Chicago, employs 15,000 people in the United States and makes elevators and construction equipment as well as specialized systems and materials for the automotive industry.With 120 positions open for more than three months, Mr. Bass said, \u201cit puts a strain on the organization,\u201d including increased overtime costs and longer waits to fulfill orders from customers.To fill jobs, Mr. Bass said, his company is relying more on outside placement agencies that prescreen applicants. \u201cWe are literally recruiting for production line jobs, which we didn\u2019t have to do in the past,\u201d he said.Back in Youngstown, Chris Cruciger and his father, Bill, are taking a similar approach at their roofing firm, Roof Rite. But instead of reaching out to recruiters, they are working with a local nonprofit group, Flying High, which provides job training and drug treatment and sends candidates only if they have completed a screening process and four months of skills development.\u201cWe could take on twice as many projects if we had more suitable workers,\u201d Chris Cruciger said. \u201cThere are people who can barely read and write, but if they can do a good job as a roofer, they can earn $20 an hour or more and have a career.\u201dIt\u2019s a slow process, Bill Cruciger said, but it beats having to interview dozens of otherwise promising applicants who clam up when a drug test is mentioned.\u201cYou hit that moment of silence, and they just put their head down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe leave the door open and tell them they are eligible to come back once they\u2019re clean. But we\u2019ve yet to have anybody return.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Detroit Techno", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationIn the early \u201980s, the Roland Corporation, a Japanese electronics company, developed two machines that would soon become obsolete and change the world, in that order. The TR-808 Rhythm Composer and the TB-303 Bass Line \u2014 synthesizers with built-in sequencers \u2014 were designed for musicians to practice with at home, by programming artificial accompaniment. They used voltage-\u00adcontrolled oscillators to generate sound waves intended to resemble an acoustic drum set and an electric bass. Sonically harsh and rigid, they were considered largely unsuitable by serious musicians, and they trickled into thrift stores, garage sales and pawn shops. Eventually, they were discovered by D.J.s in the Midwest, who used them to create sounds that no existing instrument was capable of making.People often forget that the most visionary musical styles to come from America in the late 20th century \u2014 house and techno \u2014 are not from the coastal capitals of modern culture but the perennially neglected Rust Belt. House was born in Chicago and got its name somewhat incidentally, from a club at the center of the scene called The Warehouse. But the word \u2018\u2018techno\u2019\u2019 was chosen by design: Juan Atkins, a Detroit musician who put out the genre\u2019s first records, named it after a section in Alvin Toffler\u2019s book \u2018\u2018The Third Wave,\u2019\u2019 called \u2018\u2018The Techno-\u00adRebels.\u2019\u2019 Toffler was describing what we might now refer to as hackers \u2014 those who refused to limit their uses of machines to the intentions of their manufacturers.Roland\u2019s engineers couldn\u2019t have anticipated the mutant synthesis of funk, disco, post-punk and electroacoustic music coaxed out of their machines by Atkins and his first collaborators, two friends from high school named Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson. Theirs is such an all-\u00adAmerican story that it could be a Bruce Springsteen song: teenagers from the outskirts of an industrial town, united by music, ambition and cars. The three formed a D.J. crew named Deep Space Soundworks, upstaging competitors by mixing in a live TR-808. The next step was to start making records of their own.What the uninitiated always notice first is the beat. Most techno uses the \u2018\u2018four on the floor\u2019\u2019 rhythm it got from disco and shares with house \u2014 the thump of the bass drum on every downbeat. Traditional instruments like pianos and strings make occasional appearances. But more often than not, synthesizers and sequencers are used to form sound waves from scratch. I like to imagine what the instruments making these sounds would look like were they to take physical form \u2014 maybe some fleshy contraption from a David Cronenberg movie, capable of mutating, with the twist of a knob, into a completely different shape right before our ears. Or maybe the sound of a star shooting past your windshield as you drive up the freeway into outer space.\u2018\u2018The music is just like Detroit, a complete mistake,\u2019\u2019 May said in the liner notes to a seminal techno compilation, 1988\u2019s \u2018\u2018Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like George Clinton and Kraftwerk are stuck in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company.\u2019\u2019 Perhaps it\u2019s Kraftwerk\u2019s legacy that led techno to become such a huge success in Europe. Unfortunately, that trajectory has overshadowed the other half of May\u2019s equation. Despite its heartland origins, techno gets a bad rap in America. We associate it with party drugs, velvet ropes, glow sticks. Rave culture in England, club culture in Germany and a string of Scandinavian superstar D.J.s have made black artists like Atkins, May and Saunderson appear to be an anomaly in electronic music.This erasure might have something to do with Detroit techno\u2019s complicated relationship with the black musical tradition \u2014 in particular, Detroit\u2019s. Atkins has said, somewhat heretically, that he\u2019s \u2018\u2018more interested in Ford\u2019s robots than [Berry] Gordy\u2019s music.\u2019\u2019 The radical act of Detroit\u2019s techno rebels was that they entered an inhuman network of machinery and found a voice within it \u2014 which aligns them with a different Detroit legacy. The city\u2019s first independent black autoworkers\u2019 organization was called the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement \u2014 or DRUM. Members chanted the word while marching, as though keeping a beat.The same wave of technological advancement that brought the world the TR-808 and the TB-303 was also supposed to bring Detroit\u2019s industry into the future; instead, it facilitated the calamitous undoing of its economy. These conditions gave techno an urgent relevance. The refusal to allow machinery to dictate human activity unites the shop floor and the dance floor. When I listen to techno, I don\u2019t just hear the electronics; I hear the hands operating them.This quality is evident on my favorite techno track, \u2018\u2018The Cosmic Courier,\u2019\u2019 which Atkins made alongside two European musicians in 1992, as the sound had started its trans-\u00adAtlantic journey. It begins, like music itself, with a beat, the forward motion of time, following our orbit through the swirling clouds of the cosmos. Other components enter one by one. A bass line as tangible as a body, reminding us of the riddle of physical matter. An insistent chordal vamp, searching for some kind of harmony, trying to make sense of it all. Then, suddenly, a melody emerges, a small but unmistakable voice, both earthly and alien, of its environment yet distinct within it. The clouds part, and everything falls away but the unyielding beat and the delicate presence of melody. In it, I hear nothing less than the human spirit, somewhere in a vast, inscrutable universe, daring to exist.Shuja Haider is a writer and musician based in Brooklyn and a contributing editor at Viewpoint Magazine.Advertisement"}
