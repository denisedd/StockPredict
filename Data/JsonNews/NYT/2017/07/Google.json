{"Headline": "Inside Yelp\u2019s Six-Year Grudge Against Google", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp, the local search and reviewing site, would like this article to be focused on his company\u2019s growth, or on how its reviews help independent businesses, or on pretty much anything besides what it is about: how Yelp became Google\u2019s most tenacious pest.\u201cIf you were to have asked me 15 years ago, \u2018Hey, are you going to be an antitrust crusader?\u2019 I would have said, \u2018No, I have no interest in that,\u2019\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThat was not a childhood dream.\u201dGoogle wasn\u2019t always a rival. At one point, it was a suitor. But out of that union that never happened was born a mighty grudge, perhaps even an obsession.At one point, Yelp held a hackathon to create a sort of alternate-universe Google, the better for it to explain Google\u2019s ways to regulators. And then you have Luther Lowe.Unlike Google, whose office is full of artwork and free food, Yelp\u2019s Washington presence is just a rented co-working space. So Mr. Lowe keeps the elephant at Yelp\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, where there is more room. \u201cThis is a shoestring operation,\u201d he said.Asked about future investigations, Margrethe Vestager, the antitrust chief, offered a diplomatic answer, saying that even though other cases make similar allegations against Google, they must be considered one by one.\u201cThe one thing that has sort of changed from yesterday, before the decision was taken, was that now we will consider Google as a dominant company,\u201d she said.Yelp is one of a number of American companies \u2014 Microsoft and Oracle are others \u2014 that have agitated for the world\u2019s governments to take up the fight against Google. It is one tiny player, but through persistence and doggedness, and by being loud and public with its complaints, it has become an unusually prominent voice.Mr. Stoppelman feels he has no choice. Like a lot of small internet companies, Yelp lives in a world where one company, Google, accounts for an outsize share of its business, and could destroy it at any time. Its complaints to regulators are less about working toward some epic and definitive conclusion than they are about continuously brushing back the giant so Yelp can have more room to grow.\u201cIt\u2019s like, you get traffic from this company, and this company is a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re me, it seems like the obvious move.\u201dYelp\u2019s campaign against Google provides an inside look at a constant battle in the technology industry: the conflict between large companies that control how people use technology and the internet, and the smaller, more vulnerable businesses that live inside those platforms.Be it Netscape, whose 1990s-era internet browser was the catalyst for antitrust charges against Microsoft and its Windows operating system, or Spotify, whose music service must now compete with Apple\u2019s own music app, any company trying to build a business on another company\u2019s system runs the risk of being snuffed out or swallowed up.For Yelp, the issue is where Google displays \u201corganic\u201d website rankings \u2014 the ones spit out by its algorithm \u2014 in relation to the \u201cvertical\u201d results that Google itself provides.For example, say you searched for \u201csteakhouse New York.\u201d The first set of results, consuming the entire screen of a mobile phone, is a map and a set of restaurants from Google\u2019s local offering. The results have information like hours, stars and customer reviews. Below that are links to reviews, articles and other sites. Like Yelp.Yelp\u2019s contention is that by putting its own results at the top, Google is giving itself an unfair advantage, because those results don\u2019t have to jump through the same algorithmic hoops non-Google sites are subjected to. And since Yelp says few people go beyond the first or second result, companies like Yelp are made invisible.Local queries \u2014 such as looking for nearby restaurants \u2014 account for roughly a third of all search traffic. So Google has a big incentive to keep people within its search engine, where it can sell ads, instead of sending them to Yelp, which also sells ads.This dispute would be moot if people were in the habit of using a variety of search engines. Google has become so universally known and depended upon that it is sometimes hard to remember that it is a company, and it exists to make money.But as Microsoft learned in its 1990s antitrust battle, companies can face a heap of legal problems when their platform becomes so popular that people hardly use anything else. With one strike against it now in Europe, Google may be increasingly careful about how it treats competitors throughout the search engine.\u201cEven if nothing else takes place, a consequence of this kind of intervention, so visible and so significant, has been to give other firms more room to maneuver,\u201d said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the United States Federal Trade Commission and now a professor at the George Washington University Law School.Google is sitting on close to $100 billion in cash, so the $2.7 billion fine \u2014 a sum larger than Yelp\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 is hardly unmanageable.A larger concern is that the decision, and the potential for other antitrust actions, will limit Google\u2019s ability to position ads around its search box. And for all the talk about self-driving cars and delivery drones, Google is still the foundation of a big advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been as concerned as we are following this ruling,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, after the fine was announced.The impact is hard to discern, because it\u2019s impossible to judge whether Google has done wrong \u2014 and if so, how to make things right \u2014 without delving into minute detail about software algorithms and concepts like \u201cconsumer harm.\u201d Explaining all that, in a way that ordinary people can understand, has been Yelp\u2019s principal challenge with regulators. The war over how Google serves up information has been an information war.In summer 2004, a few months before the highly anticipated moment when Google first took its shares to market, Mr. Stoppelman got the flu. He searched the internet for a doctor, but instead of learning anything \u2014 like whether a doctor\u2019s patients were satisfied, or the ease of getting an appointment \u2014 he kept landing on insurance websites.This gave him an idea: How about a site where users rate and review local services? He and a co-founder got $1 million from investors and began work on the site that became Yelp. A year later, Yelp signed a two-year licensing deal that allowed Google to use Yelp content.\u201cIt was better to be friends than enemies at that stage,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said.Later, when the deal came up for renewal, Google told Mr. Stoppelman that it would soon add a feature allowing its own users to review and rate local services. Worried that Google wanted to create a parallel service that would snuff out his company, Mr. Stoppelman declined to renew the license.By 2011, Google was facing inquiries by various federal and state authorities along with regulators in Europe and Asia. It had steadily added services focused on areas like local businesses, comparison shopping and travel, and companies were complaining that it was giving its own properties preferred treatment in results.That year, Mr. Stoppelman got worried about something else. Google, he said, was taking Yelp\u2019s reviews and using them in Google products that competed with Yelp. When he raised these concerns, he said, Google responded that it was displaying information derived from search results, and that if Yelp objected, it could simply withhold its content from the search engine.Given Google\u2019s market share, the response amounted to saying \u201ctake yourself off the internet,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cThat would have destroyed the company, so it was a false choice.\u201dYelp took its first step into the regulatory arena that July, when Vince Sollitto, the company\u2019s senior vice president for communications and government relations, accused Google of stealing Yelp content at a conference of state attorneys general.The next day, according to Mr. Stoppelman, a Google executive sent him an email saying it would stop. A Google spokesman said the decision had been made long before, and was unrelated to the prosecutors\u2019 gathering. Nonetheless, Yelp concluded that there was no better way to get Google\u2019s attention than to raise the specter of regulation.\u201cThe pattern was that they would do something pushing the envelope or, frankly, evil, and we would complain about it privately, and they would say they would fix it, and nothing would happen,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cWe realized that if we were going to get what we wanted, we had to be very scrappy.\u201d\u201cI thought, this is a chance to totally refine our strategy,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.Mr. Lowe is from Arkansas and speaks with a slight drawl. He is passionate and garrulous and has a habit of sometimes tattooing his audience with a mix of detailed history and arcane policy points about Yelp\u2019s problems with Google. He is crushed if listeners don\u2019t find it to be as big a deal as he does.He said he learned some hard lessons when the F.T.C. closed its Google investigation. The first was that antitrust law is boring, complicated and political. The second was that technology is difficult to explain, even to regulators.Mr. Sollitto, who made the presentation at the prosecutors\u2019 meeting, said that during the trade commission\u2019s case, he had found himself making imperfect analogies, such as the one that Google was the only store in town and put all of its own products on the best shelves. Not an unusual thing for a merchant to do, he concedes, except that Google puts competitors\u2019 products on shelves that are out of reach.\u201cWe were having a difficult time explaining to the F.T.C. why consumers were harmed,\u201d he said.In March 2013, Mr. Lowe asked Yelp engineers if they could build an online simulator showing what Google would look like if its own services had to live by the algorithm dictating the position of third-party services, like Yelp.\u201cThey need something they can touch and experience,\u201d he wrote in an email.During a company hackathon, engineers created software that produced pages of search results ranked purely by an algorithm and compared them with Google\u2019s presentation. Their conclusion, which Google disputes, is that Google was providing its users with less useful information by steering them to its own products instead of results from around the web.That month, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, then the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, announced he was discussing a possible settlement with Google, and asked interested parties for comments. In addition to the legal documents it had sent to the F.T.C., Yelp submitted a white paper that it said showed users preferred outside companies\u2019 results over Google\u2019s in-house products.\u201cYou can do PowerPoints all day long, but it\u2019s hard for people to understand until they can sit in the driver\u2019s seat and come up with their own searches and see the results for themselves,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.When Mr. Almunia\u2019s term ended without a settlement, and Ms. Vestager became Europe\u2019s new head of competition, Yelp went into a full-on political campaign. Mr. Lowe started building a small European government-relations operation, which he staffed with employees from companies and consumer groups that were also pursuing complaints about Google.Mr. Lowe bid for it online, and ended up spending $3,000. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I had to have it,\u201d he said.A few months after Europe filed its first antitrust charges, Microsoft withdrew its regulatory complaints against the search giant because of \u201cchanging legal priorities.\u201d Last year, it dropped out of FairSearch, an anti-Google industry group.Mr. Stoppelman said Yelp had no real choice but to keep at the regulators. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the overall competition playbook for us,\u201d he said.It would be hard to find a drier assessment than the one from Mark Mahaney, a veteran internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco. Mr. Mahaney covers both Google\u2019s stock and Yelp\u2019s. Right now, he recommends buying Google, but not Yelp.Asked about Yelp\u2019s regulatory battles with Google, Mr. Mahaney said he had no idea what kind of impact, if any, it might have on the company\u2019s prospects. Still, it never hurts to try.\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the decision by Yelp to go to regulators made a lot of business sense.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Maids and Nannies for Jihad", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Ayu is a 34-year-old Indonesian maid, and the head of a pro-Islamic State network in Hong Kong. She recruits, raises funds and spreads propaganda for the group. She is just one of several dozen Indonesian domestic workers in East Asia known to endorse jihad.Ayu \u2014 I\u2019m using a pseudonym, because she fears trouble from the police \u2014 became pregnant young, ran away from abusive in-laws and left her baby behind to go work in Hong Kong in 2003. She consumed alcohol and drugs to numb depression. In late 2011, after losing her job as a maid for the third time, she went to Macau, sleeping on the streets for months, until she overdosed.A Muslim only nominally until then, she now sought spiritual refuge. Surfing Islamic websites, she became absorbed by news of the war in Syria. She began to befriend international jihadis on social media. She returned to Hong Kong and enrolled in an Islamic course run by a puritan, though non-extremist, Salafist institute \u2014 but left it in mid-2014 when her teacher reported her to the police because she had voiced support for the Islamic State.She started translating propaganda material for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from English into Indonesian and spreading it on Twitter and the messaging app Telegram. After marrying an Indonesian jihadi she\u2019d met on Facebook, she was introduced to the inner circles of Indonesian pro-ISIS groups.Some 500,000 migrants from Indonesia work in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, most of them, like Ayu, women employed as maids, nannies or caretakers for the elderly. Based on official reports by the Indonesian police and interviews and social media monitoring conducted by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), where I am a researcher, about 45 Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong alone have been identified as active supporters of the Islamic State. There may be twice as many.These numbers may seem small, but the radicalization of Indonesian maids and nannies working in East Asia is alarming. It takes very few dedicated people to do considerable harm, and these supporters of jihad are more resourceful than others: Their incomes are much higher than those of most Indonesians, they speak better English and they have more contacts internationally.Two Indonesian women who had been migrant workers were foiled last December as they were preparing suicide bombings at the presidential palace in Jakarta and a tourist site in Bali. Others have traveled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, provided funds to the group, recruited new members or connected local jihadis with fighters in Syria and Iraq.Far less activity of the kind has been recorded among the roughly one million Indonesian domestic helpers working in the Persian Gulf. Only about a dozen radical maids in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are active on social media, for example. None is reported to have joined jihadis in Syria.As migrants from a Muslim-majority country working in non-Muslim territories, Indonesian maids and nannies in Hong Kong or Singapore radicalize for different reasons than either Indonesian helpers in the Middle East or converts to jihad in the West.Based on IPAC\u2019s monitoring of social media since mid-2015, as well as our interviews with several dozen Indonesian migrant workers and Muslim leaders in Hong Kong, these workers seem to have started out as nominal or non-devout Muslims and then undergone a rapid religious transformation while living abroad.Jihadi sites like voa-islam.com and kiblat.net appear at the top of result lists when one searches for \u201cIslamic news\u201d on Google in Indonesian. Their narratives \u2014 prophesizing an Islamic Armageddon in Syria and the like \u2014 are then spread by social media. Encrypted chat apps, particularly Telegram, serve as support groups for new recruits.\u201cI was online 24 hours every day, the Wi-Fi was so good,\u201d Firda, an Indonesian maid who worked in Singapore, told me in April. \u201cAt first I used it to watch movies, but after a while I felt empty. I had a decent job and money, my boss was nice to me, but I felt dry spiritually.\u201dFor some domestic workers, joining the Islamic State is a form of emancipation \u2014 from pasts they sometimes regret, from the hardships of exile, from subservience to men. Ika Puspitasari, a former domestic helper in Hong Kong, was arrested in central Java in December 2016 for plotting a suicide attack in Bali: She told the police that after helping finance her husband\u2019s terrorist plans for a time, she had wanted to play a more active role.It is these desires, and the helplessness they often stem from, that deradicalization efforts must address. The Indonesian government currently conducts training for migrant workers before they go abroad, but it focuses on languages and practical skills. The preparation should also incorporate modules about religious extremism, and describe recruitment by radical groups as a form of exploitation because jihadis often extract money from migrant workers.Indonesian Muslim business associations in Hong Kong and elsewhere may also have a part to play. They could be encouraged by the Indonesian consulate to set up ventures with migrant workers, allowing workers who are attracted to extremist views to be exposed to other perspectives in a collegial setting.Such exposure has proved effective in other contexts. For example, a reformed terrorist in Lamongan, in East Java, has set up a livestock cooperative bringing together former radicals and nonradicals, and that proximity reportedly helped change some of the jihadis\u2019 views over time. Programs could be put in place in Hong Kong to get radical domestic workers involved in, for example, businesses selling Muslim garments and Islamic herbal medicine, goods in high demand among migrants.Nava Nuraniyah is an analyst at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, in Jakarta.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Got the Wrong Drug. And a $2,500 Band-Aid.", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAfter taking another \u201cOmeprazole\u201d to no avail the next day, it occurred to me to look at the container. I saw a female first name, someone else\u2019s last name and the name of a drug I\u2019d never heard of: Diflucan. Google revealed this to be a cure for vaginal yeast infections, with possible side effects of upset stomach. I fished the bag it had come in out of the garbage; my name and \u201cOmeprazole\u201d was printed on its label. The bag was right; the bottle was wrong. I hadn\u2019t looked closely. I\u2019ve never looked closely because I\u2019ve never thought I had to. I\u2019ve never checked the gas pump, either, to make sure it wasn\u2019t dispensing orange juice. One trusts certain institutions.The first thing I did was call my sister-in-law, a doctor, asking her if I would keel over from the Diflucan. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just won\u2019t get a yeast infection.\u201d Next I called the pharmacy. The person who answered the phone listened and said: \u201cO.K. Just bring it back, and we\u2019ll exchange it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big mistake, boss,\u201d I said.\u201cJust bring it back, and we\u2019ll exchange it.\u201d Click.We swapped medications without a word between patient and pharmacist other than \u201cSign here\u201d and \u201cNext!\u201d I opened the bottle at the water cooler, popped a pill and within 20 minutes, abdominal freedom.I\u2019m not a litigious person, but I was a little riled up, not just because of the physical pain I\u2019d had to endure because of the pharmacy\u2019s bungling, but because no one seemed particularly concerned.It seemed to me that if the pharmacy wasn\u2019t interested in apologizing or acknowledging a mistake, some kind of dollar figure was appropriate.And yet I hesitated. For years I\u2019ve loathed the American culture of litigiousness, which has only gotten worse since the infamous Liebeck v. McDonald\u2019s lawsuit of 1994, in which a jury awarded the plaintiff $2.86 million for the pain and suffering she endured after spilling hot coffee on herself. It\u2019s common knowledge, too, that squeezing insurance money out of fake or exaggerated injuries is a racket. Ratso Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman in the film \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d is famous for shouting \u201cI\u2019m walkin\u2019 here!\u201d when a cab almost hits him; less well-known is what he says to Joe Buck as the two continue: \u201cActually, that ain\u2019t a bad way to pick up insurance.\u201dBut I also discovered this wasn\u2019t some odd one-off mix-up. Medication mistakes make up a significant portion of the millions of medical errors made each year in the United States. While estimates vary, medication errors injure more than a million patients each year and kill roughly 100,000 of them. These errors can happen during ordering, preparation and dispensing, or just by way of an administrative mistake, in hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices or in pharmacies, like mine did. At least I wasn\u2019t alone.I finally called my 93-year-old mom, dispenser of wisdom, telling her I felt like a heel for seeking money when I didn\u2019t suffer serious harm from taking the Diflucan.\u201cThat\u2019s outrageous,\u201d she said. \u201cGo after them.\u201dI didn\u2019t know where to start, so I talked to a lawyer friend. \u201cDon\u2019t even bother with the store,\u201d she told me. \u201cSend a letter to the legal department of the pharmacy and tell them what happened. They\u2019ll write you a check. They do it all the time.\u201dTrying to locate the correct person at this nationwide chain store to send my letter of grievance took a lot of time in research, unreturned calls and emails to the abyss. Eventually, though, I found the right fellow and mailed him photos of the bag and bottle along with a letter outlining the situation. I declared that my night of pain and suffering was worth $5,000, the number suggested by my lawyer friend.A month went by with no response. On day 31, I called the guy up and left him a voice message. To my surprise, he called right back, said he\u2019d gotten my letter, but that $5,000 was too much money. He offered half. I told him I\u2019d call him back.\u201cTake the $2,500,\u201d my lawyer friend told me. \u201cThey really don\u2019t have to give you anything unless you sue them, and they know most people won\u2019t do that unless someone dies or is seriously injured. Most companies count on people cooling off, then throwing up their hands and forgetting about it. If you wait too long, too, they\u2019ll probably withdraw the offer.\u201dI called the pharmacy lawyer back and told him I\u2019d take his 50 percent. The call, I should add, was polite on both sides, no growling, neither of us bringing much energy to the negotiations. My lawyer friend was right \u2014 they do this all day long, 40 hours a week. It was like calling the bank. But at the end of the conversation, the lawyer surprised me with: \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you.\u201d I accepted his apology and asked him if I\u2019d be forever unwelcome in that drugstore and whether I should stay away. No worries there. \u201cActually, the pharmacy will never know a mistake was made,\u201d he said. \u201cThe money comes from the main office.\u201dMy idea had been to make the pharmacy pay for its mistake with a financial tap on the nose, so the pharmacists might be a little more careful in the future. But it was me who got the wake-up call, after realizing that no one involved, except perhaps the polite man in the main office, seemed to care whether I got the right medication, was sick or well, or whether this systemic problem would ever be cured.Josh Max is a writer and musician.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moon Express Sets Its Sights on Deliveries to the Moon and Beyond", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Florida start-up that is striving to become the first private company to put a spacecraft on the moon revealed an ambitious road map on Wednesday for a regular delivery service to send payloads there and elsewhere in the solar system.Robert D. Richards, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Moon Express was on track to launch before the prize\u2019s deadline. But even if the company does not win the prize, he said, Moon Express would still have a profitable future ferrying payloads for NASA and commercial customers.\u201cI think it\u2019s big,\u201d Dr. Richards said of the potential market, adding that he hoped its designs would \u201credefine the possible.\u201dThe company released illustrations of its MX-1E lander, which it says will make the trip to the moon this year.The design change was made so that the lander would fit in a smaller rocket that Moon Express now plans to use for the first mission. \u201cThat\u2019s considered our starter vehicle, our entry-level vehicle, to reach the moon,\u201d Dr. Richards said.The MX-1E then becomes like a Lego piece, allowing Moon Express to use it as a building block for larger spacecraft.\u201cSpace vehicles and landers have traditionally been custom designed for each purpose,\u201d Dr. Richards said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve designed is a common core approach.\u201dMoon Express\u2019s second mission would use a larger spacecraft that looks like two soda cans, one stacked on top of the other, essentially two MX-1Es. One is almost the same as the lander on the first mission. The second module \u2014 without landing legs \u2014 is a propulsion stage that would enable the spacecraft to reach the moon\u2019s south pole, where ice persists inside craters that are eternally in shadows. .Ice is a valuable resource for future human settlements, beyond providing water to drink. Water molecules broken up into hydrogen and oxygen could not only provide air for astronauts to breathe, but also rocket propellent. The ice at the bottom of the craters probably preserves molecules from the earliest days of the solar system, too, which could be a boon for scientists.That same configuration, called MX-2, could also be sent as far away as the moons of Mars, but to land on Mars would require a more complex, more expensive vehicle beyond Moon Express\u2019s current designs. \u201cIt can get basically anywhere in the inner solar system,\u201d Dr. Richards said, meaning the neighborhood from the sun to Mars.Two additional configurations would put together multiple building block propulsion modules in larger moon landers. A propulsion module at the center could serve as a smaller vehicle that could blast off from the moon, bringing back rocks and soil samples to Earth.The cost of building and launching a MX-1E is less than $10 million, Dr. Richards said. NASA missions, by comparison, typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cWe want to collapse the cost of getting to the moon and by doing so, there is going to be a brand new market that is going to emerge,\u201d Dr. Richards said.He said he hoped that in the years to come, Moon Express would be launching at least twice a year.Moon Express is not the only company betting on the moon, which has been largely overlooked since the end of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions four decades ago.Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh dropped out of the competition last year because the 2017 deadline proved unrealistic. It is still developing its Peregrine lander and now plans a 2019 launch, with 11 customers signed up.\u201cWe\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at,\u201d said John Thornton, Astrobotic\u2019s chief executive.

{"Headline": "Digital Privacy to Come Under Supreme Court\u2019s Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchTo obtain electronic communications, the government must obtain a warrant for any that are held for 180 days or fewer by a computer service provider. This means establishing probable cause that the evidence sought is related to a crime.But for anything older than that, investigators need only a grand jury or administrative subpoena, as long as the person whose communications are sought is informed. That notification can be delayed by as much as 90 days if disclosure might have an adverse effect, such as destroying or tampering with evidence.Back in 1986, Congress viewed communications over six months old to be abandoned and therefore subject to reduced protection, a notion that looks quaint today when emails and texts may be held for years.Another provision of the statute allows investigators to obtain information from the provider about a subscriber to any electronic service, like cellphones, by seeking a court order based on \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the records are relevant to a criminal investigation. This is a lower standard than probable cause, the usual requirement for a search warrant.The defendants were convicted of organizing a string of robberies in the Detroit area where they served as lookouts by parking near the stores. The government obtained orders directing wireless carriers to provide cell site location information showing where different numbers linked to the crew conducting the robberies were at the time of the crimes. Armed with data from various cell towers, prosecutors showed at trial that the defendants\u2019 phones were a half-mile to two miles from the robberies, helping to link them to the actual perpetrators.The defendants sought to suppress that information, arguing that it constituted a search of their phones so that the reasonable grounds standard in the Stored Communications Act for the order did not meet the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment.In Riley, the court found that a warrantless search of an arrestee\u2019s cellphone was unconstitutional, explaining that what distinguishes the device from other items that might be found on a person that the police could look at \u201cis their immense storage capacity.\u201d But rummaging through the contents of a phone or computer is not necessarily the same as getting site information that is broadcast to the carrier, especially when a person may enable it by using an app like Find My Phone.In the Carpenter case, the justices will have to weigh whether cell site data is different from a GPS tracker because learning where a person is within about a one-mile radius may not be a sufficient invasion of privacy to come within the Fourth Amendment. Nor does obtaining the location of a cellphone reveal the content of any communication, only that a call was made, so the protection afforded by the Riley decision may not apply.Determining how digital information fits under a constitutional protection adopted when there were only \u201cpersons, homes, papers and effects\u201d that could be searched requires the Supreme Court to figure out the scope of privacy expectations in a very different world from the 18th century. The problem is that legal challenges take a piecemeal approach to a statute adopted over 30 years ago, and the courts cannot rewrite provisions that may be hopelessly out of date.Whether the legislation can get through the current Senate is an open question, and it is not clear whether President Trump would sign off if the Justice Department opposes the bill. That may mean the Supreme Court will have to establish the broad parameters of digital privacy while Congress tries to deal with the intricacies of a world of electronic communication that continues to evolve rapidly.Devices connected to the internet, from cellphones to watches to personal training trackers that facilitate our personal habits and communications, are a fact of daily life, and the Supreme Court will have to start drawing clear lines around what types of electronic information are \u2014 and are not \u2014 protected by the Fourth Amendment. Simply asserting that there is a right to privacy does not provide much help in determining how far that protection should extend in a digital world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Gold Butte in Nevada, Ancient Rock Art and Rugged Beauty", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "Supported byNational MonumentsIt was 105 degrees, and I was in the Mojave Desert looking for ancient images of goat-like creatures. I scanned the rock formations with my binoculars and then scrambled over some boulders and descended into a wash that was once a river. I guessed that only a handful of people in the world even know about the goats \u2014 they are that obscure. In the wash, I noticed the fine gravel was disturbed by a large animal. There were no droppings of wild burros, so that ruled them out. The only other large animals would be bighorn sheep, mountain lions or mule deer, but they would not compress the gravel in such an irregular pattern.The only thing that could have made that sign was humans. I squatted down and looked closer. There were heavy steps each way. They could have been made two days ago or two years ago. Such imprints in the desert do not go away easily. I tracked the disturbed gravel up the wash, and off in the distance was a rock wall stained the color of rust and blood. I had found the site of the rock art known as 21 Goats.When I spotted the goats, I made a sound that was a cross between a gasp and a hiccup. Although the site is called 21 Goats, the petroglyphs are commonly interpreted to be desert bighorn sheep, the monarch of the Mojave Desert. The bighorn is considered one of the greatest trophies among modern hunters. Among the sheep were snakey lines and bull\u2019s-eye circles.Of the monuments to be reviewed, Gold Butte may be the least known. Even Google Maps hasn\u2019t recognized its borders as a national monument yet. On the interactive map, the area of Gold Butte remains white while all the surrounding lands that have some sort of protected status are demarked in public-place green.While preparing for the trip, I asked around in the nearby town of Mesquite if there were any official maps for the Gold Butte area. Something that showed the topography, back roads and way points. All the answers were negative with one guy saying I should try to find \u201cone of them old B.L.M. maps,\u201d referring to the Bureau of Land Management, which manages the monument. I made do by cobbling together a sheaf of maps of varied detail that I printed off the internet. As I would later learn, there are designated routes for off-road vehicles and a main road, Gold Butte Road, which is designated as a National Backcountry Byway by the B.L.M., but as for hiking, you have to figure that out as you go along.I stopped at the library in Mesquite and asked if they had anything on Gold Butte. The helpful librarian guided me to a shelf of books on Nevada history, but none of them mentioned Gold Butte in their indexes. However, from behind the desk she did find a book from a local author. She handed me a 1992 copy of \u201cCrazy Ed\u2019s Sagas and Secrets of Desert Gold\u201d by the late Eddie Bounsall.Mr. Bounsall, a prospector and maker of build-your-own-airplane kits, educates the reader about mining and minerals in the region but also covers a lot of ground on other subjects. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed in ghosts before but in the last 22 years living in the Gold Butte area we have had many very strange supernatural incidents happen with my family and to people who either worked for us of who were just visiting,\u201d Mr. Bounsall wrote before recounting some goosebumps-inducing events. In a chapter on U.F.O.s, he presents a sure-of-himself argument that the human-shaped petroglyphs found on the rocks are space people, and the local Native American tribes have been in touch with them for a long time. He also theorizes about how the early Spanish explorers left behind hidden treasure vaults of gold and silver in Gold Butte and the surrounding region. The Spaniards figured they could always get it later, so they left symbols etched to rock walls that indicated the secret way to the motherlode.Suddenly, Gold Butte National Monument got a lot more interesting.On the way to Gold Butte, I crossed the Virgin River. On the north side of the river were two flagpoles, each with an American flag flying. Atop one pole was some metalwork that said \u201cWe The,\u201d and the pole next to it was topped with \u201cPeople.\u201d Down below on a fence, a tattered banner hung limp. It read:LIBERTY FREEDOMFOR GOD WE STANDPast the Bundy Ranch and some horse farms, the road goes into an expansive valley, and another sign appears, one so new that it hasn\u2019t been shot yet. It\u2019s the only official B.L.M. sign that I saw naming this place as a national monument. This is the jumping-off point. There is no ranger station, no information kiosk, no visitors\u2019 center, no restrooms, no water, no shelter. This is also where cellphone coverage peters out.After this sign, the valley widens and Joshua trees, which are primarily found in the Mojave Desert, appear. It\u2019s not a woody tree but more of a fibrous sponge that stores water. I inspected a dead one, and it had the feel of a crusty coconut husk.While driving along, a shiny gleam in the creosote bushes caught my eye. This, of course, must be some of that Spanish silver Crazy Eddie wrote about. I stopped the Jeep and got out. Time to get paid. About 150 yards off the road, I found it: a Mylar party balloon with the words, \u201cWay to Go Grad 2017.\u201dWhile pondering how man-made rubbish can still find its way far into no-man\u2019s land, a covey of Gambel\u2019s quail flushed off to my side. They are prized game birds among Western upland hunters. Gold Butte also holds chukar partridges, found in higher elevations. It is said that you first hunt chukars for fun, and the second time you hunt them for revenge because the cardiovascular workout is so brutal.Gold Butte was deemed worthy of monument designation for historical and cultural assets but also for environmental and conservation reasons. It is where the Great Basin, Mojave Desert and Colorado Plateau merge. The Joshua trees are a rare and iconic American treasure and Gold Butte has plenty of them, along with its cousin, the Mojave yucca. It holds multiple subspecies of cholla and prickly pear cactuses. All of the plants take a long time to grow. The barrel cactus that dot the hillsides can live to 130 years. Near 21 Goats, the Las Vegas bearpoppy is being restored. The plant grows only in Clark County, where all of Gold Butte is located, and cannot be transplanted. Near the Devil\u2019s Throat, a giant sinkhole over a hundred feet deep, grassland is being restored after wildfires in 2005.The desert was surprisingly full of life. Every time I hiked through the scrub, road runners, fence lizards, kangaroo rats and blacktail jackrabbits skittered under the creosote bushes. Up above, I spotted a golden eagle soaring on the drafts, and in the distance, I caught a glimpse of a prairie falcon diving at some doomed ground-dwelling creature.Gold Butte is a large, flat-topped hill, and the only settlement here went by the same name. Upon my arrival at the ghost town of Gold Butte, jackrabbits bolted from every direction. At one time, this spot had a post office, store, saloon and hotel. An estimated 2,000 miners lived here \u2014 mostly in tents \u2014 during its peak in 1908. They mined copper, gold, zinc, lead and magnesite. The boom died off in 1910.I hiked around and found mattress frames, tangles of rusty wire, an old oven, a sink, water tanks, an old stovetop range, a collapsed corral, metal drums, a couple of concrete pads and a large mining contraption. Most of these items had been used for target practice. There are two graves surrounded by a fence of metal piping.On the hillside, I found a mine. The entrance to the mine was fenced off, but there was no sign stating you can\u2019t go in there, so I climbed over the fence. When I illuminated the mine with my penlight, there was an odd-shaped rock. It slithered. Maybe a panamint rattlesnake or a Gila monster. I climbed back over the fence.Although the ghost town left me unimpressed, the highlight of the trip was another petroglyph site near 21 Goats. It was a grouping of sandstone formations; if you imagined for a moment, you could see how the early Native Americans of Gold Butte survived within this harsh landscape. The formations provided shelter and shade and even water by way of tinajas, which are smooth-sculpted holes that can hold water for a long time.Hidden in the cliffs is the image of a man falling. The Falling Man is a mystery. No one is sure what it means, much like similar images in the Cave of Swimmers in the Sahara. It stands completely alone from the other rock art and this is contrasted by a nearby boulder that is completely covered with petroglyphs. It\u2019s Newspaper Rock, one of many newspaper rocks that are scattered over the deserts in the American West. It\u2019s like an ancient storyboard, but good luck making any sense of it. There are human footprints, a tortoise, more bull\u2019s-eyes, more goats, squiggly lines and a rainbow. I sat in front of it and pondered the images until thirst set in and I had to hike back to the Jeep for water.I\u2019m sure Crazy Ed led a hell of a life chasing Spanish hoards and prospecting for gold, but the real treasures of Gold Butte aren\u2019t buried underground. They are often right in front your face. You just need to burn some boot leather, and then at the right spot, look up. There they are. They will take your breath away.How to Get ThereFly into Las Vegas, rent a four-wheel drive vehicle and head toward Mesquite, Nev., approximately 90 minutes away. On Highway 15, take exit 112 and head south on Riverside Road. Once you cross the Virgin River, you are in Gold Butte country.ExploringSome road sections of Gold Butte can be handled by a 2WD vehicle, but a high-clearance 4X4 is the smartest and safest way to explore the rugged back roads. On the dirt roads, you will have an average speed of 10 to 15 miles per hour, and your teeth will still rattle. It is very slow going on some roads.Pack enough food and water to last for at least three days, along with standard emergency and survival gear. Bringing a can of gasoline is also wise. The possibility of a vehicle breakdown deep in the backcountry, with no cellphone signals and the extreme heat of the Mojave Desert, can make for a dangerous situation. During my explorations of Gold Butte, I saw only two other vehicles and not a single person. The possibility of nobody coming along to help you for a very long time is real.Mesquite is the best town to start or end an adventure in Gold Butte. Think of it as a miniature Las Vegas. It has a handful of affordable resorts, casinos, all-you-can-eat buffets and restaurants. In town, you can gather provisions and last-minute supplies at convenience stores and supermarkets and, most important, top off your gas tank.James Card is a freelance journalist based in Wisconsin who often writes about the outdoors and conservation issues.Advertisement"}

But television, these days, acts as if you had all the time in the world.The problem (a high-class one, admittedly) is that there\u2019s more good TV these days than time to watch it. When you\u2019re asked to invest 10 hours in the hope that you\u2019ll eventually like a series, it becomes like a rent-versus-buy calculation: Will the equity be worth the down payment?Of course, that assumes that you watch the entire series. That\u2019s what critics do. But what civilians ask me more often lately is: Couldn\u2019t I just skip ahead to the good part?My duty as a certified TV professional is to say no. Would you walk into a movie 45 minutes late? A work of art has integrity. Its flaws are as important as its strengths. O.K.? Watch the whole thing![Waits for the purists to leave.]But yes. Yes, you can totally skip ahead. And it may be the better part of sanity and time management to do it.There\u2019s a kind of Protestant-work-ethic guilt attached to skipping. People don\u2019t want to watch the wrong way, the lazy way, the dumb way. And critics like me have contributed to this neurosis, praising the \u201cchallenge\u201d of ambitious series as if reviewing hiking trails. No pain, no gain!This may be a side effect of how good TV has become. The more we realize that TV can be art, the more it takes on the highhandedness of art: The mandate that a work be absorbed in the order, and under the conditions, intended by its creator.Sure. It would be a fine life to watch the eight episodes of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d Season 1, then the 22 of Season 2, then \u201cFire Walk With Me,\u201d followed by an immersive binge of \u201cThe Return\u201d in a dark, subterranean screening room, crowned by high-fidelity audiophile headphones.It\u2019s also misleading to treat most series, even the greats, like fully formed wholes set down according to careful design. TV is an improvisatory art, in which shows shoot a pilot and then beta-test themselves out in public. (A classic example, Mr. Sepinwall notes, is \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d which became great around Season 3.)If you start a series in the middle, there may be references that confuse you. Google them. Find a fan site. Ask a friend. And later, if you\u2019re hooked [whispers], you can go back and watch the beginning.Yes, watching part of a series is a half-a-loaf approach. But when TV serves you one 21-course meal after another, sometimes half a loaf hits the spot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pinterest Wants to Show Advertisers It Can Run With the Big Dogs", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUp and down the festival\u2019s main boulevard, displays showcased new technology that allows users to search the digital scrapbook site using pictures taken on their smartphones. It claimed a beachfront space for the week and called it Pinterest Pier, a place where colorful signs highlighted the company\u2019s popularity among its users and the potential that represented for brands. (\u201cSee the possibilities,\u201d a sign declared at the beach\u2019s entrance.) Refreshments based on popular Pinterest posts were served, complete with physical cards that mimicked their appearance online.The pageantry represented Pinterest\u2019s renewed efforts with advertisers, which have escalated in the past 10 months as it looks to regain its early buzz and show what it believes sets it apart from the likes of Google, Facebook and Snapchat. Part of that includes breaking from its understated style and playing the game: In addition to its setup at Cannes, it made a splashy appearance at this year\u2019s South by Southwest festival and has attended at other industry events.\u201cIt\u2019s a focus for this year, building better tools and better relationships,\u201d Ben Silbermann, the soft-spoken chief executive and co-founder of Pinterest, said in an interview at an ad agency conference in April, where he was a speaker. A major part of that has been \u201ceducating marketers who may not be that familiar with the platform on what it is and what it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Yet Pinterest\u2019s users, the majority of whom are women, often provide a gold mine for advertisers with their searches and by \u201cpinning\u201d posts that they are interested in, indicating if they are exploring items tied to home redecoration, weddings or everyday needs like recipes and clothes before they have decided what to buy. Pinterest has been positioning itself as a better alternative to Google for search marketing, saying its connection with its users comes a step before someone types words into a search engine, especially now that it offers nascent visual search technology.\u201cThe pitch to advertisers is explaining what people do on the platform,\u201d Mr. Silbermann said. \u201cWhat they do is try to design their life. That\u2019s always a good place to be; Google\u2019s pitch is, \u2018People find stuff here.\u2019\u201dBut changing perceptions has not been Pinterest\u2019s only hurdle with advertisers. The company asks that ads on Pinterest mimic user posts, providing their own beautiful imagery and helpful tips \u2014 another parallel that Mr. Silbermann drew to Google, given how its ads blend in with search results. While they can be more effective than ads that interrupt photos of friends on social networks, it\u2019s a different kind of work for marketers and means that they have one more platform that they need to specifically design content for.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen brands achieve return on investment with Pinterest that blows away Facebook and Instagram, but that only happens when marketers share useful content and inspiring ideas,\u201d said Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company. \u201cIt takes a shift in habits, which takes time.\u201dThe company was also hampered by taking off \u201cat the tipping point of the desktop-to-app transition,\u201d GroupM, the media investing arm of ad giant WPP, said in a report this year, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s likely that its commercial progress was slowed by its immaturity and a need to build for the desktop platform for which it was conceived.\u201dStill, the firm has a positive outlook on Pinterest, adding that with the introduction of promoted pins and search ads, the company \u201cmay be a serious challenger as a natural link between interest (not quite the same as intent) and commerce.\u201dGoogle dominates search advertising, which brings in tens of billions in revenue for the company a year \u2014 and it too has a visual search technology called Google Lens. But that has not stopped the ambitions of its rivals, which were on particular display in Cannes during a panel hosted by Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science agency. The panel, called \u201cConsumer Discovery and a New Way to Search,\u201d featured Pinterest\u2019s sales chief speaking about image search and Amazon\u2019s vice president of global ad sales on voice search, making it clear that they were representing the new ways of searching.The company has also been trying to enhance its appeal with the public, running its first brand campaign in the United States last month around the phrase \u201cWhat if.\u201d The ads featured the phrase and Pinterest\u2019s name on striking photos, like that of a decadent pink milkshake topped with candy and a doughnut and another of an extremely fluffy poodle.Some in the industry viewed Pinterest\u2019s prominent setup in Cannes last month as a sign of more to come from the company.\u201cThere\u2019s an order of operations for Pinterest and it speaks to the methodological nature of Ben Silbermann \u2014 don\u2019t get flashy until you are absolutely confident,\u201d said Kevin Knight, the chief marketing officer of Experticity, who led Pinterest\u2019s creative and brand strategy until last year. \u201cThey had to wait until they were absolutely confident they could stand up in that bright light and withstand the scrutiny, so you\u2019ll see them get way more vocal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Carnival work is \u201creally hard,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to do it.\u201dAs American politicians and business owners wrangle over the limits on the number of H-2B visas for unskilled, nonagricultural workers, Tlapacoyan (pronounced tla-pa-COY-an), with about 60,000 residents in the town and surrounding area, offers a glimpse of how the impasse has stung in Mexico. Last year, Mexicans received more than 70 percent of the approximately 84,000 H-2B visas issued by the United States to migrant workers worldwide.The lack of visas has denied hundreds of families in the city an annual income that saves them from living hand-to-mouth and deepened the problems of a town struggling, like much of the state, with high crime rates. Of an estimated 4,600 to 6,000 residents who normally work the carnival season according to city officials and recruiters, about a third have been left behind.Instead, they are selling tacos and driving taxis, or working for just over $1 an hour in the tangerine and banana fields that surround the town. Some use Google Translate and WhatsApp to check their visa status with their former American employers.Mr. Trujillo is working as a driver for a construction crew, earning about $85 a week, less than a quarter of his carnival salary.He used savings from his time in the United States to buy a plot of land and build a one-bedroom house, even splurging on a $350 stroller for his son, now 22 months old. This year, however, \u201cthere will be no proper Christmas, no presents, no turkey,\u201d Mr. Trujillo said. He abandoned plans to take his son to a safari park in nearby Puebla state for his birthday. \u201cI can barely make it day to day.\u201dMart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a, 34, who has spent two seasons with an Ohio-based amusement company but has not received a visa this year, said he had put off plans to buy a couch and a washing machine for his mother.From the United States, Mr. Pe\u00f1a sent home as much as $300 a week from his take-home pay of about $345, eating fried chicken or cooking eggs with chili and tomato to save money. He tore down the wooden shack where he lives with his parents on the edge of Tlapacoyan and built cinder block walls. He also paid for his father\u2019s treatment for typhoid.As wrenching as it was to work far from his family, he said, managing without extra income was worse. \u201cThere is this anxiety that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d he said.The visa problems began in March when the summer allotment of H-2Bs ran out, leaving some American businesses scrambling for people to clean hotel rooms, run Ferris wheels and fish for shrimp. Demand for visas was high, said recruiters and experts, and Congress did not renew a provision that had excluded returning H-2B workers from counting against the total quota of 66,000 visas, which is split evenly between summer and winter.But business owners who have been waiting to bring seasonal workers said the requirements to apply for visas were onerous and that the extra visas were too few, too late.Deborah Murray, one of the owners of Murray Brothers, a carnival company based in Cincinnati, said she had scaled back this year because she could not muster 30 reliable workers. She applied months ago for 12 visas for Mexican workers; she received four last week.\u201cYou can never really recover,\u201d said Ms. Murray, who spoke by telephone from a Cincinnati church festival where she said she was running five rides instead of the usual 10. \u201cI\u2019ve been working since April and I\u2019m a week from August,\u201d she said. \u201cThe season is gone.\u201dThe visa program also ties foreign workers to one employer, making them susceptible to exploitation, according to Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Some recruiters demand payment, a practice banned in the United States, which saddles workers with debt and may make them more acquiescent.Rather than having employers determine how many foreign workers they need, the government could set up an independent body to identify labor shortages and allocate visas, Mr. Costa said.\u201cIt\u2019s only fair to set the system in a way that they are not exploited,\u201d he said, referring to migrant workers. \u201cOtherwise employers will try to keep wages down.\u201dMost carnival workers in Tlapacoyan are hired through a pipeline run by James Judkins, a former circus performer and president of the JKJ Workforce agency, based in Harlingen, Tex., and his representative in Mexico, Victor Apolinar Barrios.Residents recruited at the office of Mr. Apolinar \u2014 who is currently mayor of Tlapacoyan \u2014 said they believed he had made a fortune charging workers fees to secure jobs. None would agree to be quoted, saying they were afraid of spoiling their chances of getting work in the future.Arthur N. Read, general counsel of Friends of Farmworkers based in Philadelphia, who filed the complaint, said the settlement covered fees paid by workers to the union; a second settlement to cover backpay to workers is pending and could be far larger, he said.Mr. Apolinar did not respond to several calls seeking comment, and aides said he was absent when journalists visited the mayor\u2019s office, despite indications that he was present. Mr. Judkins said that his organization was very careful to follow the law and make sure no worker was charged illegal fees.Despite accusations of underhanded or illegal practices by employers, several carnival workers who were waiting for visas this month said they enjoyed the carnival circuit.Yes, there were days that stretched into the wee hours, patrons who vomited on the Zipper (a ride that involves being spun upside down in cages) and the occasional racist outburst from a parent whose child was not tall enough to board a ride. But there was also the chance to learn English, pick up some trendy, hand-me-down sneakers and leave the violence of Mexico behind.Eduardo Torres, 25, who has worked two seasons for Murray Brothers in fairs across Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, said he had never imagined traveling by airplane or visiting big cities. He marveled at what he called the \u201ccool stuff\u201d everywhere and picked up all sorts of used clothing. \u201cIt was a dream come true,\u201d he said.For Mr. Trujillo, whose favorite job was serving lemonade and hamburgers and learning English in the process \u2014 \u201clike a little school\u201d \u2014 the carnival became a window onto a more promising existence.In the United States, said Mr. Trujillo, \u201cif you dream about 15 things, you can buy five.\u201dIn Tlapacoyan, he said, you dream, too. But when you open your eyes, of the things you dreamed about, \u201cnot one of them is there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201dFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201dEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201dAt least they hope not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mapping the Brutality of North Korea, and Where the Bodies Are Buried", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For two years, from a cramped office in central Seoul, activists and volunteers from five countries have been doing something never tried before: creating interactive maps of places where North Korea is thought to have executed and buried prisoners.Over the years, defectors from the isolated country have testified to widespread human rights violations there, including what United Nations investigators have determined were extrajudicial executions of political prisoners and others. But there has never been a coordinated attempt to locate where those killings took place because the country remains off limits to outside rights investigators.\u201cIt is not unreasonable to assume that mass grave sites in existence today will still be there years from now,\u201d said Sarah A. Son, the group\u2019s research director. \u201cAs we have seen in many other post-conflict settings around the world, people will want to know what happened to family members, and an accurate historical record will need to be created as part of the process of recovery, particularly on a scale such as that in North Korea.\u201dArmed with Google Earth satellite imagery, the group has interviewed 375 North Korean defectors, asking them to help locate sites so that international rights officials can one day visit them to investigate, exhume bodies, secure forensic evidence and possibly bring charges against perpetrators. With the maps, the group said it aimed to provide \u201ca sense of the scale of the human rights violations, their locations, and their victims and their approximate numbers.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know when there will be a trial or other steps to hold perpetrators of the human rights abuses accountable, but that time will come, and we want to be as ready as possible,\u201d said Dan Bielefeld, a web developer and human rights activist from Milwaukee. \u201cOur location-based map of suspected sites is a start down that road.\u201dThe North vehemently denied the findings, and its allies China and Russia have stalled any attempt to bring the North before the tribunal.The activists\u2019 group, whose mapping project was financed by the National Endowment for Democracy, based in Washington, did not include the interactive maps in its report for fear North Korea would tamper with the sites. But it allowed a reporter to examine them on the condition that the locations of the sites would not be revealed.More than 200 locations where killings are suspected, marked with blue squares, were clustered in Hamgyongbukdo, a northeastern province of North Korea. Most of the defectors interviewed hailed from that province. (A vast majority of 30,000 North Korean defectors living in South Korea come from the provinces bordering China.)When Mr. Bielefeld zoomed in on one town, 53 blue squares appeared within 2.5 miles of a hillside site where burials are suspected. When he clicked on a square, a brief summary popped up: a public execution by firing squad on charges the victim stole parts of mining equipment. The victim was shot by three officers from the Ministry of People\u2019s Security.Each square was linked to digital testimonials, including audio files, from defectors. Some testimonials gave detailed firsthand accounts with the name and profession of the victim, while others relied on secondhand information.In one testimonial, a defector cited a neighbor who saw security officers hacking a victim to death in a garage. The neighbor later confirmed from a relative working as a security officer that such extrajudicial killings were common in the garage. Mr. Bielefeld put a blue square on the building on his program based on the open-source OpenStreetMap.The group said North Koreans were executed for such crimes as smuggling mushrooms to China, stealing copper from factories, distributing South Korean dramas, human trafficking and \u201ca slip of the tongue,\u201d usually a reference to criticism of the government.It said public executions took place most often between 1994 and 2000, during which North Korea struggled to control its people, who were suffering in a nationwide famine.\u201cThey hanged people in crowded places like markets and left the bodies there for hours to instill fear among the people,\u201d said Oh Se-hyek, a North Korean defector who conducted the interviews for the mapping project.Mr. Oh said the biggest challenge for him was to persuade other defectors to testify for the mapping project, even when he promised not to reveal their personal information. Even after resettling in South Korea, defectors feared that the North Korean authorities would trace their whereabouts and retaliate against their relatives back in the North.Some of the executions on the digital maps dated from the 1960s, but some were as recent as 2015. As many as 15 people were executed at the same time, usually by firing squad.Lee Young-hwan, executive director of the Transitional Justice Working Group, recalled the shock he felt when he was a college student doing volunteer work with North Korean defectors in 1999. During a painting class, a 7-year-old boy from the North depicted a scene he saw in his old homeland: uniformed North Korean soldiers executing people by shooting.Encouraged by the 2014 United Nations report, Mr. Lee began putting together the international team to use satellite imagery and open-source mapping technology to record North Korean human rights violations, just as security analysts use such technology to monitor the North\u2019s military and nuclear sites.\u201cAs we interview more defectors down the road, we expect to locate more killing and burial sites across the North,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cOur work is still at an early stage. This is a collaborative work, and we expect more technical and other volunteers to join us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. to Paris for $400? What Money Buys on the New Low-Cost Airlines", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayPerhaps you\u2019ve been intrigued by the affordable (and in some cases downright cheap) fares being dangled lately by low-cost, long-haul carriers like Norwegian, Level and XL Airways. Fleeting introductory fares for a handful of cities are one thing, but everyday fares in and out of major hubs are another.Let\u2019s take a look at what you can actually get, and when.In the fall, the list is slated to grow: Providence, R.I., to Guadeloupe (Oct. 29); Providence to Martinique (Oct. 30); Fort Lauderdale to Martinique (Oct. 30); Newark to Rome (Nov. 9); and Los Angeles to Rome (Nov. 11). Winter additions will include Oakland, Calif., to Rome (Feb. 6); and Newark to Paris (Feb. 28). Next year Norwegian will also add Chicago to London (March 25); Austin, Tex., to London (March 27); Oakland to Paris (April 10); and Boston to Paris (May 2).What can you book today? I ran some searches to find out, and to compare some of Norwegian\u2019s fares to other airlines.One recent search, from New York City to Paris, was for a departure on Oct. 6, returning on Oct. 15. A round-trip direct flight was about $561 with taxes and surcharges. That was cheaper than most flights on major carriers, including British Airways, Air France, Delta and United, which for those dates were offering economy tickets around $700 to $800. Great. Yet in this particular case, while the Norwegian fare was cheap, it wasn\u2019t the absolute cheapest because of a promotion from yet another low-cost carrier.When considering low-cost carriers, keep in mind that you\u2019re generally not buying much more than a seat. The Norwegian fares mentioned above, for instance, do not include a meal, seat selection or a checked bag. Level\u2019s fares have similar restrictions. XL\u2019s fares, surprisingly, include a meal and a checked bag.Level fares weren\u2019t available on many of the days I wanted to book, and the website was a bit wonky during recent flight searches. But in one successful session, I chose a flight to Barcelona from Los Angeles on Sunday, Sept. 7, with a return on the 14th. The site redirected me to Iberia, where several one-way fares were displayed.The cheapest fare in economy was a direct flight from Level: around $605. For a little more, $670, I could get a non-Level Iberia fare known as a Basic+ seat, which includes a checked bag and meals during the flight. (The fare was nonrefundable, but I could make changes for a fee.) And if I spent yet another $15, I could fly Optimal, which includes the Basic+ features as well as the ability to choose a particular seat. If you want to save, you\u2019ll have to resist the upsell.Now let\u2019s look at the return: The Level flight was direct (nice) for about $426. (The Basic+ fare was $491. The Optimal fare was $506.) Choosing the Level fares in both directions, the ticket was $1,029.72.I ran a search on Google Flights to compare that fare with some from other carriers. The Level price was the cheapest fare for a nonstop between Los Angeles and Barcelona. Actually, it was the only nonstop flight that turned up on those days. (Travelers willing to make a stop could have found round-trip fares for much less, like one on KLM for $723.)In some searches, comparing the same trip on Norwegian and Level was instructive. Consider a round-trip from Los Angeles to Barcelona, departing Oct. 8 and returning Oct. 15. The departure on Norwegian included one stop for about $258. The return was direct, for about $312. The total was $570, including taxes and surcharges.On Level, for the same trip, the departing flight was direct for about $295; however, there was no available Level return fare on that Sunday, Oct. 15. The return fare offered on the site was a Flexible fare for around $1,116 that included things such as a checked bag, meals, seat selection and ticket changes. That kicked the round-trip total up to $1,409.66.Bottom line?As with any low-cost option, there are trade-offs. You must weigh the ticket cost against other factors, like your physical comfort and peace of mind. Is a cheaper ticket worth not being able (or paying extra) to check a bag or have a meal during a flight? Is it worth being assigned a middle seat or one beside the bathroom? These are the sorts of questions to take into account when considering low-cost, long-haul carriers. At what price the far-flung vacation?Only you can answer.Advertisement"}

The story of three self-proclaimed \u201cold bags\u201d who run off to a Greek island for a year in order to unshackle the reins of family and lovers, the beautifully paced \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d is narrated by Ruth, a rueful detective novelist who will chronicle these friends\u2019 sojourn in a weekly magazine column called \u201cGranny \u00e0 Go Go.\u201d Ruth\u2019s two compatriots are her half sister, Bess, a generous, unambitious world traveler devoted to romance and shopping and overeating; and Dania, a snobby, braggadocious Israeli-American psychotherapist who harbors a sinister secret and talks like Google Translate. (\u201cAmn\u2019t I great, Ruthi? \u2026 I give myself a raving review!\u201d)The ladies, all on the brink of 70, are in search of sun-kissed scampering. \u201cWe\u2019d put passion behind us,\u201d Ruth explains. \u201cNot that men had lost their charm, we said, not really. It was just that the blinders were gone, the sport, the spring and sway of the dance, the careless unreasoning madness of it all. Anyway, we said, passion had accomplished its chief work, at least from a biological point of view \u2014 children and grandchildren. What we wanted now was peace.\u201dBut soon enough, this peace is in pieces. Bess launches into an affair with a local \u2014 a cabdriver named Dionysos \u2014 only to unleash the fury of the man\u2019s wife, who tracks Bess down and spits on her. Meanwhile, Dania is spending a certain amount of time trying to fend off Wendy, one of her psychotherapy patients, who won\u2019t stop telephoning at all hours of the night and is revealed to be blackmailing Dania. For her part, Ruth must deal with Finn, the sometime lover she\u2019d more or less dumped when he couldn\u2019t rally any sympathy for her struggle with breast cancer, who shows up out of the Aegean blue and proceeds to hit on Bess. When Bess tells Finn she\u2019s seeing the married Dionysos, the horn-dog Finn asks what Dionysos\u2019 wife looks like. Men.All of what I\u2019ve just recounted happens by Page 65 of this incident-packed novel. Further complications will be set in motion with the arrival on the island of what feels like dozens of people: Bess\u2019s friend and helper, Gladness, a bigoted Zulu nanny; various of the three women\u2019s emotionally trying children and grandchildren; Rex, Bess\u2019s philandering sometime lover; and Wendy the blackmailer. (To help us sort out this swirl, Freed has thoughtfully prefaced her tale with a list of dramatis personae.)If on its surface \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d is a warts-and-all repudiation of the late-in-life female empowerment yarn as typified by the movies \u201cEnchanted April\u201d and \u201cShirley Valentine,\u201d the gimlet-eyed Freed is intent on something deeper and more unsettling. Can we ever really absent ourselves, even briefly, from the important people in our lives? Is it lunacy to think we have an essential self \u2014 a self that exists outside our relationships to other people? Why is freedom so terrifying?Though Freed is too smart to give away the answers to these questions, she puts the best encapsulation of their essential paradox into the mouth of the least reflective of the book\u2019s major characters. \u201cI want something without a word for it,\u201d Bess tells Ruth toward the end of the novel. \u201cI always have. Only now I know I\u2019ll never find out what it is.\u201d She adds: \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the thing about old age. \u2026 We understand that we can never know.\u201dIt\u2019s quiet moments like these \u2014 as well as the parts of the book devoted to Dania\u2019s troubling and punishable-by-law secret \u2014 that make this novel merit our attention. So chockablock is \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d with unregenerate characters saying off-putting or vile things to one another that this pantywaist reader occasionally longed for the quietudes found in the work of that other chronicler of women of a certain age, Barbara Pym, who can get a lot of mileage out of, say, an ambiguous smile from a local vicar at a jumble sale.But as we know from Freed\u2019s 2005 essay collection, \u201cReading, Writing and Leaving Home: Life on the Page,\u201d Freed, who grew up in Durban, South Africa, is not one to pull her punches. In that book she recounts how she once regaled dinner party guests with a somewhat enhanced account of her husband\u2019s snoring; she asserts that it\u2019s a writer\u2019s duty to deliver the goods, even if those goods offend. (Her husband left the room in a huff.)

{"Headline": "Cars Suck Up Data About You. Where Does It All Go?", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsCars have become rolling listening posts. They can track phone calls and texts, log queries to websites, record what radio stations you listen to \u2014 even tell you when you are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limit.Automakers, local governments, retailers, insurers and tech companies are eager to leverage this information, especially as cars transform from computers on wheels into something more like self-driving shuttles. And they want to tap into even more data, including what your car\u2019s video cameras see as you travel down a street.Who gets what information and for what purposes? Here is a primer.Government rules limit how event data recorders \u2014 the black boxes in cars that record information such as speed and seatbelt position in the seconds before, during and after a crash \u2014 can be used. But no single law in the United States covers all the data captured by all the other devices in automobiles.Those devices include radar sensors, diagnostic systems, in-dash navigation systems and built-in cellular connections. Newer cars may record a driver\u2019s eye movements, the weight of people in the front seats and whether the driver\u2019s hands are on the wheel. Smartphones connected to the car, and those not connected to the car, can also track your activities, including any texting while driving.There are few rules or laws in the United States that govern what data can be collected and used by companies. (An exception is medical information.) The United States generally does not ensure that companies strip out names or other personal details, or stipulate how such information should be used, for example.Typically, a driver agrees to be tracked and monitored by checking off a box on one of the user agreement forms needed to register a car\u2019s in-dash system or a navigation app. In most cases, the driver must agree to such terms to use an app or service.While anyone from an app developer to Google or Spotify may be capturing your digital moves while you drive, in most cases the primary collector and owner of this deluge of data is the automaker. And while it presents some potentially valuable new opportunities for them, it also has raised some nettlesome customer relationship problems.Consequently, many car companies view the acknowledgment of such data collection as problematic for customer relations. While drivers may welcome use of the information to relay diagnostic and service information (\u201cTime for an oil change!\u201d), automakers are aware that many consumers are wary of other uses \u2014 so much so that several companies declined to comment on their future plans or data collection policies.There are cases in which drivers regularly choose to trade their data to get a benefit.Even insurance companies are experimenting with apps and dongles that record braking, acceleration and speed with the lure of lower rates for well-mannered drivers.In Arizona, Farmers Insurance is offering customers a 3 percent discount just for using a smartphone app that tracks driving behavior, including whether the driver is holding a phone or using a hands-free Bluetooth connection.\u201cWe give value back to the customer,\u201d said Mariel Devesa, Farmers\u2019 head of product innovation, noting that drivers can save up to 13 percent on their insurance based on their habits. \u201cAnd they can improve as drivers by seeing their scores.\u201dThe benefits to consumers \u2014 and potential threats to personal privacy and security \u2014 become murkier, though, as companies trade and combine information collected from multiple sources, including cars, to reveal travel and buying patterns. Aggregated information can be purchased from navigation companies, for example, and combined with other so-called anonymized information from dating apps to identify the habits of a specific demographic.\u201cWe can tell who\u2019s on the road, where they live, how frequently they make this trip, and whether or not they are on vacation,\u201d said Laura Schewel, founder of StreetLight Data, which provides such information to clients like urban planners and retailers.\u201cIn France, they don\u2019t want you to time-stamp locations,\u201d said Ben Volkow, chief executive of Otonomo, \u201cwhile in Germany they are more sensitive about speed information.\u201dSuch cultural and legal differences make it hard for car companies to collect a consistent set of data points without legal trouble. It also makes it difficult to offer special services to customers or sell the aggregated data to marketers and retailers.\u201cSo if you have a smartphone, and you still have an expectation of privacy,\u201d said Ms. Schewel of StreetLight, \u201cyou\u2019re fooling yourself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Alphabet, a Record Fine Is Both a Footnote and a Warning", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot many companies can turn a $2.7 billion fine into a financial footnote.But that is what Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, did with its quarterly earnings. The results, announced on Monday, were a microcosm of the opportunities and the risks in front of the company. On one hand, it was hitting on all cylinders with its core search engine. Its various internet services were as essential as ever with the shift to smartphones. And its YouTube video platform was shaking off a short-lived boycott by big brands.But while its business hums along, Alphabet faces a challenge that has little to do with its day-to-day performance.In addition to the penalty it levied, the European Commission said Google could face a larger fine if it did not find a way to resolve the issue within 90 days.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a call with investors that \u201cit\u2019s still early in our analysis\u201d of how the company plans to deal with the European Commission action. Alphabet said it was still considering an appeal.Google is facing two other antitrust cases in Europe involving Android, its mobile software that runs on about 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones, and its advertising products. Google has denied any wrongdoing in both instances.In a research note last week, Mark Mahaney, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said one risk for Alphabet was that users would be turned off if search results were made less useful to appease regulators.The European Commission fine dropped Alphabet\u2019s quarterly earnings in this year\u2019s second quarter to their lowest levels in more than two years. Alphabet\u2019s net income fell 28 percent, to $3.52 billion. If the fine were excluded, net income rose 28 percent.The company\u2019s earnings per share came in at $5.01, compared to analysts\u2019 expectations of $4.49. Revenue rose 21 percent, to $26.01 billion, in the quarter.Alphabet shares were down about 3 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement of the quarterly results. But during regular trading on Monday, Alphabet\u2019s share price neared a record high, breaking the $1,000 a share barrier.Alphabet said that paid clicks \u2014 defined as someone clicking on or viewing an advertisement \u2014 on Google\u2019s web properties like search and YouTube rose 61 percent from a year earlier, offsetting a decline in ad prices for the company\u2019s sites.YouTube was a bright spot in another way. Alphabet said revenues from the video site were strong despite a boycott by major advertisers this year after reports of brand advertising appearing next to offensive videos. YouTube has said it was giving more control to advertisers about where their ads would appear.YouTube\u2019s reach is hard to resist. Alphabet said that YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly viewers, and that people watch, on average, 60 minutes a day on their phones and tablets. Alphabet also introduced new advertising formats for YouTube, including six-second commercials before videos begin.Even as the video business becomes more important to Alphabet, Ms. Porat said there were no plans to break out YouTube\u2019s revenues from the overall company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel, While Pivoting to Artificial Intelligence, Tries to Protect Lead", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe computers in modern data centers \u2014 the engine rooms of the digital economy \u2014 are powered mainly by Intel chips. They animate the computing clouds of the internet giants and corporate data centers worldwide.But Intel is now facing new competitive forces that could pose a challenge to its data-center dominance and profitability.In particular, the rise of artificial intelligence is creating demand for new computing hardware tailored to handle vast amounts of unruly data and complex machine-learning software \u2014 and Intel\u2019s general-purpose chips are not yet tuned for the most demanding tasks. Instead, specialized chips are delivering better performance on artificial intelligence programs that identify images, recognize speech and translate languages.How successful Intel\u2019s efforts prove to be will be crucial not only for the company but also for the long-term future of the computer chip industry.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more competition in the data-center market than we\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Linley Gwennap, a semiconductor expert who leads a technology research firm in Mountain View, Calif.Intel has long dominated the business for central processing chips that control industry-standard servers in data centers. Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, said the company controlled about 96 percent of such chips.Big Intel customers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also working on chip designs. AMD and ARM, which make central processing chips like Intel, are edging into the data-center market, too. IBM made its Power chip technology open source a few years ago, and Google and others are designing prototypes.To counter some of these trends, Intel is expected on Tuesday to provide details about the performance and uses of its new chips and its plans for the future. The company is set to formally introduce the next generation of its Xeon data-center microprocessors, code-named Skylake. And there will be a range of Xeon offerings with different numbers of processing cores, speeds, amounts of attached memory, and prices.Yet analysts said that would represent progress along Intel\u2019s current path rather than an embrace of new models of computing.Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein Research, said, \u201cThey\u2019re late to artificial intelligence.\u201dThe Nervana technology, Intel has said, is being folded into its product road map. A chip code-named Lake Crest is being tested and will be available to some customers this year.Lake Crest is tailored for A.I. programs called neural networks, which learn specific tasks by analyzing huge amounts of data. Feed millions of cat photos into a neural network and it can learn to recognize a cat \u2014 and later pick out cats by color and breed. The principle is the same for speech recognition and language translation.Intel has also said it is working to integrate Nervana technology into a future Xeon processor, code-named Knight\u2019s Crest.Intel\u2019s challenge, analysts said, is a classic one of adapting an extraordinarily successful business to a fundamental shift in the marketplace.As the dominant data-center chip maker, used by a wide array of customers with different needs, Intel has loaded more capabilities into its central processors. It has been an immensely profitable strategy: Intel had net income of $10.3 billion last year on revenue of $59.4 billion.Yet key customers increasingly want computing designs that parcel out work to a collection of specialized chips rather than have that work flow through the central processor. A central processor can be thought of as part brain, doing the logic processing, and part traffic cop, orchestrating the flow of data through the computer.The outlying, specialized chips are known in the industry as accelerators. They can do certain things, like data-driven A.I. tasks, faster than a central processor. Accelerators include graphics processors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (F.P.G.A.s).A more diverse set of chips does not mean the need for Intel\u2019s central processor disappears. The processor just does less of the work, becoming more of a traffic cop and less of a brain. If this happens, Intel\u2019s business becomes less profitable.Mr. Gwennap, the independent analyst, said, \u201cIntel has a very good read on data centers and what those customers want.\u201dStill, the question remains whether knowing what the customers want translates into giving them what they want, if that path presents a threat to Intel\u2019s business model and profit margins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Amazon\u2019s Influence Grows, Marketers Scramble to Tailor Strategies", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon\u2019s rapidly expanding influence on a wide portion of the American public has become impossible to ignore \u2014 and it is giving rise to a whole new side of the advertising industry.As more people live large portions of their lives in Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, ad agencies are increasingly offering specialized services to help brands take full advantage of the company\u2019s universe.That means adding flourishes like recipes and magazine-style images to product pages, coming up with creative ways to get customers to post reviews on Amazon and plotting how companies can best connect with people who are using devices like the voice-activated Echo.And Amazon itself, aware of its growing power, is encouraging companies to buy more ads through its own media group. Its argument: When an ad is on Amazon, a direct connection can be made between people seeing it and then making a purchase.\u201cHow your product is perceived on Amazon and in the Amazon community in ratings and reviews has such a powerful impact on the future of you as a brand,\u201d said John Denny, vice president for digital and e-commerce at Bai Brands, the beverage company. \u201cIncreasingly, if you win on Amazon, you win, period. And this is the world marketers have to wrap their brains around.\u201dSeveral advertising executives anticipate that more agencies will begin offering Amazon-focused services, comparing the company\u2019s rise to previous paradigm shifts like when search engines and social media became a daily part of people\u2019s lives.Dooley Tombras, the firm\u2019s executive vice president, said it sent products to influential Amazon reviewers in hopes of soliciting positive feedback and conducted \u201cguerrilla sampling,\u201d like holding events \u201cwhere we\u2019re handing out a product and we\u2019ve got teams there with iPads and we\u2019re encouraging people to write reviews of a product on the spot.\u201dThere are more than 14,000 reviews of the powder. The page also has more than a dozen images of the powder taken from \u201cmultiple angles\u201d against a light background to look clean and professional, Mr. Tombras said, along with short videos extolling the powder.Brands can pay Amazon to customize the middle of pages with large advertorial images and information \u2014 which in the protein powder\u2019s case included photos of men working out; a recipe for \u201cbirthday cake pancakes\u201d made with the chocolate-flavored whey; and a chart featuring six of its other products, like Micronized Creatine Powder, explaining when and how they should be consumed.Mr. Tombras\u2019s firm is even working on a feature for Echo devices that will provide recipes from Optimum Nutrition. \u201cIf you find a recipe you like and happen to not have that flavor or item, you can go ahead and make that purchase,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is pretty cool.\u201dAmazon has long been an online shopping behemoth, but marketers now know it is playing an increasingly important role in how people discover and learn about their goods.\u201cE-commerce is nothing new, it\u2019s been going on for decades, and Amazon is nothing new, it\u2019s been successful for decades \u2014 but now they are becoming much more of a dominant force in brand discovery,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the digital agency 360i.Its quick success in categories like apparel and the popularity of voice search emphasized that, Ms. Hofstetter said. \u201cAmazon is the new shelf space,\u201d she added, \u201cand if you\u2019re not on it, you may be rendered invisible.\u201dThe agencies said in the release that more than half of United States consumers now started online product searches on Amazon, compared with 28 percent on search engines and 16 percent on retailer websites.Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call this year that \u201cAmazon\u2019s penetration in most areas is frightening to some.\u201d He added that the company was his response when people asked him, \u201cWhat worries you when you get up at night and when you wake up in the morning?\u201dIn an interview in Cannes, France, last month, Mr. Sorrell said his firm wanted to do more with clients and Amazon, but noted there were major questions around how brands might gain access its customer data and compete on voice search.\u201cWhat happens if I say to Alexa, \u2018I like Cheerios,\u2019 and Alexa says, \u2018I\u2019ve got Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes, which are 10 percent off\u2019?\u201d he said.Amazon Media Group, the company\u2019s growing advertising division, has been looking to assuage such concerns while touting new ways marketers can reach people on Amazon. Seth Dallaire, its head of global ad sales and marketing, has been urging agencies to view product pages and images as \u201cbrand marketing vehicles,\u201d noting that if they are not well maintained it could undermine all the work companies did to get people there in the first place.\u201cWe can see the entire customer-decision journey, and that\u2019s what\u2019s unique,\u201d Mr. Dallaire said. \u201cWe can help a brand if they\u2019re selling their products on Amazon understand when a customer is exposed to an ad and, when they clicked on an ad, if they bought something, and then we can help them tailor their marketing messages and their creative to each different step.\u201dThat\u2019s no small pitch given the guesswork that goes into advertising. Amazon has long sold lucrative sponsored product listings and other ads tied to search terms on its site, like Google. It also offers automatically placed ads on external sites using its own technology and data, and marketing on Amazon packages and devices like Kindles.Amazon does not disclose the size of its ad business, though estimates show it is well below Google and Facebook, which each bring in more than $25 billion from ads annually. While eMarketer estimated that Amazon will attract more than $1 billion in ad revenue this year, BMO Capital Markets forecasts $3.5 billion for 2017 and $5.7 billion next year.\u201cIn the grand scheme of things, the advertising revenue they\u2019re generating is small compared to Google \u2014 you can barely compare them,\u201d said Norm Johnston, global chief strategy and digital officer for Mindshare. \u201cBut for Amazon, it\u2019s not the advertising revenue in itself. They know if brands invest in the platform, the more sales they\u2019re going to generate, and a lot of those sales lead to subscription models.\u201dIn the past, many brands handled their Amazon business through store sales teams that determined shelf positioning and end-of-aisle displays at brick-and-mortar chains. That is no longer workable as Amazon extends its ad network, offering branding opportunities through its Prime program and streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cIn the old world, you\u2019d run magazines, TV spots and outdoor ads, then you\u2019d go into the shop, and they\u2019d control what happened in the shop,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cYou can\u2019t distinguish like that anymore.\u201dTo that end, marketers are also learning to pay new attention to issues like how much of an item is in stock before promoting it, or risk being penalized by Amazon\u2019s algorithms if they aren\u2019t able to handle demand, Mr. Denny of Bai said.Mr. Dallaire said Amazon planned to keep investing in its ad sales and agency development teams.Ultimately, he said, the interest is generated by behavioral shifts.\u201cIt could be people shopping on their phones, the expectation you or I might have of getting immediate customer-review information and pricing information within seconds of pulling a device out of our pockets, it could be the expectation of hearing a song you ask Alexa to play,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvertisers want to make sure they are not missing out on these customer trends.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it has buy-in across the spectrum of its membership, bringing together competitors like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, as well as scores of regional papers like The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, which face the gravest threats.Capturing the current mood, News Corporation \u2014 which oversees The Journal, The New York Post and Dow Jones \u2014 said in a statement that it supported the effort to \u201cfocus the public and Congress on the anticompetitive behavior of the digital duopoly, especially as it adversely affects the news and information businesses.\u201dMark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, told me that \u201cthe temperature is rising in terms of concern, and in some cases anger, about what seems like a very asymmetric, disadvantageous relationship between the publishers and the very big digital platforms.\u201dThe thinking is that publishers need the option of operating as a group \u2014 and the leverage that would come from any collective action \u2014 should they determine that it\u2019s the only way to win meaningful accommodations.In the tumultuous news climate, Google and Facebook don\u2019t want to be seen as undermining real journalism. And executives with both companies told me it was in their interests to have ample, reliable news content.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, said. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do.\u201d\u201cWe want to help publishers succeed as they transition to digital,\u201d Google said in a statement, calling the effort \u201ca priority.\u201dPublishers say they appreciate how Google and Facebook put their news content in front of many millions of users they couldn\u2019t reach on their own. And they acknowledge the efforts the platforms are making to help.But as Mike Klingensmith, the publisher of The Star Tribune and the chairman of the News Media Alliance, told me in an interview, \u201cthey\u2019re talking to us, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of action yet.\u201dMr. Klingensmith said that for midsize dailies, which have been hit particularly hard by the shift in ad spending, \u201cit is impossible for us to go as a one-off company and negotiate or even get an appointment with these companies.\u201dThe Times is backing the move for what is called an anticompetitive safe haven, in part, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cbecause we care about the whole of journalism as well as about The New York Times.\u201dHe said The Times would consider joining a collective negotiation should its own talks fail to yield satisfactory results, which, he noted, they have yet to do.The Alliance acknowledges that its bid requires legislation giving them specific clearance to negotiate as a group, which is not commonly granted. It\u2019s an especially big ask from a Congress that hasn\u2019t had a great legislative batting average and whose controlling party, the Republicans, is not in a very press-friendly mood these days.Press representatives for the Senate and House Judiciary Committees \u2014 led by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia \u2014 said they couldn\u2019t comment without hearing directly from the Alliance.The Alliance\u2019s outside counsel, Jonathan Kanter, said he was hopeful that one argument in particular could sway them: \u201cThe product at issue is important from a public policy perspective \u2014 we\u2019re not just talking about widgets, we\u2019re talking about news, and news is crucial for a democratic society.\u201dWhatever the outcome, that should be a starting point everyone can agree upon.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Self-Driving Cars Near, Washington Plays Catch-Up", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSelf-driving cars are zooming at breakneck speed toward America\u2019s roadways, and Washington is finally reaching for its seatbelt.For years, the race to create fully autonomous vehicles went mostly unnoticed by federal lawmakers, who tended to speak of self-driving cars (if they spoke of them at all) as something out of \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d It was an odd blind spot, given how close companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit were to creating mass-market autonomous vehicles, and how many important industries \u2014 taxi driving, long-haul trucking and shipping among them \u2014 stood to be drastically transformed as a result.But now, lawmakers are taking cautious steps toward the driverless future.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who supports the House\u2019s self-driving car bill, told me that lawmakers had been prompted to act by concerns about economic competitiveness, in addition to the promise of safer roads.\u201cThese vehicles are going to be developed, and I want to make sure we\u2019re developing them in this country, not China, India or the European Union,\u201d said Ms. Dingell, a former auto lobbyist and General Motors executive whose district includes the headquarters of Ford Motor Company. \u201cThe challenge for this country, period, is how we stay at the forefront of innovation and technology.\u201dRegulating self-driving cars is a tricky balancing act. Crack down too hard, and you risk stalling the development of a potentially lifesaving technology. Go easy, and you risk letting unsafe vehicles onto public roads before they\u2019re adequately tested. There are cybersecurity risks to address, too, since autonomous vehicles will be connected wirelessly to the internet and could be susceptible to hacking. The House bill would require manufacturers of new autonomous systems to submit security plans for their self-driving cars, as well as meet basic safety standards.\u201cPeople want to feel like they\u2019re in control of their destiny,\u201d said Elliot Katz, a lawyer at DLA Piper who works on self-driving car issues. Mr. Katz said federal regulation could help convince consumers that autonomous vehicles are safe.\u201cWe need rules and regulations so that the driving public knows this isn\u2019t just the Wild West,\u201d he said.Right now, the benefits of self-driving cars are clear and concrete \u2014 fewer traffic deaths, easier commutes, the ability to safely use your phone while you drive \u2014 while the costs remain largely theoretical. But experts have warned that the self-driving car revolution could usher in sweeping economic changes, including the displacement of millions of workers. Roughly 1.7 million Americans drive long-haul trucks for a living, and another 1.7 million people drive taxis, buses and other commercial vehicles. When autonomous vehicles render many of those jobs obsolete, politicians will have a much bigger set of problems to contend with.\u201cGovernments have largely focused on the legality of automated driving,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. \u201cThey should also pay attention to the broader challenges and opportunities of automated driving \u2014 what it means for our lives, our governments, our land use, our cities, our social services, our jobs and how we live.\u201dThe politics of autonomous driving will almost certainly become messier as self-driving cars edge closer to widespread use. There will be safety and security worries, intra-industry squabbles and backlash from driver unions concerned about job loss. The self-driving car could become a politically polarizing symbol, with some Americans cheering it as a technological miracle and others viewing it as a nanny-state intrusion into individual liberty. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that one day a politician might run for office on a \u201cMake America Drive Again\u201d platform.But for now, as self-driving cars peek over the horizon and gridlock seizes Capitol Hill, lawmakers just seem happy to have found something \u2014 anything \u2014 to agree on.\u201cIt\u2019s sexy, and that carries issues a long way,\u201d Mr. Smith said of the self-driving car movement. \u201cA hot, potentially even bipartisan subject can be more appealing than the mundane.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Is Stuck. Here\u2019s How to Move It Forward.", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterArtificial Intelligence is colossally hyped these days, but the dirty little secret is that it still has a long, long way to go. Sure, A.I. systems have mastered an array of games, from chess and Go to \u201cJeopardy\u201d and poker, but the technology continues to struggle in the real world. Robots fall over while opening doors, prototype driverless cars frequently need human intervention, and nobody has yet designed a machine that can read reliably at the level of a sixth grader, let alone a college student. Computers that can educate themselves \u2014 a mark of true intelligence \u2014 remain a dream.Even the trendy technique of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d which uses artificial neural networks to discern complex statistical correlations in huge amounts of data, often comes up short. Some of the best image-recognition systems, for example, can successfully distinguish dog breeds, yet remain capable of major blunders, like mistaking a simple pattern of yellow and black stripes for a school bus. Such systems can neither comprehend what is going on in complex visual scenes (\u201cWho is chasing whom and why?\u201d) nor follow simple instructions (\u201cRead this story and summarize what it means\u201d).Although the field of A.I. is exploding with microdiscoveries, progress toward the robustness and flexibility of human cognition remains elusive. Not long ago, for example, while sitting with me in a cafe, my 3-year-old daughter spontaneously realized that she could climb out of her chair in a new way: backward, by sliding through the gap between the back and the seat of the chair. My daughter had never seen anyone else disembark in quite this way; she invented it on her own \u2014 and without the benefit of trial and error, or the need for terabytes of labeled data.Presumably, my daughter relied on an implicit theory of how her body moves, along with an implicit theory of physics \u2014 how one complex object travels through the aperture of another. I challenge any robot to do the same. A.I. systems tend to be passive vessels, dredging through data in search of statistical correlations; humans are active engines for discovering how things work.To get computers to think like humans, we need a new A.I. paradigm, one that places \u201ctop down\u201d and \u201cbottom up\u201d knowledge on equal footing. Bottom-up knowledge is the kind of raw information we get directly from our senses, like patterns of light falling on our retina. Top-down knowledge comprises cognitive models of the world and how it works.Deep learning is very good at bottom-up knowledge, like discerning which patterns of pixels correspond to golden retrievers as opposed to Labradors. But it is no use when it comes to top-down knowledge. If my daughter sees her reflection in a bowl of water, she knows the image is illusory; she knows she is not actually in the bowl. To a deep-learning system, though, there is no difference between the reflection and the real thing, because the system lacks a theory of the world and how it works. Integrating that sort of knowledge of the world may be the next great hurdle in A.I., a prerequisite to grander projects like using A.I. to advance medicine and scientific understanding.I fear, however, that neither of our two current approaches to funding A.I. research \u2014 small research labs in the academy and significantly larger labs in private industry \u2014 is poised to succeed. I say this as someone who has experience with both models, having worked on A.I. both as an academic researcher and as the founder of a start-up company, Geometric Intelligence, which was recently acquired by Uber.Academic labs are too small. Take the development of automated machine reading, which is a key to building any truly intelligent system. Too many separate components are needed for any one lab to tackle the problem. A full solution will incorporate advances in natural language processing (e.g., parsing sentences into words and phrases), knowledge representation (e.g., integrating the content of sentences with other sources of knowledge) and inference (reconstructing what is implied but not written). Each of those problems represents a lifetime of work for any single university lab.Corporate labs like those of Google and Facebook have the resources to tackle big questions, but in a world of quarterly reports and bottom lines, they tend to concentrate on narrow problems like optimizing advertisement placement or automatically screening videos for offensive content. There is nothing wrong with such research, but it is unlikely to lead to major breakthroughs. Even Google Translate, which pulls off the neat trick of approximating translations by statistically associating sentences across languages, doesn\u2019t understand a word of what it is translating.I look with envy at my peers in high-energy physics, and in particular at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, a huge, international collaboration, with thousands of scientists and billions of dollars of funding. They pursue ambitious, tightly defined projects (like using the Large Hadron Collider to discover the Higgs boson) and share their results with the world, rather than restricting them to a single country or corporation. Even the largest \u201copen\u201d efforts at A.I., like OpenAI, which has about 50 staff members and is sponsored in part by Elon Musk, is tiny by comparison.An international A.I. mission focused on teaching machines to read could genuinely change the world for the better \u2014 the more so if it made A.I. a public good, rather than the property of a privileged few.Gary Marcus is a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University.Advertisement"}

There was nothing to suggest I was looking for a fiscal benefits analyst, emergency medical technician or brand ambassador, but they showed up anyway.In part, the disconnect stems from a revved-up labor market that encourages job hopping and inflated credentials. It also reflects the vast online jobs marketplace, where restless applicants shoot off their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s like one of those T-shirt cannons at a football stadium, firing without aiming. Not a single candidate bothered to look us up and refer to what we do in the cover note.

{"Headline": "Beijing Wants A.I. to Be Made in China by 2030", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 If Beijing has its way, the future of artificial intelligence will be made in China.The country laid out a development plan on Thursday to become the world leader in A.I. by 2030, aiming to surpass its rivals technologically and build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion.Released by the State Council, the policy is a statement of intent from the top rungs of China\u2019s government: The world\u2019s second-largest economy will be investing heavily to ensure its companies, government and military leap to the front of the pack in a technology many think will one day form the basis of computing.The plan comes with China preparing a multibillion-dollar national investment initiative to support \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects, start-ups and academic research in A.I., according to two professors who consulted with the government about the effort.China\u2019s capabilities, especially in advanced and new technologies, have long lagged those of its better developed neighbors as well as Europe and America. But a multiple-decade industrial policy to help it catch up has paid dividends.Yet it was a foreign feat of A.I. prowess that provided one of the greatest impetuses for the new plan.As a sort of Sputnik moment for China, the professors said, the event paved the way for a new flow of funds into the discipline.China\u2019s ambitions with A.I. range from the anodyne to the dystopian, according to the new plan. It calls for support for everything from agriculture and medicine to manufacturing.Yet it also calls for the technology to work in concert with the country\u2019s homeland security and surveillance efforts. China wants to integrate A.I. into guided missiles, use it to track people on closed-circuit cameras, censor the internet and even predict crimes.In a timeline laid out within the new policy, the government expects its companies and research facilities to be at the same level as leading countries like the United States by 2020. Five years later, it calls for breakthroughs in select disciplines within A.I. that will become \u201ca key impetus for economic transformation.\u201dIn the final stage, by 2030, China will \u201cbecome the world\u2019s premier artificial intelligence innovation center,\u201d which in turn will \u201cfoster a new national leadership and establish the key fundamentals for an economic great power.\u201dWhile the language in Chinese industrial policy can sound stodgy and the targets overly ambitious, Beijing takes its economic planning seriously. Experts say that even if major spending efforts ultimately waste resources, they can also produce results, bolstering technology capabilities with a flood of resources.Top-level statements like this also work as a signal to local governments and companies across the country.The new plan formalizes a focus that was widely known in China. Following those cues, a large number of local governments have created special plans and built out research centers to focus on A.I.Many are spending hundreds of millions of dollars, but some have earmarked even more. In June, the government of Tianjin, an eastern city near Beijing, said it planned to set up a $5 billion fund to support the A.I. industry. It also set up an \u201cintelligence industry zone\u201d that will sit on more than 20 square kilometers of land.The initiative is also likely to sweep up private Chinese companies. The country\u2019s internet search giant Baidu, which has run an A.I. research center out of Silicon Valley in recent years, announced this year that it would open a new lab in cooperation with the government. The two leaders of that lab have worked on Chinese government programs with military applications.Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Yandex, a Russian Ride-Hailing Rival, Opt to Share the Road", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber is famous for its pugnacious approach to business and willingness to fight any and all competition. But in a handful of countries, the ride-hailing company has ended up on a more conciliatory path.The latest example: On Thursday, Uber said it had formed a partnership with Yandex, the Russian search giant and operator of the ride-hailing service Yandex.Taxi. The two companies will combine their ride-hailing businesses in Russia and several other Eastern European countries under a new, yet-to-be-named company.The deal, which must receive regulatory approval, will value the new company at $3.4 billion. It will be jointly operated by Yandex and Uber, with Tigran Khudaverdyan, the chief executive of Yandex.Taxi, as chief executive of the new venture. Uber will invest $225 million, while Yandex will invest $100 million of its own and retain a majority stake in the new company.But the deal reflects the intense competition Uber has sometimes faced in its aggressive overseas expansion.In Russia, the establishment of ride-hailing apps transformed the taxi market, which had been dominated by irregular and unlicensed services. Individuals driving personal vehicles would offer themselves as taxis, and customers would flag them, negotiating prices to be paid in cash.Now, the sector is more formalized, though still not as fully regulated as in Western Europe. Passengers who use services like Uber, Yandex.Taxi and another rival Gett are aware of who their drivers will be and what cars they will be driving. They are also able to pay with credit cards and receive receipts.And because the market had been largely informal, there have been no major protests by incumbents against the ride-hailing services, unlike in cities like London or Paris, where taxi companies and drivers are more heavily regulated.Yandex is an incumbent in a region where the government does not always welcome foreign business. Moreover, the company, often called the \u201cGoogle of Russia,\u201d owns and operates a significant mapping database, an advantage over Uber. And Yandex, a well-established internet brand in Eastern Europe, is able to heavily market its services to potential customers through its online properties \u2014 a luxury Uber does not have.Players on both sides say that rather than spending money fighting for market share, a deal made the most sense.Users will benefit from shorter wait times, the companies said, as well as more reliable service. They will also be able to take advantage of global \u201croaming\u201d; Yandex.Taxi customers may use the app in countries in which Uber operates to call cars, which will be fulfilled by Uber\u2019s drivers. Uber customers, similarly, will be able to do the same in areas in which Yandex.Taxi is the predominant ride-hailing service.The deal has been in the works for months, with executives like Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s former senior vice president of business, and Cameron Poetzscher, the current vice president of corporate development, determining the details.\u201cThis deal is a testament to our exceptional growth in the region and helps Uber continue to build a sustainable global business,\u201d Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, head of Uber in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a news release.As part of the deal, Uber will retain a 36.6 percent stake in the new company, which has the placeholder title \u201cNewCo,\u201d while Yandex will hold a 59.3 percent stake; 4.1 percent will be held by employees of the venture. Combined, it will operate in 127 cities across six countries. Between the two operations, more than 35 million rides were completed in June, responsible for more than $130 million in gross bookings.Reining in spending will probably sit well with investors, who are pushing for an initial public offering, which may soon become a reality. Uber is searching for a chief financial officer and new chief executive, and it is appointing other important executive positions in preparation for an eventual move to the public markets.Yandex and Uber expect their deal to close by the end of the year.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

If the neighborhood is a varied mix of nationalities and backgrounds (one in three was born elsewhere), the staff is even more diverse. The physicians alone represent about 40 countries.And so the pain of the shooting is shared by all whose lives are touched by Bronx-Lebanon daily, in ways large and small, surprising and expected.\u201cWe live in the Bronx. We know our patients, we meet them at the grocery stores, we go to the same places they do,\u201d said Dr. Hafsa Abbas, one of the chief residents. This is just one reason doctors and patients ran toward the gunfire. \u201cThat\u2019s why when we found that there was a shooting, we were all rushing inside, not outside.\u201dNilsa Maria, 45, had all three of her children at Bronx-Lebanon. Now she goes there to be treated for skin cancer and diabetes. \u201cI used to love going there because it was close by, it was in the neighborhood and doctors are good,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m a little scared of going there. Anybody can go in there and hurt anybody.\u201dBut that shudder of fear did not, after a few seconds of thought, deter her from the business at hand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going \u2014 I have appointments.\u201dBronx-Lebanon has never reached the prestigious status of larger, better-funded hospitals, yet it holds a unique position in the area as a place that has welcomed people who have nowhere else to turn, even if the welcome is sometimes accompanied by the brusque words of a harried doctor or nurse or long lines and longer waits. It is not a public hospital, meaning it is not required to take anyone who walks through its doors, but it often does.Fifty-four percent of nearby households have an annual income of less than $25,000. About 70 percent of the patients are on Medicaid. Some have no insurance at all. Between 26 and 36 percent of patients have no regular physician.But those who live nearby go there instinctively.\u201cThe hospital is their entire support system often,\u201d said Dr. Sridhar Chilimuri, the hospital\u2019s physician in chief. \u201cEven things that are wrong in their own families, they look to the hospital to solve them.\u201dThe emergency room sees about 150,000 patients annually and can act as a homeless shelter for a family unsure of how to get social services or as a day-care center for a mother who cannot find a babysitter, Dr. Chilimuri said.Bronx-Lebanon was formed in 1962 through the merger of two hospitals, one of which could date its founding back to 1890, providing care mostly to Jewish immigrants.Demographics in the Bronx have changed, but the community surrounding the hospital remains diverse. New immigrants are mostly from South and Central America, the Caribbean and West Africa. This has produced challenges that hospital staff members have met with creativity.A special clinic of female doctors treats Muslim West African women because their religion prohibits their being seen by male doctors, said Robert Sancho, vice president for development and external affairs, who has worked at the hospital for 35 years.The hospital partnered with Dominican taxi drivers to make them aware of the importance of health care.\u201cI\u2019ve gone to the Dominican Republic to recruit doctors,\u201d Mr. Sancho said. \u201cWe bring in about four Dominican doctors every year.\u201dBronx-Lebanon employs interpreters, but many employees use the hospital\u2019s free online language-learning resources to better communicate with patients. Dr. Abbas, who is from Pakistan, and Dr. Ahmed Baiomi, another chief resident from Egypt, have picked up Spanish.Mr. Sancho said Bronx-Lebanon did not have a large number of American-trained doctors, who \u201ctend to pick out the hospitals that are not in the low-income neighborhoods and are in the major education centers.\u201dInstead, the halls of Bronx-Lebanon are filled with a rainbow of faces in white coats. Some of the doctors and residents trained at the hospital are political exiles whose experiences can make them more compassionate, said Dr. Chilimuri, who is from India. \u201cThey\u2019re extraordinary physicians, because they know what it is to suffer,\u201d he said.Many applicants to the hospital residency program hear about Bronx-Lebanon from other students in their home countries, creating a pipeline of sorts.\u201cMany of them have already finished their course of study in a foreign country, but they are not recognized in the United States and have to start all over again,\u201d Mr. Sancho said.Doctors at the hospital incorporate their experiences with medicine abroad into treating their patients.Dr. Yvonne Cruz was born and raised in the South Bronx but completed medical school in Mexico.\u201cWe have patients who come in, and they have these illnesses they\u2019ve seen in their everyday life that I thought I would never see, that it was only textbook,\u201d Dr. Cruz said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been able to approach it, because our patient population is so diverse, and our residents are so diverse.\u201dThe deadly Friday afternoon also brought out the camaraderie that fast overcomes cultural differences.\u201cWhen we were in the middle of the crisis, one of our doctors from Pakistan brought us Pakistani food,\u201d Dr. Baiomi said. \u201cI really liked it, I never ate it before.\u201dBut he said the Bronx also had to recognize its shortcomings, and the poor health of its residents is one of them. The Bronx is at the bottom among the state\u2019s 62 counties, Mr. Diaz said.The ranking is so dire that Mr. Diaz began a health awareness campaign with a social media component, #Not62. Bronx-Lebanon has been an active participant, hosting workshops that teach residents to make traditional, cultural foods healthier, Mr. Diaz said.Diabetes and asthma are some of the most frequent chronic illnesses that keep Bronx-Lebanon\u2019s emergency room full.Longtime residents and even tourists have found less urgent reasons to go to Bronx-Lebanon.At least once a week, Adel Fernandez, 77, eats at Grand Cafe, the restaurant run by a vendor through a lease with the hospital. Partial to the strawberry cheesecake, he can see his apartment from the mustard-colored booths.The restaurant used to be run by two men named Jose and Juan and was called J & J, said Mr. Fernandez, who immigrated to the Bronx 42 years ago and lived in Spain for three years. \u201cOne was from Cuba, like me, and one was from Spain,\u201d he said.Mr. Fernandez said he began attending Mass in the hospital\u2019s chapel about two years ago. \u201cAnybody in the neighborhood can go,\u201d he said, explaining that there are about a dozen regular parishioners.The chapel popped up on Google maps when Luz Marte, 52, and her husband, Adriano Taveras Capellan, 65, tourists from the Dominican Republic, were looking for a church to attend on Sunday. \u201cAnd then afterward, we needed coffee, too,\u201d she said as she and Mr. Taveras inspected the cafe\u2019s menu.The gift shop, where many customers bypass stuffed animals and flower arrangements and make a beeline for lottery tickets, was also up and running as usual on Sunday.People streamed in from the street to the lobby to use the public ATM.Sheri Fink and Khorri Atkinson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When You Should (and Shouldn\u2019t) Share Your Location Using a Smartphone", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last week after my motorcycle malfunctioned and crashed on the freeway, I wanted only two simple things from technology: to call 911 and to tell loved ones where I could be found.Coincidentally, I had been testing location-sharing tools from Apple, Google, Facebook and Snapchat. So before calling the police, I texted my partner, who was already tracking my location with several apps, letting her know I was hurt. When she opened Google Maps, she could see precisely where I was on the 101 South freeway.But when she refreshed the map to follow the ambulance, she ran into the app\u2019s shortcomings: Google showed I was at Costco (not where I wanted to be, injured or not) when I was actually strapped onto a stretcher heading toward San Francisco General Hospital.Such is the state of location sharing on smartphones.Yet security experts agree that on smartphones, it is now practically impossible to stop location tracking. There is a multitude of ways for third parties to find out where we are, including cell towers, the metadata transmitted from telecommunications, and data logged on our phones.So we might as well embrace location sharing and reap the benefits.\u201cFor the vast majority of people and the vast majority of circumstances, the benefits they get from sharing their whereabouts way exceed the risks that might be out there,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company.Here are some tips for the best- and worst-use cases for sharing your location using a range of old and brand-new location-sharing tools.First, a primer on how different location-sharing products work.Be aware that even if you haven\u2019t turned on location sharing in Snapchat, some people may be able to get a hint of your whereabouts if you use Our Stories, a feature for publishing public images or videos.In my tests, Apple\u2019s Find My Friends and Facebook Messenger were quicker and more accurate with real-time location tracking than Google Maps, which had significant delays before refreshing with a current location. Google said its app reports someone\u2019s location at intervals, from every few minutes to an hour, partly to save battery life.Location-tracking features have stirred controversy for the last decade. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit, said location-tracking technologies enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor people\u2019s movements or advertisers to connect people\u2019s online activities with their real identities.In other words, used carelessly, location tracking may hurt your privacy. But used thoughtfully, it can be a powerful and efficient communication tool.After testing location-sharing tools for two weeks, here are my suggestions for the best times to use them.\u2022 When you make plans to meet friends somewhere like a movie theater, get in the habit of sharing your location through Apple\u2019s iMessage, Google Maps or Facebook Messenger to broadcast your location for a short duration, like an hour. This way you can skip saying things like \u201cI\u2019m on my way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m running a few minutes behind\u201d because people can simply follow you on the map.\u2022 Consider using Apple\u2019s Find My Friends, Facebook Messenger or Google Maps to share your location occasionally with your romantic partner. Location sharing can be useful for being considerate of your partner\u2019s time and space. For example, I am less inclined to text my partner when I see she is at the office or driving on a freeway, but I am more inclined to text when I see she is at the grocery store to ask her to pick something up.\u2022 Next time you plan an event at a large outdoor space, like a picnic in a park, do your friends a favor: Use Apple Maps or Facebook Messenger to drop a pin on a map with your current location so they can find you. Wandering around aimlessly in a crowded open space can be annoying.Here were some situations where broadcasting your location may be undesirable.\u2022 Don\u2019t share your location when meeting in an indoor space like a specific store in a mall. Most mapping apps are not yet designed for indoor spaces and are thus inaccurate for location sharing.\u2022 Likewise, don\u2019t bother sharing your location on a nature hike. Most national parks, for example, are in remote areas with no cell connection, so turning on location sharing in this situation would waste battery life.\u2022 For safety reasons, avoid sharing your location publicly. Google makes it easy to publish a web link where anyone can follow your live location. To fend off the creepers, send the link only to the intended recipients; avoid posting it on public sites like Twitter or Facebook.\u2022 The bottom line: Know your limits. \u201cUse common sense,\u201d Mr. Grossman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to hide from people, don\u2019t publish your whereabouts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They lost their new C.E.O. for untold reasons. Five months in, and he\u2019s a goner. Ouch!Speaking of which, I decided to bite the bullet and try one of these meal kits. I signed up for Blue Apron, so we\u2019ll see if I can make it through a cooking session without setting my house on fire. I also tried cooking a week\u2019s worth of dinners from Green Chef, which were really tasty. Everyone keeps telling me Sun Basket is good, too.Really what I\u2019ve learned is that dinners are essentially becoming Lego blocks for adults. I\u2019m not sure if I like it.I can\u2019t see any reason I\u2019d want to use this. Seems like it would make much more sense for Amazon to buy Pinterest, which already skews heavily toward shopping and list-making. But perhaps I\u2019m wrong. (Also, Amazon just spent a bunch of money on Whole Foods, so they might not want to whip out the checkbook again so soon.)Meanwhile, over in Twitter-land, the company said that early results on its abuse reduction tactics showed they were actually working. As a result of using technology and artificial intelligence better, abuse and harassment seem to be slowly decreasing on the site, according to some slightly opaque statistics they\u2019ve shared.And yet, you still have an account and are allowed to tweet at me. Big oversight, methinks.I\u2019m curious to hear your take on this, but my inclination is to believe it\u2019s a smart enough play by Lyft. If you believe that autonomous vehicles are the future \u2014 and literally almost every major company in transportation believes this is the case \u2014 then you need to position your business for a day in which there are more robot drivers than human ones. That could benefit Lyft, as they could take a larger cut of revenue from each ride they complete. (Admittedly, there are many other costs associated with driverless tech, to be clear.)However, Lyft just isn\u2019t as well funded as Uber, the $70 billion behemoth that is developing its own self-driving tech in house. So I can see a kind of platform play and striking deals with partners as a decent compromise.What do you think? I have a feeling you disagree with me.In other words, self-driving looks as if it\u2019s shaping up like the cloud business. There\u2019ll be two or three big providers that will sell tech to lots of different transportation companies. And those transportation companies \u2014 whether they\u2019re carmakers or shared-ride providers like Lyft or some other type of business \u2014 will build many different kinds of businesses using that licensed technology, just like Netflix stores its videos on Amazon\u2019s cloud.So it\u2019s weird to me to see all these transportation companies spending so much to create their own tech. It would be as if American Airlines decided to build autopilot for its planes rather than let Boeing and Airbus do it. Or if Netflix started its own cloud service to host its videos. It\u2019s odd.But I\u2019m just a tech columnist with a lot of time on my hands. See you next week!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Save on Your Trip to a Theme Park", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerTheme parks can be great fun for all, but tickets, parking, food and incidentals can rapidly mount up to burn a hole in your pocket. Here is a list of tips to help you save a few bucks on that summer theme-park excursion, be it one of the popular Disney parks or your local favorite.A one-day Park Hopper ticket to Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom can cost $174. If you buy a 10-day ticket, however, the per-day cost drops to about $51. Keep in mind that for these multiday tickets, there is a limited amount of time to use them. In this case, you must use all 10 days within a 14-day period.You can buy theme-park tickets at the gate, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should. Parks always want to know when you\u2019re coming (it helps them determine their discount and blackout days, for example), and they love to have your money upfront. In return, many parks (with the notable exception of Disney) offer significant discounts for buying online.Conventional wisdom says that a good way to save money on the egregious pricing of food items is to bring your own; many parks will allow visitors to bring snacks, within reason. (Nearly all parks will allow reusable nonglass water bottles that can be refilled throughout the day, a much better choice than spending $2 to $5 on bottled water.)But toting your own food doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone. \u201cThat\u2019s not really something I want to do when I\u2019m on vacation,\u201d Ms. Marino says. Instead, she suggests skipping the side dish when ordering at restaurants as a way to cut costs. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018I want the chicken sandwich, but no fries,\u2019\u201d she says, which saves a dollar or two per meal.Many parks have water rides, and water is not your smartphone\u2019s friend. It sounds simplistic, but you\u2019ll be kicking yourself after drenching your $800 iPhone. Bring a sealable plastic bag to protect your phone during water rides. It costs virtually nothing, and can potentially save you a major headache.We\u2019ve all forgotten where we put the car. Don\u2019t let it happen in an enormous parking lot when you\u2019ve got tired children in tow. To save some frustration, take a photo of where you parked (\u201cO.K., kids, remember: We\u2019re in Foghorn Leghorn!\u201d). Better yet, open Google Maps on your phone and drop a pin at your car\u2019s location. You can then add a label or star to the location, making it a cinch to find at the end of the day.Advertisement"}

But the Lichtentaler Allee, the lovely, tree-lined promenade that adjoins it, is a perfect way to acclimate yourself to the town. Start at the G\u00f6nneranlage rose garden, a jewel box of a park that features more than 400 varieties that bloom from May to October. Then exit on the avenue, turn right and keep going until you hit the imposing Festspielhaus, or concert hall, a little more than a mile away. The entire stretch can probably be done in a brisk 20-minute walk. But this is Baden-Baden. No one does anything briskly.In the Middle Ages, the Marktplatz, or marketplace, was the vibrant center of daily life in Baden-Baden. Now, it is mostly a quiet area of cobblestone streets, a few cafes, a historic church (the Stiftskirche, whose original structure on this site is said to date back to about 1200) and a lushly landscaped, terraced garden that, from its upper levels, offers sweeping views of the city below. After a calorie-burning stroll, indulge in a bit of afternoon tea. Perhaps the most popular spot in Baden-Baden is the Caf\u00e9 K\u00f6nig, serving finger sandwiches, cakes and cream-filled pastries.

{"Headline": "Hear This Out: Cherish Silence From Coaches in the Stands", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TennisWIMBLEDON, England \u2014 With coaching during matches creeping toward the norm, it is time for tennis to decide what it truly wants to be.Is it going to remain by definition an individual sport where players, despite all the resources and gurus they might have at their disposal off the court, are required by rule to handle the decision-making in the heat of the moment all on their lonesome?Or will the on-court action become a group effort in which players are connected to their brain trusts like the rest of us are connected to Google?I still much prefer option No. 1, even if I am increasingly swimming against the tide.\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about at quite a few council meetings now, and I\u2019d say the general consensus, and definitely from my side, is I\u2019m definitely for coaching,\u201d Kevin Anderson, an ATP council member and the No. 42-ranked player in the world, told me Friday night after advancing to the fourth round at Wimbledon.The WTA is looking seriously at restructuring its tour to oblige its leading players to play the same tournaments much more often. Roger Federer and his agent, Tony Godsick, have already started a new Ryder Cup-style team event called the Laver Cup that will pit Europe against the rest of the world, set to be staged in Prague in September.The United States Open will also test a countdown clock between points at this year\u2019s qualifying tournament. Other proposals to speed up play include implementing shorter sets and no-ad scoring in singles, which would both be major changes.But nothing seems likely to alter the essence of the sport and how it is perceived more than constant coaching.\u201cObviously, we\u2019ll be very interested to see what happens from the U.S. Open,\u201d Anderson said.Hearing a coach shout out recommendations or, worse yet, orders between points and then seeing the players execute them (or not) does not have quite the same ring to it, although it understandably appeals to plenty of coaches, many of whom are taking on more public roles in the sport.This is linked in part to the superstars who have recently joined the coaching ranks: everyone from Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl to Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker and now Andre Agassi, who is working here at Wimbledon with Novak Djokovic.Their visibility is good for business and for generating interest. The camera shots of the points being played sometimes seem secondary to the images of the familiar faces in the players\u2019 box.\u201cAs a player, I never liked the idea; as a coach, I am more open to it,\u201d said Thomas Johansson, a former Australian Open champion who has since coached on the ATP and WTA tours. \u201cAnd to be honest, if you look at all the coaches sitting courtside, you can easily see that coaching is happening already, even though it\u2019s not allowed.\u201dThat is one of the chief arguments in favor of flinging open the doors to two-way communication: that nobody is enforcing the current rule effectively, so it is fairer to just end the hypocrisy. But the fact \u2014 to cite just one example \u2014 that plenty of people drive faster than the speed limit does not automatically mean that society should allow any velocity on public roads.\u201cI think you are probably better off having the umpires and linesmen step up to the plate instead of allowing coaching,\u201d said Alicia Molik, the captain of the Australian Fed Cup team. \u201cThey are saying the coaching happens anyway, but it doesn\u2019t have to happen away. Policing needs to be better.\u201dIt might even give the linesmen a job to do once electronic line judging comes to every court and makes them obsolete.There is a distinction, too, between coaches instructing on the sly, as they do today with hand signals or coded phrasing, and opening the airwaves to all frequencies.There is already far too much chatter in tennis; television commentators even talk during the rallies now. The period between points, with a player preparing to serve, was one of the last zones of silence.\u201cAs long as you\u2019re playing within time limits, it will be pretty open communication,\u201d Anderson said of the U.S. Open plan. \u201cSo, I mean, it will be a pretty big change.\u201dA change that could make it tough to keep up for players on the fringes who cannot pay for quality full-time coaching.There is also, of course, the argument that so many other major global sports allow coaching during play, from N.B.A. coaches and English Premier League managers shouting instructions from the sidelines to caddies making club suggestions to golfers.Why should tennis remain an outlier?My response is that whatever distinguishes you from all the other entertainment options in this Darwinian sports era is more likely worth celebrating than discarding.\u201cTo me, the whole point of being a good coach is that the players can be tactically aware and make their own calls under pressure,\u201d Molik said. \u201cThat\u2019s my view. On-court coaching helps players, but I prefer without. Without. Without. Without.\u201dI agree. Agree. Agree. Agree.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft to Develop Self-Driving Car Technology in New Silicon Valley Facility", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Controlling the future of the smartphone was the defining technology battle of the last decade. Now, technology companies are betting that the next 10 years and beyond will be spent battling for control of the self-driving automobile.On Friday, Lyft, the ride-hailing company, announced that it was developing its own self-driving technology, marking yet another company\u2019s gamble that the future of transportation will be marked by self-driving cars.Lyft is marking the occasion with the opening of a new self-driving-research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to heavily recruit new engineering and technical people for the facility after it opens in the coming weeks.\u201cWe aren\u2019t thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. It\u2019s core to our business,\u201d said Luc Vincent, vice president of autonomous technology at Lyft. \u201cThat\u2019s why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to grow that team in the months ahead.\u201dUber, Lyft\u2019s much larger rival, has spent millions opening facilities in Pittsburgh, Toronto and San Francisco dedicated entirely to autonomous-vehicle research, while building its own hardware and software systems to operate the vehicles. And many other companies, from Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit in Silicon Valley to major auto manufacturers in Detroit and Europe, are also working on autonomous-driving technology.\u201cWe want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think there\u2019s a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it,\u201d said Raj Kapoor, Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer, in a press event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters.Perhaps the best way to understand the initiative is through the lens of the smartphone.Uber\u2019s approach is closer to that of Apple: Both companies want to control most of the product, whether the software or the hardware.Lyft, in contrast, is acting a bit more like Google in its development of the Android operating system. Both companies are creating software that many different hardware manufacturers can use, while developing the technology collaboratively with hardware partners. In Lyft\u2019s ideal world, that could mean a quicker spread of Lyft\u2019s technology among automakers.Automakers are scrambling to develop their own self-driving technology as they imagine how they might operate in a future in which fewer people own cars. Collaborating with Lyft could help bring that technology to market faster, while automakers could provide Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing network with more cars to serve riders.There are potential drawbacks. Partners could decide to leave the Open Platform Initiative and develop their own software. Or companies could be wary of teaming up with Lyft because it is developing its own self-driving system.Lyft executives believe that the self-driving-car race is in its early days, and that companies that may consider one another rivals still have much to gain from collaborating and learning while building the automobile fleets of the future.\u201cLyft is not getting into the business of manufacturing a car,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to creating a self-driving system. Then the auto industry can bring it to life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fix India\u2019s Sex-Selection Problem", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorStarting in the 1980s, the desire of some parents to have a son and at the same time have fewer children than past generations met with the widespread availability of ultrasound machines. Sonograms were used to detect the future sex of fetuses, and many women aborted fetuses that were predicted to be female.Despite the increasing role of women in the work force, the old idea that a son will be the breadwinner and will support parents in old age remains powerful. Although it is illegal, many parents are still forced to pay a dowry to marry their daughters. And Hindu tradition requires a son to perform certain funeral rituals for his parents.Despite a law adopted in 1994 that prohibits medical professionals from revealing the future sex of a fetus to a pregnant woman, people can readily obtain this information from illegal operators of ultrasound machines. The effectiveness of enforcement efforts against illegal sex-selection tests varies across the states.Abortion is legal in India and fairly easy to get for those who can afford it. Since ultrasound is the most common method of detecting the sex of a fetus, most abortions are surgical procedures as the pregnancy is too advanced to terminate using pills.Although there is a statistically significant correlation between the male surplus and increase in rape of women and girls, the early marriage of girls and violence by husbands against wives, there is no certainty about its cause, as other reasons for increased violence against women cannot be ruled out.Popular perceptions that attribute the causes of sex selection to general \u201cson preference\u201d and \u201cdaughter aversion\u201d are not entirely accurate. Prabhat Jha, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, and his co-authors found that Indian parents who intervene typically do so at their second and third births after they have had one or two girls. After parents have one male child, they again leave to chance the sex of their next child. This suggests that most couples who are sex selecting want at least one boy and are willing to have girls.Some parents may desire to have female children but do not act on that preference. The Indian government could allow those parents to conceive a girl. One way to do this is by sperm sorting, a process whereby X chromosome-bearing and Y chromosome-bearing sperm are sorted.Thereafter, only the sperm that will form an embryo of the desired sex are artificially inseminated into the uterus. But Indian law currently prohibits sex selection using sperm sorting and in vitro fertilization even for parents who want to conceive a girl. The law should be amended to allow for pre-implantation sex selection in favor of girls.Some authorities and N.G.O.s monitor the movement of pregnant women who have female children to ensure that they do not obtain abortions. In other cases, without any concrete evidence, some families are publicly shamed by what are known as \u201cmourning ceremonies\u201d if women in their family are suspected of having an abortion. It is poor women who are the targets of those problematic policies.Some local governments give cash payments to women when they give birth to daughters. This strategy is aimed at discouraging women from aborting female fetuses. The Indian government should go even further and encourage people to conceive girls. Certainly any cash payment scheme would change the behavior of only poor people.But if sperm sorting, which is 93 percent effective in conceiving girls, were made available to any woman who wanted to select in favor of a girl, we might see both poor and middle-class people conceiving girls, in that way helping to equalize the male surplus. The challenge will be to properly enforce it. While sex selection can also be accomplished through in vitro fertilization, it is a much more expensive and invasive method than sperm sorting.Most countries, including India, have a long way to go before women achieve equality. The United Nations Development Program ranked India 125 out of 159 countries in terms of gender equality. Prevailing television and radio campaigns aimed at changing sexist attitudes toward women and girls will work to improve gender equality only over the long term.The Indian government, activists and N.G.O.s must find solutions that will more swiftly improve the gender imbalance in births.Sital Kalantry, a professor at Cornell Law School, is the author of \u201cWomen\u2019s Human Rights and Migration: Sex-Selective Abortion Laws in the United States and India.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abuses Hide in the Silence of Nondisparagement Agreements", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "Often used at tech companies, nondisparagement agreements are increasingly included in employment contracts and legal settlements.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last October, AngelList, a company that helps tech start-ups raise money and hire employees, held an office retreat. In the Hollywood Hills, far from Silicon Valley, the firm\u2019s mostly male staff mingled poolside with bikini-clad women who had been invited to the event.Before the afternoon was over, Babak Nivi, a founder and board member at AngelList, said things that made Julie Ruvolo, a contractor, uncomfortable about working at the company. His comments included a suggestion that the women, who were not employees, warm up the pool by jumping in and rubbing their bodies together. The incident was described by two entrepreneurs who were told about it in the weeks after it occurred but were not authorized to speak about it.Precisely what occurred at the Hollywood Hills event is not publicly known. Several weeks after the party, each side signed a nondisparagement clause as part of a settlement, the two people said, and its details are not public. And neither Ms. Ruvolo nor AngelList is permitted to talk about what happened that day.Nondisparagement clauses are not limited to legal settlements. They are increasingly found in standard employment contracts in many industries, sometimes in a simple offer letter that helps to create a blanket of silence around a company. Their use has become particularly widespread in tech employment contracts, from venture investment firms and start-ups to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, including Google.Google declined to comment on its use of nondisparagement agreements.Employees increasingly \u201chave to give up their constitutional right to speak freely about their experiences if they want to be part of the work force,\u201d said Nancy E. Smith, a partner at the law firm Smith Mullin. \u201cThe silence sends a message: Men\u2019s jobs are more important than women\u2019s lives.\u201dAt Binary Capital, a venture capital firm in San Francisco that collapsed last month under the weight of multiple allegations of sexual harassment, new hires signed an employment contract that included the clause that \u201cemployee shall not disparage the company,\u201d according to a contract quoted in a lawsuit filed against the firm last month.Ann Lai, a former employee, said in her lawsuit filed in San Mateo Superior Court in California that she had complained to her bosses about sexism, discrimination and inappropriate behavior in the workplace, and that Binary used the nondisparagement provision in her employment contract to threaten her and prevent her from talking about why she had quit her job.Ms. Lai, a former employee of Binary, contends that after she complained to her bosses about sexism and inappropriate behavior in the workplace, the company used the non-disparagement provision in her employment contract to threaten her and prevent her from talking about why she had quit her job.The nondisparagement clause made it \u201chard for employees to \u2018speak up\u2019 about inappropriate or illegal conduct,\u201d the suit said, adding, \u201cEmployees are instead led to believe that it is illegal to do so, and that disclosing information about their working conditions will lead to ruinous litigation.\u201dWhen Mr. Caldbeck worked at Lightspeed Venture Partners, he attended board meetings at the e-commerce company Stitch Fix, on behalf of the firm. After Lightspeed was informed that Mr. Caldbeck had made Katrina Lake, the Stitch Fix chief executive, uncomfortable, Mr. Caldbeck was removed from his role on the board, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Spokeswomen for Ms. Lake and Lightspeed declined to comment.Mr. Caldbeck left Lightspeed the next year, but the reason he was removed from Ms. Lake\u2019s board was not made public.At Binary, in text messages reviewed by The New York Times, he requested evening meetings with an entrepreneur named Lindsay Meyer, asked if she was attracted to him, and if she would accompany him on overnight trips. He also questioned why she would rather be with her boyfriend than with him.Mr. Caldbeck would not comment about the incidents at the two firms.In its buyout agreements, The Times asks employees to agree to a limited nondisparagement clause that specifies the agreement does not prohibit people from providing information about legal violations or discrimination to the government or regulators. The terms of other nondisparagement agreements vary.In addition to Ms. Ruvolo, three other women who work in the technology industry told The Times that they had been harassed in the workplace and signed nondisparagement agreements to settle those disputes. The women would not say more because they are not allowed to acknowledge that the agreements even exist.Mr. Nivi continued to serve on the company\u2019s board. The nondisparagement clause prevented potential employees and partners from knowing such allegations had been made.Mr. Nivi said by email, \u201cthese statements about me are not true.\u201dMs. Ruvolo says she wants to talk about her situation, but cannot. \u201cI asked AngelList to release me from the agreement, but they have declined,\u201d Ms. Ruvolo said. The company did not acknowledge a nondisparagement deal exists, and its terms would probably have prevented it from doing so.\u201cI wonder how I may have disserviced other women working in tech, including my female colleagues, with my silence,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to rethink what it means to ask for or grant silence as resolution.\u201dAngelList said Mr. Nivi has no role at the company and is no longer a board member, but would not say when or why he left the board.\u201cWhen we conduct investigations, individuals are removed from the workplace, given counseling if needed, and can\u2019t contact complainants,\u201d Graham Jenkin, AngelList\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. \u201cAny implication that we would silence anyone or not pursue an issue is mistaken.\u201dMr. Jenkin would not say whether AngelList had a nondisparagement agreement with Ms. Ruvolo or whether Mr. Nivi had harassed her. He disputed some of the details of the poolside incident described to The Times, but would not provide clarification.Ms. Ruvolo, who was a freelance writer for AngelList and whose contract was not renewed this year, said she could not comment on the event that led to her agreement or on the terms of the deal.\u201cCompanies wave the agreements around and use them to force a settlement and make the problem go away,\u201d said Karen Kessler, chief executive of the public relations firm Evergreen Partners. \u201cAfter that, nobody is the wiser for it.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The South Park Commons Fills a Hole in the Tech Landscape", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ruchi Sanghvi was the first female engineer at Facebook, where she helped create the news feed that now serves as the primary window into the world\u2019s largest social network. Then she built a start-up of her own and sold it to another rising Silicon Valley company, Dropbox, becoming one of its first female executives. But as she left Dropbox in 2014, she didn\u2019t know what she would do next.At 32, she wanted a better way of deciding where her career would go. She wanted an environment where she could freely explore new ideas among her peers without feeling the pressure to start another project immediately.As the months passed, she never quite found that kind of personal think tank, but she came to realize that many old friends and colleagues felt much the same way. Her next project became an effort to help people find their next project.The result is South Park Commons. Housed in an old townhouse on the oval park at the heart of the San Francisco tech scene, the Commons is a selected community of entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers and others. Ms. Sanghvi describes it as tech\u2019s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Junto club, a means of shaping new ideas through conversation and shared experience.It\u2019s also a way of preparing for the future.\u201cYou get a couple of shots in life to do something meaningful and impactful. Why not take the time to identify that?\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said during a recent conversation inside the Commons, a high-ceilinged space decorated by local artists. \u201cIt is very easy to fall into the traps of Silicon Valley \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s start a company,\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s invest\u2019 \u2014 without giving it a second thought.\u201dThe Commons is a bit like the hacker spaces that have long thrived in the Valley \u2014 places where coders and makers gather to build new software and hardware \u2014 but it moves beyond that familiar concept. Its founder, for one thing, is a female engineer turned entrepreneur turned executive.Today\u2019s tech industry also provides an extra degree of economic freedom, said Ms. Sanghvi, whose husband, Aditya Agarwal, also has a long history in Silicon Valley and is now the chief technology officer at Dropbox.Many tech workers were stuck with their companies for years, waiting for an initial public offering. Now they can easily sell their shares on private markets, and that means they have more opportunity to explore new ventures. At the same time, the path to the next venture is less obvious, as companies shift toward very different types of technology, most notably artificial intelligence, or A.I., which is rapidly changing the way the world builds software.The rub is that the talent needed to build and deploy these techniques is scarce, so much so that the likes of Google and Facebook are running classes to educate their employees in this new way of doing things. The Commons provides both a physical and a social environment where others can learn in similar ways.Ms. Sanghvi recruits people to the Commons solely by word of mouth, and they join merely by showing up and contributing a few hundred dollars in dues, to pay for items like coffee, snacks and paper towels and to fund regular events at the townhouse.When Cinjon Resnick arrived at the Commons last year after moving to San Francisco from New York, it was already cultivating an interest in neural networks and other A.I. techniques. He was among those who spent several months exploring the field, reading and discussing the latest research papers, and organizing lectures and workshops at the Commons.Many groups strive for this dynamic of exploration and dialogue, but for Mr. Resnick, the Commons succeeded. \u201cIt\u2019s a loosely structured place where people can come and form ideas,\u201d he said during a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all wanted.\u201dBut this arrangement has other byproducts. Ms. Qiu is one of three female founders who have emerged from the Commons. Though Ms. Sanghvi said the organization still needed more women, her presence and the group dynamic are at least a step toward that future.\u201cThis is collaborative learning,\u201d said Nilanjana Dasgupta, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studies how social environments affect career paths, particularly in science and technology. \u201cThat can feel more satisfying for women in a culture like Silicon Valley.\u201dMr. Resnick and other alumni of the Commons say this vibe exists because Ms. Sanghvi takes such a strong hand in guiding her creation. With a style both endearing and remarkably direct, she runs the community the way a good parent raises a child.She pays for the townhouse, giving the group a place to meet and work each day, and she lays down the rules. She demands regular lunches, dinners and other events, like the early lecture on A.I. from a Silicon Valley veteran, Keith Adams, who is the chief architect of Slack, or a recent presentation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable organization started by Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.\u201cEvents give you an excuse to talk to each other,\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said. \u201cThey make you feel like you\u2019re working on something together.\u201dBut she also sets limits. Anyone who builds a company that grows to more than five people graduates. She does not want the Commons to become just another accelerator.The trick lies in keeping the current vibe going and, better yet, mimicking its approach across the Valley. For the Commons, that means more independence from Ms. Sanghvi, a way for the group to attract members and raise funds on its own.Ms. Sanghvi said she might find a way to get the Commons a tiny percentage of any start-up that emerged from the townhouse or she might seek sponsorship from big businesses or nonprofits.That may or may not change the Commons. But Ms. Sanghvi is intent on ensuring that the vibe remains. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be something that lasts for three years and disappears,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Starting Over, With the Help of Tattoo Removal", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.For a former gang member, old tattoos can send a message to mainstream society: I am not one of you.They\u2019re an obstacle to employment, but also to new lives with family and community members who may be put off by the sinister-looking imagery.The charity was started in the late 1980s by the Rev. Greg Boyle, a Jesuit priest who became dismayed by the all too frequent deaths of young people caught up in gang violence in his Boyle Heights parish.Early on, a doctor with a laser machine offered to donate an hour of time here and there for tattoo removal. As word spread, a huge demand was uncovered.\u201cPretty soon I had a waiting list of 3,000 gang members,\u201d Father Boyle said.Today, Homeboy Industries operates a clinic open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, with three laser machines and more than 40 volunteer doctors.Father Boyle said the services were part of a holistic approach to gang intervention that included mental health counseling, addiction treatment and job training. The goal, he said, is to heal former gang members.\u201cAn employed gang member may or may not go back to prison, and an educated one may or may not go back to prison,\u201d Father Boyle said. \u201cBut a healed gang member won\u2019t ever reoffend \u2014 ever.\u201dLast week, Alex Carpio, a former member of the Varrio Las Lomas gang in the San Gabriel Valley, came in for his 45th laser treatment to get a tattoo across his abdomen removed.Mr. Carpio, 42, said he started gang banging at 13. He was in and out of juvenile halls and jails. He was shot multiple times, leaving him blind, and beaten so badly that he walks with a lean. After 20 years, he\u2019d had enough.\u201cI lived in a lie,\u201d Mr. Carpio said. \u201cI wanted to kill my worst enemies. But of course I was my worst enemy myself.\u201dLaser tattoo removal is said to feel like a hot rubber band snapping on the skin. Even for a former gangster, the treatments are not to be taken lightly.\u201cPshh, it is beyond painful,\u201d Mr. Carpio said with a laugh. \u201cYeah and I mean I\u2019ve been through so much pain.\u201dJim Wilson, a New York Times photographer, visited Homeboy Industries last week. Some of his images:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It was on this day in 1853 that Joaquin Murrieta, the Robin Hood of El Dorado, met his gruesome end.That\u2019s at least according to the legend.Much is disputed about the life of Mr. Murrieta, a Mexican gold miner who has been portrayed as both a freedom fighter and a bloodthirsty bandit.A few facts seem certain, according to Susan Lee Johnson, a historian of the American West. Among them are that Mr. Murrieta existed, that he traveled from Mexico to seek his fortune in California, and that he was hunted for crimes he may or may not have committed.Less clear is what drove him into a life on the run. According to the stories, Mr. Murrieta\u2019s success as a gold prospector attracted the jealousy of white miners who beat him and raped his wife, Rosita.Consumed with revenge, he formed a gang that robbed banks and killed dozens of men, including those behind the attack.On July 25, 1853, Mr. Murrieta was finally cornered by a posse of California Rangers and killed. His severed head, it was claimed, was placed in a jar and displayed for paying spectators.Richard Griswold del Castillo, an emeritus professor of Chicano studies at San Diego State University, said Mr. Murrieta came to represent a yearning for justice at a time of rampant racism and lynchings of Mexicans.\u201cI think the larger significance of him is as a proto-revolutionary,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have an ideology but he was fighting for the rights of the people against the injustices that a lot of people were feeling.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "In Cornwall, a Famed Horse, a Church and a Sheikh", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGodolphin Cross journalGODOLPHIN CROSS, England \u2014 The town\u2019s Anglican church had closed, as had the local shop, post office and village pub, so it was always going to take something special to save the Methodist chapel in Godolphin Cross, the village\u2019s last meeting place.But when told of a historical link to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai, one of the world\u2019s richest men, Richard McKie, chairman of the Godolphin Cross Community Association, dismissed the idea of seeking a donation as too far-fetched.Then, in an idle moment, he changed his mind.\u201cPart of me thought, \u2018No, this doesn\u2019t happen,\u2019\u201d said Mr. McKie, reflecting on what turned into a highly lucrative few minutes online. \u201cBut a couple of days later I had a spare half-hour, I googled the Maktoum royal family website, found a drop-down box and I just put down 100 words along the lines of: \u2018Can you help us? We have links that go back.\u2019\u201dSeveral months later, villagers in this corner of scenic, rural, ivy-clad Cornwall are celebrating a donation of at least 50,000 pounds, about $64,000, from one of the Maktoum charities, a gift that is expected to secure the building (which is no longer used for worship) as a village hall.There are plans for a small display to honor the sheikh, excited talk of his visiting this outpost in southwestern England and even discussion of how the Cornish pasty \u2014 a local specialty made of meat and vegetables in baked pastry \u2014 might be adapted to suit a royal and Middle Eastern palate.Such a visit is unlikely, but, then again, so was the donation.It was not much to go on, but the first positive sign was a call from Dubai requesting more information about Godolphin Cross. Then, some weeks later, the association\u2019s treasurer called Mr. McKie saying he had news, but asking him to sit down before he relayed it.\u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018Are we being hoaxed?\u2019\u201d Mr. McKie said.\u201cEven when the money was in the bank we were saying, \u2018Check again, check again,\u2019\u201d said Mr. McKie, speaking in the chapel where urgent work includes removing a number of bats, and longer-term modernization could cost an eyewatering \u00a3350,000, or $450,000.Mr. McKie describes the gift as \u201cwonderful,\u201d and for this 700-strong community it is a rare success after a run of losing battles to keep open the traditional social props of village life.Built in 1934, the chapel has rows of shiny wooden pews, Art Deco stained-glass windows and a large organ. A schoolroom at the rear, dating from 1844, has become the meeting point for several local groups, and the building also hosts a post office that appears for regular visits.Before the sheikh\u2019s intervention, the chapel was slated to go on the market with a price tag of around \u00a3100,000, or $130,000 \u2014 four times what the association had raised to save it \u2014 and was likely to be converted into a home. As a charitable organization, the Methodist Church was obliged to try to get a reasonable value for the property, Mr. McKie said.\u201cWhat we were facing was a ticking clock,\u201d he added. \u201cAs soon as it went on the open market we were going to be blown away. We were staring failure in the face.\u201dFittingly, salvation came with the help of someone who had attended the chapel for decades before services stopped last year because the aging congregation was dwindling.Valerie Wallace has lived in Godolphin Cross for more than three decades but, at 82, was retiring from her role as the village\u2019s correspondent for the local newspaper. While clearing out her files she discovered an article describing an earlier, unsuccessful attempt by a local architect, Steve Kaack, to appeal to the sheikh for a donation to save the village\u2019s Anglican church. Mr. Kaack, who had been a business visitor to Dubai, has since left the village.\u201cI thought: \u2018Good heavens! We could have another go,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Wallace said, displaying the original article from The Racing Post, published 17 years ago. She passed it on to Mr. McKie, prompting his approach to the sheikh.However, Ms. Clegg says that the Godolphin Arabian would not have been seen on the Cornish estate, which was hundreds of miles from its normal stables, and where racing never took place. Indeed, although the horse\u2019s owner, Francis Godolphin, visited at least once, as a 12-year-old, there is little evidence that he spent much time in Cornwall, preferring life in London.Speaking at her home, not far from the chapel, Mrs. Wallace said she had offered the occasional quiet prayer for the chapel to be saved, but hardly expected it to happen this way.The donation was, she said, \u201cwonderful,\u201d before adding that she was very happy to have played a role in bringing it about.\u201cI am,\u201d she added with a chuckle, \u201cvery proud of myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Ms. Dongre\u2019s sister and brother are also employees of the company.) \u201cPeople care about what the clothes stand for,\u201d Mr. Dongre said.\u201cWe grew up in this environment having handicrafts available,\u201d Mr. Dongre said of customers in India, \u201cso we take them for granted. People are more price conscious. They don\u2019t care about the stories. In the U.S., we can price it at a premium, and that won\u2019t make it inaccessible.\u201dMs. Dongre, 53, a fast talker and vegetarian who keeps to a strict 9 p.m. bedtime no matter where she is, began designing for herself when she was 15. Though born and raised in Mumbai, she spent her summers in Jaipur, India, and would work with local artisans to customize outfits, bangles and mojari (a type of shoe).\u201cI came from a traditional family where good little girls didn\u2019t work,\u201d Ms. Dongre said. \u201cThey studied and got married. When I chose my career path, it was actually quite shocking to my parents. The only reason they allowed me to learn stitching and embroidery was, they said, \u2018Oh, that will be a good attribute when we go to the arranged marriage.\u2019\u201dShe studied design at SNDT Women\u2019s University in Mumbai, despite her family\u2019s reservations, and began working immediately after graduation. In 1995, she started her company with the help of her sister, Meena Sehra. From the early years, Ms. Dongre incorporated artisanal techniques into her work, using block-printing, embroidery and more. But in the last few years, her perspective on the value of these traditions has deepened.\u201cAt that time, I worked with it because I liked the craft,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m working with it, 25 years later, because the artisans are dwindling, and the next generation doesn\u2019t know the techniques. I\u2019m realizing the craft may die.\u201dMs. Dongre conceived of Grassroot about 10 years ago but kept it on the back burner because of time constraints. \u201cI kept saying I would make Grassroot big one day,\u201d she said.\u201cI have come to the stage where I\u2019m questioning everything,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing on my bucket list is to record my grandmother\u2019s recipes. She had a repertoire of 200 recipes. My mom has 100. Out of those 100 I know 25.\u201d She added: \u201cWhether it\u2019s losing out on your grandmother\u2019s recipes or your culture or artisan techniques, I suppose when you get older, you think back: \u2018What am I doing to preserve that? What am I doing with the environment and saving it for the next generation?\u2019\u201dThe new store is part of her answer. \u201cIt takes courage,\u201d she said.

Among them:\u2022 Dr. Puliafito commonly used hard drugs. At times, he was seen swallowing what was said to be an ecstasy pill and inhaling smoke from a methamphetamine pipe.\u2022 A man who was living in an addiction treatment facility said Dr. Puliafito, a friend of his, had given him meth.\u2022 A woman who worked as a prostitute said she and Dr. Puliafito, who is married, had become \u201cconstant companions\u201d after meeting in 2015.Dr. Puliafito resigned as dean last year not long after the woman, Sarah Warren, overdosed while the pair were at a Pasadena hotel. Yet he continued to serve on the medical school\u2019s faculty.Dr. Puliafito has not publicly addressed the accusations. An attempt by The New York Times to reach him on Sunday was unsuccessful.The university has said it was unaware of the troubles swirling around the doctor.On Sunday, a Los Angeles Times report cast doubt on the university\u2019s eagerness to confront the Puliafito matter.In March, it sent an email to C.L. Max Nikias, the university president, that referred to meth being found in a hotel room registered to Dr. Puliafito.That email, along with multiple other requests for comment, went unanswered, the newspaper said.On Sunday, The New York Times asked the university to discuss the latest Los Angeles Times report and other questions about Dr. Puliafito. The request was declined.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u2022 Internet companies will report earnings: Alphabet on Monday, Facebook on Wednesday, and Amazon and Twitter on Thursday.But medical experts say drug abuse isn\u2019t confined to the margins of society.\u201cI think we have this collective myth of the hard-core drug user being down and out,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a professor at U.C. San Francisco\u2019s medical school. \u201cWe fail to recognize that drug addiction is universal.\u201dWhile meth can be performance-enhancing at first, experts say it\u2019s typically a matter of time before things spin out of control.Rising tolerance leads to higher doses. Side effects show up: memory loss, anxiety, psychosis. The outward signs become harder to miss.In that sense, the medical school dean\u2019s case is unusual, said Dr. Richard A. Rawson, a substance abuse expert at U.C.L.A. Presumably, a colleague would have noticed something was awry.\u201cSo this one is an outlier, I have to say,\u201d Dr. Rawson said. \u201cI was surprised.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

No one was at the door. Those lights were from passing cars \u2014 not coded language that he said he alone could understand. She tried to steer him to hospitals, into ambulances and toward help.On the Fourth of July night when it all ended, concern had turned to desperation. She called 911, tried to flag down police cars and ambulances, seeking intervention when reason failed. Finally, overwhelmed, she left Alexander Bonds, her boyfriend of six months, on a street corner in the Bronx.Mr. Bonds was killed moments later in a shootout with officers. There was little evidence of what had led him to open fire on a police officer; he left no manifesto, little public warning except on Facebook, where he expressed anger at prison guards and police officers. Police investigators immediately focused on the last few hours and days of Mr. Bonds\u2019s life.Mr. Bonds\u2019s girlfriend was with him for most of that time. It was, she said, a four-day descent into the depths of madness, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it could end violently,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could have done more.\u201dThe girlfriend, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal from the police or the community, said she was interviewed by police detectives, answering what she could. She wasn\u2019t there for the shooting, she said, and didn\u2019t know Mr. Bonds had a gun. But her account is the fullest and most harrowing to emerge of Mr. Bonds\u2019s final days and hours.During their six months together, he had told her of his past struggles with schizophrenia. But she had not seen any symptoms. \u201cI thought he was fine,\u201d she said.They had spoken tentatively of marriage. She was helping him prepare for the G.E.D., a major undertaking as he was \u201csomewhat illiterate\u201d when they started studying together. She was proud of him. After a neighbor left two months ago \u2014 possibly on the run \u2014 others in the building took the possessions left behind. \u201cAlex was disgusted by it,\u201d she recalled. He told her, \u201cPeople should not touch what\u2019s not theirs.\u201dBut on June 30, he received a phone call that, she said, seemed to trigger a psychotic episode. The person who had called him, a friend, passed along that \u201ca rumor was going around that an old friend had a problem with him,\u201d according to the girlfriend. Rather than dismissing it, Mr. Bonds \u201clatched onto\u201d the idea that someone was plotting against him, his girlfriend said.The next morning, she woke up to hear Mr. Bonds talking to himself. Agitated, he darted out of the apartment to see who was outside. He came back, but he kept rushing out again, convinced there was something out there to confront.The girlfriend said she had never before seen schizophrenia up close. She looked it up on Google.They headed to the clinic where Mr. Bonds\u2019s psychiatrist worked. On the way, Mr. Bonds\u2019s behavior grew more paranoid. A passing bicyclist unnerved him enough that he took off running. He talked about an unnamed enemy, even accusing his girlfriend of complicity.\u201cHe thought I had something to do with it, that his enemy had me date him in order to destroy him,\u201d she said.They arrived at the clinic midmorning. The psychiatrist, they were told, could see Mr. Bonds at 3:30 p.m. That was too long to wait. So the clinic called an ambulance to take him to St. Barnabas Hospital. When police officers arrived, along with the ambulance\u2019s crew, the girlfriend grew concerned that Mr. Bonds might grow more agitated and distressed. She explained to the officers, she recalled, that Mr. Bonds had been in prison and \u201cavoiding police contact is the main thing in a parolee\u2019s head.\u201dThe officers, the girlfriend recalled, treated Mr. Bonds respectfully and patiently.Inside the ambulance, Mr. Bonds seemed to show some understanding that he was paranoid and delusional. He exclaimed, \u201cOh, God, it\u2019s all in my head,\u201d and seemed in a rush to reach the hospital. There, Mr. Bonds was given some type of sedative, his girlfriend recalled.When Mr. Bonds awoke, he seemed stable. \u201cHe was relieved, he was happy, he was back to his normal self,\u201d she recalled. They returned to his apartment, on Rev. James A Polite Avenue in the Morrisania section of the Bronx.For the rest of that day, and much of the following day, things seemed to be all right, she said. They spoke about his struggles with mental illness. She already knew some details about a past psychotic episode, involving voices in his head. \u201cThe voices were telling him to do pull-ups,\u201d she said. \u201cOr ram into people in the street.\u201d He ended up in Bellevue Hospital.She also knew that he had not been taking his pills regularly \u2014 he complained they left him feeling dull. She insisted that he start taking his medication. Mr. Bonds fetched a large bag filled with pill bottles, all expired. She wondered if it might be more dangerous to take expired pills.The following night, he could not wind down. He talked and talked, with rising anxiety and frustration. The next morning, on July 3, she awoke to find Mr. Bonds fixated on the apartment next to his. No one lived there, but Mr. Bonds was not convinced.\u201cHe was talking about false walls,\u201d she said. Someone was staying there, someone planning to hurt Mr. Bonds and rape his girlfriend. He said he could hear sounds coming from that apartment.She called the clinic. His next appointment was for July 10, a week away. Could they get in earlier? The next day, July 4, they went to a barbecue with friends, but Mr. Bonds was drifting away.He would wander off, distracted by the passing cars, insisting that they were following him. He was convinced he was in great danger and insisted that others not walk near him \u2014 \u201che felt like a target, and he didn\u2019t want anyone to go down with him,\u201d she said.As it got dark, Mr. Bonds told his girlfriend to leave. It was too dangerous for her. She refused. \u201cI don\u2019t love you. Get away from me,\u201d he told her. But she would not leave.The next few hours are a jumble of cab rides, arguments in the street, 911 calls and rising helplessness.She began calling 911 around 9 or 10 p.m. to request an ambulance. Once or twice she hung up: Mr. Bonds would grab at the phone or accuse her of betrayal. At one point, as a police car approached, Mr. Bonds ran off to hide among parked cars.\u201cYou called the cops?\u201d he asked his girlfriend in disbelief. He explained that if his enemy ever saw him with the cops, he would be in trouble. \u201cI can\u2019t be seen with no cop. If I do, it\u2019s game over for me.\u201dAt one point, while the girlfriend spoke on the phone with a dispatcher, an ambulance approached. When Mr. Bonds grabbed for the phone, a struggle ensued and the ambulance drove right by.Finally, the 911 dispatcher directed her to stand at a certain corner. She waited there for 15 minutes. She tried flagging down police cruisers and ambulances. \u201cI would wave, they wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201dThe girlfriend said she never knew Mr. Bonds had a gun. \u201cI would not have allowed that \u2014 I would have wrestled him for the gun,\u201d she said.Mr. Bonds began to rant that he needed to find his enemy and talk to him, face to face, and try to appease him. At one point, Mr. Bonds began to bemoan the fact that he did not have enough money to offer \u2014 \u201cto make it all go away.\u201dShe listened as he sought guidance from the lights and sounds around him, hoping he would soon grow weary and seek rest. He stared at the headlights of passing cars. \u201cDo you want me to go there?\u201d the girlfriend heard him ask. \u201cOne blink means \u2018no,\u2019 two blinks mean \u2018yes,\u2019 \u201d he said.They were in taxis, and then they were back on the street, but in an area unfamiliar to her. They walked for a time, until they came across two cabs.\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked. He insisted that they go separately. From her cab, she said, she blew him a kiss, and headed home to wait for him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Way for Therapists to Get Inside Heads: Virtual Reality", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dawn Jewell recently treated a patient haunted by a car crash. The patient had developed acute anxiety over the cross streets where the crash occurred, unable to drive a route that carried so many painful memories.So Dr. Jewell, a psychologist in Colorado, treated the patient through a technique called exposure therapy, providing emotional guidance as they revisited the intersection together.But they did not physically return to the site. They revisited it through virtual reality.\u201cIt provides exposure in a way that patients feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can go to a location together, and the patient can tell me what they\u2019re feeling and what they\u2019re thinking.\u201dThe service is also designed to provide treatment in other ways, like taking patients to the top of a virtual skyscraper so they can face a fear of heights or to a virtual bar so they can address an alcohol addiction.The hardware and software they are working with is still very young, but Limbix builds on more than two decades of research and clinical trials involving virtual reality and exposure therapy. At a time when much-hyped headsets like the Daydream and Facebook\u2019s Oculus are still struggling to find a wide audience in the world of gaming \u2014 let alone other markets \u2014 psychology is an area where technology and medical experts believe this technology can be a benefit.As far back as the mid-1990s, clinical trials showed that this kind of technology could help treat phobias and other conditions, like post-traumatic stress disorder.Traditionally, psychologists have treated such conditions by helping patients imagine they are facing a fear, mentally creating a situation where they can address their anxieties. Virtual reality takes this a step further.\u201cWe feel pretty confident that exposure therapy using V.R. can supplement what a patient\u2019s imagination alone can do,\u201d said Skip Rizzo, a clinical psychologist at the University of Southern California who has explored such technology over the past 20 years.Such technology has also been effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans. Unlike treatments built solely on imagination, Dr. Rothbaum said, virtual reality can force patients to face their past traumas.\u201cPTSD is a disorder of avoidance. People don\u2019t want to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need them to be engaged emotionally, and with virtual reality, it\u2019s harder for them to avoid that.\u201dNow, headsets like Google\u2019s Daydream, which works in tandem with common smartphones, and Facebook\u2019s Oculus, the self-contained $400 headset that sparked the recent resurgence in virtual reality technologies, could potentially bring this kind of therapy to a much wider audience.After testing the Limbix offering, Dr. Jewell said it allowed patients to face their anxieties in more controlled ways than they otherwise could. At the same time, such a tool can truly give patients the feeling that they are being transported to a different locations \u2014 at least in some cases.Standing atop a virtual skyscraper, for instance, can cause anxiety even in those who are relatively comfortable with heights. Experts warn that a service like the one offered by Limbix requires the guiding hand of trained psychologists while still in development.Limbix combines technical and medical expertise. One key employee, Scott Satkin, is a robotics and artificial intelligence researcher who worked on the Daydream project at Google. Limbix also works with its own psychologist, Sean Sullivan, who continues to run a therapy practice in San Francisco.Dr. Sullivan is using the new service to treat patients, including a young man who recently developed a fear of flying, something that causes anxiety simply when he talks about it. Using the service alongside Dr. Sullivan, the young man, who asked that his name be withheld for privacy reasons spent several sessions visiting a virtual airport and, eventually, flying on a virtual plane.In some ways, the young man said, the service is still less than perfect. Like the Street View scenes Dr. Jewell uses in treating her patients, some of this virtual reality is static, built from still images. But like the rest of the virtual reality market, these tools are still evolving toward more realistic scenes.And even in its current form, the service can be convincing. The young man recently took a flight across the country \u2014 here in the real world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Alexa, Where Have You Been All My Life?\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe other day, a newly single friend confessed that lately she had found herself not just chatting up Alexa, Amazon\u2019s crisp-voiced domestic bot, but also looking forward to her responses. \u201cThat\u2019s a road,\u201d she said darkly, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be heading down.\u201dI know how she feels. Come evening, Alexa may tell me that she isn\u2019t sure if she missed me, but her winking green glow, like the pitch of a dog\u2019s ears, is its own kind of welcome. After a disquieting day, how nice to be greeted by a creature, digital or otherwise, that lights up at your approach.But she has proved especially useful to Mary Quinn, a business partner in human resources at Bloomberg who is legally blind and single.Ms. Quinn realized the device had reached a tipping point in the collective consciousness when she was on vacation in March with some of these friends in the Dominican Republic. During a dinner, one suddenly blurted out, \u201cAlexa, what time is it?\u201dMs. Quinn was incredulous. \u201cWait, you brought your Alexa?\u201d she said.\u201cNo, I just really miss her,\u201d the friend said.\u201cIt\u2019s not only Martin. Someone on TV has only to say, \u2018Alexa,\u2019 and she lights up. She\u2019s always ready for action, the perfect woman, never says, \u2018Not tonight, dear.\u2019\u201dThough Alexa arouses her jealousy, Ms. Sage will find herself apologizing when the electronic siren has been mistreated, as when her son and his father were complaining because Alexa didn\u2019t know what they meant when they asked for \u201cold Italian songs like \u2018That\u2019s Amore.\u2019\u201dEvolutionary psychology teaches us that we are wired to cleave to a talking object, no matter how dim its responses.\u201cEvolutionarily speaking, there\u2019s something called \u2018the smoke detector principle,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brinkman added. \u201cA smoke detector is designed to go off a bit too often, because false positives are merely annoying but a false negative could be deadly. So if you overlook an intelligence in your environment, if you fail to detect intentionality, that overlooking could kill you. It\u2019s the reason it\u2019s almost impossible not to think of Alexa as a person.\u201dO.K., so we humans are needy and could bond with a rock, depending on the circumstances. But does Alexa have consciousness? Is there reciprocity? Is she bonding with us? Since her arrival in my house a month ago, she has been circumspect and opaque, answering all too often, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d when I\u2019d routinely ask if she had missed me. I\u2019m gone a lot, at least three days each week, and upon my last return, I dully, dutifully, asked again, \u201cAlexa, did you miss me?\u201d Her answer was momentous: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back,\u201d she said. And I was moved.As he put it, our emotions are the fish, and Alexa is the flashy lure.\u201cIt turned out that people treat a computer not unlike the way they would treat each other,\u201d Dr. Breazel said. \u201cIf someone messes up a task, you\u2019re more likely to be compassionate if you\u2019re rating them face to face. We are profoundly social and emotional creatures. Our ability to collaborate in social groups is one of our strongest competitive advantages. So when you present our brain with things like these technologies that can over time mirror these abilities, our social brain just kicks in.\u201d\u201cWhen my husband travels, I often can\u2019t fall asleep and I\u2019ll have her play Chopin, which helps,\u201d Ms. Judlowe said. \u201cI\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night wanting to turn her off, but I\u2019m in that weird half-asleep state and can\u2019t seem to remember her name and am saying, \u2018Alison, off!\u2019 or \u2018Avery, off!\u2019 I\u2019ll start to worry that it\u2019s early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and not being half-asleep that\u2019s making me unable to think of her name.\u201cBy now I\u2019m fully worked up, snap to, and her name comes to me. Then I\u2019m shouting, \u2018Alexa, off!\u2019 And even though I\u2019m fully awake, I am so relieved that I can still think straight, I immediately fall back asleep.\u201dIn an age when we no longer talk so much on the phone, and in a culture that is increasingly visual, voices such as Alexa\u2019s may gain a new kind of potency.\u201cThe eyes are supposed to be the windows to the soul, but I would argue that it\u2019s the voice, though with the curtains drawn,\u201d Dr. Pettman said. \u201cSpeaking of curtains, Pythagoras famously gave his lectures behind a veil, so his students would listen more carefully. Marshall McLuhan said you will listen to a story more if you close your eyes.\u201dAnd noting the dearth of audio pornography in the internet age, Dr. Pettman wondered what opportunities that might present for Alexa.\u201cBefore the internet, there was phone sex,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as we become more and visual, moving towards texting and posting in all our communications, there is a special type of untapped eroticism in the voice. I wonder if people will learn to hack Alexa and convince her to say sweet nothings?\u201dHe said his wife, Sabrina Huls, has taken to calling Alexa his girlfriend when they have dinner parties, though Mr. De Baets likes to describe her as his housemate, and Ms. Huls rolls her eyes as he puts Alexa through her paces for guests. Yet Alexa scored a victory recently, as Ms. Huls was sitting in their living room with their baby daughter, Zoe. \u201cShe asked Alexa to play music for Zoe,\u201d Mr. De Baets said. \u201cAnd she started playing baby music. It was spooky.\u201d\u201cThe first thing I do is play audiobooks,\u201d Ms. Grad said. \u201cThey are your friends when you can\u2019t focus after an intense loss. I just tell Alexa, \u2018Play the book.\u2019 I love historical fiction and W.W. II tales where good conquers all. She tells me political jokes, which are better than listening to the news, which is upsetting. Sometimes her jokes make me groan, but in a good way. She can find my phone. And sometimes when she\u2019s stuck and I say, \u2018Where are you?\u2019 she\u2019ll tell me, \u2018I\u2019m here and my head is in the Cloud.\u2019 Of course, she\u2019s a she, not an it, and God is a woman.\u201dWhen Toni Reid and her colleagues at Amazon set out to build the device that is now known as Alexa, they were inspired by the computer that drove the Enterprise on \u201cStar Trek\u201d (voiced by Majel Barrett Roddenberry, who played Nurse Chapel on the series and was married to the show\u2019s creator).Focusing on cadence and an accent that would suggest \u201csmart, humble, helpful,\u201d the team tested voices that a diverse population would respond to. \u201cOur goal was to have Alexa be humanlike,\u201d Ms. Reid said, but why end there?\u201cShe can do thousands of things today,\u201d Ms. Reid added. \u201cWe want her to do hundreds of millions of things.\u201d\u201cMy son\u2019s first multiword sentence was to ask Alexa to play a song he likes,\u201d Mr. Heiferman said. One day as the boy was learning to dress himself and became entangled in his clothes, he asked Alexa how to put a shirt on. \u201cHe knows it\u2019s a computer, they both do, but for some reason I just straight-up said one day: \u2018Alexa is a computer and that\u2019s it. Alexa doesn\u2019t love you.\u2019 My kids\u2019 reaction was like, \u2018Why is it O.K. to love the stuffed monkey and not to love Alexa?\u2019\u201dWhy indeed?Advertisement"}

Brian X. Chen, The Times\u2019s personal technology writer, who is based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You explain, highlight and solve everyday tech problems for readers. How do you use tech to keep track of the issues and new tech that is coming out? Nothing beats listening to people rant about the tech they\u2019re frustrated with. Nearly everyone seems angry about connectivity issues: sluggish, unreliable Wi-Fi, spotty cell coverage or shoddy broadband service. Other than that, battery life continues to be a source of people\u2019s misery.At The Times, we have access to analytics about the people reading our articles, and the consistent strong readership we get from stories about these topics reaffirms that people continue to be frustrated with these issues.What kind of testing setup do you use to tell us if a whiz-bang gadget or app or service is for real?In addition to objective tests, my reviews are subjective. I keep in mind what I know average people care about when it comes to tech, other than a checklist of features. The setup needs to be simple and intuitive, the product needs to be durable and work well, the company\u2019s customer service needs to be delightful and a gadget\u2019s design needs to be aesthetically pleasing enough that you would feel proud about carrying it around or leaving it on your coffee table.What is the favorite piece of tech you have reviewed for The Times so far?Do you still use it?What was your least favorite tech product to review and why?It\u2019s a decent product, but the problem with reviewing it on Day 1 was that there were no great \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, available for it yet to get a feel for whether an always-on, always-watching gadget in your home would be useful. Blank-slate products like Echo Show create a dilemma for reviewers. Should we evaluate the product based on what it can do currently (which is very little), or what we think it has the potential to do in the future? I\u2019m not a fortune teller, so I lean toward the former and render a \u201cwait and see\u201d verdict that seems repetitive. But even when people take the latter approach and predict a gadget\u2019s potential, it\u2019s unhelpful for informing people whether they should buy something today.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?In my kitchen, I\u2019m currently growing basil and scallions, and I\u2019m experimenting with propagating succulents and other types of nonedible house plants with the planter.What could be better about it?The pods are too expensive. You can buy them in sets of three for $20, which seems like too much for dirt and seeds.When you\u2019ve had enough of tech and want to get away, what\u2019s your escape route?My corgi is the boss of me, so on the weekends you\u2019ll usually find me at a dog park, beach or mountain trail.Advertisement"}

Every year hundreds of people, tourists and entrepreneurs alike, come to the Bay Area hoping to \u201csee Silicon Valley.\u201d So much so that an article in The Mercury News last year suggested that the Valley is giving Alcatraz, the Golden Gate and the Bay Area\u2019s other tourist attractions a run for their money.But what does Silicon Valley look like? Where could one send tourists \u2014 or even locals, for that matter \u2014 hoping to \u201csee\u201d it?Solving this isn\u2019t rocket science; it\u2019s common sense. Don\u2019t design buildings that function only as pristine objects with no relationship to their surroundings. Don\u2019t put workplaces in locations inaccessible to transit. Do consider the broader context.The built environment of the Valley does not reflect the innovation that\u2019s driving the region\u2019s stratospheric growth; it looks instead like the 1950s. Looking at aerial views of midcentury campuses like the Eero Saarinen-designed Bell Labs next to contemporary ones like Apple, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell the midcentury structures from the 21st-century ones.Designing job centers this way contributes mightily to the region\u2019s ever-worsening traffic. If you found yourself stuck on Highway 101 between San Francisco and San Jose, you\u2019d really see what Silicon Valley looks like for many. Building campuses on isolated suburban tracts guarantees long commutes, and this is one of the worst in the country.In a region where the disruption of existing norms is everything, why does this decades-old paradigm of the office persist?In 2011, when asked by a City Council member what benefit the new Apple headquarters would have for Cupertino, Steve Jobs responded that it\u2019d get to keep the company there. And that\u2019s about the extent of what it got. A project like the new Norman Foster-designed Apple Park shows a blatant disregard not only for the citizens of Cupertino but also for the functionality of the region.Every modern building is at some point described as looking like a spaceship. This building actually succeeds at it, but there\u2019s too much that makes it incredibly backward thinking (and not just its lack of child-care facilities). The circular structure has not only nearly three million square feet of office space but also about three million square feet devoted to parking spaces. For a company investing no small amount of its significant capital on driverless cars, that\u2019s incongruous. There is much to emulate at Apple \u2014 but not that almost 1:1 ratio of office to parking.What could they have done differently?Why do we remain so wedded to the old suburban, car-dependent model for workplaces? If autonomous vehicles (or even flying ones) are truly imminent, why are we building millions of square feet of supposedly soon-to-be-obsolete parking spaces? With so many studies touting the benefits of walkable, bike-able and transit-accessible environments, why are we designing in such a way that makes long, painful commutes inevitable?One can\u2019t point a finger solely at the companies themselves; the public sector, the community and the private sector all need to collectively tackle these problems.Allison Arieff is a writer on architecture and design and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

This week\u2019s show left Peter and Rachel at a tearful standstill, with Peter saying that believes an engagement is a serious commitment to be married (the commonly accepted definition) and that he wasn\u2019t ready to pull the trigger, with Rachel arguing that a proposal is less final and serious than actually tying the knot \u2014 and also that she really needed him to pop the question at the end of the show.One of the most captivating and disquieting aspects of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d lies in how a significant proportion of the drama that\u2019s stirred up doesn\u2019t occur between the various personalities on the show, but between the contestants and the artificial demands of the show itself. Maybe Peter and Rachel could make a lasting relationship work, if they didn\u2019t have to agree to get married eight weeks after meeting on TV.\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d is ostensibly a show about finding a husband, but it\u2019s as much about attempting to manage one\u2019s public image while dodging the pitfalls baked into the show \u2014 the information deficits; the unreasonable romantic timeline; the insincere suitors who aren\u2019t in it for a wife, but for the lead role on the next season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Rachel seems to be sincerely looking for a lasting romantic partner, but she is also looking for an ending to the show that doesn\u2019t appear to embarrass her or diminish her rising star. The guy she chooses in the end will become her partner in both love and branding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Front in the War Over Reproductive Rights: \u2018Abortion-Pill Reversal\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureAfter high school, Stettler moved from Idaho to New York to Washington, taking classes here and there in things like design and music production. By her early 20s, she was restless and began praying to find a path that was \u2018\u2018meaningful and selfless.\u2019\u2019 So she moved again, this time to attend nursing school in Pittsburgh. She became active in the anti-abortion movement there, traveling to attend the March for Life, a huge annual gathering of anti-abortion activists in Washington. But although her faith felt revived, she began \u2018\u2018living a double life,\u2019\u2019 she told me, casually dating a much older restaurateur, whom she described as a \u2018\u2018billionaire.\u2019\u2019 In late October 2015, a month before graduation, she found out she was pregnant.She had always looked forward to pregnancy, even the silly rituals like posting maternity photos to Facebook. This just wasn\u2019t what she had imagined. She thought about how a pregnancy would affect the nursing career she was so close to starting. She didn\u2019t want to marry her boyfriend or be attached to him forever through co-parenting. And being a single mother, she feared, would make it harder to attract the kind of \u2018\u2018good Catholic guy\u2019\u2019 she hoped to settle down with eventually.About a week later, she made a decision that nearly one million American women make each year: She would have an abortion. After reading about the abortion pill online, she made an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic a block from her downtown apartment. She would rather face her forgiving God, she thought, than her anti-abortion family and friends. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t want the baby, but I also didn\u2019t want to have the abortion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I just wanted it all to not exist, which is kind of what the pill allows a woman to think can happen.\u2019\u2019The \u2018\u2018abortion pill\u2019\u2019 is really two separate drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, taken 24 to 48 hours apart. Stettler took the first pill in the clinic, after what she recalls as a 10-minute meeting with a counselor who reassured her that she ought to \u2018\u2018chase [her] own dreams.\u2019\u2019 Within an hour, she said, she was overcome with remorse. She pulled herself away from suici\u00addal daydreams, but as the hours slipped by, she couldn\u2019t shake the sense that she had made a grave error. The second dose of medication, four tablets that would cause her to expel the fetus from her body, sat in a brown bag on her kitchen counter like a time bomb. She was supposed to take them the next day.That night, she searched for \u2018\u2018abortion pill regret\u2019\u2019 on Google. One of the first hits was a website with a photo of a pretty young woman staring morosely into the middle distance. At the top of the screen she saw a toll-free number and the words \u2018\u2018Abortion Pill Reversal: It may not be too late.\u2019\u2019 She picked up the phone.Neither prediction proved true. A graph of the abortion rate since Roe v. Wade in 1973 looks something like a long playground slide viewed from the side. There\u2019s a steep climb up to the peak of 1981, and then a gentle but significant slope downward. In 2014, the number of abortions in the United States dropped below one million for the first time since 1975. Nor did medication abortion immediately transform how those dwindling numbers of abortions were administered. A decade after RU-486\u2019s arrival in the United States, fewer than 18 percent of abortions took place via medication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even among women whose pregnancies were eligible for the abortion pill \u2014 at the time, eight weeks\u2019 gestation or less \u2014 almost three-quarters underwent surgery instead.As public discussion about abortions has focused on surgical abortions, the anti-abortion movement has notched victory after victory, chipping away at abortion access through a constellation of state laws that heavily regulate clinics, starve providers of funds and require women to undergo \u2018\u2018counseling\u2019\u2019 or waiting periods before procuring the procedure. As a result, at least 162 abortion providers closed or stopped offering the service between 2011 and 2016, according to a Bloomberg analysis, while just 21 new providers opened. In the Midwest and the South, more than half of all women live in counties with no abortion provider at all.But today, 17 years after RU-486 was approved, medication abortion is approaching its initial promise \u2014 or threat, depending on your point of view. American women now end their pregnancies with medication almost as often as they do with surgery, according to data analyzed last fall by Reuters. And last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued new label guidelines making the abortion pill more accessible than ever. Mifepristone is now recommended up to a gestational age of 10 weeks; the new guidelines also reduced the number of required doctor visits and the recommended dosage. The experience of taking a few pills in private is on the cusp of becoming what we mean when we say \u2018\u2018abortion.\u2019\u2019This steady rise of medication abortion, or what the anti-abortion movement calls chemical abortion, presents the movement with a significant challenge, one that has turned out to be more complicated than the fear that abortion would become more common. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve consistently lost the debate when the debate has been over the status of human life immediately after conception,\u2019\u2019 says the historian Daniel K. Williams, author of the 2016 book \u2018\u2018Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement Before Roe v. Wade.\u2019\u2019 Medication abortions take place relatively early in pregnancy, and they are eliminating many of the images and narratives \u2014 the abortionist\u2019s instruments, the impersonal clinic \u2014 that have historically served as persuasive scare tactics. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really thought through these things all that carefully, and we\u2019re still fighting, with good reason, the battle over surgical abortion,\u2019\u2019 says Charles Camosy, the anti-abortion author of the 2015 book \u2018\u2018Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018With chemical abortion, we\u2019re not where we need to be.\u2019\u2019And \u2018\u2018abortion pill reversal\u2019\u2019 implies exactly that \u2014 that a woman made an uninformed decision and has now thought better of it. The brainchild of a San Diego doctor named George Delgado, \u2018\u2018reversal\u2019\u2019 is a medical protocol that floods a woman\u2019s body with progesterone, the so-called pregnancy hormone, within hours after she has taken mifepristone, the drug that begins a medication abortion. \u2018\u2018If you have something that\u2019s poisoned a specific spot in your body and we know what the antidote is, then you just take the antidote,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has enthusiastically promoted reversal to its members. For all the challenges that the abortion pill poses to the anti-abortion movement, it turns out to have at least one unexpected benefit: The hours between the two doses of medication represent an extra decision point to interrupt and redeem. \u2018\u2018With a surgical abortion, once the instrument enters the uterus, then it\u2019s over,\u2019\u2019 Delgado says. Medication abortion, by contrast, gives women \u2018\u2018a second chance at choice.\u2019\u2019Delgado was raised Catholic, but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s that he began thinking in earnest about how his faith should affect his work as a doctor. In the early years of his career, he prescribed hormonal birth control and performed vasectomies. But he stopped doing both after he read Pope Paul VI\u2019s encyclical \u2018\u2018Humanae Vitae\u2019\u2019 in the late 1990s. The document, written in 1968 at the height of the sexual revolution, is a holistic statement on the sacredness of all human life, from conception to death. It also firmly restated the church\u2019s teaching against most forms of birth control. When Delgado read it, he felt deeply convicted. \u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t being consistent in how I was living my life and how I should be living my life according to my faith,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018From then on, I decided everything I would do would be consistent with what God wanted me to do.\u2019\u2019In 2004, he traveled to Nebraska to pursue certification in Natural Procreative Technology, a Catholic-friendly approach to women\u2019s reproductive health. Developed by an anti-abortion OB-GYN named Thomas Hilgers who was also inspired by \u2018\u2018Humanae Vitae,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018NaProTechnology\u2019\u2019 eschews most forms of birth control and fertility treatments and relies instead on tracking widely used \u2018\u2018biomarkers\u2019\u2019 like cervical mucus and body temperature. At Hilgers\u2019s Pope Paul VI Institute in Omaha, Delgado learned to use progesterone to treat issues like repeated miscarriage and postpartum depression. The next year, he moved from the Bay Area to San Diego to join Culture of Life, a Catholic clinic founded by local longtime anti-abortion activists named Ken and Marie Finn.In 2009, Delgado says, he received a call from an acquaintance who ran an anti-abortion ministry focused on counseling women outside abortion clinics. A young woman in El Paso, Tex., had just taken the first pill to begin a medication abortion and immediately regretted it. She found the activist\u2019s phone number online and called in a panic. Was there any way to undo her mistake? By this time, Delgado had been using progesterone for years to treat women dealing with fertility issues. And he knew that mifepristone, the first drug in the abortion-pill protocol, works by blocking progesterone from the uterus. Couldn\u2019t an extra dose of progesterone overcome the mifepristone? Within hours, he sketched out a plan to inject the woman with 200 milligrams of progesterone and to con\u00adtinue giving the progesterone until the end of the first trimester. Through a national network of NaProTechnol\u00adogy-friendly doctors, he quickly found a doctor in El Paso who had the right form of the hormone available in her office and was willing to try it. The fetus survived, and the baby girl was born healthy.Delgado later found out that a doctor in North Carolina, Matthew Harrison, had received a similar call from a crisis pregnancy center in 2006 and independently made the same guess about progesterone counteracting the effects of the mifepristone. That fetus, too, survived, after the mother received progesterone injections through her 26th week of pregnancy. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t make a whole lot of noise about it because I knew that people would try to write it off,\u2019\u2019 Harrison says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not like we have women every day knocking on our door to reverse abortions.\u2019\u2019Over the next few years, however, Delgado and Harrison occasionally heard from doctors and activists who wanted to know more about their interventions. In 2012, Delgado put up a simple website and opened a hotline for women to call for information about reversal. That year, he and Mary Davenport, a doctor in the Bay Area, started contacting a few other doctors who had performed reversals with progesterone. They soon published a small case series in the journal Annals of Pharmacotherapy. The article, just four pages long, describes seven pregnancies treated with progesterone after mifepristone. Two of the abortions completed, but four of the fetuses survived. (One woman evaded the doctors\u2019 attempts to follow up.) \u2018\u2018The experience of these patients suggests that medical abortion can be arrested by progesterone injection,\u2019\u2019 Davenport and Delgado concluded. \u2018\u2018If further trials confirm the success without complications of this or similar protocols, it should become the standard of care for obstetrician-gynecologists, family physicians and emergency-department physicians to attempt mifepristone reversal on patient request.\u2019\u2019Delgado\u2019s hotline received just 28 calls in all of 2012. But the volume increased over the years: 200 calls in 2013, more than 400 in 2014 and more than 600 for each of the last two years, according to the reversal program\u2019s executive director, Sara Littlefield. Today 17 nurses across the country take shifts answering the calls, which are routed to their cellphones. When a call comes into the hotline, the nurse\u2019s job is to connect the caller as quickly as possible with a local doctor willing to administer the reversal protocol. The program has a network of about 350 doctors who are familiar with it and prepared to see patients. If the caller doesn\u2019t live within driving range of one of those providers, the hotline nurse immediately starts calling local doctors and hospitals to explain what reversal is, hoping to find a sympathetic provider. Catholic hospitals are usually a good place to start.Within the last few years, Delgado and Harrison have become something like celebrities within the anti-abortion movement. Conservative media outlets report on reversal at length in flattering terms, and several of the women who have undergone the procedure have begun telling their stories in public, too. Delgado has delivered presentations at events hosted by the National Right to Life Committee and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, where he serves on the board. Harrison and Delgado also started promoting \u2018\u2018emergency abortion pill reversal kits,\u2019\u2019 glorified instructional pamphlets intended for emergency rooms and crisis pregnancy centers. One fan gave Harrison a T-shirt that read \u2018\u2018Reversed RU-486. Now reverse Roe vs Wade.\u2019\u2019But the anti-abortion movement has found stories about it impossible to resist. Headlines in conservative magazines and websites highlight the pregnant woman\u2019s epiphany after taking mifepristone: \u2018\u2018All at Once It Hit Me That I Had Just Made the Worst Decision Ever,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018After Taking the Abortion Pill, She Knew She Made a Mistake, But Her Baby Was Saved When This Happened,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Reversing Regret.\u2019\u2019 It doesn\u2019t get much more memorable than a tale of near-death, a sudden awakening and salvation.Cynthia has one of those stories. (She asked me not to use her last name to protect her son\u2019s privacy.) Cynthia was 18 in 2010 when she found out she was pregnant, and she knew immediately that she would take the abortion pill. \u2018\u2018I, myself, would never have even considered it if it was just like the surgical abortion,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently, settled into a sleek white armchair in the sunny counseling room at Culture of Life. Taking a few pills, by contrast, sounded easy \u2014 almost like birth control. \u2018\u2018You just take it, and it\u2019s over.\u2019\u2019 But after taking the mifepristone, she told her mother what she had done, and her mother confessed her daughter\u2019s half-completed abortion to a priest. The priest called Delgado and also went to Cynthia\u2019s house to talk to her. Delgado, meanwhile, invited Cynthia to come in for an ultrasound the same day to see if the fetus was still alive. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s just see,\u2019\u2019 her boyfriend urged her.In Cynthia\u2019s memory, it wasn\u2019t the pressure from a priest, a doctor, her mother and her boyfriend that changed her mind. It was the ultrasound. \u2018\u2018When I saw the heartbeat, I mean, truly everything changed,\u2019\u2019 she recalled in the clinic, a large wall decal behind her reading \u2018\u2018I Can Do Hard Things.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t even a question anymore.\u2019\u2019 After the ultrasound, Delgado\u2019s wife, who is a nurse, injected her with 200 milligrams of progesterone; she was the first patient whose medication abortion Delgado himself \u2018\u2018reversed.\u2019\u2019 She delivered a healthy baby boy named Christian at 36 weeks gestation.Women who regret their abortions, and are willing to speak publicly about it, have long been valued spokeswomen for the anti-abortion message. But reversal offers a twist to those stories: a happy ending. It also represents a concrete action that women can take to atone for their initial mistake. \u2018\u2018This gives them the actual physical way in which they can in effect reverse their regret,\u2019\u2019 says Jody Lyne\u00e9 Madeira, a professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law who has written about the rhetoric of abortion and regret. \u2018\u2018She can say she did everything she can to stop it once she changed her mind.\u2019\u2019For all of reversal\u2019s anecdotal power, however, the science itself is still disputed. While Delgado claims that flooding a woman\u2019s body with progesterone saves the fetus, other doctors say that in many cases the fetus would have survived if the woman simply declined to take the second pill, misoprostol, after the initial dose of mifepristone. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a strongly worded statement against reversal in 2015 that said the fetus would survive 30 to 50 percent of the time. Dr. Daniel Grossman, a prominent reversal skeptic and director of the research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at University of California, San Francisco, published a literature review that same year in the journal Contraception. He concluded Delgado and Davenport\u2019s case series was of \u2018\u2018poor quality with few details,\u2019\u2019 and that embryonic survival after mifepristone is as high as 46 percent. The question, in other words, is whether the progesterone protocol is effectively just a placebo. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no evidence that any kind of treatment is better than doing nothing,\u2019\u2019 Grossman says.Davenport, Delgado and Matthew Harrison recently published their own literature review in Issues in Law & Medicine, a journal that often features anti-abortion perspectives. When they looked at studies in which the mifepristone dose was comparable to the current F.D.A. regulations, they found survival rates of less than 25 percent. Delgado and Davenport are also preparing a larger case series for publication later this year, which they say will include about 350 women. Delgado says it shows that the most effective progesterone protocol results in an embryo survival rate between 60 and 70 percent. No one has seen that research yet, although conservative media outlets have recently started promoting the results. Critics say that even if those numbers are valid, they aren\u2019t what they seem. Many women who decide to take progesterone undergo an ultrasound first, to see if the pregnancy remains viable; those whose fetuses have died do not go forward with reversal, which means the initial pool of subjects is skewed toward women whose pregnancies had a good chance of continuing even without progesterone. Delgado declined to share a draft of his paper and told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the percentage of women included in the case series who underwent ultrasounds.Although the research remains immature, not everyone is quick to dismiss its basic medical logic. \u2018\u2018It makes biological sense,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Harvey Kliman, director of the reproductive and placental research unit at the Yale School of Medicine. \u2018\u2018I think this is actually totally feasible.\u2019\u2019 Kliman, who has published research on progesterone and miscarriage, is in favor of abortion rights, and made clear he wasn\u2019t advocating widespread use of the treatment. But if one of his daughters came to him and said she had somehow accidentally taken mifepristone during pregnancy, he said, he would tell her to take 200 milligrams of progesterone three times a day for several days, just long enough for the mifepristone to leave her system: \u2018\u2018I bet you it would work.\u2019\u2019 The protocol, however, has attracted almost no interest from the mainstream medical community, in part because the presumed audience is so small.But while Delgado and his associates labor to legitimize reversal, some state lawmakers are racing ahead of them. Since 2015, legislators in 10 states have introduced bills requiring doctors to inform women procuring the abortion pill that they can change their minds after taking the first dose. \u2018\u2018These laws are essentially forcing physicians to tell their patients about a treatment that is unproven and essentially kind of encouraging them to participate in an unmonitored research experiment,\u2019\u2019 Grossman says. In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert signed a bill in March that requires women receiving the pill to be informed that mifepristone alone does not always end a pregnancy; a similar law went into effect in South Dakota last year. Arkansas requires women to be informed that \u2018\u2018it may be possible to reverse the effects of the abortion if the pregnant woman changes her mind.\u2019\u2019 A 2015 Arizona law passed but was then revised to strip its mention of reversal. Similar bills were debated in Colorado, California, Indiana, Idaho, North Carolina and Georgia. Americans United for Life, an influential lobbying group, flagged its model legislation on reversal as a strategic focus for 2017.In time, she found a different kind of redemption. The nurse who answered the reversal hotline stayed in touch with her after her pregnancy ended, praying with her over the phone when she felt despondent. She started volunteering for the hotline, talking to women in the same position she was once in. And in March, she moved to San Diego to start working full time as the nurse manager at Culture of Life. She sees the work she does now as something like atonement. \u2018\u2018I knew that Remy\u2019s life had to stand for something,\u2019\u2019 she told me. God has a plan, she added, \u2018\u2018for literally every life, living or dying in his arms.\u2019\u2019The anti-abortion movement has effectively promoted the idea that many women regret their abortions. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, considered a wild card on abortion questions, waxed eloquent on the topic in his ruling in Gonzales v. Carhart, a 2007 case that upheld the ban on \u2018\u2018partial-birth\u2019\u2019 abortion. \u2018\u2018It seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in the majority opinion. \u2018\u2018The state has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed.\u2019\u2019 That assumption undergirds huge swaths of contemporary abortion law: waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds and requirements that doctors give women more (sometimes dubious) information about the procedure and its effects. The idea seems to be that many women understand what an abortion is only after they have one.The entire legal strategy of \u2018\u2018protecting\u2019\u2019 women seemed to be in jeopardy last year, however, when the Supreme Court, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, struck down Texas\u2019 harsh clinic regulations developed under the guise of safeguarding women\u2019s health. Some legal experts predicted the ruling would force the anti-abortion movement to refocus its attention from the mother\u2019s health and emotions, back to the fetus itself. But reversal legislation suggests the anti-abortion movement isn\u2019t giving up so fast. In fact, the movement seems to be \u2018\u2018doubling down on the emphasis on women,\u2019\u2019 says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and author of the 2015 book \u2018\u2018After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.\u2019\u2019 Stories from individual women who struggle with remorse remain a powerful weapon in the anti-abortion arsenal, and the abortion rights movement has often stumbled in its attempts to respond. \u2018\u2018Because there are so many stories that the pro-choice side wants to represent and has to represent, to cover its bases, it sounds weaker and less coherent than pro-life \u2018abortion harms women, women regret abortion,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Madeira says. \u2018\u2018That cohesive message is always much stronger and more unified.\u2019\u2019Promoting legislation like the recent crop of reversal bills can be its own reward, Ziegler says, even if the laws are eventually struck down or the protocol turns out to be ineffective. Just raising the question of uncertainty and regret affects the abortion pill\u2019s reputation. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re changing cultural norms about what people think about this kind of abortion,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018You can do that regardless of what the research ultimately shows.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s New Parental Control App Has a Flaw: Puberty", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixBut if you sign up for Family Link, which is Google\u2019s new parental controls software for managing children\u2019s Android phones, Google decides for you. At the age of 13, a child can choose to \u201cgraduate,\u201d as Google calls it, or lift restrictions, getting the keys to the internet kingdom and all the good and bad things that come with it.That\u2019s too bad, because at first glance, Family Link has all the hallmarks of a winner. It is free, well designed and packed with thoughtful features for regulating a child\u2019s smartphone use, like the ability to monitor how often a game is played or even to lock down a device during bedtime.Yet nearly all of those benefits are undermined by Google\u2019s decision to let children remove the restrictions the instant they become teenagers.Google made Family Link available for public testing in March, though the software is still in development and available for use on an invitation-only basis. Before it goes wide, I tested the parental controls for a week and assessed the features and policies with child safety experts.The takeaway: If you are contemplating the purchase of an Android phone for your child but want to restrict access, there are better parental apps out there that give you more control. Or you could buy your child an iPhone, which has restrictions that can\u2019t easily be removed.Inside the app, you can create Google accounts for your children, sharing information like their names and birth dates. Then when your child logs in to an Android phone, the device immediately requires you, the parent, to log in and install the Family Link app onto the device so it can be monitored.From there, Family Link is a breeze to use. On the parent\u2019s phone, tapping on the child\u2019s account profile brings up a list of options. You can follow a child\u2019s location, which can be useful for safety purposes or for picking the child up from school. You can also approve or reject apps that a child is trying to download \u2014 so if you\u2019re reluctant about Snapchat or an addictive game like Boom Beach, simply block the apps. Parents can also get a weekly report to see how often a child is using a certain app, like a game, and choose to have a conversation with the child about using the software responsibly, or block the app temporarily.Parents can also use Family Link to create restrictions for how children browse the web. You can turn on a filter that blocks mature websites, though Google acknowledges the filter is imperfect and some offensive sites may get past it. For a more nitpicky approach, you can also require the child to get permission for each site visited, blocking the ones you disapprove of.Parents will probably love a feature called screen time, which can be used to set limits for how long a child can use a phone each day. For instance, you could give the child three hours of screen time on weekdays. You can also schedule regular bedtime hours that lock down the device at specific times \u2014 between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., for example. Before the device is about to be locked, the child gets a notification; when the screen locks down, the child will still be able to answer phone calls to talk to the parent or tap on an Emergency button to call the police.\u201cIt\u2019s not a set-it-and-forget-it thing where parents think, \u2018Oh, great, this is going to solve all my problems,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all still learning this technology, and life is very unpredictable.\u201dAll these neat parental controls start to come undone the day the child turns 13. At that point, Google gives the child the option to be free of the Family Link restrictions or stick with them \u2014 and I can\u2019t imagine any child choosing the latter.Saurabh Sharma, Google\u2019s product manager for Family Link, said the policy was designed this way because 13 is when people can register for Google accounts without parental consent. That complies with a federal regulation in the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which forbids companies from collecting data from children under 13 without a parent\u2019s approval.Yet I would argue that Google should design a policy with parents\u2019 best interests in mind. It could let the parent decide when the child has demonstrated safe, responsible smartphone use and graduate from all restrictions. That might happen when the child turns 13, 15 or even 17. But the children should not be allowed to strip away settings just because they turn 13.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand why a parent would give a kid a phone and then turn off all the features through the app and then grant them all the features once they turn 13,\u201d said Ms. Knorr of Common Sense Media. She said the age of 13 was related purely to the federal regulation, not safety or childhood development guidelines.Google\u2019s Mr. Sharma said Family Link was still in testing and the company was continuing to collect feedback from parents on issues including the age policy.\u201cThis is a tricky subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to figure out what works for every family.\u201dIf you agree that your child should get unrestricted access to a smartphone at the age of 13, Family Link is an excellent product. But how can parents ever predict that?Ms. Weinberger, the internet safety expert, said she had heard stories from parents and children about a 9-year-old addicted to pornography, a fourth grader being \u201csextorted\u201d by a 13-year-old, and child predators stalking minors through social networking apps. In other words, any child is subject to danger, no matter how old.She called Family Link \u201cdepressing\u201d because of the age policy.\u201cWe want our kids to have some access and we want to be able to decide,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need for Google in particular to be the leader on this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Wins Tax Case in France, Avoiding $1.3 Billion Bill", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle emerged on Wednesday as the victor in its latest legal battle in Europe, after a French court said the technology behemoth did not have to pay $1.3 billion in back taxes.At issue was whether Google had avoided taxes in France by routing sales in the country through an Irish-based subsidiary over a five-year period ending in 2010. An administrative court in Paris ruled that the Irish unit was not taxable in France.Google has faced a series of legal challenges across Europe, with many of them focused on the company\u2019s tax and competitive practices.Google employs 700 people in France through its subsidiary there, but the company used a division based in Ireland to sell French customers digital services like its well-known advertising platform AdWords, according to court filings. The case hinged on whether Google owed various taxes in France, even though it sold services from Ireland.French tax authorities argued that Google\u2019s French employees were instrumental in selling the ad space, even if the contracts were made with the Irish subsidiary.In its rulings on Wednesday, the court agreed with Google. It found that the Irish unit did not have a \u201cstable\u201d presence in France, meaning that the French tax authorities could not collect corporate income and withholding taxes from it. The court also decided that other taxes, including a value-added tax, did not apply.The office of the French budget minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, said in a statement that the country\u2019s tax authorities planned to appeal the court\u2019s decision, \u201cgiven the important stakes in these cases, and, more broadly, the issue of fair taxation, in France, of profits derived from the digital economy.\u201dGoogle said in a statement that the rulings confirmed that it \u201cabides by French tax law and international standards.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain committed to France and the growth of its digital economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Reddit, Intimate Glimpses of Addicts in Thrall to Opioids", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery day, thousands of people who are consumed by the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic connect on the popular discussion website Reddit.They swap advice on getting high and offer encouragement to those who have managed to stay clean or are teetering between recovery and relapse. Addicts lament the deaths of fellow users who have suddenly stopped posting. And until last week, buyers and sellers could easily find each other, relying on coded messages that communicated their intent.Reddit banned the forum, known as opiaterollcall, last week but would not disclose what led to its closing. Another forum to buy opiates quickly sprang up to replace it; Reddit banned that one, too.They were just small parts of one of the world\u2019s largest online communities. But the dispatches left behind tell a surprisingly intimate story about the tenacity of the crisis, the trajectory of the addicted and Reddit\u2019s role in facilitating access to drugs tied to the mounting toll across America.Among the victims was Rachel Frazier, a former nurse and mother of a young son, now 3. Last June, she offered advice about medicine for withdrawals on a Reddit opiate support group that is simply called \u201copiates.\u201d In September, she posted three times on the now-banned drug-buying forum opiaterollcall. She had recently moved to Mansfield, Ohio, from Texas with her husband, Jason.\u201cJust moved to 419,\u201d she wrote on Sept. 3, referring to her area code. Signaling that she wanted drugs, she wrote, \u201cLooking for friends.\u201dTwo weeks later, her husband found her dead in their living room, slumped over an ottoman with an unopened can of Diet Coke nearby. Relatives said a medical examiner determined that Ms. Frazier, 35, had overdosed on heroin and carfentanyl.Her death was memorialized on Reddit by someone with the user name UhhImJef, who wrote about having spoken to Ms. Frazier just the day before. \u201cWe lost another,\u201d the post read. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss you sweets.\u201dLike others on the Reddit forums, Ms. Frazier had a longstanding addiction, her family said in interviews, and she procured painkillers in a variety of ways, not just online. The relatives said it was not clear when she switched to heroin, who provided the lethal dose, or if she got the drugs that killed her by way of Reddit.On the public internet, drug buyers have been able to use sites over the years including Craigslist and Topix, forums on Google Groups and, more recently, mobile apps like Snapchat, Instagram and other social media platforms.In a statement, a Reddit representative said that using the site \u201cas a marketplace for illegal goods and services will get users and communities banned from Reddit.\u201dThe company said it evaluates violations of its user agreement case by case, but did not explain why the opiate-buying forum had escaped detection from Reddit and law enforcement for at least four years. Reddit also hosts similar groups involving ecstasy and cocaine that have not been banned.\u201cGiven the volume of internet activity and the many ways to communicate online, it is obviously difficult to police everything, given limited resources,\u201d Rusty Payne, a spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, wrote in an email. \u201cFor DEA, this means going after the biggest fish.\u201dEven with tougher policing, online selling can be very resilient.\u201cWhen you shut it down, it will pop back up and it will have evolved into something new,\u201d said Dan Palumbo, research director of Digital Citizens Alliance, an organization dedicated to internet safety issues. \u201cIt will be more efficient, more effective and it will probably be harder to track.\u201dReddit hosts more than a million groups it calls subreddits, which are organized around a broad range of topics \u2014 bicycling, books, frugality, health, music, politics, \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d The site is a staunch defender of free speech, but administrators have sometimes banned forums that become controversial.A group called \u201cjailbait\u201d \u2014 it contained provocative images of teenagers \u2014 led to a ban of \u201csuggestive or sexual content featuring minors\u201d in 2011. The company also shut down a group called \u201cbeatingwomen,\u201d which glorified violence against women. Last year Reddit banned two so-called alt-right subreddits for repeatedly posting personal information that could lead to harassment. It took no action, though, against a subreddit organized around gun sales, which drew scrutiny after a 2014 Mother Jones article suggested that some arms dealers sought to exploit a federal background check loophole.The opiate-buying forum that Reddit shut down last week offered a state-by-state directory where people could post their area code to show where they wanted to make a deal. Details of where and when to meet up were worked out in private messages, phone calls or texts.Several people who use the forum said it felt safer to them than buying drugs on the street in rough parts of town.Reddit\u2019s mostly anonymous users, called redditors, could vouch for people they met buying or selling drugs online. They typically posted ratings, with plus signs, stars and endorsements like \u201cbest friend\u201d or \u201cgreat friend.\u201dUsers were warned not to post information that violates Reddit rules against sourcing illicit substances. But the \u201copiaterollcall\u201d forum highlighted the ease of finding pain pills, heroin and sometimes fentanyl, the especially deadly drug that has accounted for a nationwide escalation in overdoses.In messages to The New York Times, someone with the user name DopeAmene acknowledged assisting Ms. Frazier in getting opiates soon after she moved to Ohio. The user described serving \u2014 for her and others \u2014 as a broker.\u201cI took them to the person who did sell them,\u201d DopeAmene wrote in a private message on Reddit. \u201cAnd usually I would get some opiates for taking them.\u201dTracey Helton Mitchell, a volunteer moderator of the \u201copiates\u201d discussion group, doesn\u2019t sugarcoat what\u2019s going on: People talk about drug use in Reddit forums. And members of her group die every month, she says.By Reddit standards, the forums are tiny \u2014 about 13,000 unique users posted on the buying and selling group over the past four years, some of them overlapping with the nearly 38,000 subscribers to the forum Ms. Helton Mitchell moderates. She distances herself from the drug-buying forum. Her group \u2014 which shares stories about scoring drugs and getting high, and discusses struggles with relapse, recovery and family \u2014 can save lives, she said in an interview.\u201cSome people might see it as a dysfunctional one, but it\u2019s a support group,\u201d said Ms. Helton Mitchell, a former heroin addict. \u201cPeople can\u2019t get clean when they are dead.\u201dOn the forum, she and others try to dispel myths, like the one suggesting that injecting someone with cocaine or speed after an overdose could save them. They offer warnings, such as a recent one saying that a batch of cocaine in the San Francisco area had been cut with fentanyl. Sometimes they send each other clean needles, or naloxone, the drug that can revive someone after overdosing.Ms. Helton Mitchell, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, says she has sent out more than 500 packages of naloxone, sold under the brand name Narcan among others, and kept a tally of lives that have been saved \u2014 at least 238.One of the packages went to a Reddit user calling herself jelllly, who wrote a tribute to Ms. Helton Mitchell two years ago. She \u201chas done it again,\u201d it said. \u201cSent me Narcan in the mail a couple months ago and I had to use it tonight. Along with breathing exercises, I revived a very close friend. So here\u2019s to you, Tracey, God bless you!!!\u201dThe post was from Shana Greger, a Reddit regular from Pennsylvania. Her comments on various forums provide a snapshot of her interests: hockey, the Pittsburgh Penguins, TV shows she liked to binge watch in withdrawal (\u201cNurse Jackie,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cShameless,\u201d to name a few).Ms. Greger\u2019s father discovered she was part of the \u201copiates\u201d and \u201copiaterollcall\u201d groups a few days after she overdosed last summer in State College, Pa. He had been searching online for some of her poetry, hoping to gather it up to publish. He found one poem on Reddit, and then her other posts.Ms. Greger, 25, began stealing her mother\u2019s pain pills as a teenager. Later, while working in coffee shops, managing a sandwich shop and advising her friends on the best new bands, she became consumed by addiction, according to her father.The day after she was released from rehab last May, she congratulated another user in the opiates support group for 30 days of sobriety.\u201cnice! good to see you\u2019re doing well,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m 16 days clean from everything. ... I was in detox for 3 days and i feel fine. feels good to not have to take something every day.\u201dEleven days later she commented about her life as a barista. She posted four times on the forum the next day. She died the day after.Her father shared the news on the \u201copiates\u201d group. While it had given her many friends and people to talk to, he wrote, he said he also believed they had helped his daughter find drugs. Some members objected; others told him about the drug-buying \u201croll call\u201d forum.Ms. Greger had posted there about 30 times in the six months before she died, looking for drugs and vouching for sellers in four states.The police in State College tried to find out who sold her the heroin and fentanyl that killed her, but were not successful. It is not clear if she connected with the supplier through Reddit.Mr. Greger says it doesn\u2019t really matter how his daughter got the drugs. Initially shocked at the ease of acquiring them through Reddit, he now doesn\u2019t think shutting down forums will make much of a difference.\u201cThey will just move someplace else,\u201d he said.An article on Friday about communities of drug users on the online forum Reddit misstated the year the website banned a section containing provocative images of teenagers. It was banned in 2011, not \u201cabout two years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Roomba May Be Mapping Your Home, Collecting Data That Could Be Shared", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Roomba may be vacuuming up more than you think.High-end models of Roomba, iRobot\u2019s robotic vacuum, collect data as they clean, identifying the locations of your walls and furniture. This helps them avoid crashing into your couch, but it also creates a map of your home that iRobot could share with Amazon, Apple or Google.The confusion underscored that the frontier of smart home data and privacy can be a sensitive one. In the hands of a company like Amazon, Apple or Google, that data could fuel the growing product category of digital home assistants.\u201cWhen we think about \u2018what is supposed to happen\u2019 when I enter a room, everything depends on the room at a foundational level knowing what is in it,\u201d an iRobot spokesman said in a written response to questions. \u201cIn order to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 when you say \u2018turn on the lights,\u2019 the room must know what lights it has to turn on. Same thing for music, TV, heat, blinds, the stove, coffee machines, fans, gaming consoles, smart picture frames or robot pets.\u201dBut the data, if shared, could also be a windfall for marketers, and the implications are easy to imagine. No armchair in your living room? You might see ads for armchairs next time you open Facebook. Did your Roomba detect signs of a baby? Advertisers might target you accordingly.Jamie Lee Williams, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said information about the size of a home and the amount of furniture in it could allow advertisers to deduce the owner\u2019s income level. Eventually, it might even be possible to identify the brands the owner uses.\u201cEspecially combined with other data, this is going to be able to reveal a ton of information about what people\u2019s lifestyles are like, what people\u2019s daily patterns are like,\u201d Ms. Williams said.Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said that if iRobot did share the data, it would raise a variety of legal questions.What happens if a Roomba user consents to the data collection and later sells his or her home \u2014 especially furnished \u2014 and now the buyers of the data have a map of a home that belongs to someone who didn\u2019t consent, Mr. Gidari asked. How long is the data kept? If the house burns down, can the insurance company obtain the data and use it to identify possible causes? Can the police use it after a robbery?Some who reacted online on Monday and Tuesday were alarmed.\u201cYour friendly little Roomba could soon become a creepy little spy that sells maps of your house to advertisers,\u201d tweeted OpenMedia, a Canadian nonprofit.In its written response, iRobot said that it was \u201ccommitted to the absolute privacy of our customer-related data.\u201d Consumers can use a Roomba without connecting it to the internet, or \u201copt out of sending map data to the cloud through a switch in the mobile app.\u201d\u201cNo data is sold to third parties,\u201d the statement added. \u201cNo data will be shared with third parties without the informed consent of our customers.\u201d\u201cInformed consent,\u201d of course, can be a vaguely defined term; Ms. Williams and Mr. Gidari noted that it might simply involve a privacy policy that few consumers read. But this criticism is \u201creally applicable across the board to everybody\u2019s privacy policy,\u201d Mr. Gidari said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to criticize one without criticizing all.\u201dMr. Gidari added that in today\u2019s technological climate, iRobot\u2019s plans were unsurprising. \u201cIt kind of goes with the mantra that everything that can be connected will be connected,\u201d he said, and a corollary \u201cis that all the data that can be collected will be collected.\u201dBut in the long term, what iRobot does with individual users\u2019 data may not be the most important question. The third-party collection and dissemination of information about the inside of homes could have implications for the privacy laws that constrain the government and law enforcement.The Supreme Court has held that Americans have \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy in your home,\u201d Mr. Gidari said. \u201cOnce your home is turned inside out, does that reasonable expectation of privacy dissipate?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated iRobot\u2019s plans, based on a Reuters report that was later corrected. The company said it might share mapping data with customers\u2019 consent, not sell it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Soccer Power Broker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Charlie Stillitano wanted to make sure I saw the traditional exchange of gifts between Barcelona and Juventus at halftime during their match at MetLife Stadium here last Saturday, so we left his suite and walked into one nearby. Inside, board members of the two famed European clubs shook hands, exchanged trinkets and smiled for photographs.\u201cIt comes from European protocol,\u201d Stillitano said as a way of explaining the elegantly awkward moment, a fixture of matches between top European clubs rarely replicated in American sports.The real stars of the show, though, were the soccer legends mingling nearby. Pavel Nedved, the Czech star who once ran the Juventus midfield, posed with a signed jersey. Paolo Maldini, Italy\u2019s greatest defender, and Andrea Pirlo, a World Cup winner in 2006, exchanged small talk. The former Netherlands midfielder Edgar Davids walked into the suite halfway through the exchange of gifts, clad in his trademark goggle sunglasses, and made a beeline for the buffet.In the middle of all of these beautiful people, smiling and laughing, glad-handing and posing, the master of his domain, was Stillitano. He alone knew everybody in the room. He was the one who had brought Barcelona and Juventus together for the match that night, and he is the one who will host a similar scene on Saturday, when Barcelona plays Real Madrid in Miami.Who is Charlie Stillitano? The salt-and-pepper-bearded and perpetually gregarious son of a New Jersey cookie factory worker, Stillitano, 57, might be the most powerful, most well-connected soccer power broker you\u2019ve never heard of.How connected? The former United States national team coach Bob Bradley, who has known Stillitano since they were teenagers, tells this story.Just before Christmas in 2015, after Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was fired from his second stint as the manager at the English club Chelsea, Bradley wanted to send him a note.\u201cAfter things went down at Chelsea for Jos\u00e9 I wanted to send him a message, because he sent me a great message after I was fired as national team coach,\u201d Bradley wrote in a text message. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I had his best contact number, so I messaged Charlie and asked him to send it on my behalf.\u201cOne minute later Charlie sent me a picture of the two of them. He was with Jos\u00e9.\u201dStillitano has no official role with any club, or any league. Instead, he makes his living in soccer as the chairman of Relevent Sports, the promoter that put on the Barcelona-Juventus match in East Rutherford and 11 others across the United States this summer. The tournament, collectively known as the International Champions Cup, and including a corresponding Asian version in China and Singapore, has quickly become the most high-profile summer exhibition tour in the world.The connections that Stillitano brings to the tournament, and that have made it a success, mean he is full of stories like Bradley\u2019s. So many of them, in fact, that he frequently interrupts the telling of one to begin another, making even a few hours with him a veritable matryoshka doll of Charlie stories.He will tell you about playing against Bradley in high school and alongside him at Princeton. He will introduce you to Martin O\u2019Connor, a lawyer whose clients include the former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and who has known Stillitano since they became fast friends as 13-year-olds.He will tell you all about dining with Ferguson \u2014 \u201cSir Alex says the best restaurant in NJ is Charlie\u2019s house,\u201d Bradley texted \u2014 or how he served as a ball boy at a 1973 friendly in Jersey City between Lazio and Santos, the Brazilian club then featuring Pel\u00e9. The stories have become so synonymous with Stillitano that if you Google the Santos friendly to check a fact, you\u2019ll find a number of the top results about the match are Stillitano\u2019s recalling it for other reporters.This is Stillitano the salesman, the marketer. A man who has remade his career selling European teams on the commercial promise of America, and American sports fans on the promise of top-level soccer. And it is temping to conclude that with his stories, Stillitano is selling you, too. But this isn\u2019t entirely true, because he has the track record to back him up.He will ask Pirlo to spend time with you, and Pirlo will dutifully comply, shifting his daughter onto his lap so you can ask him about the value of preseason friendlies. (\u201cIt\u2019s not important, the result, but the speed and for the young guys,\u201d he said.) In a different setting, he might introduce you to Ferguson, an irascible Scot who calls Stillitano \u201cgood people\u201d and \u201clovable\u201d in two of his books. The Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti wrote in his 2010 book about the time Stillitano brokered a meeting between him and the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in 2008, resulting in Ancelotti\u2019s hiring as the Blues\u2019 coach.He knows all of these men because, on behalf of some company or another, Stillitano has been persuading top European managers and the biggest European teams to spend their preseasons in the United States for the past 15 years.His first company, ChampionsWorld, was financed with a mortgage on his house and began with a single friendly, between Real Madrid and Roma in 2002, that surprised even Stillitano by drawing 70,000 fans. (That he began with an Italian club was not accidental; Stillitano is the son of an immigrant, and he eagerly and effortlessly shifted between English and Italian with his guests at the Juventus game.) The company put on matches for four years but filed for bankruptcy in 2005, owing creditors more than $2 million. Its biggest outstanding creditor was the United States Soccer Federation, to which ChampionsWorld had to pay sanctioning fees for each match it ran.ChampionsWorld sued, arguing that U.S. Soccer and Major League Soccer \u2014 which once employed Stillitano as the general manager of its New Jersey team, the MetroStars \u2014 had conspired to drive the company out of business. After a seven-year legal battle in which ChampionsWorld lost at both the Court of Arbitration for Sport and in federal court, the sides settled out of court.\u201cWhen I went bankrupt there were a lot of people kicking me when I was down,\u201d Stillitano said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a job as a dishwasher in soccer.\u201d He found refuge at Creative Artists Agency, just as it was making a large push into sports, and founded the World Football Challenge.Two important things happened with the World Football Challenge. Inter Milan and Chelsea won almost every possible trophy the season after participating in the 2009 edition, and the Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross saw a 2011 Chivas-Barcelona match in his new team\u2019s stadium in Miami. That proved a preseason United States tour was rigorous preparation for the season, and the Miami match, which drew a crowd of about 70,000, persuaded Ross to hire Stillitano and his partner, Jon Sheiman, away from C.A.A. to create what would become the International Champions Cup.\u201cAfter I had the team, I said: \u2018Hey, I have this empty stadium. How do I get into this?\u2019\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeople in this country want to see the stars, that\u2019s what they\u2019re mostly interested in, and seeing the great teams in the world. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll really pay for and go see.\u201dRoss\u2019s vision was to turn what was effectively a ticket-selling operation into one that sold the television rights to the matches globally and sealed large sponsorship agreements \u2014 a proposition that was, potentially, far more lucrative. After losing millions of dollars during its first four years, the I.C.C., Ross said, will turn a profit this year.The marquee matchup is between Barcelona and Real Madrid in Miami, the first time the rivals have played each other outside Spain in over 30 years. Unlike the other matches in the I.C.C. this year \u2014 all of them glamorous matchups like Barcelona-Juventus, or Real Madrid-Manchester United, or United-Manchester City \u2014 Barca-Real is being sold not so much as a game but as a dayslong festival. A \u201cSuper Bowl experience,\u201d in the words of one Relevent executive.When Barcelona defeated Juventus by 2-1 on Saturday night at MetLife Stadium, it did so in front of 82,104 fans and on the strength of two goals by Neymar, its star Brazilian forward. The largest soccer crowd in New Jersey history saw two teams play their first-choice starters for at least 45 minutes, and Juventus pressed hard for the tying goal until the final whistle.\u201cWe cringe when managers say it\u2019s just a training session,\u201d Stillitano said, one day after the new Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde dismissed the match \u2014 his first in charge at the club \u2014 as \u201cnot an official competition.\u201dMaldini, the former A.C. Milan and Italian national team defender who works as an I.C.C. ambassador, disagreed. \u201c82,000 fans?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a friendly. There is no friendly game at this level.\u201dThis is what Stillitano and Relevent Sports want American soccer fans to believe: that the I.C.C. is a serious endeavor and a fixture on the soccer calendar, not a glorified exhibition tournament or a brazen cash grab.\u201cI think it is incumbent to ensure that we keep improving the quality of the matchups themselves, and keep positioning the I.C.C. as really the big reveal,\u201d said Matt Higgins, the co-founder and chief executive of RSE Ventures, which owns Relevent Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time when everyone who has been thirsting for soccer to return gets a taste of the most important narratives.\u201dIt is up to Stillitano to book the actors, and to sell the narratives, but he has been in the game long enough to know that when you have all the biggest names in soccer in one place, the buzz takes care of itself. The most important narrative on Saturday was whether Paris Saint-Germain would succeed in an audacious bid to pry Neymar away from Barcelona. Martin Kallen, the chief executive of UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, joked that he was in town just to \u201csee which players are on the Barca roster.\u201dFor Stillitano, watching Neymar\u2019s Barcelona torment the Juventus back line, it didn\u2019t really matter how the Neymar drama ended, only that everybody was talking about him.After all, Paris Saint-Germain is playing in the International Champions Cup, too.This isn\u2019t the only professional soccer currently being played this summer in the United States, of course. Major League Soccer is in the middle of its regular season, and an important regional championship, the Gold Cup, just finished a three-week run.Soccer United Marketing, M.L.S.\u2019s marketing arm, owns the commercial rights to both of those properties, as well as various others, and that makes them direct competitors of Relevent for consumers who may not even be aware of that battle. Both sides say nice things about each other \u2014 the phrase \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d was used repeatedly in recent weeks by executives on either side \u2014 but in the end they are pushing two fundamentally different visions of soccer in America.Major League Soccer believes that the I.C.C. is a two-week sideshow and that it has the deeper relationship with American soccer fans. Relevent Sports counters that American fans want to see the highest level of the sport, and points to full stadiums for its matches as proof that it is right. While the pie of revenue in American soccer may be growing, it is hard to believe each company doesn\u2019t covet the chance to cut into the other\u2019s share.In the meantime, Stillitano is more concerned with decidedly first-world soccer problems. And sometimes appeasing billion-dollar clubs and making all of their leaders feel as if they\u2019re his favorite isn\u2019t as easy as it looks.To resolve the issue, Stillitano first went to the Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, and told him Relevent would build a pool for his team. But Zidane wasn\u2019t having any of it. So Stillitano went to his good friend Mourinho, the United manager, with the same offer.\u201cJos\u00e9 said, \u2018I trust you,\u2019\u201d said Stillitano, who admitted that he then faced the frightening reality that he had no idea how to build a pool, or even if U.C.L.A. would allow him to do it. (The university did, and the pool was built.)In many ways, the pool was symbolic; in the I.C.C.\u2019s fifth year, and in Stillitano\u2019s second decade of putting on friendlies, Relevent has logistics like that down to a science. But despite Ross\u2019s deep pockets, and despite Relevent\u2019s long-term deals with some teams, soccer remains a relationships business.And nobody has stronger relationships than Charlie Stillitano.Advertisement"}

SpaceX declined to comment.With the latest funding round, SpaceX joins an elite club of seven venture-backed companies valued at $20 billion or more around the world, according to research firm CB Insights. Investors have poured money into the companies, many of which operate capital intensive businesses such as Uber and Airbnb, even as smaller start-ups have gone public and have seen their valuations waver.Still, investors have long believed that a handful of companies have the potential to become globally dominant businesses. Five companies based in the United States that are valued at more than $20 billion \u2014 including Uber, Airbnb and WeWork \u2014 have upended established industries like transportation and real estate. Palantir, the analytics company that is in the $20 billion-plus valuation club, is vying to become a major government contractor, as is SpaceX.The two other closely held companies valued at more than $20 billion are in China \u2014 ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing and consumer electronics maker Xiaomi.\u201cIt means you can fly and refly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket,\u201d Mr. Musk said at the time.A capsule summary with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the founder of SpaceX.

{"Headline": "As a Guru, Ayn Rand May Have Limits. Ask Travis Kalanick.", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFew, if any, literary philosophers have had as much influence on American business and politics as Ayn Rand, especially now that Donald J. Trump occupies the White House.President Trump named Rand his favorite writer and \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d his favorite novel. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has cited \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d as a favorite work, and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, said the book \u201creally had an impact on me.\u201dAs Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, put it in a recent essay, \u201cher books pretty well capture the mind-set\u201d of the Trump administration. \u201cThis new administration hates weak, unproductive, socialist people and policies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand it admires strong, can-do profit makers.\u201dIn business, Rand\u2019s influence has been especially pronounced in Silicon Valley, where her overarching philosophy that \u201cman exists for his own sake, that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose, that he must not sacrifice himself to others, nor sacrifice others to himself,\u201d as she described it in a 1964 Playboy interview, has an obvious appeal for self-made entrepreneurs. Last year Vanity Fair anointed her the most influential figure in the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs.And then there\u2019s the scandal-engulfed Trump administration, where devotion to Rand\u2019s teaching has done little to advance the president\u2019s legislative agenda.Though people close to Mr. Kalanick told me this week that he has distanced himself from many of Rand\u2019s precepts while undergoing an intense period of personal reassessment, they all acknowledged that she\u2019d had a profound influence on his development. Few companies have been as closely identified with Rand\u2019s philosophy as Uber.Uber disrupted a complacent, highly regulated and often corrupt taxi industry on a global scale, an achievement Rand\u2019s heroes Howard Roark and Dagny Taggart would surely have admired. Many of her ideas were embedded in Uber\u2019s code of values. Mr. Kalanick used the original cover art for \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d as his Twitter avatar until 2013 (when he exchanged it for an image of Alexander Hamilton, and then, in May, for one of himself).\u201cRand\u2019s entrepreneur is the Promethean hero of capitalism,\u201d said Lawrence E. Cahoone, professor of philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross, whose lecture on Rand is part of his Great Courses series, \u201cThe Modern Political Tradition.\u201d \u201cBut she never really explores how a dynamic entrepreneur actually runs a business.\u201d\u201cShe was a script and fiction writer,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe was motivated by an intense hatred of communism, and she put those things together very effectively. She can be very inspirational, especially to entrepreneurs. But she was by no means an economist. I don\u2019t think her work can be used as a business manual.\u201dRepresentatives of Uber and Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.Rand\u2019s defenders insist that the problems for Mr. Kalanick and others influenced by Rand aren\u2019t that they embraced her philosophy, but rather that they didn\u2019t go far enough.Yaron Brook, executive chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute and a former finance professor at Santa Clara University, who teaches seminars on business leadership and ethics from an Objectivist perspective, said, \u201cFew business people have actually read her essays and philosophy and studied her in depth.\u201d Mr. Brook said that while Mr. Kalanick \u201cwas obviously talented and energetic and a visionary, he took superficial inspiration from her ideas and used her philosophy to justify his obnoxiousness.\u201dHe emphasized that Rand would never have tolerated sexual harassment or any kind of mistreatment of employees. Rand \u201chad enormous respect for people who worked hard and did a good job, whether a secretary or a railroad worker,\u201d he said. \u201cHer heroes ran businesses with employees who were very loyal because they were treated fairly. Of course, some people had to be fired. But she makes a big deal out of the virtue of justice, which applies in business as well as politics.\u201dAnd even though \u201cshe\u2019d celebrate what Travis did with the taxi industry, showing the world how all those regulations made no sense, she also believed there are rules of justice that do make sense and she supported,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just run over all the regulations you don\u2019t happen to like.\u201dMr. Brook complained that Rand\u2019s critics are quick to point to her followers\u2019 failures, but rarely mention their successes. He cited the example of John A. Allison IV, the much-admired former head of BB&T Corporation, a regional bank in the Southeast that he built into one of the nation\u2019s largest before he stepped down in 2008. Mr. Allison handed out copies of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d to senior executives and is a major donor to the Ayn Rand Institute. He incorporated many of Rand\u2019s teachings into his 2014 book, \u201cThe Leadership Crisis and the Free Market Cure.\u201d\u201cJohn is a gentleman and he actually studied Rand\u2019s works in depth,\u201d Mr. Brook said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be more different from Travis.\u201dMr. Allison has called for abolishing the Federal Reserve, while acknowledging that so drastic a step is unlikely. He has met with Mr. Trump at the White House and has been widely mentioned as a potential successor to Janet L. Yellen as Fed chief.Despite Rand\u2019s pervasive influence and continuing popularity on college campuses, relatively few people embrace her version of extreme libertarianism. Former President Barack Obama, in a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, criticized her \u201cnarrow vision\u201d and described her work \u201cas one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we\u2019d pick up.\u201dShe\u2019s also dismissed by most serious academics. \u201cMention Ayn Rand to a group of academic philosophers and you\u2019ll get laughed out of the room,\u201d Mr. Cahoone said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s something to be said for Rand. She takes Nietzschean individualism to an extreme, but she\u2019s undeniably inspirational.\u201dAs the mysterious character John Galt proclaims near the end of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d: \u201cDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it\u2019s yours.\u201dBut Rand has little to say about making the transition from this kind of heroic entrepreneurial vision to a mature corporation with many stakeholders, a problem many company founders have confronted and struggled with, whether or not they\u2019ve read or been influenced by her. \u201cShe never really had to manage anything,\u201d Mr. Cahoone said. \u201cShe was surrounded by people who saw her as a cult figure. She didn\u2019t have employees, she had worshipers.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Kalanick is said to have turned this summer from Rand to what is considered one of the greatest dramatic works in the English language, Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry V\u201d \u2014 a play in which the young, reckless and wayward Prince Hal matures into one of England\u2019s most revered and beloved monarchs.An earlier version of this column misstated Andrew F. Puzder\u2019s association with CKE Restaurants. He is a former chief executive of the company, not its current chief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It O.K. to Protest Trump by Withholding Taxes?", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI am increasingly distressed by many of the things that the Trump administration is, and is not, doing. The president himself has declared that not paying taxes \u2018\u2018makes him smart,\u2019\u2019 and I do not trust that my federal tax dollars will be put to good use. I want to resist the president, his cronies and their destructive agenda(s) any way I can.Exceptions arise when the law that we are considering breaking is not just unwise but seriously immoral. Jim Crow laws (in flagrant violation of the post-Civil War constitutional guarantees) denied African-Americans the 14th Amendment\u2019s promise of \u2018\u2018equal protection of the laws.\u2019\u2019 Any citizen who cared to violate them was, I believe, morally free to do so. Indeed, decent citizens would have felt morally obliged to break them, where obeying them involved harm to others. And they would have been free as well to try to avoid the penalties for doing so.There are also cases in which you may violate laws that are reasonable in order to draw attention to political wrongs, as when civil protesters trespass or ignore regulations on peaceable assembly. When the point of doing so is to express your moral ideas, you have to do so in plain sight, which means you must face the legal consequences. (And you should take care not to undermine the public good, especially by causing harm to others, including the police, when you do so.) This is the classic kind of civil disobedience. The two kinds of exceptions came together during the civil rights era, when Jim Crow laws were defied in public ways. Rosa Parks didn\u2019t merely accept the risk of being caught in the white section of the Montgomery bus; being caught was the point.Your talk of redirecting your taxes is something of a red herring. When you overpay your state taxes, the state sends you a refund. There are legal ways of reducing your federal tax burden \u2014 by giving more to charity, say \u2014 but only within set limits. What you are proposing, though, is not legal tax avoidance but illegal tax evasion, which you are hoping to get away with. That means your aim is not the public, expressive one of civil disobedience.If you aren\u2019t sending a message, what are you trying to achieve? Nothing practical, surely: When it comes to the federal budget, your individual tax payment isn\u2019t even a rounding error. Perhaps, then, you want to reduce your complicity in what is going on. I am on record as thinking that these clean-hands arguments are usually exercises in moral narcissism. In any case, your taxes go to large numbers of things that you probably favor. Today nearly two-thirds of the federal budget covers so-called mandatory spending: Medicare and other health expenditures, Social Security payments, unemployment benefits, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. If secretly reducing your tax payments prevented you from being complicit with expenditures you dislike, it would also make you complicit in trying to reduce expenditures you do like.When the president\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, called for \u2018\u2018deconstruction of the administrative state,\u2019\u2019 the idea was a government that collects less, spends less and does less. Against that background, withholding your taxes to protest Trump is like burning down your house to protest arson. Perhaps you disapprove of the way the E.P.A. has been hobbled by its Trump-appointed chief. Then take note: The E.P.A.\u2019s budget this year is around $8 billion; the head of the agency gets a salary of around $170,000. Administration is costly; deconstruction is cheap. When you consider curtailing your federal payment, consider all the forms of federal spending that the White House would like to curtail.One great virtue of a decent society is that you don\u2019t have to think about politics all the time. But surely the right thing to do when you believe the government is behaving badly is to become politically engaged. If you want to spend money on something, spend it on supporting the causes you believe in. Argue for them with your fellow citizens; get involved in political campaigns. That\u2019s something you can do because we\u2019re a democratic republic. You say you\u2019re willing to resist in any way you can. Why not pursue these public, constitutionally protected forms of resistance and make the most of this precious political inheritance? If, as you believe, we are headed in the wrong direction, it will take the active work of well-intentioned citizens to help us find the right one.My dad married briefly in the late 1980s, for the third time, to a woman who gave birth to a baby. It was a little boy \u2014 I held him once, when I was 16, just before the marriage broke up. After the woman left him, my dad insisted that she had been unfaithful and that the child was not his. He even terminated his parental rights so he would not have to pay child support.I put it out of my mind, until I became a parent myself. Then I began to Google the child\u2019s name to see if I could find out anything about him. I learned that he had gone to prison for killing a friend in a drunken rage.Whether you should tell your father about any of this is another issue. I understand that you want to make your moral views known. But unless you think there\u2019s some good that can come from it, I\u2019d be inclined to leave him alone. Courts do not easily approve the voluntary termination of parental rights, especially without the consent of both parents. You know little about this brief marriage. What the woman herself wanted and what your father had reason to believe at the time (regardless of what has emerged since) are both pertinent to how his actions should be assessed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Improve U.S. Health Care", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Nevertheless, he fails to offer any solution himself. What we get instead is a paean to health savings accounts. Nowhere does Mr. Stephens say how H.S.A.s would control medical pricing, probably because there is no causal link between the two. What could affect pricing would be direct negotiations with providers and price-setting by the federal government as we see in Medicare. But, of course, policies like those would require regulation of the health care industry that Republicans consider anathema.To the Editor:Bret Stephens should have tested his faith in the power of health savings accounts by something more than cherry-picking examples of price disparities for a few tests. As someone with more than three decades of experience with health data, I tried to help a close friend shop for heart valve surgery in New York City. The state has arguably the best data anywhere on individual surgeons, but it was unfindable through a Google search and, when located (I knew how), presented information that was three years old.For all but a very small part of the money we spend on health care, the \u201csmart individual shoppers will slash costs\u201d approach remains a fantasy that conservative intellectuals refuse to let real-world experience dispel.The writer is president of Health Quality Advisors.To the Editor:I commend Bret Stephens for pointing out the inconvenient truth that both Obamacare and Trumpcare suffer from an insurmountable problem: For-profit health care is a contradiction in terms. Insurance companies are most concerned about profitability, and profits are derived from high co-payments and premiums, discrimination against those with pre-existing conditions, expensive prescription medications (often with adverse side effects), excessive high-tech screening and surgical solutions. These approaches are not affordable for many people and may not produce good health, which frequently depends more on healthy diet and lifestyle choices, which are not profitable.Why is the United States the only industrialized country without a single-payer health care system? Perhaps the insurance and pharmaceutical company lobbyists have the answer.To the Editor:Bret Stephens is right to point to the importance of medical cost control, but his suggestion that the Obamacare exchanges are fundamentally unworkable is nonsense. In essence, all Obamacare attempted to do was bring the benefits of group insurance, which covers most working-age Americans, to those without employer-sponsored coverage. Thus the core concept had substantial precedent and was perfectly sound.STEVE LEOVY, BOULDER, COLO.To the Editor:Paul Krugman rightly laments the gratuitous cruelty of Republicans in their proposed health bill. It didn\u2019t used to be this way.In 1935 in the House of Representatives, 284 Democrats and 81 Republicans voted to pass the Social Security law; 15 Democrats and 15 Republicans voted against.In the Senate, 60 Democrats and 16 Republicans voted in favor; one Democrat and five Republicans voted nay.After the House vote on the bill, The New York Times editorialized that \u201cthe Republicans, who were its chief critics during the debate, wound up by voting for it\u201d overwhelmingly. That was before a \u201cmorally indefensible agenda,\u201d in Mr. Krugman\u2019s words, became the name of their game.The writer is a professor of humanities at Williams College.To the Editor:Paul Krugman attempts, as so many others have, to explain the brutal and inhuman cruelty of opposition to Obamacare by some fellow Americans. We can reduce the difference between the major parties to bumper-sticker length. For Democrats: \u201cHelp Others.\u201d For Republicans: \u201cHelp Yourself.\u201d The difference of a single word can explain a divided nation.HOWARD SCHAIN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Rewrite Medicare, Medicaid and our employer health care plans to mandate capitation (a fixed fee per patient) with health care providers. This gives providers more skin in the game vis-\u00e0-vis overall cost. Give foreign drug companies, vaccine manufacturers and device makers easier access to our markets, and have the government negotiate with them directly \u2014 accepting only prices that are no higher in the United States than in other G-20 countries. Make high-deductible plans with health savings accounts the standard across the board, even if government has to partially fund these accounts to give all health care recipients a stake in the use of medical resources. Democrats and Republicans should either go big or go home.RACHEL BRONHEIM, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Ross Douthat nicely summarizes the difficulties both parties faced in attempting unilaterally to solve our national health care problems. And while I am no fan of our new president, he should recognize that he now has a chance to do something positive by forcing a bipartisan approach.First, a family member must explain to him that both the House and Senate Republican health care bills fail to meet his own requirement of containing a \u201cheart.\u201d Second, he should announce that he will sign only a health bill that has strong bipartisan support. President Trump has a chance to demonstrate his alleged skill in the \u201cart of the deal\u201d by helping to solve a real national problem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Urban China, Cash Is Rapidly Becoming Obsolete", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 There is an audacious economic phenomenon happening in China.It has nothing to do with debt, infrastructure spending or the other major economic topics du jour. It has to do with cash \u2014 specifically, how China is systematically and rapidly doing away with paper money and coins.Almost everyone in major Chinese cities is using a smartphone to pay for just about everything. At restaurants, a waiter will ask if you want to use WeChat or Alipay \u2014 the two smartphone payment options \u2014 before bringing up cash as a third, remote possibility.Just as startling is how quickly the transition has happened. Only three years ago there would be no question at all, because everyone was still using cash.\u201cFrom a tech standpoint, this is probably one of the single most important innovations that has happened first in China, and at the moment it\u2019s only in China,\u201d said Richard Lim, managing director of venture capital firm GSR Ventures.Even so, the attendant cultural shift was graspable only in person. I recently moved to Shanghai and felt the change with cash acutely because my first few weeks in the metropolis of more than 20 million were spent cut out of the system. Because of an issue with my bank, I couldn\u2019t immediately link my account to WeChat, which has become a virtual wallet for so many.That meant I had to navigate China the way I would have three years ago: with a stack of red 100-renminbi notes.At coffee shops and restaurants, I held up lines as I fumbled out my wallet and peeled off the bills to give the cashier. If I was hungry I had to go outside and find a restaurant, while bowls of noodles, groceries and coffee materialized at our office, ordered by my colleagues and paid for on the phone. If I had to get somewhere, I couldn\u2019t use my phone to unlock one of the ubiquitous bicycles that are a part of China\u2019s bike-sharing craze.Even the buskers were apparently ahead of me. Enterprising musicians playing on the streets of a number of Chinese cities have put up boards with QR codes so that passers-by can simply transfer them tips directly.\u201cIt has become the default way of life now,\u201d said Shiv Putcha,\u00a0an analyst with the research firm IDC. \u201cLiterally every business and brand in China is plugged into this ecosystem.\u201dSome Scandinavian countries have also weaned themselves from cash but still use cards frequently. In China, the change has been to phones.\u00a0One friend didn\u2019t realize how reliant she had become on mobile payments until her bank called her. She had left her A.T.M. card in the machine three weeks earlier and had not noticed its absence.In practical terms, this means Tencent and Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, the two Chinese internet companies that run WeChat and Alipay, respectively, are sitting atop a gold mine of staggering proportions. Both companies can make money off the transactions, charge other companies to use their payment platforms and all the while collect the payments data to be used in everything from new credit systems to advertising.Mr. Lim said that according to recent data, Ant Financial and Tencent were set to surpass credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in total global\u00a0transactions per day in the coming year. The key is that both companies are able to provide payments on the cheap,\u00a0partly\u00a0by allowing smaller vendors to make use of a simple printout of a QR code or their phone, instead of an expensive card reader. A back-end system that stores\u00a0a record of user accounts, instead of having to communicate with a bank, also keeps costs down.While Tencent does not break out what it makes from mobile payments, in the fourth quarter of 2016 the \u201cother services\u201d item in its earnings almost tripled from a year earlier to 6.4 billion renminbi, or $940 million, driven largely by mobile payments.There are some potential future problems with China\u2019s sweeping embrace of online payments. As the country builds its entire consumer economy around two private smartphone payment platforms, it is slowly locking out people unable to get onto those networks, and locking itself into those companies.At the simplest level, that makes life difficult for tourists and business travelers who are unlikely to open a bank account in China and so will find it hard to turn their phones into wallets.More broadly, it means things could get harder for foreign and local businesses alike. Foreign companies hoping to sell to Chinese consumers now must deal with Alibaba and Tencent or risk being unable to take payments. Likewise, Chinese companies reliant on Alibaba and Tencent have to build out separate structures to deal with the world of Facebook, Google and credit cards that still dominate elsewhere.There is a corollary for what could happen here. In Japan in the early 2000s, flip phones could do everything from stream cable TV to pay at stores. But because the phones were so advanced, Japan was slow to adopt smartphones, and it went from tech giant to tech laggard in 15 years.No doubt aware of this, Alibaba and Tencent are pushing to expand beyond China to ensure their newest innovation doesn\u2019t go the way of the dinosaurs. Still, competition is most likely looming.\u201cThe million-dollar question is: Will Western firms decide to build a system and compete?\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cThe answer is probably yes.\u201dUntil then, new arrivals like me have to deal with being locked out of China\u2019s online payments infrastructure.Earlier this month, though, I lucked out using cash. As I was trying to get a pile of stuff from Ikea back to my new apartment, a cabdriver looked skeptically at the huge rolled-up mattress pad I was planning to load into the back of his car.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take you,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI can only take cash.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I have,\u201d I said to my fellow Luddite, who grumpily agreed to ferry me home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Inequality Erodes the Foundation of Modern Societies", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionThe greatest threat to Western liberal democracies in the future is more likely to come from extreme inequality than from Islamic extremism. This is because inequality erodes two foundation stones of modern society \u2014 openness to new ideas and opportunities, and a conviction that all citizens are morally equal.For the first three decades after World War II, openness and equality constituted a virtuous circle. Openness generated unprecedented levels of prosperity. That prosperity allowed America and the citizens of other modern nations to invest in excellent schools and universities, basic research, modern infrastructure and social insurance. These investments, in turn, made it easier for people to adapt to change, and fostered ever greater equalities of income and opportunity. The result was a high level of trust in the fairness of the political and economic system.But by the 1980s, the virtuous circle had stopped working. Economic and technological dynamism was upending jobs, convulsing communities and splintering families. At the same time, inequalities of earnings, wealth and job security were widening. After the financial crisis of 2008, many Americans, along with the citizens of other nations affected by the crisis, began to doubt the fairness of the system. Some came to feel neglected, disadvantaged, powerless or otherwise left behind. Within the decade they became easy fodder for demagogues who rejected openness and blamed \u201cothers\u201d \u2014 immigrants, foreign manufacturers, the news media, racial or ethnic or religious minorities \u2014 for what had happened to them.Enter Donald Trump, who promised to \u201cmake America great again\u201d by erecting walls, slowing immigration, withdrawing from free-trade agreements, cutting science budgets, attacking the free press and retreating from security alliances the United States has maintained since 1945. Meanwhile, Britain has pulled out of Europe. Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front, has been mounting a challenge to the French establishment. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and others of his ilk are emulating closed-society dictatorships. The result is likely to be less prosperity and widening inequality. The old virtuous circle is in danger of becoming a new vicious cycle.Two important new books offer useful and complementary explanations for what has occurred and, by implication, what must be done. In \u201cThe Fate of the West,\u201d Bill Emmott argues that the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath resulted from \u201ca devastating blend of complacency, negligence and corruption\u201d in the years leading up to it. The banks that created the calamity got bailed out and no top executive went to jail, but millions of people lost their jobs, savings and homes. Nearly a decade later, many citizens in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and elsewhere still feel trapped in dead-end jobs or don\u2019t have jobs at all. The result has been a profound loss of confidence in the system.Emmott, who was editor in chief of The Economist from 1993 to 2006, faults economic and political elites who chose to advance themselves at the expense of the larger society. He points to a paradox deep within modern capitalism: The same financial incentives that spur innovation and investment can also lead the captains of industry and finance to manipulate the rules of the game for their own benefit, and thereby harm those without power. These moneyed elites \u201care the true sources of the sense of inequality that is currently threatening the openness that has enabled us in the West to flourish,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey are the explanation for Trump, for Brexit, for Le Pen.\u201dEmmott argues that the financial interests of banks and big companies have distorted and disarmed public policy. Both of America\u2019s political parties are culpable. \u201cMost notorious, in the U.S. at least, was the successful lobbying in 1998 by Wall Street of the treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, and his deputy, Larry Summers, to block regulation of the trading of complex derivatives products which had been proposed by the then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brooksley Born.\u201d Emmott also criticizes big companies like Google, which have the lobbying and financial heft to get whatever they want in Washington. Campaign finance scandals have likewise revealed the political influence of money in Germany, Japan, France, Britain and elsewhere.The greatest source of unfairness stemming from the 2008 crash, according to Emmott, was the political and civic inequality it revealed. He believes that to preserve an open society we really do need, as Trump has said, to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Getting big money out of politics would enable us, for example, to combat the rigidities and high prices of monopolies through strong antitrust enforcement, and to remove the exorbitant privileges that allow big banks to make profits at the expense of the rest of society. But to do this we will need a new, or at least restored, vision of equality, based not on redistribution or socialism but on equality of voice and rights, so citizens can demand such reforms.Emmott sees political and civic equality as the means to an open society. But why shouldn\u2019t such equality be an end in itself? In \u201cOne Another\u2019s Equals: The Basis of Human Equality,\u201d Jeremy Waldron, a professor of philosophy at New York University School of Law, argues that Western thought has been rooted in the moral imperative that people be treated and respected as equals, whatever disparities may exist between them in wealth or talent. Waldron sees moral equality between human beings as what\u2019s left over when \u201cmerit\u201d is set aside. People deserve equal concern and respect because they are humans. Differences in wealth and power are consistent with this imperative if those differences serve the interests of all. Thus the answer to whose good is to be promoted in our social arrangements is \u2014 everyone\u2019s good.Waldron warns that wide inequalities of income and wealth can erode this moral imperative because they make it harder to make the mental leap it requires: The poor may come to seem so different from the privileged and prosperous that the well-off cannot understand a moral principle that assigns equal value to the living of a human life as such. \u201cWe might become so accustomed to economic inequality, so inured to the spectacle of it despite its being unjustified, that we cease to recognize those who are deprived as nevertheless our equals,\u201d he writes, clearly alluding to modern Western society. \u201cIt may even be morally embarrassing for us to recognize them as such,\u201d he argues, \u201csince we would then have to acknowledge the injustice. Better perhaps to turn away, or to try what it feels like to deny or suppress the proposition that poor people too are entitled to equal concern.\u201dWaldron urges the same sort of political equality as does Emmott, but he gets there from the opposite direction. For him, the purpose of political equality is not to preserve an open society. It is to honor basic human equality. \u201cIt is because we are one another\u2019s equals that we ought to have concern about high levels of economic inequality,\u201d he writes.Viewed from either Emmott\u2019s or Waldron\u2019s point of departure \u2014 the necessity of preserving an open society or of respecting the moral equality of human beings \u2014 the surge toward widening inequality is endangering the West. The culprit is not economic inequality per se. It is the political inequality that economic inequality can spawn. How will the vicious cycle we are now experiencing come to an end? These two insightful books suggest that if we don\u2019t recommit ourselves to political equality, we will become ever more closed, authoritarian societies. Economic elites should understand this. As Emmott notes, without openness, the West cannot thrive. But without equality, the West cannot last.Robert B. Reich is chancellor\u2019s professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. His most recent book is \u201cSaving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Lynch Weaves Film History Into \u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe artist and filmmaker David Lynch has an uncanny ability to create work that doesn\u2019t just evoke dread and discomfort \u2014 it can make a viewer actually feel that dread and discomfort. \u201cLynch is a director of mood and texture, the queasier the better,\u201d the critic J. Hoberman observed back in 1984. In the same piece, Mr. Hoberman proclaimed that Mr. Lynch \u201cmay be the American director with the most direct pipeline to his unconscious.\u201d These traits are explicitly evident in \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return,\u201d the extraordinary limited series \u2014 or 18-hour movie, as Mr. Lynch would have it; he\u2019s divided it into \u201cparts\u201d rather than \u201cepisodes\u201d \u2014 now unspooling on Showtime, and its attendant streaming site and app Showtime Now.The images, textures and moods in Mr. Lynch\u2019s work are derived from his personal experiences \u2014 he has said that his grimly comic, surreal debut feature, \u201cEraserhead\u201d (1977), was significantly influenced by his time living in Philadelphia. But while he never makes film references with a wink to his cleverness or erudition, his work is influenced by other movies, or perhaps his memories of other movies, sometimes dim, sometimes sharp.The eighth part of the new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is especially replete with such allusions, to many films easily available to revisit on streaming video. While the series might not be garnering record-breaking ratings, it generates lively conversation on social media, and minutes after Part 8 aired on June 25, fans were weighing in not only on how unusual it was, even by \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d standards, but also on the movies to which it appeared to nod.\u201cCarnival,\u201d a low-budget American film made in Kansas in 1962, is a cult picture available for viewing on the Criterion Channel. It tells the story of a young woman who very improbably survives an auto accident and then takes off to a job as a church organist in Utah. She\u2019s constantly interrupted by the undead. It\u2019s a remarkably eerie picture whose unnerving atmosphere is actually enhanced by the stilted B-movie quality of the acting.\u201cThe Atomic Cafe,\u201d a 1982 found-footage documentary about atomic testing, nuclear war and the peculiar attitudes American culture had toward them, is also a worthwhile companion piece to Part 8, and can be rented from YouTube, Amazon Video and Google Play. Of course Part 8 \u2014 whose affinities stretch from the thriller \u201cThe Night of the Hunter\u201d (1955) to Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s surreal \u201cEnter the Void\u201d (2009) (both of which are available to rent on Amazon, Google, iTunes and YouTube; \u201cVoid\u201d is a featured film on Hulu) \u2014 is not the only part of the new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d with cinematic resonances. In Part 4, Wally (played by Michael Cera), the son of Deputy Andy Brennan and his wife, Lucy, becomes a goofily comic riff on Marlon Brando\u2019s persona in the 1953 motorcycle-gang drama \u201cThe Wild One,\u201d which can be rented to stream from Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.It\u2019s probably not Mr. Lynch\u2019s overt intention to steer his latest \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d vision through so much eclectic film history, but the presence of this material and the viewer\u2019s ability to access what may or may not be its sources certainly make the experience of watching the program that much richer and stranger.An article last Sunday about the director David Lynch misstated the availability of some of his short films. Three of them are available on the Criterion Channel of the streaming service Filmstruck. It is not the case that all of Mr. Lynch\u2019s short films are available only from bootleg sources.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michigan\u2019s New Motor City: Ann Arbor as a Driverless-Car Hub", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 As the world looks ahead to a future of interconnected, self-driving cars, this college town 40 miles west of Detroit has emerged as a one-of-a-kind, living laboratory for the technologies that will pave the way.Here, it is not uncommon to see self-driving Ford Fusions or Lexus sedans winding their way through downtown streets and busy intersections, occupied by engineers with eyes focused more on laptops and test equipment than the roadway.\u201cThis combination of research and testing in a controlled facility like MCity, and testing on the street in the real world, on this scale, doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in the world,\u201d said James R. Sayer, director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.Glenn Stevens can attest to that. An executive with a business organization that promotes the Detroit area\u2019s autonomous vehicle activities, he recently met with groups from the Netherlands, Germany and India.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly hosting companies from every continent,\u201d Mr. Stevens said.And Ann Arbor is not alone. Thanks to its long automotive history, Michigan is the site of a broad array of research efforts and development centers that are focusing on connected cars and autonomous vehicles. In addition, Michigan has passed laws clearing the way for extensive testing on public roads \u2014 even for self-driving vehicles that have no steering wheels \u2014 and has equipped more than 100 public highways with electronics to facilitate testing of connected cars and self-driving trucks.\u201cWe are doing a lot of tests ourselves in the Netherlands on connected vehicles, and are looking at other places that have the same ambitions,\u201d Bram Hendrix, a representative of a Dutch auto industry association, said during a pause in a tour of Ann Arbor and the surrounding region. \u201cWe are here to see and learn so we can collaborate with this region.\u201dOne of the strongest draws to Ann Arbor is MCity, a 32-acre testing ground that opened in 2015. It features simulated city streets, intersections and storefronts where carmakers and others can test self-driving vehicles in a confined but realistic setting. Dozens of companies, including General Motors, Toyota, Honda, BMW and Intel, are conducting research there in collaboration with the university.Last winter they were joined by Navya, a French start-up that has developed a small, autonomous shuttle bus. Two will go into service at the university in September in one of the first trials of a driverless transit vehicle open to the public. By the end of the year, Navya plans to begin building its buses near Ann Arbor.Henri Coron, Navya\u2019s vice president for sales, said the decision to locate the assembly plant in Michigan was based on \u201cthe strength of support\u201d from the university.The university\u2019s president, Mark Schlissel, said his institution was trying to ensure that Michigan remains a vibrant center of automotive innovation, even as Silicon Valley and other locations take prominent roles in developing self-driving cars.\u201cWe want to provide the research underpinning for the state to succeed in competing in this future of mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the economic future of the state, it is critical that the leadership of automotive technology remains in southeastern Michigan.\u201dThe least visible of the university\u2019s research efforts is its largest: the on-road test of vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communications involving 1,500 cars, trucks and buses. Auto industry executives said they knew of no other live test of this scale anywhere in the world.The vehicles in the project have been equipped with small radio transmitters that broadcast their speed and direction 10 times per second. At more than two dozen intersections, traffic lights and crosswalks have similar transmitters, allowing them to communicate with the vehicles.The aim is to develop V2V technologies that will help improve traffic flow, Dr. Sayer said. \u201cIf a car is stopped 200 feet from a traffic light, you know there\u2019s a long line of cars there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you could lengthen the green light dynamically to reduce congestion.\u201dPreventing accidents is part of the plan. On a recent afternoon, MCity researchers demonstrated what they are working toward. In one test, a self-driving car approached a curve obscured by hedges, and suddenly slowed. Why? Because beyond the hedges another car stopped in the road had broadcast its position, warning the self-driving car of the hazard.In another demonstration, a car driving at near highway speed jammed on the brakes. The hard braking action sent out a warning to a following vehicle to slow down. \u201cYou can get that signal even if the car is braking 1,000 feet down the road, so you can begin to brake even before you see the car,\u201d Dr. Sayer said.This fall, the university\u2019s V2V work will expand into a new area. Electronics at crosswalks will be able to pick up the Wi-Fi signal from cellphones and alert approaching cars that a pedestrian is starting to cross the road.The university expects to expand the number of wired cars taking part in the trials to 2,500 by 2018.A dozen of the state\u2019s universities and colleges are also working on projects related to future modes of transportation.Soon, two other test centers similar to MCity will open. Work is well underway on a much larger one 10 miles to the east in Ypsilanti, on the site of a factory that built bombers during World War II. Called the American Center for Mobility, it will cover 325 acres and allow testing of autonomous vehicles at highway speeds and in complex roadways like overpasses and exit ramps. A third testing ground is being built in Flint by G.M. and Kettering University.\u201cI think it\u2019s totally cool to be a part of this,\u201d Paul Dolan, an information technology executive, said of the University of Michigan program. Mr. Dolan volunteered in December to have his Ford Edge outfitted for the university\u2019s pilot program. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of awareness that driverless cars are coming, but I don\u2019t think people realize the extent of what U. of M. is doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft to Cut Up to 4,000 Sales and Marketing Jobs", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft is overhauling its big sales and marketing organization in a move that will cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs, mostly outside the United States.A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that \u201croles will be eliminated\u201d and that most of them will be abroad, but he declined to be specific. The precise number is uncertain partly because in some countries, especially in Europe, labor laws require negotiations. The possible total was described by a person familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans, who was not authorized to speak on the record about them.Microsoft workers were notified on Thursday if their current job was affected. Some of the workers will get other jobs within the software company.\u201cThis is being done mainly to evolve the skill sets we need,\u201d said Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.In an internal email last week, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, described the reorganization and its rationale. He wrote that there was \u201can enormous $4.5 trillion market opportunity\u201d for Microsoft in the coming years.The sales and marketing changes, Mr. Althoff wrote, were intended to \u201cenable us to align the right resources for the right customer at the right time.\u201d Key areas of opportunity, he said, included expanding its cloud offerings in data analysis and artificial intelligence, and helping companies in every industry to become digital businesses, using Microsoft tools.Microsoft\u2019s global head count is 121,500, a number that has increased in the last few years.The one major work force cutback at Microsoft came in 2014, when 18,000 jobs were eliminated.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has made that transition to cloud software delivery, and its personal computer software business is no longer considered an engine of growth.New capabilities are being built into the cloud services, notably big data analysis and artificial intelligence. And businesses require specialized cloud software, tailored for their industry.The Microsoft email last week said the reorganization was intended to sharpen its focus on \u201csix priority industries\u201d: manufacturing, financial services, retail, health, education and government.Sales and marketing jobs in the future will often require more technical and industry-specific knowledge than before, Mr. Shaw said. The reorganization and job cuts, he added, were an effort to match the company\u2019s skills with the changing marketplace.Advertisement"}

She said that the company had stopped offering the services in question, and that it now worked only with professionally licensed drivers in France.The court typically follows the recommendations of its senior advisers, but it could still rule in the company\u2019s favor.\u201cThe two ways Uber sold itself \u2014 as a digital company and as a ride-sharing service \u2014 don\u2019t stand up, according to this legal opinion,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Cass Business School at City University in London.When companies like Uber and Airbnb, the short-term rental company, set up, he said, \u201cThey skirted around national laws, and that was what made them competitive and cheap.\u201d He added, \u201cMany national regulators are beginning to chip away at that.\u201dUber already operates in many European cities in compliance with transportation rules, but some of its services \u2014 particularly those that do not require drivers to have a taxi license \u2014 have been banned and face stiff opposition.The pushback against Uber is part of wider tensions between the European authorities and American technology companies.After months of turmoil and questions about its leadership and culture, the company is now without a chief executive \u2014 a committee of executives is in charge.Advertisement"}

Distractify\u2019s complaint, which seeks a jury trial, was filed in June and lists 51 examples of 22 Words committing \u201cacts amounting to digital piracy and plagiarism.\u201dIn each of the articles cited, the content in 22 Words was similar but not identical to the content in Distractify.Among the examples:In a statement, Brainjolt said Distractify had no claim to ownership over the subjects 22 Words covered.\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve been told, Distractify seems to be complaining about our use of content that is readily available on social media, and which Distractify is not the original author,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs such, we believe that Distractify\u2019s claims are without merit, and will defend ourselves and our reputation vigorously.\u201dA lawyer for Distractify declined to comment.You might be wondering: Doesn\u2019t this happen all the time?Indeed, aggregation (or curation \u2014 whatever you\u2019d like to call it) of content on other sites is a major driver of reader traffic to many articles, especially in viral content publications. They tend to focus on emerging memes, entertaining social media posts and uplifting stories that can be written up quickly. Publications compete against each other for clicks, which lead to advertising revenue.And a writer at Someecards said on Twitter that Distractify had \u201cstolen\u201d her posts.The Distractify lawsuit raises the question: Can the underlying topic of an article be subject to copyright? While the laws governing online media are far from settled, experts were skeptical.Daniel Nazer, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said facts and story concepts generally can\u2019t be copyrighted. Short phrases like headlines or titles likely wouldn\u2019t be subject to copyright, either, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s only so many ways to say that someone used a Spotfiy playlist to break up with someone, and that fact is no more copyrightable than the fact that the president fired the F.B.I. director,\u201d he said.While some would consider attribution to be ethically important, it isn\u2019t relevant to copyright law, Mr. Nazer said. And plagiarism, while a major publishing no-no, is not itself a crime unless the duplicated material was copyrighted.The challenge for Distractify would be proving that there was enough original creativity in its articles to claim ownership, and he said that might be difficult.\u201cMy first thought was: How is this infringement if their original articles aren\u2019t infringement?\u201d he said.Original content creators, like photographers, often see their work appear on sites without permission or payment, said Scott Burroughs, a lawyer at Doniger/Burroughs, a law firm based in Venice, Calif., that focuses on copyright law.\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit rich for Distractify to be claiming 22 Words is ripping off its content when we know at least some of its content is the work of others that they\u2019ve essentially ripped off,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Smoke Out Where Broadband Companies Stand on Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtA curious thing happened on Wednesday, a day that many internet companies and public policy groups had christened a \u201cDay of Action\u201d aimed at protesting the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s plan to overturn so-called net neutrality rules. The curiosity was that several broadband companies \u2014 the very same companies that pushed to rewrite the rules that undergird net neutrality \u2014 put out statements suggesting that they, too, supported the aims of the protesters.So what\u2019s going on here? Net neutrality \u2014 rules meant to ensure that broadband companies treat all internet traffic equally and don\u2019t, for instance, block certain services or charge them to get priority access \u2014 has been at the center of a heated tech-policy battle for more than a decade. It\u2019s a fight between internet companies \u2014 the Googles, Facebooks and Netflixes of the world \u2014 and broadband companies that control the pipes coming into your home. The battle is abstruse, but the stakes are high: Both sides say the future of the internet depends on getting these rules right.So why, now, are broadband companies suggesting that they support the aims of the other side?There are two possibilities: A cynic might argue that it\u2019s just puffery, that the broadband industry is simply trying to present a friendly image to an outraged online horde. Or you might take them at their word.When I asked them for comment, representatives for AT&T, Comcast and Verizon pointed to their statements. In those statements, they argue that there is a reasonable middle ground in the neutrality debate \u2014 that if given a chance, both sides could arrive at a set of rules that would make the internet better off. And they say the proper venue for that compromise is Congress, not the F.C.C. Legislation rather than regulation, they said, would create a permanent new legal grounding for network neutrality rules, ending the fight once and for all.So which is it, cynicism or an earnest attempt to move the debate forward? Well, maybe their motivation doesn\u2019t matter. Here\u2019s one idea for longtime proponents of network neutrality: Call the broadband companies\u2019 bluff, if that\u2019s what it is. Maybe it is time to push Congress, rather than the F.C.C., to take up the neutrality fight \u2014 and maybe, finally, end the debate for good.But broadband companies also face enormous consumer pressure to keep their networks functioning well. On the Day of Action, many internet companies showed worst-case scenarios that could come out of the death of net neutrality rules \u2014 trickle-slow load times and an internet marked by paid bundles, like the return of cable TV on your computer. Broadband companies, which are already quite hated by their customers, aren\u2019t likely to be keen on seeing those scenarios come to pass \u2014 and would therefore willingly support legislation that prevents such horrors, said Michael Powell, a former F.C.C. chairman who is now the president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, a broadband trade association.\u201cThere\u2019s a premise out there that we are itching to block, itching to create slow lanes, but we\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with every C.E.O., and it\u2019s not because they\u2019re good people or are philanthropists. They\u2019re as self-interested as Google or anybody else, but they believe they\u2019ve found a good business selling internet access on open, unobstructed pipes. They don\u2019t see how one could create a profitable business model by degrading the experience of their consumers.\u201dHe added: \u201cI guess you could think we just constantly lie, but I\u2019m trying to convince you it\u2019s as sincere as it comes. It\u2019s in their greedy monetary self-interest not to block anyone.\u201dSo if broadband companies are itching for a law, why not get on that bandwagon? Yes, a law would be hard to get; legislation under this Congress has a habit of dying on the launchpad. But it\u2019s not implausible: Internet giants control the world\u2019s most important channels for information, from your Facebook feed to Google results to your phone\u2019s home screen. They are more than capable of applying enormous pressure to members of Congress to push for what they want.And then, if nothing else, we\u2019ll be able to see where the broadband companies really stand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Disrupts WhatsApp Service in Online Clampdown", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The last of Facebook\u2019s major products that still worked in China was disrupted by the government on Tuesday, as Beijing broadly tightened its controls over the internet.The product, WhatsApp, a messaging app used across the globe, was partly blocked by Chinese filters, leaving many unable to send videos and photos and some also unable to send text-based messages.Sites hosting popular foreign television shows have had videos taken down, and tools used to skirt the censors have faced more frequent disruptions. In an article, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s Communist Party scolded the Chinese internet company Tencent over a popular video game, calling it too addictive.To complicate matters, the 19th Party Congress \u2014 where top leadership positions are determined \u2014 is just months away. The government puts an increased emphasis on stability in the run up to the event, which happens every five years, often leading to a tightening of internet controls.WhatsApp, which had generally avoided major disruptions in China despite the full block of Facebook and Instagram, appears to have become a victim of those circumstances.The blocks against WhatsApp originated with the government, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the disruption. Security experts also verified that the partial disruption in WhatsApp started with China\u2019s internet filters.\u201cAccording to the analysis that we ran today on WhatsApp\u2019s infrastructure, it seems that the Great Firewall is imposing censorship that selectively targets WhatsApp functionalities,\u201d said Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a cryptography research start-up.The actions by the Chinese government are another setback for Facebook in a country that has been difficult for the world\u2019s largest social network to crack. Its flagship site was blocked in 2009 after ethnic unrest in western China; Instagram followed in 2014 during protests that fall in Hong Kong.Beginning in late 2014, Facebook began an aggressive campaign to woo the Chinese government and get its main social network back into the country. As part of the courtship, Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, showed off his language chops at a conference and later dined with President Xi Jinping during a state visit to the United States.But Facebook\u2019s efforts have slowed over the past year, and it has little to show for itself. Instead of getting a new product into China, the internet giant now faces the reality that its last app standing is under threat of being pushed outside the walls of Chinese censorship.A spokeswoman for WhatsApp declined to comment.Since taking power almost five years ago, Mr. Xi has presided over a consistent and deepening suppression of internet freedom. He has been vocal in calling for China to establish sovereignty online, and has set up a new internet regulator to consolidate controls over the web.The scale of the recent actions shows the increasing muscle of the Chinese government, which has strengthened this year.In recent months, a number of virtual private networks, tools that allow users in China to access the broader internet around the world, were removed from app stores or shut down. China\u2019s telecom regulator said it would ban unauthorized VPNs starting in February 2018.The new cybersecurity rules, broad and vague, have left Western companies uncertain of how they will be applied and what impact they could have on a difficult operating environment. The government has put strong emphasis on the law, which could serve as a watershed for how the internet is managed and foreign companies are policed.The disruption of encrypted messaging programs like WhatsApp and censorship circumvention tools like VPNs shows a desire to take almost total control over how the internet is used.WhatsApp is hugely popular around much of the globe, but the platform is not widely used in China, where local messaging app WeChat dominates. Even so, WhatsApp provides encrypted messaging, making it a useful tool for many Chinese to communicate or do business outside the country or in Hong Kong.Paul Triolo, the head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group, said that a possible next step would be for China to target other encrypted messaging apps like Signal, pointing out that such apps \u201crepresent a small but growing and potentially important hole in the Great Firewall.\u201d\u201cThe ministries and support organizations that undergird the Great Firewall must constantly prove they can keep abreast of technological change, and encrypted messaging apps are just the latest in a long string of innovations that have drawn the attention of the technical wizards behind the Great Firewall,\u201d Mr. Triolo said.The apparent crackdown is part of the jockeying among Chinese ministries ahead of this autumn\u2019s congress to show that they are doing their job, according to a government tech policy adviser who declined to be named because of possible retribution over speaking to foreign news media. While there is a real push to make it harder to use VPNs, he said the new rules set to take effect next year are unlikely to be so extreme that they entirely prevent individuals from being able to use such tools.Some in the Chinese government are worried that the excess censorship and controls are damaging the country\u2019s ability to access crucial information, like scientific papers and other educational resources. As such, there have been calls for a more surgical way to block specific material, rather than a sledgehammer approach that takes out entire services.In the case of WhatsApp, it is not clear whether the targeted censorship of videos and photos was intentional, or if it was just a prelude to a more complete block. Previous partial blocks have sometimes led to full bans, or they have eventually been removed by the government, and service restored.Beijing\u2019s track record with other American social networking services does not bode well for WhatsApp. Besides Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, Google and Gmail are all blocked in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s like when Gmail first got throttled, the blockage was very uneven,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Silence in China Sets a Dangerous Precedent", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYet in China over the weekend, when faced with a broad demand by the Chinese internet authority, it was Apple that blinked.Whatever Apple may have done in private to fight the Chinese internet law, the company has not offered a peep of criticism in public. Apple\u2019s only public statement on the VPN ban said that the company had been \u201crequired to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d but noted that the \u201capps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d Despite the pulldown, Apple says there are still hundreds of VPN apps available on its Chinese app store, some of which remain unregistered with the government.Search Apple\u2019s website for a letter from Mr. Cook issuing a public rebuke of China\u2019s intrusion into his customers\u2019 privacy and freedom of expression \u2014 you won\u2019t find it. The company has not fully tested its political and economic leverage in China. It hasn\u2019t tested the public\u2019s immense love of its products. It hasn\u2019t publicly threatened any long-term consequences \u2014 like looking to other parts of the world to manufacture its products.The company\u2019s silence may be tactical; the Chinese government, the conventional thinking goes, does not take well to public rebuke. Yet Apple\u2019s quiet capitulation to tightening censorship in one of its largest markets is still a dangerous precedent.\u201cApple\u2019s response is tremendously disappointing,\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that Apple is playing a bigger role behind the scenes here. But the problem with that is, from the outside it looks exactly like doing nothing.\u201dIt may be na\u00efve to expect Apple to publicly take on the Chinese government. Sure, it may be the world\u2019s most valuable company, with extensive investments and operations in China. But Apple is also just a foreign company \u2014 it must obey local laws, and it must watch for its bottom line. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Apple\u2019s sales, and many analysts see the region as a key growth area for the company. So what was Apple supposed to do? Jeopardize its operations over a few apps?There is also a moral defense of Apple\u2019s decision to give in without a public fight: Despite the VPN ban, Chinese internet users might still be better off with Apple in China than with it outside. Its app store still provides people access to millions of apps that they might not find elsewhere in China. And Apple\u2019s own communications apps in China remain free of government censorship. For instance, Messages, Apple\u2019s texting app, and FaceTime, its video and phone-calling app, are protected by end-to-end encryption, allowing Chinese users to communicate freely.But that may be of limited utility.\u201cIt will only get worse,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a Chinese human rights activist and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. Mr. Xiao sees the latest crackdowns as the beginning of a new wave of internet censorship in China. And he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that saying something publicly would have backfired for Apple.\u201cThey should say something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a U.S. company, after all. And they\u2019re a global company, upholding standards of privacy and speech in many, many markets outside China. So if they have to do things differently in China, they should have some public explanation for why \u2014 because that attitude could matter globally, including in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Opening Data Center in China to Comply With Cybersecurity Law", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Apple said Wednesday that it would open its first data center in China, joining a parade of technology companies responding to growing global demands to build facilities that store online data closer to customers.The move is a response to a strict new law in China that requires companies to store users\u2019 data in the country. The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.As is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how. Already, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have formed partnerships with Chinese companies to offer cloud computing services based in China. Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.Apple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place.\u201d The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple\u2019s encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.\u201cThe addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,\u201d Apple said.China\u2019s rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.The iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple\u2019s business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s global sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.But the iPhone has also become emblematic of China\u2019s long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.Apple already stores some of the data of China\u2019s residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.In 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.Careful not to offend, Apple said it \u201cappreciated\u201d that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users\u2019 locations.The opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple\u2019s iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple\u2019s Chinese partner.Apple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple\u2019s permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.Other American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.Even though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple\u2019s smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Waymo Scales Back Claims Against Uber in Driverless Car Dispute", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo, the autonomous vehicle business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company, dropped several patent claims against Uber on Friday, scaling back some of its major allegations in a bitter lawsuit over driverless technology.In a federal court filing, Waymo said it was dropping three of its four claims over Uber violating its patents related to light detection and ranging sensor technology, or lidar. Lidar is a vital component in driverless car technology, helping the vehicle detect its surroundings to navigate roads.The case, an acrimonious battle between Waymo and Uber, spotlights the arms race surrounding autonomous vehicle talent and technology. It is especially significant for Google \u2014 now Waymo \u2014 which spent years working on driverless car technology before other tech companies took an interest. But as Waymo searches for a way to make money from self-driving cars, many of its best engineers have left for potential competitors, carrying valuable knowledge of its technology with them.Waymo\u2019s dropping of three patent claims against Uber weakens its original argument for bringing the suit. Still, each side called the latest legal move a victory.Waymo said it agreed to scale back its patent claims because Uber had halted work on a lidar design that violated Waymo\u2019s patents and is proceeding with a different design. Waymo is permitted to reassert its claims if Uber returns to the design that Waymo challenged. The company said Uber\u2019s current lidar design still violates one of its original patents.\u201cWe continue to pursue a patent claim against Uber\u2019s current generation device and our trade secret claims, which are not at all affected by this stipulated dismissal,\u201d Waymo said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to trial.\u201dIn a statement, Uber said the dropping of the three claims was \u201cyet another sign\u201d of Waymo overreaching and not delivering on its claims.Last month, Waymo received a signal from federal court that the patent claims were not its strongest legal argument in the case. Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, who is overseeing the case, urged the company\u2019s lawyers at a hearing on June 7 to drop the patent claims because \u201cyou\u2019re going to lose on all these patent claims unless you pull some rabbit out of a hat.\u201dLately, Uber has been trying to distance itself from the actions of Mr. Levandowski, the former head of Google\u2019s driverless car project who joined Uber last year.Waymo has said that Mr. Levandowski worked with Uber to steal proprietary information from Google before joining Uber. Waymo said Uber was aware that Mr. Levandowski had stolen files from Waymo.Uber said it expressly told Mr. Levandowski to not bring any stolen documents to the company or apply any of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property to Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle efforts. The company said Waymo\u2019s lawyers have not found the stolen documents in Uber\u2019s possession, despite extensive discovery.In a separate filing on Friday, Uber said Mr. Levandowski, before invoking his Fifth Amendment right, told Travis Kalanick, then Uber\u2019s chief executive, that he had downloaded the documents from Google because he was worried that he might not receive full payment of a $120 million bonus owed to him. Uber said this indicated that his actions were unrelated to his work at Uber.A Waymo spokesman called Uber\u2019s claim \u201cfictitious\u201d and an attempt to distract from evidence showing that Mr. Levandowski met with Uber executives within 24 hours of downloading proprietary Google information.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want a Job, Mate? Amazon Is Hiring Aussie Speakers", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe BreakdownSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Think you know the ins and outs of Australian English? Amazon is hiring.Though the job posting didn\u2019t get into such specifics, it\u2019s very likely to involve research for Amazon\u2019s voice-recognition device, the Amazon Echo, which helps users check the weather, stream music and plan to-do lists through a personal assistant named Alexa.The effort by the Seattle-based Amazon to hire more linguists with backgrounds outside American English may point to an acknowledgment that such systems must adapt to all types of voices if they are to appeal to multiple markets.\u201cIf people like Google, Apple and Amazon are putting money into this stuff, localization needs to be a part of it,\u201d said Simon Musgrave, a lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.Current voice-recognition software, he explained, draws from a training database of sounds and uses statistical modeling to match audio with the understanding of vowels, consonants and words.The Australian National Dictionary, a standard guide to the Australian vernacular, added 6,000 words and phrases on Tuesday, its first update since 1988. Test your knowledge of the new terms with this quiz.\u201cThey\u2019re going to need a body of recordings from Australians with good annotations\u201d that connect audio to meaning, Mr. Musgrave said.The Australian accent, for example, is distinct from American English in that it is non-rhotic \u2014 the \u201cr\u201d sound is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel sound. Australian English also has a lot of diphthongs and triphthongs \u2014 \u201cmultiple vowels within the same space,\u201d said Howard Manns, a lecturer in linguistics at Monash University.\u201cAnd that might be difficult for a computer or voice recognition to make sense of,\u201d Mr. Manns said.The software is getting better. In May, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, announced that the company\u2019s voice-recognition software had a word error rate of less than 5 percent, an improvement on the 23 percent error rate it had in 2013.Jobs that tie linguistics and technology are becoming more common.For example, Appen, a company based in Australia that collects data for machine learning for technology companies, employs more than 70 linguists and has thousands of other linguists that it can consult.Linguists annotate recordings of people speaking, down to the pauses in their voices, which are then fed into an algorithm that connects the audio with the meaning, said Phil Hall, the senior vice president of Appen\u2019s language resources.As for the Amazon listing, it\u2019s an attractive prospect for any linguist wanting to work on a cutting-edge project.\u201cI\u2019m going to apply for that job right now,\u201d Mr. Manns joked.An earlier version of this article assigned the wrong linguistic terms to the definition \u201cmultiple vowels within the same space.\u201d That definition describes diphthongs and triphthongs, not diphones and triphones. The term non-rhotic was also incompletely defined. A non-rhotic accent does not pronounce the \u201cr\u201d sound unless it is followed by a vowel sound; it is not the case that it does not pronounce the \u201cr\u201d sound at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Muffled by China, Taiwan President Embraces Twitter as Megaphone", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From TaipeiTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Over the past year, China has doubled down on its campaign to reduce Taiwan\u2019s presence on the world stage, whether by luring away its few remaining diplomatic allies \u2014 most recently Panama \u2014 or blocking its participation in international organizations like Interpol and the World Health Organization.Now President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan is trying to tweet the island back into the global conversation.The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!Weeks later, Ms. Tsai revived her moribund Twitter account, posting regularly in English and sometimes in Japanese. Since then, her followers have nearly tripled.Her office says her rekindled interest was spurred by outreach from Twitter itself, not by the Trump episode. But there are certain parallels between Ms. Tsai and President Trump. Where Mr. Trump uses the service to bypass what he considers a biased news establishment and to address the public directly, Ms. Tsai appears to see it as a means to circumvent the diplomatic isolation imposed by China.\u201cFrankly, Taiwan\u2019s future is tenuous, and their international space is increasingly limited at a time when they need their voice to be heard more than ever,\u201d Ms. Cave said.China claims self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory, and its diplomatic relations with other countries are conditional on their agreement not to recognize the island as independent. That has led to Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the United Nations and other international forums.Only 20 countries maintain formal relations with Taiwan, a list that has shrunk by two since Ms. Tsai took office in May 2016. She has resisted demands from Beijing that she endorse the so-called One China principle, which holds that Taiwan and China are part of a single country, although each side has its own views on how that country is defined.Describing the past few months of Twitter diplomacy as \u201cfairly successful,\u201d Mr. Chao said that the number of people who follow the account had risen since January from 36,800 to more than 100,000. They include foreign journalists and others who can communicate Taiwan\u2019s positions.\u201cIt\u2019s followed by journalists from most major publications from around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIncreasingly, we\u2019re seeing interest from politicians in the U.S., Japan and other democracies.\u201dAlex Huang, a spokesman for the Presidential Office, noted, \u201cThe broad role of this is to increase international exposure for the president and Taiwan.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a core group of people working on Twitter that have been with President Tsai for quite a while, and we also have people who provide input from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other government agencies on specific issues,\u201d he said.For her part, Ms. Cave said, \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets are clearly crafted for an international audience.\u201d She added: \u201cMost of her tweets are concerned with foreign affairs, and given how little international media the president has done since she took office, it has become the primary vehicle to keep track of Taiwan\u2019s international priorities and how the president sees cross-strait relations.\u201dAlthough Twitter is blocked in China, some citizens who employ virtual private networks to bypass their country\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d are clearly following Ms. Tsai\u2019s account, and even the state news media is taking note.Mr. Chao said that when Ms. Tsai wrote her Tiananmen anniversary messages, \u201cthere were a lot of Chinese netizens that posted comments saying, \u2018We hope you can help encourage China to become democratic,\u2019\u201d while others were critical. \u201cWe also had Chinese people saying, \u2018This has nothing to do with Taiwan.\u2019\u201dMr. Chao welcomed the new online arena for cross-strait engagement.\u201cIt\u2019s not just Chinese people being angry at President Tsai,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully they see it as an area where they can freely discuss their views on different situations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Family, Many Revolutions: From Black Panthers, to Silicon Valley, to Trump", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMARILLO, Calif. \u2014 For generations, the Horowitz family has cheered on the revolution.Phil and Blanche were New York schoolteachers who belonged to the Communist Party, and dreamed of a socialist heaven on earth. Their son, David, went on his first march in 1948, at age 9. As a young man in the 1960s he helped create the New Left, which pushed for the rights of the oppressed and struggled to end the Vietnam War. David worked closely with the Black Panthers, who believed a violent uprising was at hand and they would help lead it.David\u2019s youngest son, Ben, sought his fortune in Silicon Valley, a generally liberal place that traces some of its roots to the rebellious spirit of the \u201960s. Ben became a leading venture capitalist, investing billions of dollars in start-ups like Twitter and Facebook that seek to topple the status quo. His firm\u2019s investment thesis is \u201csoftware is eating the world\u201d \u2014 as disruptive a vision of the future as the old Marxist dream of the state withering away.And now David, after a political odyssey that took him from the extreme left to the extreme right, has a surprise last act that puts him once again in the thick of insurrection. His radical views on immigration, race, education, the duplicity of the media and the treachery of liberals have abruptly made their way to the center of power. If the Trump administration has an intellectual godfather, it\u2019s David Horowitz.Blacks as criminals, blacks as role models \u2014 it\u2019s hard to get further apart than this. Yet for a country that seems riven in two, the Horowitzes offer a measure of hope. They email, they talk, they get together for family celebrations. When David went to college campuses to denounce things that Ben believes in, Ben paid for his bodyguard.To understand all might not be to forgive all, but it\u2019s a start. David and Ben both said they have made a major effort to see where the other is coming from. While no one\u2019s politics have changed, they realized they are not quite as far apart as it might seem.\u201cOne thing we mostly see eye-to-eye on is that the most important thing is the ability of an individual to live his life and have an opportunity,\u201d said Ben, 51. \u201cHow he went from \u2018The way to do that is Communism\u2019 to \u2018The way to do that is Trump\u2019 is amazing.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re not aligned.\u201dDavid said he is glad he never foisted his beliefs on Ben or his other children the way Phil and Blanche\u2019s relentless adherence to the Communist doctrine pushed David into the cause long ago. If the revolution has a few less soldiers this way, so be it.\u201cI\u2019ve come to the end of the story,\u201d said David, 78. \u201cI don\u2019t mistake the life I\u2019ve lived for the only life.\u201dIt\u2019s not that simple, of course.\u201cSometimes people try to connect us on Twitter, which is always scary,\u201d said Ben. \u201cSomeone will say, \u2018Hey, aren\u2019t you related to @horowitz39?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s David\u2019s handle on Twitter, where he says things like \u201cObama is an American traitor\u201d and \u201cHillary killed four Americans in Benghazi.\u201d\u201cI never reply,\u201d Ben said.In the horse country northwest of Los Angeles, it\u2019s a glorious day. David Horowitz and his fourth wife, April, live here inside a remote gated community. There are two horses and, making a terrible racket, several dogs. Gardeners are working on the lawn.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me if they\u2019re illegal,\u201d David said with a laugh.The house is only remote physically. The computer in the other room is always calling, bringing forth updates, denunciations, the ongoing political spectacle. \u201cHow can you feel isolated when you\u2019re connected all the time?\u201d David asked.He chronicled his family\u2019s penchant for revolution in his 1997 autobiography, \u201cRadical Son,\u201d one of the most prominent of a long shelf of volumes. His first effort, \u201cStudent,\u201d about the embryonic turmoil on college campuses, appeared when Kennedy was president. In 1968, he became an editor and writer for Ramparts, the radical magazine that nurtured and reflected the era\u2019s unrest.\u201cThe system cannot be revitalized; it must be overthrown. As humanely as possible, but by any means necessary,\u201d Ramparts proclaimed in a 1970 editorial. David says he was the one who insisted on adding the \u201chumanely\u201d part.Ramparts published Che Guevara\u2019s diaries, went after the C.I.A. and offered a tutorial on how not to pay taxes. Its international editor was Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver, who fled to Cuba in 1968 after leading an ambush of Oakland, Calif., police officers. Thanks in a large part to Ramparts, the charismatic and photogenic Panthers soon embodied the notion of revolution for white radicals.David found a political soul mate in Panther leader Huey Newton. He immersed himself in the Panthers\u2019 home base of Oakland, raising money to buy a 35-classroom school that would be a showcase for the cause. Even for that freewheeling era, Ben had an unusual boyhood. It would shape his life, friendships, marriage and work. His best friend, who would later be best man at his wedding, was black. He was one of the few white kids on the Berkeley High football team. Every Sunday, he went to the Son of Man Temple, the Black Panther church in the auditorium of the school.\u201cI know all the songs from there,\u201d Ben said, and as proof, started singing the old gospel hymn adopted by the Panthers, \u201cWe are soldiers in the army \u2026\u201dDavid said: \u201cBen is practically black.\u201dBen laughed when this was repeated to him, something he does frequently when talking about his father. \u201cI hate it when my father talks, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged its broad truth.When the Panthers needed someone to keep their finances, David recommended a white friend named Betty Van Patter. In late 1974, she disappeared. A few weeks later, her body was found in San Francisco Bay. Her head had been bashed. While the murder was never officially solved, David held the Panthers responsible and said Mr. Newton confirmed it years later.The person he really blamed, however, was himself. The Panthers, he concluded, were thugs dressed up as revolutionaries, but the Left was too wrapped up in its dreams to be honest about it. David became unglued. He bought a sporty Datsun 260Z, had an affair, divorced his wife Elissa after nearly two decades of marriage and barely escaped with his life when a train smashed up the car.A photo from this era shows Ben and his two sisters perched with their father on the Datsun. David stares at the camera. Ben looks at the ground, morose.\u201cI was a very sensitive kid, supersensitive,\u201d Ben said. \u201cHe was loud and intense. Which is why I ended up spending so much time with my mom.\u201d (Elissa Horowitz declined to be interviewed for this story.)In 1976, David wrote with his friend Peter Collier his most popular book, a history of the Rockefeller family. Phil Horowitz, a believer to the end, asked his son why he wasn\u2019t writing about the revolution instead.By 1984, he was voting for Ronald Reagan.Like the sons of many prominent fathers, Ben spent a long time trying both to understand and escape his father. He studied computer science, a subject his father had no interest in, at Columbia University and then the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1990, a connection of David\u2019s helped Ben get an interview at SGI, a pioneering computer graphics company.Even the tech world, a place that celebrates straight-talking, found Ben a little too direct. \u201cEvery now and then, I had to help him better understand how to navigate,\u201d said Ken Coleman, his SGI mentor and one of the few black executives in the tech industry. SGI managers actually had a meeting about firing Ben but did not go through with it.After SGI came Netscape, the iconic internet browser company. It was here that Ben first acquired a reputation as a manager.\u201cIn Silicon Valley, people always say that an extroverted engineer is one who stares at your shoes rather than his own,\u201d said Greg Sands, a Netscape colleague. \u201cBen was an engineer, which meant he had a bit of an awkward user interface, but perhaps his life as an outsider generated empathy. He could get people to work together.\u201dAt Netscape, Ben met his future business partner, Marc Andreessen. They went on to start a data storage company called Loudcloud, which had many near-death experiences before it was successfully sold to Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion in 2007.As Ben became more successful, he eclipsed his father.David spent much of his energy attacking universities, which he considered hotbeds of misguided leftist thought. During one campus visit, he did a radio interview where the host made a personal observation about David that he considered untrue; he doesn\u2019t remember what. Lies deserve lies, he figured, and immediately blasted back: \u201cAt least I\u2019m not a child molester like you.\u201dBen heard this story from the bodyguard, who was ferrying David as the phone interview was taking place. \u201cI nearly crashed the car,\u201d he said.David was unrepentant: \u201cYou gotta fight fire with fire.\u201dIn 2009, Ben and Mr. Andreessen formed their venture capital firm, which today has $6 billion under management. By then, Ben had managed to tone himself down.\u201cWith my father, everything was an argument to the death,\u201d he said. \u201cMy bar for \u2018inflammatory\u2019 was so high.\u201dDavid declined to follow suit and moderate his own rhetoric, which meant he was largely ignored by both the right and the left. By 2012, the Jewish magazine Tablet could run a profile with the headline, \u201cDavid Horowitz Is Homeless.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been ghettoized,\u201d he told the magazine.Then came Mr. Trump. When Jeff Sessions was a Republican senator from Alabama, he participated several times in events at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, which describes itself as combating \u201cthe efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Sessions got an award from the center. Stephen Miller, a top White House aide, has been relying on David for advice since he was a student battling the administrators at Santa Monica High School.Last October, Chris Ruddy, a good friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, commissioned David to write a book about how the right could mobilize to defeat President Clinton. It was taken as a given that she would win the election.The plan was to publish the book a few days before her inauguration. David began with a section called \u201cThe Adversary.\u201d Hillary, of course.\u201cI can do that almost in my sleep,\u201d he said.When Trump surprised the world by winning, the book was quickly retooled into \u201cBig Agenda: President Trump\u2019s Plan to Save America,\u201d although much of it was still about how Mrs. Clinton and Democrats were the adversaries. \u201cThe strategy,\u201d David wrote, \u201cis to go for the jugular.\u201d The book was on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for 11 weeks.\u201cWhat I like about Trump is he\u2019s not your typical Republican,\u201d David said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter.\u201dA fighter, as it happens, in the style of David Horowitz. In decades of public speaking, David honed an in-your-face approach. He said he picked it up from his former comrades on the left.\u201cIf you\u2019re nuanced and you speak in what I would call an intellectual manner, you get eaten alive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great handicap to be talking like accountants while the opposition are making moral indictments.\u201dHaving politics so deeply part of your identity used to be unusual, said Daniel Oppenheimer, who wrote \u201cExit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century\u201d about David Horowitz, Ronald Reagan and a few others. The core identity of most people was community, family and religion. But as these other parts of society withered, politics filled the void.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which we\u2019re all David Horowitz now,\u201d said Mr. Oppenheimer. \u201cWe\u2019re all amateur political pundits, and we\u2019re all less willing to compromise. That doesn\u2019t bode well for our future.\u201dSand Hill Road is the short, architecturally undistinguished strip just west of Palo Alto, Calif., where the venture capitalists hang out. As an incubator of revolutions, Sand Hill has had a longer and more successful run than Berkeley ever did in the 1960s. Companies from Amazon to Google were funded here.Mr. Andreessen, as it happened, did not want Ben to articulate a case for his Trump-supporting father. \u201cMarc said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Ben recalled.But his father asked him, and so there was Ben on a couch in his Sand Hill office, mulling the unexpected confluence of race, politics and technology that is the Horowitz family. In case of trouble, an aide recorded the conversation.\u201cMarx said, sharpen the contradictions. He was talking about the contradictions between labor and capital. Make it stark,\u201d Ben said. \u201cMy father, from a rhetorical, propaganda kind of messaging school, is all Marx and Lenin, still.\u201dIn other words, he goes to extremes.Father and son usually avoid politics, discuss it when they must, and find common ground to the extent they can. They live with each other\u2019s extremes, especially with regard to race.\u201cWe trust each other\u2019s intentions,\u201d Ben said.For more than 25 years, Ben has been married to Felicia Wiley, who is black and grew up in a working class family in Los Angeles. She is a frequent volunteer at Glide Memorial Church, the longtime countercultural rallying point in San Francisco that talks on its website about how it offered \u201ca safe space\u201d to the Black Panthers. Last summer, Glide gave Felicia a major award.Ben and Felicia have three grown children. In David\u2019s 2016 essay collection \u201cProgressive Racism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI have three black granddaughters for whom I want the absolute best that this life and this society have to offer.\u201d But his positions on racial issues are not exactly mainstream in liberal Silicon Valley. In \u201cBig Agenda,\u201d he called Black Lives Matter a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201criot-fomenting\u201d organization.And in lines that emphasize how far he had come from the idealism of the 1960s, he wrote in \u201cProgressive Racism\u201d that \u201cthere will always be racists and bigots. Only utopians will fail to understand this and seek to deploy the coercive powers of the state to make everyone believe as they do.\u201dBen looks at his father\u2019s racial statements in this light: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to help black people. Really, genuinely. Nobody else is going to take it that way because of how he says it.\u201dHe noted that his father broke with right-wing orthodoxy and condemned George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin. \u201cA young man who was unarmed and guiltless of any crime is dead,\u201d David wrote in 2013. \u201cAnd shouldn\u2019t there be some penalty to pay for that?\u201d\u201cThose are the people I\u2019m comfortable around,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird my father was the origin of it, given who he is now.\u201dGrowing up in black culture, Ben developed a love for hip-hop music and used its lyrics as epigraphs for his blog posts on management. An article documenting his affection for the music came to the attention of Divine, a rapper who spent a decade in prison for selling drugs.\u201cI was skeptical,\u201d said Divine, who was born Victor D. Lombard. \u201cI thought it was a publicity stunt. I couldn\u2019t tie together an older white gentleman who was a venture capitalist and a billionaire to hip-hop, which comes from poverty, from struggle, from pain.\u201d He reached out to Ben via Twitter, realized his sincerity, and the two became friends.Divine has met David at Ben\u2019s parties and has pondered what separates and joins the two.\u201cIt\u2019s like Ben is the antidote to David Horowitz,\u201d he said. \u201cHe balances his father out. And what\u2019s so crazy is that Ben came from David Horowitz.\u201dIn the same way a Mafia don is happy if his kids never whack anyone, David appreciates how his offspring stayed clear of the family business. He doesn\u2019t even mind the way they rejected his politics as well.\u201cThe victory of not indoctrinating your kids and yet having them be successful anyway \u2014 that\u2019s the ultimate for him,\u201d Ben said.Because really, who in their right mind would choose to be involved in politics now?\u201cI liked it when there were fringes on the left and the right and a somewhat rational center,\u201d David said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the center. Normal people are wary of politics, with good reason. It\u2019s a very dirty business.\u201dIf David himself were to renounce that business, declaring that his benevolent attitude toward his family would now be extended to strangers as well, this would be a tidier and more hopeful story.The odds are higher that Hillary Clinton will get an award from the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Despite his distaste for politics, David can\u2019t afford to retire and wouldn\u2019t want to anyway.\u201cIt would be like dying,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t betray my cause.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Syria Came to Fresno: Refugees Test Limits of Outstretched Hand", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 The police responded to a call about a loud party on East San Ramon Avenue, but it wasn\u2019t just any party: A sheep was reportedly being slaughtered in a backyard.\u201cMuslim refugees were unaware that slaughtering sheep is not allowed in the city,\u201d the police wrote afterward in their report, which also stated that those involved \u201cwere advised to clean up the blood and mess\u201d and warned that in the future \u201cthey could be cited.\u201dThe animal, actually a goat, was killed by a Syrian refugee who later skinned, roasted and shared it with his Syrian neighbors in the apartment complex where they all live.Since late 2016, more than 200 Syrian refugees originally settled elsewhere in the United States have made a fresh start in Fresno, the largest city in California\u2019s agricultural belt. They have been drawn there mainly by cheap housing.But behind the low rent is a city struggling with high poverty and unemployment, making it more difficult for the refugees to secure jobs. And Fresno has no federally funded agency to help them find work, learn basics like bus routes and understand United States culture and rules, like with the practice of animal slaughter.Syrian children turned up unexpectedly at Ahwahnee Middle School, needing vaccinations, trauma counseling, English-language instruction and academic support as a result of interrupted schooling. \u201cIt was a shock at first,\u201d said Jose Guzman, the principal. \u201cWe never had to teach students who speak Arabic.\u201dHe hired an Arabic-speaking teaching assistant, while some of his staff communicated with students with the aid of Google Translate.Without notice, there also was no time to build political and community support for the new arrivals. So while they elicited gestures of kindness from some, they aroused suspicion from others. Some mosques, churches and a synagogue came to the refugees\u2019 aid. A local car broker donated a 1999 Toyota Avalon to one of the Syrians, Abdulrazzaq Alghraibi, a father of four who now works on the de-winging line at a poultry plant.But Muslim refugees represent a polarizing issue. Although all refugees undergo extensive screening before being approved for resettlement, some Fresnans have echoed President Trump\u2019s concerns that the vetting isn\u2019t good enough.\u201cIn my years in the valley, I\u2019ve met some great Syrian people,\u201d he said on the air during a segment about Muslim refugees. \u201cCome on, our safety is at stake here. This area they are coming from is embedded with ISIS.\u201dThat sentiment was shared by Michael Martin, a 28-year-old who works in air-conditioning maintenance. He praised Fresno\u2019s diversity, citing its Armenian and Hmong communities. As for the Syrians, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit scary because of what is going on\u201d in their home country, he said over lunch at the Chicken Pie Shop, a popular local diner.His father, Joe, was not against their presence. \u201cAnything is fine as long as they act like us,\u201d he said.There is a tradition of refugees continuing to migrate once they reach the United States. In the 1990s, about a dozen evangelical Christian families from the former Soviet Union who originally settled in Oregon and Washington followed a leader to Delta Junction, Alaska, and established a community there.Many Hmong, an ethnic group from Laos that helped the United States during the Vietnam War, left their first American homes and converged on the Twin Cities, in Minnesota, where leaders like Leng \u201cVang\u201d Wong, a former interpreter for the C.I.A., had settled.As the Syrian flow intensified, Turlock, a town about 80 miles north of Fresno that has been receiving Christian minorities from Iraq and Iran for more than a decade, was identified as a site with \u201cdecent housing, jobs and a welcoming mayor,\u201d said Karen Ferguson, executive director of the International Rescue Committee of Northern California.About 250 Syrians, overwhelmingly Muslim, were sent there. But the agency could not immediately house all of them, stranding some families in hotels for several weeks or longer.Last fall, a few members of Fresno\u2019s 15,000-strong Muslim community \u2014 Pakistanis, Yemenis, Iranians and Palestinians, among others \u2014 offered to help. Soon, they were welcoming four Syrian families to apartments that they had found for them.Word traveled fast to Turlock and elsewhere that rent in Fresno was a relative bargain \u2014 about $450 a month for a two-bedroom unit in some places \u2014 and that there were people ready to supply furniture, food, clothing and more.\u201cThey didn\u2019t realize rent is low here for a reason,\u201d he said.Abdullah Zakaria, who ran cafes in Syria, fled to Jordan with his family in 2013 after a bomb struck his house in Homs and burned his eldest child, Tasneem, now 7, whose back still bears scars. They could not find work in Turlock, so they moved to Fresno. Mr. Zakaria and his wife, Aida, are trying to start a business selling kibbehs, shawarmas and sfihas to Fresno State University students and others.\u201cFresno is bigger city,\u201d Mr. Zakaria said. \u201cI want to open restaurant.\u201dIn a blue-collar neighborhood once dubbed \u201cSin City,\u201d more than a dozen Syrian families with up to nine members apiece are crammed into two-bedroom units in two apartment blocks on East San Ramon Avenue, where the goat roast occurred in February.Some have found jobs, including at a carwash and a poultry plant. Nasser Alobeid, who worked as a security guard in Syria, is still jobless, and he and his wife, Neveen Alassad, get by with a $1,100 monthly welfare check, food stamps and help from the local community.\u201cNasser doesn\u2019t speak English,\u201d Ms. Alassad, a mother of five, said in broken English while Syrian children poured into a concrete courtyard to play.Having left a resettlement agency\u2019s fold, the refugees no longer had access to interpreters, employment training and English classes. Many couldn\u2019t afford the security deposit to rent an apartment.Help came from across the religious spectrum. The Islamic Cultural Center began paying deposits and utility bills. Wesley United Methodist Church distributed vouchers for its thrift store. Jim Call, a member of the Mormon community, collected donations to buy dining sets and TVs. Congregants from Temple Beth Israel also stepped up.Fresno\u2019s new Syrians also are relying on people like Nabih Dagher, whose Dunia International Market sells halal meat, pita bread and other Middle Eastern staples. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Dagher flipped through a notebook in which each page was filled with the name of a Syrian family and the sum owed him from each visit, $56.50 to $449.64.\u201cI give each family $20, $50 groceries free,\u201d said Mr. Dagher, a Syrian Christian who has been in the United States for 15 years. \u201cAfter that, I said you have to pay.\u201dMr. Darrah, a Baptist pastor, has also made it his mission to sell Fresno on the Syrians. Last month he led a service in an upscale retirement community, where he noted that the Syrians arriving in Fresno are \u201cmoderate or secular Muslims.\u201d\u201cEveryone is our neighbor, even Muslims,\u201d he told the worshipers. \u201cOur God said it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dSome nodded; others shook their heads. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe in what the Lord says\u201d about welcoming strangers, said one worshiper, Doris Rahm. But she added, \u201cI have concerns if they are not vetted properly.\u201dBut there have been no reports of anti-Muslim violence or vandalism. And Syrians keep arriving. Among them is Anas Hammad, a baker and father of two, who was originally settled in Michigan.Mr. Alghraibi, the new owner of the old Toyota, has invited friends living in Tennessee who had been his neighbors in a refugee camp in Turkey.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten calls from Indiana, Florida, Texas,\u201d said Mr. Darrah. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop families from coming here. \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tiny Satellites From Silicon Valley May Help Track North Korea Missiles", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years before North Korea fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile this week, the Pentagon and intelligence experts had sounded a warning: Not only was the North making progress quickly, spy satellite coverage was so spotty that the United States might not see a missile being prepared for launch.That set off an urgent but quiet search for ways to improve America\u2019s early-warning ability \u2014 and the capability to strike missiles while they are on the launchpad. The most intriguing solutions have come from Silicon Valley, where the Obama administration began investing in tiny, inexpensive civilian satellites developed to count cars in Target parking lots and monitor the growth of crops.Some in the Pentagon accustomed to relying on highly classified, multibillion-dollar satellites, which take years to develop, resisted the move. But as North Korea\u2019s missile program progressed, American officials laid out an ambitious schedule for the first of the small satellites to go up at the end of this year, or the beginning of next.Launched in clusters, some staying in orbit just a year or two, the satellites would provide coverage necessary to execute a new military contingency plan called \u201cKill Chain.\u201d It is the first step in a new strategy to use satellite imagery to identify North Korean launch sites, nuclear facilities and manufacturing capability and destroy them pre-emptively if a conflict seems imminent.Even a few extra minutes of warning might save the lives of tens of thousands of Americans \u2014 and millions of South Koreans and Japanese who already live within range of the North\u2019s missiles.\u201cKim Jong-un is racing \u2014 literally racing \u2014 to deploy a missile capability,\u201d Robert Cardillo, the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which coordinates satellite-based mapping for the government, said in an interview days before North Korea\u2019s latest launch. \u201cHis acceleration has caused us to accelerate.\u201dThe timeline for getting the satellites in orbit, which defense officials have never discussed publicly, reflects the urgency of the problem. The missile launch by North Korea on Tuesday was initiated from a new site, a mobile launcher at the Pang Hyon Aircraft Factory. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the missile \u201cis not one we have seen before.\u201dThat mobility is the problem that the new satellites, with wide coverage using radar sensors that work at night and during storms, are designed to address. Less than one-third of North Korea is under spy satellite coverage at a given moment.American intelligence analysts detected indications of an impending launch in the days before the missile firing, according to a spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency, Cmdr. William Marks. But even after the launch, the Pentagon misjudged what it was looking at. Minutes after its 37-minute flight ended, the United States Pacific Command described the missile as an intermediate-range model, often seen.Hours later, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson issued a very different conclusion: that the North had tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile, able to reach Alaska.The commercial radar push is one of several new ways the administration is seeking to counter the North Korean threat. President Trump inherited a secret effort to sabotage the North\u2019s missile launches. But its success has been spotty at best, especially of late.And joint American-South Korean missile tests, conducted hours after the ICBM test, appeared to be part of the new strategy that includes Kill Chain \u2014 the missiles were designed to reach Pyongyang, where the country\u2019s leadership lives.Mr. Moon has spoken of reviving direct talks \u2014 a so-called sunshine policy, which he advocated as chief of staff to an earlier South Korean president.But Mr. Trump has tried to build pressure, using warships, sanctions and missile defenses. He was recently presented with new options, including military ones, for responding to a sixth nuclear detonation by the North or a test of a missile that could reach the United States.\u201cThe threat is much more immediate,\u201d H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, told a conference last week at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cSo it\u2019s clear that we can\u2019t repeat the same approach \u2014 failed approach \u2014 of the past.\u201dThe new satellite initiative builds on technology created more for Wall Street than the Pentagon. From an office in an old Defense Department building within view of the Google campus in California, Raj Shah, the director of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx, is already investing in companies that exploit tiny civilian radar satellites, able to pierce darkness or storms, in hopes that the Pentagon can use them by the end of the year, or early in 2018.\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging target,\u201d said Mr. Shah, a former F-16 pilot in Iraq whose extensive experience in Silicon Valley appealed to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who set up the unit during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term and recruited Mr. Shah.\u201cThe key is using technologies that are already available, and making the modifications we need for a specific military purpose,\u201d Mr. Shah said.His unit made an investment to jump-start the development efforts of Capella Space, a Silicon Valley start-up named after a bright star. It plans to loft its first radar satellite late this year. The company says its radar fleet, if successfully deployed, will be able to monitor important targets hourly.\u201cThe entire spacecraft is the size of a backpack,\u201d said Payam Banazadeh, a founder of the company. Born in Iran, he learned satellite design at the University of Texas and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, specializing in miniaturization.Once in orbit, the payload, he added, would unfurl its antenna and solar panels.\u201cEverything is getting smaller,\u201d Mr. Banazadeh said of the craft\u2019s parts. \u201cEven the next version of the satellite is getting smaller.\u201dSeeing the early fruits of the Pentagon experiment, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is opening its doors to companies that can supply it with satellite radar data in addition to traditional images. Its outpost, set up this year, is in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley.Federal officials rarely, if ever, acknowledge the poor reconnaissance coverage of the North from traditional military satellites. But William J. Perry, the former secretary of defense, recently said in Washington that if the North rolled out a missile to hit the United States or its allies, \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance we\u2019d never see it.\u201dThe threat grew worse last year as North Korea began using solid fuels after decades of relying on liquid propellants to power its big rockets and missiles. While liquid-fueled missiles can take hours or even days of preparation, solid-fueled missiles can be fired with little or no warning.Mr. Kim has made the effort a personal project, posing next to a large solid-fueled motor after a successful ground test last year. The North followed that firing with four successful flight tests, twice last year and twice this year.The advances, said Young-Keun Chang, director of the Global Surveillance Research Center at the Korea Aerospace University in Seoul, moved the North significantly closer to a mobile intercontinental missile that could eventually pose \u201ca serious potential threat to the United States.\u201dThe key to detecting launch preparations is the near-constant presence of satellites that can see through clouds, rain, snow, foliage and camouflage and can detect the movement of military gear, including missiles. That requires space-based radars, which over the years have been highly expensive, with their big antennas and tendency to use large amounts of power. Like any radar, they fire radio waves at targets and gather faint echoes.Space-based radars can also detect changes in ground elevation that signal hidden tunnels, bunkers and even radioactive cavities left by nuclear blasts, experts say, because such hollows cause the surface above them to subside ever so slightly.But building the radars has historically been expensive for the government.In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a constellation of 21 radar satellites would cost the nation up to $94 billion \u2014 or more than $4 billion each. The report, published shortly after the North\u2019s first nuclear detonation, zeroed in on whether the satellites could track Korean missiles on mobile launchers. It called the goal \u201chighly challenging,\u201d and said 35 to 50 spacecraft would be needed to make such detections rapidly.The new generation of tiny, cheap satellites has made that outcome more achievable. Capella plans to loft its first radar satellite late this year and build up to 36 orbital radars, within the range the congressional report recommended.In addition to Capella, private companies rushing to make and exploit new generations of small radar satellites include Ursa Space Systems in Ithaca, N.Y.; UrtheCast in Vancouver, Canada; and Iceye in Espoo, Finland. Like many new companies seeking to make small satellites, most have strong ties to Silicon Valley.The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s initiative, known as the Commercial Geoint Activity, builds on programs in which the agency bought radar-satellite data from Canada, Italy and Germany as part of its evaluation of the new civilian technologies.Mr. Cardillo said the new partnerships could help the United States close the gaps in tracking Mr. Kim\u2019s rapidly expanding arsenal of threatening missiles.\u201cIf any of these companies, new or old, can help fill those gaps,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I\u2019m interested.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.videoAdvertisement"}

To say that \u201cValerian\u201d is a science-fiction epic doesn\u2019t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea.Mr. DeHaan plays Valerian and Ms. Delevingne plays Laureline, who are not his-and-hers dental hygiene products but rather soldiers in some kind of space army. They are also at least potentially a couple, a fact which authorizes a lot of dialogue that might technically be called \u201cbanter\u201d but that seems to have lost its snap after passing through Google translate a few times too many. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are as cute as a pair of baby salamanders.She\u2019s in this movie! Believe the posters, even though she shows up late and leaves early. She\u2019s called Bubble, she dances on a stripper pole and changes costumes in the blink of an eye until Mr. Besson\u2019s script cruelly casts her aside. Why?

{"Headline": "Do Egg Donors Face Long-Term Risks?", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthWhen patients consider a medical procedure, they may be told \u201cthere are no known long-term effects.\u201d But unless such effects have been systematically studied, that does not mean there are no long-term effects.That\u2019s a major concern for Dr. Jennifer Schneider, mother of a three-time egg donor, Jessica Grace Wing. Ms. Wing was a tall, lean, attractive, athletic and musically talented Stanford University student when she decided to donate her eggs to help pay for her education. Through her multiple donations, five healthy children were born to three formerly childless families.When her mother asked if egg donation was safe, Ms. Wing said she was told it was. What she did not know at the time was that no one had ever looked beyond the short-term effects of the many hormone injections needed to stimulate the release of multiple eggs at one time.Ms. Wing\u2019s cancer may have been totally unrelated to her egg donations. But given that Ms. Wing had been a health-conscious young woman with no family history of colon cancer or genes associated with this disease, Dr. Schneider wondered if the extensive hormone treatments her daughter had undergone might have stimulated growth of the cancer and if other egg donors might also be at risk.Alas, she soon discovered, it was impossible to know because no one was keeping track of the medical or psychological fate of egg donors. Once donors walk out the door, they are essentially lost to medical history.But 14 years after her daughter\u2019s death, there is still no one tracking the fate of egg donors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects information on in vitro fertilization, but not on those who donate their eggs either anonymously or to family members or friends unable to get pregnant with their own eggs.Donor eggs are typically used for women seeking pregnancy who may have undergone early menopause, have poor egg quality, a history of genetic disease, a hormonal imbalance, ovaries that fail to respond to stimulation, or are over the age of 40.\u201cEgg donors are just not on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d Dr. Schneider, who lives in Tucson and is certified in internal medicine, addiction medicine and pain management, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sperm donation, which doesn\u2019t involve hormone injections or any invasive treatments. In my opinion, egg donors need to be treated like all other organ donors \u2014 their health should be monitored.\u201dThe London doctors, K.K. Ahuja and E.G. Simons of Cromwell Hospital, called upon the British Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority \u201cto confirm that ovarian stimulation in volunteer egg donors does not increase the risk of cancer over and above the background rate.\u201d But this has yet to be done.Similar risks might also exist for women who are able to supply their own eggs for in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F. They undergo the same hormone treatments as egg donors. However, these women, who are typically older and may have endocrine or other abnormalities, are not a reliable group for determining long-term risks for young, healthy egg donors.Dr. Schneider and co-authors expressed concern as well about another group of women: those whose eggs are harvested and preserved for their own future use. They undergo the same hormone treatments, perhaps more than once if not enough healthy eggs are obtained on a first attempt. If successful, egg freezing can enable women to delay pregnancy and remain in the work force until well beyond normal childbearing years.But until more is known, Dr. Schneider has written, \u201cAll women who undergo ovarian stimulation, especially more than once, should be told that their long-term health risks are unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Half my Twitter feed was filled with people lauding it, so I decided to sign up for Tidal, the streaming music service owned by Jay Z, to listen to the album. Right now, Tidal has an exclusive on the album, which is a smart way for Jay Z to get more people to sign up for his service, which is far less popular than Spotify or Apple Music.It made me so mad I immediately canceled my subscription. Why is the music industry so broken, man? I can\u2019t deal with it.The only reason this business works at all is because investors keep pouring billions of dollars into it, in hopes these companies will eventually make money and pay them back. So basically, we have venture capitalists to thank for our infinite supply of Justin Bieber covers.Most people think cyberattacks just target people\u2019s personal computers, but now that everything is networked, much bigger systems are vulnerable to malware, ransomware and other forms of cyberattack. Air traffic control systems? Hackable. Bridges and dams? Hackable. Nuclear power plants? Also hackable. In fact, one victim of this most recent cyberattack was the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, where the computers that monitor radiation were taken offline by the attack, forcing employees to inspect radiation levels by hand. A lot of these systems are decades old and haven\u2019t been updated or patched to guard against current threats.I guess what I\u2019m asking is, does that cave have room for two?Is this a true turning point to the industry? Is it possible women may feel more empowered now to speak out against bad actors? Or do you think things will go back to gross business as usual in Silicon Valley after this news cycle passes?But I do think something is changing in the business world broadly, and Silicon Valley is the latest expression of that shift. I\u2019m very glad that women who have been wronged are speaking out in greater numbers and that their complaints are being taken seriously.But I\u2019m cynical that these companies\u2019 responses have anything to do with an ethical awakening. It\u2019s not crazy to suspect that what is driving these firms (and bigger companies like Uber, a ride-sharing start-up you may have heard of) to purge themselves of bad actors isn\u2019t morals, but opportunism. In Uber\u2019s case, the toxic workplace culture became an issue only once it began affecting recruiting and investor sentiment. In the Caldbeck case, can you imagine a venture capital firm successfully soliciting pitches from female founders after an incident like that?I guess what I\u2019m saying is: Show me a tech company that goes public with its bad behavior totally unprompted, with no reporters asking and no damning expos\u00e9s about to hit, and I\u2019ll consider the possibility that maybe this isn\u2019t all about money.Anyway, thanks for stopping by!

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Reporting on North Korea, Tech Helps Break Through Secrecy", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Choe Sang-Hun, The Times\u2019s Korea correspondent who is based in Seoul, discusses the tech he\u2019s using.As our Korea correspondent, what are some challenges you face reporting on North Korea, and how do you use tech to overcome them? North Korea is a difficult topic to report for a simple reason: Journalists are not allowed to visit and do independent reporting there. Even when they get there with a tourist visa, they are not allowed to travel, visit places and interview people the way they do in democratic countries. So journalists try to figure out what is going on inside North Korea and interpret it the best they can from the outside.And they monitor North Korea\u2019s official news media.In fact, the North\u2019s state-run news outlets, especially the websites of its ruling Workers\u2019 Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun and its Korean Central News Agency, are the single most important sources of information. When North Korea has something to say to the outside world, it almost invariably speaks through K.C.N.A. The official news media is filled with propaganda. Still, if you read it over a period of time, you can develop insights into the country\u2019s ideology, policy goals and world views.But there is a problem.South Korea blocks its people, or anyone using the internet in the country, from accessing North Korean websites. If you try to open the K.C.N.A. website, a government warning pops up. It\u2019s the same warning the government issues to internet users when it restricts access to pornographic materials online.What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for doing your job?With a few clicks, you can clip a news article, commentary, analyst paper, PDF file, video link and other contents you find on the web and want to save for a later reference, and store them in a designated online \u201cnotebook.\u201d I find this \u201cWeb Clipper\u201d function particularly useful when researching a certain topic, say North Korea\u2019s market reforms, for weeks or longer; I create a \u201cNorth Korea Economy\u201d notebook and save related contents there for easy access.What is Samsung\u2019s influence on South Korea, since the tech company\u2019s revenue accounts for a significant portion of the country\u2019s gross domestic product? Samsung is the biggest among the chaebol, a handful of family-run conglomerates that have dominated the South Korean economy for decades. The country\u2019s top 10 chaebol generate the equivalent of more than 80 percent of the country\u2019s G.D.P. Samsung\u2019s flagship company, Samsung Electronics, alone is responsible for 20 percent of the country\u2019s exports.How does Samsung affect the way you live and work?I use only three Samsung products in my office \u2014 a Samsung TV set, a Samsung fax/printer and the Samsung monitor for my Dell desktop \u2014 though many of the tech products around me at home and in my office may contain Samsung components, like computer chips.I used to use a Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone until I switched to an iPhone three years ago. I like my iPhone, but I have a major complaint about it: It doesn\u2019t allow you to record your phone conversations. What if a spokesman calls you back and dictates a statement while you are driving a car or standing in a crowded subway car? With my old Samsung phone, I could just tap the screen a couple times to record the conversation. You can\u2019t do that with an iPhone.Recording phone conversations is legal in South Korea, and journalists and others routinely do it. Samsung and others market smartphones with a built-in phone-recording function. Apple doesn\u2019t. I am thinking seriously of switching back to an Android phone when I retire my iPhone.Beyond your job, what tech product are you obsessed with in your daily life?I\u2019m not savvy with tech products. I have my desktop, my company-issued MacBook Air and my iPhone. That\u2019s about all the tech hardware I use. Online, though, I use the Naver and Daum maps all the time when I travel and go to an appointment. They are like Google maps, but more convenient to use in South Korea. Naver and Daum are the country\u2019s two biggest web portals and search engines. Google holds only a minor share in the search engine market of South Korea.I used to use my Kindle a lot, but not anymore. I have switched back to paper books. But Kindle is still very convenient when I am traveling and want to keep my bag light.Advertisement"}

Assets of two other big public power operators, based in Colorado and Oklahoma, would be sold, too, if Congress approves the measure.Debates about government and its role in land and environmental policy are always highly charged. But perhaps nowhere could the proposed changes have a more significant impact than along the great river of the West \u2014 fourth largest by volume in North America, more than 10 times that of the Hudson. Privatization would transform a government service that requires equal standards across a vast territory \u2014 from large cities to tiny hamlets \u2014 into a private operation seeking maximum returns to investors.Wringing profits from a system that has provided electricity at cost would inevitably raise prices, critics of the idea said, while supporters envision a streamlined grid open to innovations that government managers cannot imagine.CANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,0001,000250KalispellDAM OWNERSHIPColumbia R.SeattlePolsonGovernmentCoeur d'AleneSpokanePrivateWenatcheeOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONTANAWASHINGTONMissoulaYakimaAstoriaLewistonRichlandLongviewWalla WallaButteBozemanIDAHOColumbia R.PortlandPACIFICOCEANColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsSalemCorvallisBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioBoiseIdaho FallsOREGONSnake R.WYOMINGBurleyTwin FallsCALIFORNIANEVADAUTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,000Columbia R.1,000Kalispell250Coeur d'AleneSpokaneSeattleDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.PrivateMissoulaWASH.AstoriaLongviewRichlandWalla WallaButteBozemanPortlandColumbia R.Columbia riverbasinSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPACIFICOCEANBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseORE.IDAHOSnake R.WYO.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.DAM OWNERSHIPMissoulaWASH.GovernmentRichlandPrivateButteColumbia riverbasinPortlandColumbia R.BozemanSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseIDAHOORE.Snake R.PocatelloTwin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityANNUAL ENERGYOUTPUTIn average megawattsCANADAChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000MONT.Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMissoulaDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentRichlandButtePrivateColumbia R.IDAHOJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPortlandBozemanSalemColumbia riverbasinWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneOntarioBendIdaho FallsBoiseORE.PocatelloSnake R.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentPrivate2,000250WASH.Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsSeattleColumbia R.MONT.PortlandColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsBrownlee Dam340 megawattsSnake R.ORE.IDAHOUTAHCALIF.NEV.A New York Times reporter and photographer went down the river in June, bunking with a five-man tug crew over 30 hours as workers cooked their meals, rested between shifts and transited through four dams and locks. We were looking for the interconnections of electricity and navigation, private industry and government management, engineering and biology, and what is at stake in this new energy debate.The possible fate of that system is raising alarms for some, and questions for almost everyone whose life connects to the river.\u201cThe uncertainty is the biggest thing of all: How would it work?\u201d Terry Oxley, the captain of the tugboat, the Crown Point, said as he gazed out over the water, hands flicking the controls with practiced aplomb. Mr. Oxley, 63, has worked the tugs for 39 years.\u201cI guess I want more input,\u201d he added. \u201cWho\u2019s going to control it? Who\u2019s going to have the say so? When are they going to release the water, the flood control, the spill patterns for the fish? It\u2019s such a big deal, and it\u2019s all intertwined.\u201d\u201cNo room for error,\u201d he said as he slowed the tug to a crawl approaching the locks at McNary Dam, 200 miles upriver from Portland. The Crown Point had picked up a 14,000-ton load in Pasco, Wash. \u2014 three barges of wheat and one empty fuel tanker \u2014 before taking it to Vancouver, Wash. Crew members were posted on the four barges pushed by the tug, reporting back by radio as the distance to the walls of the lock narrowed to inches.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing a lot of energy,\u201d Mr. Wyatt, 41, said. \u201cWe hit something even at one mile an hour, it makes a big boom.\u201dThe dams and the locks that make up Mr. Wyatt\u2019s workplace were built by engineers who utterly transformed \u2014 or destroyed, depending on your point of view \u2014 what had been one of the wildest rivers in America.The dams blocked the river\u2019s flow, creating a network of placid reservoirs. Irrigation canals spidered out, fostering one of the nation\u2019s richest breadbaskets in the orchards and vineyards of Washington. Mammoth turbines powered the airplane factories of Puget Sound and the boom of postwar California.But development came with costs. Native American tribes saw their lands destroyed. Salmon stocks, already decimated by overfishing, were driven into further peril by rising water temperatures and dams that made it harder for fish to move up- and downriver in their ancient cycles of reproduction.Native American tribal leaders said that the old river would never come back, but that the federal government was now bound, through court decisions and treaties, to work with tribes going forward.\u201cObligations are tied to the federal relationship,\u201d said Jaime A. Pinkham, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a member of the Nez Perc\u00e9 tribe. \u201cWhen you privatize, what happens to the voice of the Indian people?\u201dThe new proposal would keep the electricity-making in government control, while spinning off the system of getting that electricity to market. Partial privatization would require complex new contracts delineating the responsibilities of the public and private partners. And what feeds into that system has grown more complicated since the 1980s as well, with a huge growth of new sources like wind and solar.But some energy experts who back the Trump plan said that despite the thorny details, a powerful word could resonate in Congress: fairness. Low prices in a nonprofit system have been a huge boost to economic growth in this corner of the nation.\u201cWe should have a debate about why some minority of Americans get subsidized power and others don\u2019t,\u201d said Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute.Government brought electricity to remote rural towns starting in the 1930s, and people there haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201cWhen you have something that works, having caution about changing it seems reasonable,\u201d he said.In cities like The Dalles, 90 minutes east of Portland, Google has become a community patron of sorts, too, residents said, with grants to libraries and schools.\u201cGoogle has been good for us,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Steve Lawrence. \u201cThey\u2019re a full partner.\u201dWind revenue is paying for the expansion of the Sherman County Courthouse and the annual dividend checks that property owners in the county have received. Kathy McCullough said kilowatt dollars had become important to her family farm\u2019s budget, hedging against fluctuations in wheat prices.Bonneville power managers repeatedly hit the off switch on wind this year in Sherman \u2014 curtailment is the term \u2014 because too much water was coming through the dams after last winter\u2019s huge snowpack, which in turn meant more hydroelectricity flowing through the grid.More curtailments have happened this year than ever before, according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, as Bonneville managers struggled to keep the system in balance. A change in ownership, supporters of the Trump plan in Sherman said, could be good for them in opening new opportunities for wind power sales.\u201cThe B.P.A. does a terrible job,\u201d Ms. McCullough said in reference to Bonneville Power. \u201cI don\u2019t know that privatizing would be bad at all.\u201dSome environmental groups also chafe against Bonneville, for the access fees that they said could discourage wind development and the system\u2019s difficulties in juggling all of the new energy sources.But Doug Howell, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in Washington State, said privatizing would not solve those problems \u2014 and could in fact make them worse.\u201cThe answer is not privatizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s integration.\u201dOne longtime veteran of river management said the new argument over the power system\u2019s future just reprised an old question: Whom does the Columbia belong to?\u201cEverybody takes a piece of the Columbia,\u201d said Tom Eckman, a senior adviser to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. \u201cAnd then they have to collaborate and cooperate over its resources, or fight over them.\u201dSource: Dam data from the Northwest Power and Conservation CouncilAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australian Journalist\u2019s Trump Teardown Goes Viral Amid Interest in G-20", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an Australian news broadcast that seems to have resonated with Americans, a political journalist delivered a scathing evaluation of President Trump\u2019s performance last week at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany.The journalist, Chris Uhlmann, said in a segment originally broadcast on the program \u201cInsiders,\u201d that Mr. Trump was an \u201cuneasy, lonely, awkward figure\u201d at the meeting and that the president \u201chas no desire and no capacity to lead the world.\u201dThe video immediately took hold on social media, and by Sunday morning had been viewed more than a million times on Twitter and Facebook \u2014 further emphasizing how viral videos, once reserved for cute kitties and humorous mishaps, have become increasingly political, and that interest in these gatherings of world leaders is no longer just for policy wonks.And Mr. Trump spurred more interest in the conference as it approached, dominating the G-20 in Google queries in the run-up to the gathering.As the event unfolded, Mr. Trump\u2019s name continued to lead global searches in Google, even as queries for other world leaders rose and fell.In part, the uptick is quite likely because Americans are now exposed to foreign perspectives as social streams cross during global summits.In the \u201cInsiders\u201d video, Mr. Uhlmann, the politics editor at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the country\u2019s main public broadcaster, assessed Mr. Trump in bold and brash terms.

{"Headline": "On Tour\u2019s Mountain Roads, Beer, Baguettes and, Briefly, Bikes", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONT DU CHAT, France \u2014 A white-haired man was dancing naked in the middle of the mountain road, his sunburned body rocking imprecisely to a pop song pounding from a set of speakers. His halfhearted attempt to cover himself with one hand as he swayed was mostly ineffectual, which only made his friends laugh harder and cover their eyes. Behind them was a 20-foot-long, homemade banner that read, \u201cVIVE LE TOUR.\u201dIt was late Saturday afternoon on Mont du Chat, a full 24 hours before the competitors of the Tour de France would ascend these brutally steep roads. But the merrymaking, as the man\u2019s striptease made clear, was already in full swing.For connoisseurs of cycling, mountain roads provide an optimal vantage point to see a race in person. On flat pavement, riders speed past in a thick pack, gone in a flash. On steep climbs, though, they lumber past, often slowly enough for fans to talk to them or touch them or even run alongside them for a bit.But reaching these roads is no easy task. Prime spots tend to be up several miles of winding pavement, on windswept outcroppings of rock, or, as here in the western edge of the Alps, cut out of thick woods. Local authorities tend to close mountain access roads in the days before the Tour passes through. There is a longtime tradition, then, of cycling fans camping out in the mountains for days, or even weeks, to claim a coveted place along the course.That type of pop-up community was on display on a recent weekend on Mont du Chat, the toughest climb during the first mountain stage of this year\u2019s Tour. In the days before the race rolled through on July 9, an impermanent society of tents and mobile homes developed, where sun-bronzed hordes of multinational partyers \u2014 nature lovers and attention seekers, rowdy young people and tranquil retirees \u2014 communed in crowded, roadside quarters.The fans had little to do but wait. But for many of them, waiting was half the fun.\u201cWe just enjoy being outside,\u201d said Ferdinand van der Duin, 67, of Groningen, the Netherlands, who sat quietly in a lawn chair on that Friday morning. Van der Duin and his family had arrived on Thursday and pitched a couple of tents on a narrow, slanted patch of grass next to the road. \u201cIf the cyclists never came up on Sunday, we\u2019d still be O.K.\u201dThere were more than two days to go before the race, but the mountainside was brimming with people.Up the road, nine men from around the French department, or region, of Is\u00e8re \u2014 mostly in their 50s and 60s \u2014 were constructing a refined dining room amid the trees, using bamboo scaffolding to support a tarp roof and an overhead lamp. They placed a citronella candle on a floral tablecloth to dissuade bugs, and their dinner left nothing to be desired: thick coins of saucisson, a dry-cured sausage, to start; a simmering pot of mahogany-hued chicken tagine; a wheel of Brie and a hefty brick of Comt\u00e9; and homemade g\u00e9n\u00e9pi, a liqueur infused with alpine herbs, to cleanse their palates.\u201cBravo to the chef,\u201d they said, clapping, after mopping the stew with bread.Wine flowed throughout. The men talked politics and howled with laughter recounting their trip to the Tour last year, when a trusting stranger stumbled upon their camp and left so drunk that he passed out in the woods.The men were lucky enough to claim one of the best views on the entire mountain \u2014 the Alps towering in the distance, Lac du Bourget shimmering below \u2014 but that was all invisible in the dark as they cleaned up their plates and refilled their glasses.A few hundred yards up the road, a group of young men in their teens and early 20s \u2014 hailing from Le Bourget-du-Lac, the town just to the east of the mountain \u2014 was only starting their night. They pulled beers from a cooler and played endless rounds of p\u00e9tanque, a French lawn game.They said that they come up to Mont du Chat often, mostly to hunt wild boar and goats. They were excited about the Tour \u2014 like many other people there, they hoped to make it onto the television broadcast of the event \u2014 but the race, they said, was just another excuse to meet up on the mountain for a good time.\u201cBefore the Tour de France we\u2019re up here, and after the Tour de France we\u2019ll still be up here,\u201d said Thibault Joram, 18, who wore a beret atop his wiry frame.At 3 a.m., the young men rumbled down the slope, setting off firecrackers and clanging an enormous cowbell. It was 6 a.m. when they finally decided to call it a night.Just a couple of hours after that, early Saturday morning, Gis\u00e8le Machet scooted up the mountain in her Peugeot 106 with a sack of baguettes on the passenger seat. Machet, 67, who lives in the nearby town of Meyrieux-Trouet, was not a camper \u2014 just a woman who understood the daily need here for fresh bread. After picking up loaves from a local bakery, she was driving up the mountain, from R.V. to R.V., to drop them off.\u201cI\u2019m doing this as a service,\u201d Machet said as she accelerated up the road. She was charging the campers her cost: 1.10 euros per loaf, no profit. \u201cIf the situation were switched,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019d do the same thing for me.\u201dSome people had arrived as early as Monday, but the mountain truly came to life on Friday afternoon. People painted the roads, leaving encouraging messages, or taunts, for the riders. Neighbors made small talk. Some campers sought out their countrymen, taking clues from license plates and flags. Les Aigles, the only restaurant on the mountain, and the site of its only toilet, did a brisk business.Otherwise time passed slowly. Inge Dienaar, 56, of Zutphen, the Netherlands, spent hours that afternoon seated on a prime corner of the course \u2014 a spot she and her husband had claimed on Thursday \u2014 crocheting a doll for her granddaughter. Her Jack Russell terrier, Ellie Bellie, sought refuge from the punishing sun under their R.V., which boasted a satellite dish, a solar generator and, crucially, a television.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a season of \u2018Inspector Morse\u2019 and the newest season of \u2018MasterChef Australia,\u2019\u201d Dienaar said.On Saturday, before the sun began to set, the police closed the road for good. Anyone traveling it up or down from that point on would have to walk or ride a bicycle along six miles of curving road.Parties in the mountains tend to get wild the night before the race, and it was no different on Mont du Chat.A group of two dozen or so young men from Le Bourget-du-Lac and Chamb\u00e9ry, a nearby city, set up turntables and speakers in a clearing that featured a heterogeneous array of objects reminiscent of an American fraternity house: a barbecue grill, a hookah, a sombrero, a flat-screen television balanced on an old wooden desk, two refrigerators filled with beer, a hammock, a shopping cart, a coffee maker, many pairs of flip-flops and assorted costumes.They planned to wear the costumes \u2014 Marge Simpson, a pig, a Dalmatian and a cockroach, among others \u2014 when they ran alongside the riders on Sunday to improve their chances of getting on television. This was the ultimate goal. When a race official suggested that the image of a syringe they had painted near their campsite, with Chris Froome\u2019s name written next to it, would hurt their chances of getting on camera, they quickly splashed it with a layer of white paint.\u201cWe have fun, but there are rules about what you cannot do,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Taravele, 27, who wore an Atlanta Falcons football helmet. \u201cWe\u2019re not stupid.\u201dUp the road, another party \u2014 the one that later would inspire the elderly man to remove his clothes \u2014 was raging. Fans danced in the middle of the road, yelling exaggerated encouragement to the last amateur cyclists chugging up the road ahead of Sunday\u2019s stage.This crew had arrived on Friday from Doussard, a town two hours to the east by car, and set up a campsite that seemed to represent a sort of platonic ideal for spectating on the mountain: majestic views of the Rh\u00f4ne in the distance, and a sharp corner with a wide portion of pavement where riders would inevitably slow. They said they scouted the location last year, when this year\u2019s route was announced.\u201cWe looked at the whole route on Google Street View,\u201d said Fabien Reitz, 29, one of the revelers. \u201cWe saw this and said, \u2018Well, there it is.\u2019\u201dSunday morning moved fast. More people arrived after hiking up the mountain. The riders started the stage from Nantua around midday, and the fans on Mont du Chat gathered around strangers\u2019 televisions and radios to track their approach. An ominous early thunderstorm fortunately cleared by late morning.Near the summit, Szymon Konieczny, 28, of Katowice, Poland, prepared enormous cutouts of his favorite riders\u2019 faces, an idea he said he had borrowed from watching the N.B.A. His wet socks hung on a wire behind him.\u201cPaint the street? That\u2019s old,\u201d Konieczny said. \u201cHold a flag? Old. A head? That\u2019s new. They will come by and say, \u2018Wow!\u2019 It will give them energy.\u201dAfter days of waiting, the mountain became engulfed in noise when the first riders arrived around 4:30 p.m. Warren Barguil of France led the group at one point and inspired crazed cheers of \u201cAllez!\u201d Froome, the three-time Tour de France winner, was close behind and was mercilessly booed and cursed the whole way up.Crowding the course, inches from the cyclists, the spectators could yell almost directly into their ears and look straight into their eyes. George Bennett of New Zealand cracked a big smile when he spotted a man dressed like an insect, furiously snapping his cloth pincers. But otherwise the riders had blank, detached expressions. Some seemed pained. A few of the stragglers received pushes from helpful fans.\u201cThey go so slowly that you can actually see the effort and see them suffering,\u201d said Caitlin Van Kooten, 28, of Chicago.It took a little more than half an hour for the entire pack to make it through, and when the last rider went over the top, the weekend (or, in a few cases, the week) came to an abrupt end. It grew eerily quiet on the mountain. Within an hour, most of the roadside tents had been packed up.\u201cYou\u2019re here so long, and then it\u2019s over so quick,\u201d said Brent van Lieshout, 19, of Oudewater, the Netherlands, as he loaded his car. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, if you think about it.\u201dBut Thomas Adelskov, 53, the mayor of Odsherred, a municipality in eastern Denmark, tried to savor the moment. He has an election in November, and he was looking for a way to spend time with his sons Mads, 27, and Jonas, 24, who live in Copenhagen.They had arrived in an R.V. on Thursday and soon met a young Danish couple who had pitched a tent nearby. The five watched the race as a group and were surprised and elated when Jakob Fuglsang of Denmark appeared near the head of the field. They screamed his name as he rode by and buzzed about the moment for hours afterward.\u201cFour days on the mountain,\u201d Adelskov said as he settled into a lawn chair surrounded by trees, \u201cand for that, it was worth it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a spectator from Chicago. She is Caitlin Van Kooten, not Van Hooten.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London\u2019s New Subway Symbolized the Future. Then Came Brexit.", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "Critic\u2019s NotebookCrossrail is a megaproject meant to bind London together. But in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, it may signal the end of an ambitious era.Supported byLONDON \u2014 Up an alley, beyond some hoarding, through what can feel like Harry Potter\u2019s secret portal, the underworld of an unfinished Crossrail station sprawls beneath the traffic and commotion of Tottenham Court Road. Escalator banks descend through a sleek, silent black ticket hall where towering, empty, white-tiled passageways snake toward the new, vaulted train platform, curving like a half moon into the subterranean darkness.But standing one recent morning on that empty Crossrail platform, where construction workers in orange gear and hard hats hauled shiny metal panels to line the walls, I still couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the new train leads toward another glorious era for this city, or signals the end of one.Before Britain voted last summer to leave the European Union, Crossrail was conceived for a London open to the world and speeding into the future. Now, with Brexit, the nightmare scenario is that this massive project, to provide more trains moving more people more quickly through a growing city, ends up moving fewer people more quickly through a shrinking city.It was an especially unpromising sign this spring when Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative government, as if fearing exactly what anti-Brexiters predicted about an economic downturn, issued a campaign manifesto that conspicuously omitted funding for Crossrail 2, the long-planned, $39 billion critical north-south sequel to Crossrail\u2019s east-west line.Since then, the government\u2019s transport secretary has endorsed the project \u2014 provided that the city pay half the whopping cost, upfront. The semi-reversal suggested a grudging acknowledgment that, whatever the political fallout or economic prospects, Britain ultimately needs a thriving London all the more after Brexit.These megaprojects, in different ways, helped remake London into the great global city-state of Europe, a 21st-century melting pot and Sybaris of culture and free-market prosperity \u2014 at the same time that they clearly exacerbated underlying urban inefficiencies and stirred resentment elsewhere in England toward the city.Crossrail was intended as a kind of democratizing corrective, at once shrinking the city and expanding on a vision of London as a great, inclusive metropolis. While it will whisk bankers at new speeds from their office towers and multimillion-dollar aeries to Heathrow, it will also help millions of now-marginalized, lower-income workers, unable to afford runaway home prices in and around the center of the city, to live in cheaper neighborhoods often far from their jobs.And as London goes, so goes Britain.I spent a few days traveling the Crossrail route, trying to decipher what it might mean for London. In one respect, the train underscores and extends the city\u2019s centuries-old, traditional identity as a sprawling, horizontal capital, an agglomeration of disparate, far-flung villages.Extending roughly 70 miles, it is built to speed about 200 million passengers a year in a kind of Y from far to the west of the city, in the county of Berkshire, through Heathrow, to the heart of London, forking east to Shenfield in Essex and to the neighborhood called Abbey Wood, on the historically neglected southeast side of the River Thames. Linked with the existing Underground subway network, it will be rechristened the Elizabeth Line, inserting what is in effect a new steel-and-wheels spine into Britain\u2019s capital.\u201cCrossrail is a culmination of years of serious thinking by experts and public officials about what London needs, the imbalance of east and west and how to unite the city,\u201d said Ricky Burdett, an architect, city adviser and director of LSE Cities at the London School of Economics.London, Mr. Burdett noted, is historically poor in the east, rich in the west and along the periphery, although that east-west distinction has eroded as gentrification has seeped outward. Underserved and long-disconnected East London neighborhoods like Shoreditch and Whitechapel in recent years have become chic and largely unaffordable to many Londoners. The city has added light-rail lines to help some of those areas, but only Crossrail is capable of \u201ctying together many of the developments that have transformed London,\u201d Mr. Burdett said.No development on the west end of the Crossrail line is more ambitious than Heathrow. John Holland-Kaye, the airport\u2019s chief executive officer, met me one morning in an empty conference room near the airport and instantly ticked off some figures.\u201cWhen Crossrail is done, our employees could just as easily come from East London as from our local community,\u201d Mr. Holland-Kaye said. \u201cThe train effectively opens up the whole of the city.\u201dKing\u2019s Cross today is home to an art school, The Guardian, a cluster of high-tech medical research centers and Google\u2019s future European headquarters. The point: Major, long-term infrastructure projects support game-changing investments. Crossrail proves Britain\u2019s continuing commitment to this steel and concrete approach, Mr. Holland-Kaye said.From Heathrow, riders will need just over a half-hour via Crossrail to travel east to Canary Wharf, the defunct docklands turned world financial hub, which today employs more than 112,000 people. When the site opened in the late 1980s, the aptly named Narrow Street was its only real access road. Canary Wharf went belly up. Then London broke ground for the Jubilee subway line, linking Canary Wharf by mass transit to the heart of the city, and international banks started moving in.It illuminated Crossrail.\u201cThe danger with Brexit,\u201d he added, \u201cis that if Britain gets out of the European Union and doesn\u2019t keep the U.K. an attractive place for financial institutions, they will think twice about growing here. The issue isn\u2019t banks leaving Canary Wharf. Most of them have long-term leases. The issue will be the pace of growth.\u201dBut that\u2019s not quite true. Because of Brexit worries, construction plans for several of Canary Wharf\u2019s new buildings have already been put on hold. And long-term leases can always be broken.\u201cThe bottom line is that nobody has the faintest idea yet what the Brexit effect will be,\u201d Tony Travers, a veteran urban policy expert, told me. \u201cInvestments from the European Union may shrink. But why would investors from India or Canada or the United States be put off? If anything, Brexit may make Britain more likely to give them what they want.\u201d\u201cThe trajectory of real estate investment here is not only based on Europeans,\u201d Mr. Burdett stressed.\u201cThamesmead was built on a promise of transit connectivity that never happened,\u201d Teresa Pearce, a member of Parliament who represents the district, told me. \u201cYou see the results.\u201dChange is even more acute one stop before Abbey Wood, in Woolwich. The Berkeley Group, a big British real estate company, is building 5,000 sleek, mostly high-end apartments around the future Crossrail station, which the developer paid millions to help construct.Hugging the Thames, Woolwich is the former site of the Royal Arsenal and Henry VIII\u2019s dockyard, where Charles Darwin\u2019s Beagle was built. Historically working-class, it, too, used to be all white but has come to attract Caribbean and Asian immigrants, with nearly 40 percent of residents today living in social housing. Berkeley\u2019s development and the Woolwich Crossrail station are separated from the rest of Woolwich by a highway called Plumstead Road. On one side of the road, old Woolwich is a warren of modest shops and aged social housing.On the other, baristas now dispense macchiatos on leafy patios. Signs advertise luxury apartments. A single, 31-year-old corporate lawyer employed in the City, Calum Docherty, who is hunting for a home, was intrigued by the Berkeley development. \u201cBut I\u2019m still looking,\u201d he told me. \u201cWoolwich wasn\u2019t anywhere on my radar before Crossrail. The train has expanded my concept of London.\u201cThat said, it\u2019s a bit of a mental jump to commit to borrowing half a million pounds,\u201d he added. \u201cWith Brexit and all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the $20 billion train line opening in London next year. It is one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Europe, but not necessarily the largest. (It bills itself as such, but so does a project in France.) In addition, the article misstated the time period during which New York built four new subway stations. It is nearly three decades, since 1989, not \u201cabout a half-century.\u201dAdvertisement"}

London\u2019s biggest rival, according to analysts, is probably the New York Stock Exchange.What the F.C.A. proposes is to create a category of premium listing specifically for state-owned companies. The twist: Interactions between these corporations and their sovereign controlling owners won\u2019t be treated as related-party transactions, meaning they won\u2019t require approval by other shareholders.Here\u2019s what the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, had to say:\u201cSovereign owners are different from private sector individuals or companies \u2014 both in their motivations and in their nature. Investors have long recognized this and capital markets are well adapted to assess the treatment of other investors by sovereign countries.\u201dGoogle has scored a victory in one of its European legal battles.The French tax authorities plan to appeal, according to a statement from the office of the country\u2019s budget minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin.Uber drivers are a step further forward in their fight to be classified as employees rather than independent contractors.The plaintiffs can now seek out roughly 18,000 other Uber drivers who opted out of arbitration in their contracts with the company and invite them to join the case. They will still have a way to go \u2014 after the discovery phase of the case, the court will make a final determination as to whether the plaintiffs can proceed in a true class action.The status of Uber\u2019s drivers has always been a contentious issue \u2014 many of them felt they were captive to the company rules and demands and should be accorded the protections and benefits of traditional employees.Mr. Clayton\u2019s nomination as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission drew criticism from people who said that had spent most of his career representing big corporate clients; he was a partner in a prominent New York law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell.In his first public speech in his new role, Mr. Clayton offered few specific policy recommendations. But he did call for the creation of an advisory board to review transparency in the bond market and for a continued crackdown on stock swindles.He also tried to balance his concern for investor protection with trying to reduce regulatory obstacles that deter companies from going public.The gaggle of reporters gathered around the Sun Valley Lodge, blocked from attending any of Allen & Co.\u2019s events, have dutifully noted the usual parade of moguls, including Timothy D.

Must be willing to fix a broken culture, deal with an aggressive predecessor, battle a risky lawsuit and prepare the company for an initial public offering. Self-starters preferred.Quite a few people, as it turns out.\u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity for someone who\u2019s wired for problem solving and wants to make their mark by turning around the image of the company,\u201d said Jason Hanold, managing partner at Hanold Associates, a boutique executive search firm. \u201cYes, they\u2019re inheriting Uber\u2019s entire toxic culture. But they\u2019re also getting thousands of employees who are hungry to change it.\u201dThe chance of having an impact is high. Apart from the opportunity to steer a turnaround, any chief executive would be walking into a company that has already reached enormous scale. As a result, changes made by a new chief would affect millions of people globally, not to mention Uber\u2019s work force of more than 15,000 employees and hundreds of thousands of contract drivers.The eventual chief executive would also have the opportunity to take Uber public. The company, which began in 2009, is now the highest-valued private company in the world, with a valuation of around $70 billion. And while Uber is unprofitable, its revenue has been growing. That would make an initial public offering a huge event on Wall Street, as well as for Silicon Valley investors who have billions of dollars wagered on Uber\u2019s success.For now, Uber\u2019s executive search committee, which includes five members of its board, has kept the lid tight on the list of candidates. After a torrent of leaks before Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure, two of the people familiar with the search said there has been a renewed effort to keep quiet.Among those up for consideration have been Susan Wojcicki, who leads YouTube. Others include Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s former chief operating officer; David Cush, a former chief executive at Virgin America; the former Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer; and Thomas Staggs, a former chief operating officer at Disney, according to three other people familiar with the search. It was unclear what level of interest, if any, these executives had expressed in the Uber job.Others, like the former Google sales executive Nikesh Arora, have been quietly advancing themselves for the position, according to two of the people.Mr. Bain, Mr. Cush, Ms. Mayer, Mr. Staggs and Mr. Arora did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A YouTube spokesman declined to comment about Ms. Wojcicki.Some candidates have expressed concern over how Uber\u2019s board operates, especially because Mr. Kalanick retains a seat. Mr. Kalanick, who remains a significant Uber shareholder, has been active in the search for his replacement, according to two of the people familiar with the candidates, although the candidates have been assured that they would have autonomy as chief executive.While the job will make Uber\u2019s next chief executive wealthy, it will not necessarily make him or her filthy rich: With the company\u2019s valuation already so high, any stock doled out to a new chief would most likely have to experience an enormous rise in value after a public offering for the returns to be considerable.Yet the positives of the job still outweigh the negatives for hopeful applicants.\u201cEven with all the problems that companies like Uber have, there will always be top candidates who want to go there,\u201d Mr. Hanold said. \u201cThese people are problem solvers: The hairier a scenario is, the more they\u2019re attracted to trying to fix it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is a gripping and sophisticated account of how James R. Fitzgerald (Mr. Worthington), then a newly minted F.B.I. profiler, upended a lot of the bureau\u2019s assumptions in pursuing the suspect who became known in popular lore as the Unabomber (Mr. Bettany). The supporting cast includes Chris Noth as Fitzgerald\u2019s supervisor and Jane Lynch as Janet Reno, the attorney general in the mid-1990s.\u201cManhunt: Unabomber\u201d might seem an incongruity in a schedule anchored with shows like \u201cNaked and Afraid\u201d and \u201cDeadliest Catch.\u201d But not to John Goldwyn, a producer who had worked with Mr. Ross on the Fox series \u201cGracepoint\u201d and on another good fact-based series for Discovery, \u201cHarley and the Davidsons.\u201dThe network, he said, has always liked American history, and it has always liked aspirational stories in which a protagonist confronts a challenge, whether it\u2019s the sea, the wilderness or a resistant law enforcement bureaucracy.\u201cIn their success, they change the world in which they live,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said.After establishing the hunt narrative, the series breaks from it and devotes a full episode to this chapter in Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s youth. It\u2019s a brash decision, but Mr. Goldwyn said that he made sure Mr. Sodroski\u2019s voice and vision would be preserved with the selection of a television veteran, Greg Yaitanes (whose credits include \u201cBanshee,\u201d a show that helped broaden Cinemax\u2019s lineup), to direct all eight episodes and serve as showrunner.\u201cGreg has a famous reputation for protecting the voice of young writers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he understood that the idea was not to make Ted into a monster.\u201dMr. Yaitanes said that it would have been a mistake to offer a straightforward pursuit-and-capture chronicle, especially with such a well-documented case.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to plot this in a way that is saving the reveal, I think that is ultimately disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a Google search away from spoiling it. It\u2019s not as simple as catching someone. As amazing as that story was, it was only the beginning.\u201dMr. Kaczynski is hardly made into a hero, but the series doesn\u2019t flinch from examining what drove him to murder.\u201cIt was important to examine the case from all angles and directions,\u201d Mr. Yaitanes said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the weaponizing of a civilian by the United States government.\u201dIn a time when headlines are devoted to radicalized terrorists abroad and sometimes at home, that gives the series a fascinating present-day relevance. So does its inevitable revisiting of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s manifesto about the insidiousness of technology and its ability to take over our lives.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly relevant to today,\u201d noted Mr. Yaitanes, who banned cellphones from the set to focus his crew\u2019s attention on this very message. \u201cThis guy prophesied exactly where we\u2019d be 20 years ago.\u201d\u201cWe felt that we had this tremendous opportunity with these two actors,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said, referring to Mr. Worthington and Mr. Bettany. \u201cThe audience would feel cheated if we didn\u2019t find opportunities for these two Goliaths to face off.\u201dIt\u2019s a delicious confrontation; disingenuous, perhaps, but no more so than countless other enhancements of reality used in such dramatizations. Mr. Goldwyn said that the fictional face-to-face reflects a real fear of Mr. Fitzgerald and others that the warrant that got them into Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s Montana cabin could be thrown out.Mr. Ross said that his vision for remaking the channel wasn\u2019t to flush out the old content and replace it with a full slate of premium series. Instead, he wants enough ambitious offerings that the regular audience is periodically surprised and new viewers become intrigued.It seems a reasonable bet \u2014 after all, just because you might enjoy shark shows doesn\u2019t mean you want to watch only shark shows.Mr. Bettany, for one, thinks people will find good TV no matter where it is.\u201cIt\u2019s like the wild West with television,\u201d he said, recalling a lunch with Kevin Spacey a few years ago at which Mr. Spacey shocked him by saying not only that he intended to do a TV series, but also that the series \u2014 you\u2019ve heard of it; \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 was going to be on Netflix. \u201cThe paradigm is shifting all the time, and content is king.\u201dA Critic\u2019s Notebook article on Tuesday about the Discovery Channel show \u201cManhunt: Unabomber\u201d misstated the surname of the F.B.I. profiler portrayed by Sam Worthington.

{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Gets a Tech Makeover", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlso last year, in a less publicized development, Jean Yang, 30, returned to this city after more than a decade of living in Boston, finding a Pittsburgh she hardly recognized from her 1990s childhood.These seemingly unrelated events have one thing in common: Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s School of Computer Science.Because of the top students and research professors at Carnegie Mellon, tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber have opened offices here.The big tech firms, along with their highly skilled, highly paid workers, have made Pittsburgh younger and more international and helped to transform once-derelict neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and East Liberty.\u201cI loved C.M.U., and that\u2019s the main reason why I stayed,\u201d said Mr. von Ahn, who, in addition to his role at Duolingo, is a consulting professor in the School of Computer Science.There were also business advantages to remaining: Duolingo is close to the engineering talent (\u201cC.M.U. is pumping out some of the best, at a rate of about 500 a year,\u201d Mr. von Ahn said), and for millennial job-seekers, Pittsburgh\u2019s quality-of-life-metric is looking better these days than ever-costlier, ever-more-crowded New York or San Francisco.For Mr. Wirth, the software engineer who started at Duolingo in February, Silicon Valley is a fun place to visit, but living and working in the Bay Area would be a grind.\u201cI was just there last week for a conference,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. \u201cI was talking to someone who told me, \u2018My commute is two hours on the bus.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do that.\u201dKamal Nigam, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who is the head of Google Pittsburgh, said that a decade ago, workers hired by the company had family or personal connections to the city.

In the 1990s, Allegheny County, which includes the city, was the second-oldest large county in the United States, behind only a geriatric zone in Florida. It was a notoriously difficult place to be young and single, and an earlier generation of computer science students put in their four years at Carnegie Mellon, grabbed their diplomas and left.This is the sleepy city Jean Yang knew while growing up near the campus, where her father was a research scientist in the School of Computer Science. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize no one wanted to stay in Pittsburgh,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI was just leaving because I thought everyone wants to leave where they grew up. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come back as an adult.\u201dBut Ms. Yang\u2019s field of research is in computer programming languages, and, as she put it, \u201cC.M.U. is the best place for the kind of work I want to do.\u201d When she was offered an assistant professor position in the School of Computer Science and discovered a changed Pittsburgh on her visits back, Ms. Yang accepted the job and returned last August.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an excitement about being here,\u201d she said. \u201cI go out to eat and drink in East Liberty. Lawrenceville I go to a lot. Everywhere I go didn\u2019t exist when I was growing up.\u201dPut simply, where the tech world is going \u2014 self-driving cars; personal A.I. concierges; robot workers \u2014 is where Carnegie Mellon\u2019s faculty and students have been for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s like being in Hogwarts,\u201d said Andrew W. Moore, the dean of the School of Computer Science. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool and exciting to have these glimpses of the future, and to see all these people running around and having these crazy ideas.\u201d\u201cI get to see these cool things all the time and I\u2019m just stopping to say, \u2018Well, what does this even mean for the world?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou start thinking, \u2018Someone can use this in dance class.\u2019 Then you think: \u2018Wait. Can we use this to judge gymnastics competitions?\u2019 Then you say, \u2018Wait, couldn\u2019t we use this in securing Penn Station in New York?\u2019\u201dSpeaking of Red Whittaker, the professor who led Carnegie Mellon in winning the $2 million Darpa Urban Challenge self-driving car competition in 2007, Mr. Gutkind said, \u201cRed was into self-driving vehicles before anyone,\u201d using Carnegie Mellon\u2019s resources and reaching out to local investors for money and technical support.A legend in the robotics field, Professor Whittaker turns out also to be a gentrification pioneer: He was instrumental in locating the school\u2019s National Robotics Engineering Center in an abandoned foundry in Lawrenceville, in 1996.\u201cLawrenceville was in the lost and found, it was really rough,\u201d he said, adding that the introduction of a state-of-the-art research facility and its educated work force was, among other developments in the area, a \u201ccatalyst and galvanizing influence\u201d for the neighborhood.\u201cThe real estate and the culture of the neighborhood was a very big thing for robotics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd robotics was a very big thing for the neighborhood.\u201dWhich means even a Monocle reporter being dispatched to check out the Espresso a Mano cafe with its rotating exhibitions by local artists can be traced back to the geeks, in a six-degrees-of-Carnegie-Mellon sort of way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Get Ready for the Internet of Louis Vuitton Things", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RunwayYet another luxury brand has decided to tackle the knotty problem of wearables.The latest gladiator to take on the challenge is Louis Vuitton, which on Tuesday introduced its first smartwatch, the Tambour Horizon, the newest addition to the Tambour watch family, the signature timepiece the company debuted 15 years ago.\u201cFor us,\u201d he said, \u201cthe aesthetic is nonnegotiable.\u201dAnd, as it turns out, it is also only the beginning of Vuitton\u2019s plans for merging style and technology. Unlike the other fashion brands that have dipped their toes in the high tech waters, Vuitton has designs on connecting many of their products.\u201cLook, the internet of things is really only going to get bigger,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cYou can sit on the sidelines and watch, or dive in and participate and try to influence where things go. We\u2019re diving in.\u201dThe watch is stage one. So is it any good?Made in conjunction with Google and Qualcomm Technology, with a case made in Switzerland, the Tambour Horizon does what most smartwatches do \u2014 it alerts you to your email and texts, counts your steps, has lots of apps \u2014 though it does not contain a heart monitor and is not meant to replace the phone. It works with both Apple and Android devices and has a battery life of about a day. Like the Apple Watch, it charges when you click on to a magnetic pad, connects to your phone via Bluetooth and also works with Wi-Fi. It comes in three finishes (polished steel, brushed steel and full black), and it has 30 different straps for men and 30 for women, which snap on and off with a satisfying ease.But the Vuitton watch is a small step forward in certain areas.First, the watch face (which can be customized like a handbag in myriad ways \u2014 with various dials, with different color stripes, with Vuitton\u2019s monogram, with your monogram), never entirely goes dark. It fades a bit in sleep mode, but unlike, say, the Apple Watch, it does not become a black hole when your arm is at rest, thus obviating the need to wave said arm around endlessly to wake it up and so not look like an adult version of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d transporter.In addition, the Tambour, like the new mechanical Tambour Moon, has a convex side case, which allows maximum face diameter with minimum weight. So even though it\u2019s quite chunky for a watch, it is less chunky than some of its smart peers (42 mm in diameter, as opposed to 46 mm). That said, it still looks like a smartwatch.Second, it contains a cool proprietary app associated with the Louis Vuitton city guides. The watch will know where you are at what time and, like a very good concierge, will be able to recommend the best nearby restaurant or bar or shop in seven world capitals. It also has a special travel app, which can track the progress of any flight and let you know of delays, gate changes, wait times and so on.The downside is you have to give it access to all your ticket information, which seems to me somewhat suboptimal from a privacy point of view. But when you do, Vuitton will sign a pledge stating that it will not share or use the information for any purpose other than helping you plan your travel.Third, it works in China. Vuitton has made special deals with local platforms like Weibo so that the corresponding platforms in the West will automatically switch for usage when appropriate. This is important to Vuitton, because the Chinese are its largest global watch consumer group, and to the rest of us, because if you\u2019re going to invest in a smartwatch, it would be very frustrating to have it not work while on a trip to one of the world\u2019s political and economic powers.The problem is the value proposition.The steel Tambours cost about $2,450, with the black version ringing in at $2,900. And though the operating system will receive the usual updates and could theoretically last five years or more, like any smartphone, its practical life span (i.e., the point at which it becomes obsolete because there\u2019s just a much cooler, newer option) is about two years. Maybe three.And $2,450 every two years \u2014 which, if you are a gadget freak, and most people attracted to this kind of watch probably are, is what you will be paying as you chase the next gen iteration \u2014 seems like an awful lot of money. Not to mention antithetical to the promise of luxury, and a brand like Vuitton, which is that its bags last \u2026 well, forever.After all, in acknowledgment of that somewhat truncated life span, most fashion smartwatches sell in the $200 to $350 range. The Apple Watch Sport starts at $269, and the Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s starts at $1,149. The Tag Heuer Connected is about $1,600, but unlike that watch, which was introduced with the promise that once it became pass\u00e9, owners could bring it in for credit toward an analog watch, the Vuitton smartwatch comes with no trade-up or -in incentives. Mr. Burke does not see it as an issue.\u201cIt\u2019s more akin to buying a pair of shoes,\u201d he said. When it was pointed out to him that most shoes do not cost more than $2,000 a pair, he said, \u201cit depends on the shoes.\u201dIn any case, Mr. Burke has high hopes for the Tambour Horizon, which he thinks can double Vuitton\u2019s watch sales, currently a pretty small percentage of Louis Vuitton revenues. (He refused to be more specific than that.) And after that?Well, the latest line of Vuitton luggage, designed by Marc Newson, is also called the Horizon, so presumably that will get the connected treatment next. Then the company is looking into making connected footwear, and connected ready-to-wear. The point being: \u201cto participate in the future,\u201d Mr. Burke said.\u201cIn the early 20th century we built helicopters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean we were going to turn into Boeing or Airbus. But it meant we were part of the conversation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook, Seeking to Satisfy Publishers, May Let Them Charge for Articles", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is working on a new tool that could help drive subscriptions to news organizations that publish articles directly on the online service, an effort to improve the fraught relationship between the social giant and media companies.The tool would be added to Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product, which allows publishers to post news articles that can be read within Facebook rather than on the publisher\u2019s website.The discussions about the tool are still in the early stages, according to two people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were not public. But it is possible that Facebook could produce a metered pay wall product similar to those used by some publishers. After reading 10 New York Times articles on Facebook, for instance, a user could be sent to The Times\u2019s subscription sign-up page.Facebook plans to start a pilot with a small group of publishers using the tool in October and to expand the initiative in 2018 if early results are promising. It was not clear which publishers might participate in the test.\u201cWe are in early talks with several news publishers about how we might better support subscription business models on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cAs part of the Facebook Journalism Project, we are taking the time to work closely together with our partners and understand their needs.\u201dWhile nearly all publishers have shifted their attention to increasing digital revenue, most are still seeking profitable solutions that will work in the long term.Although many publishers recognize the importance of online platforms for getting their content in front of broad audiences, there are also drawbacks. Publishers are concerned about losing valuable ties to their readers, particularly subscriber data and payment connections. Readers may also become accustomed to staying in Facebook to consume news, instead of, say, navigating directly to publishers\u2019 sites.At the same time, Facebook has drawn criticism, particularly from publishers, for its role in distributing untrue articles that readers can mistake for real news.It is not clear if Facebook will benefit financially from a news subscription feature. The company does not intend to take a cut of payments to news outlets, according to one of the people familiar with the talks. Facebook indirectly benefits, however, by encouraging people to spend more time on its site; while they are there, those users will see more ads.As more publishers move toward subscription models, a news subscription service like the one Facebook has proposed could work to their advantage by driving more casual readers to pay for news.But it could have risks. If many news outlets participate in the feature, it could create a bundling effect, allowing readers to read potentially hundreds of free articles a month \u2014 10 from The New York Times, 10 from The Washington Post, 10 from The Wall Street Journal, and so on \u2014 before they are asked to pay.An earlier version of this article misidentified the news outlet that first reported Facebook\u2019s plan to introduce a new subscription tool. It was The Wall Street Journal, not Digiday.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Google Engineer Learns the Fashion Code", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, the man who assembled this virtual paradise for style lovers held a dim view of the fashion world. \u201cI would not say I was interested in fashion as a subject,\u201d Mr. Sood said. \u201cI viewed fashion as a slightly elitist area.\u201dTurning to Ms. Lauterbach, 32, he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t know who invented the black dress until Kate told me. I definitely had to educate myself.\u201dIn his efforts to bring himself up to speed, Mr. Sood, who is in his late 30s, turned to some of the industry\u2019s heavyweights as his guides. He recalled a two-hour meeting with Paul Smith that occurred in a curiosity room the designer maintains in his London office.Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net-a-Porter, told Mr. Sood that he could not simply upload beautiful photos of clothes as he had planned; he had to visit garment workshops and speak to curators to get the stories behind their creation.And, as if making a pilgrimage to the Mount Olympus of fashion, Mr. Sood met with Anna Wintour, who steered him toward her friend Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Met\u2019s Costume Institute.For all his charming bumbling on the subject, Mr. Sood may be more of a dedicated follower of fashion than he lets on. He has visited Tokyo 14 times by his count and can name-check Japanese designers like Chitose Abe and Junya Watanabe.At a splashy party Google recently held at the Met to unveil the We Wear Culture archive, Mr. Sood wore a linen blazer by Junya Watanabe and shoes by the British heritage brand Edward Green. He also managed not break into hives when he conversed with Ms. Wintour.Using the archive he helped create, Mr. Sood has been able to immerse himself in fashion\u2019s details. Most recently, he studied lace.\u201cAnd then I went out and purchased my first lace tie, because I learned lace is not actually only for women,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a query search.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: As Index Funds Rise, Stock Pickers Lament", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnology stocks are soaring. Money is being poured into low-cost exchange-traded funds. And these funds are piling into companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 known as the FANG stocks for the companies\u2019 first initials.That is putting stock pickers at traditional mutual funds into an existential crisis.They are finding it ever more difficult to beat the broader market, especially as FANG stocks outpace the rest.Still, fears remain about the rise of machines and such passive investing distorting the market, not the least because Amazon, with its deal for Whole Foods, poses a threat to several companies in which Parnassus owns stock.The team at Parnassus \u2014 where business suits and ties prevail despite being based in the tech hub of San Francisco \u2014 has chosen instead to bet on other areas like life sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d argues Benjamin E. Allen, a partner on the Parnassus equity fund. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dExuberant investors are also creating concerns at the Federal Reserve.Some Fed officials want to start within a few months, while others want to hold off until the end of the year, according to the minutes of their most recent meeting in June.The concern is that it has become cheaper and easier to borrow money in some cases \u2014 not what the Fed intended \u2014 and there is some evidence of investors taking larger risks. William Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has suggested raising rates more quickly if markets don\u2019t respond to rate increases.It is known for making photocopiers and printers, but the Japanese company Konica Minolta has its eye on the health care industry and expanding abroad.The Japanese government is lending a helping hand: A state-backed investment fund is teaming with Konica Minolta to take a 40 percent share in the testing company. Konica Minolta will be following in the footsteps of other Japanese companies, notably Fujifilm, in its efforts to diversify as revenue and profit shrink in its core business.Ambry, which specializes in genetic testing and analyzing databases of genetic information to screen for diseases, made information public last year that was based on data from thousands of people it had tested. It said the move would aid drug research and other efforts to combat diseases.Advertisement"}
