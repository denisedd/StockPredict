{"Headline": "Private Equity\u2019s Big Bets on Financial Tech", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsPrivate equity firms are rushing to bet on financial technology.Permira Capital Partners, Advent International and Bain Capital have all recently announced acquisitions of payment processors in the hope of capitalizing on the cashless zeitgeist. The Blackstone Group and CVC Capital Partners, which just offered $3.7 billion for Paysafe of Britain, are placing a double wager.Paysafe\u2019s quirk is that approximately half of its revenue comes from online gambling and gaming. Investors have struggled with the associated risks \u2014 notably from Paysafe\u2019s Asian business, which brings in about a fifth of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. A short-seller\u2019s report alleging unsavory dealings in China wiped 38 percent off the company\u2019s share price last December. Though the stock recovered, Paysafe still suffers from a stubborn valuation discount to peers like Worldpay and Nets \u2014 both acquisition targets themselves.The buyout firms therefore spy an opportunity. They will end up paying close to $4.7 billion for Paysafe, factoring in fees, net debt and the extra borrowings from a $470 million acquisition it announced on Friday.Assuming that the new owners can quickly sell the Asian business for a fairly modest five times Ebitda, their outlay would fall to around $4.4 billion. That is about 12 times the approximately $370 million of Ebitda that Paysafe is on course to make in 2018.From there, the odds are in the private equity firms\u2019 favor. Assume they fund around 40 percent of the acquisition with debt, that Paysafe\u2019s Ebitda grows at around 10 percent annually for the next five years and that the owners use about one-third of that to pay down borrowings.At the same multiple of 12 times Ebitda, Paysafe could have an enterprise value of $7 billion, with $850 million of net debt. That implies equity worth close to $6.2 billion at the end of five years \u2014 2.5 times the buyout firms\u2019 original investment, and equivalent to an annualized return of 20 percent.Put more simply, Blackstone and CVC stand to make a decent return not just from riding the digital payments bandwagon, but also for taking on risk that public-market investors are less comfortable shouldering.It is hardly radical. But ultimately, that kind of willingness to wade into the dicier corners of finance is what private equity is for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian-American Lobbyist Attended Meeting Organized by Trump\u2019s Son", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He is a veteran of the Red Army, photographed in the 1980s with fellow soldiers in a Russian birch forest. He collects fine art, likes opera and owns a nearly $2 million townhouse in trendy Logan Circle, in the center of Washington. He often zips around the city on a bright orange bicycle.On Friday, Rinat Akhmetshin, the Soviet army veteran, revealed another detail of an exotic life: He was one of the people at the meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.Mr. Akhmetshin, a naturalized American citizen who talks openly of his past in a K.G.B. counterintelligence unit focused on hunting spies in the Russian military, is well known in diplomatic and media circles in Washington, where he has worked for years on behalf of business and political interests in Russia and other former Soviet states.Mr. Akhmetshin, who wears his curly hair high in a manner that associates compare to the protagonist in the 1977 cult-classic horror film \u201cEraserhead,\u201d said in the interview that he took part in the meeting at the request of Ms. Veselnitskaya. He said he had no ties to the Kremlin.\u201cI am a target of well-coordinated and financed smear campaign,\u2019\u2019 he said in a text message.He described his time in the military as routine, serving from 1986 to 1988, like \u201cmillions of other Soviet boys.\u201d He said he left the military with the rank of sergeant.Mr. Akhmetshin has boasted to associates that he had served in the military with a group known as the Osoby Otdel, or Special Section, which in the Soviet period was a division of the K.G.B. The group was distinct from the G.R.U., or Main Intelligence Directorate of the defense ministry, an organization with which he has denied any affiliation.Those who know Mr. Akhmetshin describe him as a devoted parent, ferrying his school-age daughter to extracurricular activities around Washington. He speaks with a slight accent and is a voracious reader of classic American novels.Mr. Akhmetshin emigrated to the United States in 1994 to attend graduate school, he said. He became involved in Washington advocacy work in 1998 when he responded to an ad, leading to a job running an organization pushing what he described as a pro-democracy agenda for Kazakhstan. The position was arranged by Edward Lieberman, a Washington lawyer who has extensive business experience in Russia.The veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who met Mr. Akhmetshin through Mr. Lieberman, said that despite Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s work to repeal the Magnitsky Act, he is cleareyed about the Russian government.\u201cHe is not a whore for Putin,\u201d said Mr. Hersh, who moderated a panel arranged by Mr. Akhmetshin after a Washington screening of a film critical of the dead Russian accountant for whom the Magnitsky Act is named. Mr. Hersh said Mr. Akhmetshin cared a great deal about getting the restrictions on adoptions rescinded.The emails revealed that Donald Trump Jr. also invited Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and a campaign adviser, as well as Paul J. Manafort, who at the time was the Trump campaign chairman. Rob Goldstone, a publicist and former British tabloid reporter who helped broker the meeting, was also there.But Donald Trump Jr. did not disclose that other people who were not mentioned in the emails were also in attendance, including Mr. Akhmetshin and a translator. In his interview with The Times, Mr. Akhmetshin identified the translator as Anatoli Samochornov.Mr. Samochornov, in an interview with The Times on Monday, declined to say whether he had been in the meeting. But he did say that he was working with Ms. Veselnitskaya at the time of the Trump Tower meeting on efforts related to the Magnitsky Act and adoptions.Alan S. Futerfas, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s attorney, suggested in an interview on Friday that his client has not disclosed all the details of the meeting because it was hard to remember. \u201cThe frustrating part of this exercise is that it concerns events that occurred 13 months ago that were considered insignificant at the time and essentially forgotten,\u201d Mr. Futerfas said.Mr. Akhmetshin said he lobbies for a nonprofit group, the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, that records show is affiliated with Russian businessmen who have ties to the Russian government, including Denis Katsyv, whose businesses have been represented by Ms. Veselnitskaya.The foundation registered to lobby the United States Congress on issues related to the Magnitsky Act and adoptions two days after the Trump Tower meeting.Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s team initially said the June 2016 meeting focused on those issues. Yet Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Akhmetshin did not mention the meeting to most members of their lobbying team working on the issue, according to the lobbyists.A spokesman for Cozen O\u2019Connor Public Strategies, one of the lobbying firms, said they were unaware of the June 2016 meeting \u2014 or the participation of Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Akhmetshin \u2014 until media reports revealed it.The Justice Department contacted Mr. Akhmetshin in March and asked him why he did not register his work for the nonprofit group under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, which requires anyone who lobbies in the United States on behalf of foreign interests to disclose their work to the Justice Department. Mr. Akhmetshin responded to the Justice Department in April, saying he had properly registered under congressional lobbying rules.In 2015, International Mineral Resources, a mining company based in the Netherlands, accused Mr. Akhmetshin of hacking into its computer systems, stealing confidential information and unlawfully disseminating it as part of a smear campaign orchestrated by a rival Russian mining firm.Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian lobbyist, also attended the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. In 2015, a Netherlands-based mining company accused Mr. Akhmetshin of hacking into its computer systems and unlawfully disseminating confidential information as part of a smear campaign by a rival Russian firm. The firm later dropped its lawsuit and withdrew all allegations.The allegations were part of civil suits that International Mineral Resources filed in Washington and New York accusing the Russian firm, EuroChem VolgaKaliy, of corporate espionage.Mr. Akhmetshin said the accusations against him were false, and last year the Netherlands company withdrew all its allegations of illegal hacking. Lawyers for the Netherlands firm did not respond to phone calls or emails Friday asking for comment on the outcome of the suit.Before it withdrew its complaints, the firm accused Mr. Akhmetshin of an elaborate scheme to steal emails and other confidential information from its computer system and disseminate it to help its Russian competitor, which it said was controlled by Andrey Melnichenko, a Russian billionaire. The firm claimed that the Russian company\u2019s law firm paid Mr. Akhmetshin $145,000 in 2012 and 2013 to steal about 50 gigabytes of confidential information from its computer system, including the emails, personal contact lists and passport information of its executives and secret financial information about the firm.In one email, according to the New York complaint, Mr. Akhmetshin informed the law firm that he had made good progress and the project was \u201cup and running and it is churning up information.\u201d Mr. Akhmetshin vehemently denied he had hacked the firm\u2019s computers. \u201cI have never done so, nor do I have the skills to do so,\u201d he said in a declaration in the federal suit.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a translator who attended the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.

{"Headline": "As Venezuela Prepares to Vote, Some Fear an End to Democracy", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne by one, the markers of Venezuela\u2019s democracy have been pushed aside.Now, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is pushing a radical plan to consolidate his leftist movement\u2019s grip over the nation: He is creating a political body with the power to rewrite the country\u2019s Constitution and reshuffle \u2014 or dismantle \u2014 any branch of government seen as disloyal.The new body, called a constituent assembly, is expected to grant virtually unlimited authority to the country\u2019s leftists.Venezuelans are going to the polls on Sunday to weigh in on the plan. But they will not have the option of rejecting it, even though some polls show that large majorities oppose the assembly\u2019s creation. Instead, voters will be asked only to pick the assembly\u2019s delegates, choosing from a list of stalwarts of Mr. Maduro\u2019s political movement.The new assembly will rule above all other governmental powers \u2014 technically even the president \u2014 with the kind of unchecked authority not seen since the juntas that haunted Latin American countries in decades past.\u201cThis is an existential threat to Venezuelan democracy,\u201d said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group.The list of delegates includes powerful members of the president\u2019s political movement, including Diosdado Cabello, a top lawmaker in the ruling Socialist Party who was involved in a failed coup attempt in the 1990s, and Cilia Flores, the president\u2019s wife.But the push to consolidate power also puts the country at a crossroads, one laden with risk.Even the members of the new assembly themselves are a wild card. Their power will be so vast that they could possibly remove Mr. Maduro from office, some analysts note, ending a presidency that has been deeply unpopular, even among many leftists.\u201cIt\u2019s a crapshoot, a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said Alejandro Velasco, a Venezuelan historian at New York University who studies the country\u2019s leftist movements. \u201cYou do this and you have so little control over how it plays out.\u201dMr. Maduro contends that the government restructuring is necessary to prevent more bloodshed on the streets and save Venezuela\u2019s failing economy, which is dogged by shortages of food and medicine.The president has refused to negotiate with street protesters, calling some of them terrorists and asserting that they are financed by outside governments trying to overthrow him. A new governing charter would give him wide-ranging tools to \u201cconstruct peace,\u201d he and leftists have said.\u201cWe need order, justice,\u201d Mr. Maduro said during an interview with state television this month. \u201cWe have only one option, a national constituent assembly.\u201dThe turmoil gripping Venezuela illustrates the sweeping declines in popularity for the Venezuelan left since the death of its standard-bearer, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in 2013.It was Mr. Ch\u00e1vez who oversaw the last rewrite of the Constitution, in 1999, which was widely backed by the voters who had propelled him to office in the belief that the country\u2019s rule book favored the rich.That new Constitution \u2014 and rising oil prices \u2014 fueled a Socialist-inspired transformation in Venezuela. It helped enable Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to redistribute state wealth to the poor, nationalize foreign assets and make him popular with his supporters. The Constitution also left open the possibility of another constituent assembly in the future.Now Mr. Maduro has taken that option at a time when the leftists are dogged by their deepest crisis in decades. This time, Venezuelans are seeing it less as a stab at reform than as an attempt by a struggling ruling class to maintain power.\u201cIt\u2019s a last-ditch effort to secure his base,\u201d Mr. Velasco said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing it at a moment of weakness.\u201dUnder the rules of the vote, the constituent assembly would take the reins of the country within 72 hours of being officially certified, though it is unclear to most people what would happen after that.Some politicians have already suggested that governorships and mayors be replaced with \u201ccommunal councils.\u201d Top members of Mr. Maduro\u2019s party have identified Luisa Ortega, the attorney general, who has criticized Mr. Maduro\u2019s crackdown on protesters, as someone to be immediately dismissed.But many fear that a likely first step will be the abolition of the country\u2019s legislature, a tactic first used by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez when rewriting the Constitution in 1999.Juan Guaid\u00f3, an opposition lawmaker, fears that the constituent assembly will dismantle his chamber, effectively liquidating any political power held by Mr. Maduro\u2019s rivals.\u201cIf there was anything left of Venezuela\u2019s battered democracy, it was the powers that were legitimately elected by the people, like the National Assembly,\u201d he said. The vote would create a \u201ctotalitarian and repressive dictatorship.\u201dStill, some say the opposition has failed to offer clear alternatives to Mr. Maduro. Eva Golinger, an American lawyer who was a confidante of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s, said rivals of the leftists had focused too heavily on wresting power from the president, something that could risk a wider civil conflict.\u201cThey only rally around regime change,\u201d said Ms. Golinger, who opposes how Mr. Maduro has gone about the constitutional rewrite.The constituent assembly would also be able to take on one piece of work left unfinished by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez: creating a more Socialist Constitution.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez later tried to amend his 1999 document with changes that he argued would speed the course of his populist revolution. But the additional measures were narrowly defeated when they were taken to voters in 2007.Mr. Maduro has indicated that he intends to pick up where Mr. Ch\u00e1vez left off. He has suggested a nine-point outline that includes increasing public spending for education and health care, giving Socialist organizations increased governing abilities and taking unspecified measures to prevent foreign meddling in Venezuela.Analysts also expect that the new Constitution could dig deeper into the economic policy favored by the president, which many economists blame for exacerbating the country\u2019s economic crisis.With much of the opposition expected to boycott the vote, it was mainly Venezuelans loyal to Mr. Maduro\u2019s party who were eager to head to the polls on Sunday.Mar\u00eda Elena P\u00e9rez, 54, a leftist activist in Caracas, the capital, said it was time for a new rule book.\u201cThe current Constitution is weak, and there\u2019s a lot that needs to be fixed,\u201d she said.In the week ahead of the vote, potential delegates were making their pitches on Venezuelan airwaves.In one video, Ysmael Modoy, a candidate from the western state of Portuguesa, urged voters to defend Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy and promised a new Constitution that better battled corruption.Some sought a lighthearted tone. Antonio Le\u00f3n, a candidate who goes by the nickname the Mask, entered his commercial dancing and singing while crossing an empty street. He didn\u2019t address any changes to the Constitution, but promised voters that he would make it easier to get government rations.\u201cRemember: You are love, you are life,\u201d he said before returning to his dance.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tasmanian Hep C Buyers\u2019 Club", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesCHENNAI, India \u2014 In 2014, when Greg Jefferys\u2019s urine started smelling like dead meat, he knew there was something seriously wrong.For weeks, Jefferys, an Australian then 60 years old, had felt fatigued and noticed that just a slight bump would leave a dark purple bruise on his skin. Blood tests revealed to Jefferys that he had chronic hepatitis C \u2013 a disease he\u2019d never heard of.The hepatitis C virus attacks the liver. It infects an estimated 80 million to 150 million people worldwide. It\u2019s transmitted through blood and if left untreated can cause liver cirrhosis, cancer and ultimately death. The virus is closely associated with the use of injectable drugs \u2013 something Jefferys did briefly as a 19-year-old.At the time of his discovery, the only treatment available in Australia was an unpopular interferon-based therapy \u2014 unpopular because patients had to inject themselves in the stomach for nine months. The injections were painful and had potentially devastating side effects, including blindness and permanent liver damage.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d Jefferys said from his home in Tasmania, an island state off Australia\u2019s south coast.Jefferys, a tall man with a thick silver mustache and beard, knew Gilead Sciences had developed a better option: a highly tolerable 12-week oral treatment with high cure rates, called sofosbuvir and sold under the brand name Sovaldi.While the drug had been approved in the United States and Europe, it wasn\u2019t yet approved in Australia. And in the United States, the retail price was $1,000 per daily pill \u2014 $84,000 in total.But Jefferys also read that in late 2014, Gilead issued India a voluntary license to allow the manufacture of generic versions of sofosbuvir. The purpose was to allow patients in poorer countries to buy the drug. (Last week, the World Health Organization prequalified the first generic version of sofosbuvir, which means it can now be procured by the United Nations and other financing agencies. This raises hopes it will become available to more people in developing countries at a further discounted price.)Jefferys wasn\u2019t poor, but he knew it was his only chance at a cure. He bought a ticket to Chennai, a city in southern India, and took $1,000 \u2013 the cost of a full 12-week regimen in India.Having never been to India before, he found its traffic, smells and overwhelming poverty a stark contrast to his quiet island life, in which his spare time was mainly spent fishing.Before he arrived, he contacted a doctor and a pharmaceutical supplier online. When he met them, he purchased three bottles of pills \u2014 a complete course.\u201cIt was a high-price item, and I had to pay cash,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I was doing a big drug deal.\u201dThe 12-week course was exactly what Australia\u2019s regulatory body, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, would allow him to import under its Personal Importation Scheme.It worked. Eleven days into treatment, Jefferys\u2019s liver enzymes had returned to normal, and after four weeks the virus could no longer be detected.Today, the cost means that both public and private insurers ration the drugs. In some countries, including the United States, many public and private insurers put tight restrictions on patients\u2019 use of drugs and alcohol and will not cover the drugs if a patient\u2019s use of either is continual. (Substance abuse reduces the chances the patient will take the medicines correctly.) Other patients find they can\u2019t get coverage because their disease is not advanced enough \u2014 which is exactly what the drugs work to prevent.\u201cIt\u2019s like someone being told they have cancer, but to come back when the cancer is bigger,\u201d Jefferys said. That said, he understands that if governments treated everyone who had the disease, \u201cit would bankrupt any health system.\u201dHe started receiving hundreds of emails a day from hepatitis C sufferers in other countries, asking for advice. He decided to start helping patients travel to India, or he connected them with trusted pharmaceutical suppliers who could send generic versions of Harvoni and Sovaldi to their home countries.The demand grew so big he knew he couldn\u2019t do it alone. So he helped other former hepatitis C sufferers set up informal buyers\u2019 clubs in their own countries. He worked with an Australian doctor, James Freeman, who went on to set up a website that also facilitates people\u2019s access to generic medicines.It works like this: If you\u2019re a patient who doesn\u2019t want to travel to India, you send Jefferys $1,000 along with an identification form and a prescription. Within 10 days you receive your generic Sovaldi or Harvoni, shipped from India.If you can\u2019t get a prescription (some countries prohibit doctors from prescribing generic medicines), a medical report showing that you have hepatitis C will suffice. Jefferys asks for a $200 fee for his service, but it\u2019s optional. \u201cI don\u2019t want to profit from people\u2019s sickness. There\u2019s enough of that going on already, so I will remove my fee if you ask,\u201d his website says.If the story sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s similar to the model set by Ron Woodroof, an AIDS patient in the United States who in the 1980s began smuggling unapproved medicines from Mexico into Texas to treat his symptoms, and then began distributing the drugs to other patients. His story was adapted for the film \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d in 2013.While Australia, Britain and the United States allow the personal importation of a three-month supply of medicines under certain regulations, some countries, like Canada, ban personal importation altogether.Jefferys is reluctant to talk about his work with people in Canada. \u201cFrom a legal point of view, I\u2019m just facilitating people\u2019s access to drugs,\u201d he said. As for his methods, he said, \u201cI cannot reveal all because some are illegal. I\u2019m perfectly happy to break laws and get people treatment. You\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives.\u201dNarcyz Ghinea, a researcher in health ethics at the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney, says the online facilitation of access to unapproved drugs raises a lot of questions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very disruptive innovation that could change the way we think about medicines\u2019 access,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can buy medicines online that aren\u2019t approved in your own country, then what is the role of the regulator? The government doesn\u2019t approve it \u2014 so what?\u201dGhinea believes the popularity of personal importation could become a powerful negotiating tool to reduce drug prices. But he worries that the purchase of cheaper generic drugs overseas could undercut the market and reduce pharmaceutical companies\u2019 incentive to develop drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni. It could also compromise discount plans provided to low-income countries.Another risk is that the drugs could be fakes. Gilead, like other pharmaceutical manufacturers, said that counterfeit drugs are its foremost concern, because the source and quality of medicines obtained through buyers\u2019 clubs are unknown. But those who run the informal buyers\u2019 clubs insist they work only with licensed pharmaceutical suppliers.Parag Jain is the chief executive of Bull Pharmachem in Mumbai, a licensed wholesale distribution house. It provides hepatitis C drugs to those referred through Jefferys\u2019s club and other buyers\u2019 clubs around the world. He said that demand for other generics is high. \u201cI\u2019m shipping drugs for cancer, hepatitis B and C and H.I.V. to close to 25 countries at the moment,\u201d Jain said.\u201cDrugs for these diseases are available in Russia, U.S., Europe, South America and the U.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to look at what available actually means in the broader context. The fact you can\u2019t afford it means that it\u2019s not available to you.\u201dJefferys doesn\u2019t see much fishing in his future. \u201cPersonal importation is happening more and more,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very happy doing nothing much but fishing, but I\u2019ll continue doing this until there\u2019s no need for me to do it anymore.\u201dElle Hurley, 39, from Fort Worth, found out that she had hepatitis C in 2010, when she was pregnant with her second daughter. There was no cure at the time. In 2014, when she found out about Harvoni through a friend and anticipated beating the disease, it turned out that she was too early. She couldn\u2019t afford the drugs, and Medicaid deemed her not sick enough to cover them.But when she came across the story of Jefferys online, she thought, why not go to India? She\u2019d always been fascinated by Mumbai.\u201cI could either take a leap of faith or die a miserable death,\u201d she said.After she landed in Mumbai in June 2016, she had the medicine within five days, with Jain\u2019s help. The bottles immediately went into the hotel safe before she called her family. \u201cI was crying, and I told them I was coming home,\u201d she said.Hurley vividly remembers taking her first pill: in the car when her husband picked her up from the airport. Nine weeks after beginning treatment, the virus was undetected.\u201cIt was the best day of my life,\u201d she said.Personal importation is not the way the world will get access to a hepatitis C cure. It\u2019s a short-term stopgap for a few, one that highlights problems with drug costs, access and the role regulatory bodies play.\u201cIt\u2019s a miraculous discovery,\u201d Jefferys said of Sovaldi. \u201cBut it\u2019s just such a pity it\u2019s being exploited so heavily for profit and being denied to so many people.\u201dSophie Cousins is a freelance health journalist based in South Asia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Skinny\u2019 Obamacare Repeal Is a Terrible Idea", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSkinny is often read as good today. We like skinny jeans, skinny models and, apparently, skinny health reform. It is likely that the Senate, which has just rejected repeal-and-replace and repeal-without-replace bills, will vote on a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. What does this actually mean, and what would it produce?The proposal most often labeled \u201cskinny\u201d would repeal the insurance mandate for individuals and larger employers under the banner of choice and freedom \u2014 both standard objectives of conservatives. It also would repeal taxes on medical-device manufacturers and, perhaps, also on insurers, with the goal of reducing the costs that must be reflected in premiums.On the surface, both of those changes seem modest and reasonable. But I can assure Congress, as a former insurance company chief executive, that they would lead to a bloated upscale version of the Medicaid expansion so hated by conservatives. The result would be not only the loss of coverage for millions of people but also an even bigger bill for the government to pick up.You have to look at the dynamics of the insurance market to understand this. To survive, an insurer has to predict the risk of costly claims and to obtain sufficient enrollment to balance customers who need a lot of health care with enrollees who have few or no claims. This works because while an insurer can\u2019t know the timing or severity of illness for an individual, it can estimate the average claims of a group of individuals fairly well.In health care, some individual needs are predictable \u2014 young people use less, and those with chronic conditions demand more. The only way to obtain a reasonable average is to have a broad pool, like the employees of a company covered by a group plan.The individual market never had this natural grouping, so premiums varied widely, as did coverage, if it was available at all. The Obamacare individual mandate was intended to produce a representative group and to keep average premiums in bounds.But a variety of problems resulted in predictably higher premium rates for insurance exchanges. The mandated coverage for qualified health plans was broader, enrollment was skewed by pricing that favored older customers, and risk-reduction mechanisms were insufficiently funded. Most of those can be laid at the feet of the Republican Congress and of President Trump for his sabotage in limiting enforcement of the mandate, cutting enrollment efforts and threatening to withhold the risk-sharing payments for low-income enrollees.Others sticking it out have bet that their higher premiums, combined with the loss of competitors, will let them cover the higher risk. They are probably right. The widely predicted \u201cdeath spiral\u201d won\u2019t happen: Subsidies provide a low ceiling on the net premium for over three-quarters of enrollees.So what will it mean for individuals if the mandate is jettisoned in a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d? Those receiving subsidies will be largely immune to higher costs \u2014 their increased premiums will be offset by larger government subsidies \u2014 but it\u2019s actually middle-income people without subsidies who will be priced out of the market.Those remaining in the exchanges will be receiving much higher subsidies because of the higher premiums, making them very similar to existing Medicaid beneficiaries. This is why the likely outcome is a much bigger tab for the government.In effect, a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d will result in an unintended expansion of ever larger government subsidies to the working poor. The difference is that those people will have higher incomes than allowed under normal Medicaid or the expanded Medicaid coverage that has been so controversial in red states.Some liberals may consider this extension of Medicaid-like coverage to be good policy that provides an on-ramp for the working poor to higher incomes and jobs with benefits. Yet the loss of insurance for millions of others is a steep cost for that expansion.Those Republicans who advocate \u201cskinny repeal\u201d as just a lighter version of \u201crepeal and replace\u201d are likely to be very surprised at the unintended result.

{"Headline": "In Russia\u2019s Far East, a Fledgling Las Vegas for Asia\u2019s Gamblers", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARTEM, Russia \u2014 On Russia\u2019s eastern rim, where endemic corruption and bureaucratic sloth conspire to hold back the economic dynamism enriching the rest of Asia, a shimmering palace rises from a dark forest in an improbable effort to tap into the wealth of nearby China, Japan and South Korea.At a time when few Chinese or other investors want to take a gamble on Russia, the forest property, 4,000 miles east of Moscow, beckons deep-pocketed Asians who not only do not mind risk but delight in it \u2014 and are ready to wager their money on the baccarat tables and roulette wheels of the Russian Far East\u2019s fledgling answer to Las Vegas.Tigre de Cristal, the lone casino so far in what the authorities in nearby Vladivostok hope will become a vast \u201cintegrated entertainment zone\u201d with eight different betting palaces, is Russia\u2019s biggest gambling complex. Financed largely by a Hong Kong company, Summit Ascent, it is also the single biggest Chinese investment in a region that President Vladimir V. Putin has tried to turn into a showcase of Russia\u2019s \u201cpivot to the East.\u201dEver since Nikita S. Khrushchev stopped off in the Russian Far East after a trip to California in 1959 and decreed that Vladivostok had become \u201ca second San Francisco,\u201d the port city\u2019s formidable assets \u2014 great natural beauty, location in Asia and a highly educated population \u2014 have stirred bold dreams. These have all been followed by bitter disappointment.Under Mr. Putin, Moscow has poured billions of dollars into the area, paying for huge bridges, a new university campus and other costly state-directed projects. But despite ever closer relations between Moscow and Beijing, said Artyom Lukin, an international studies professor at the Far East Federal University, \u201cRussia has realized that free Chinese money is not coming.\u201dChinese gamblers are arriving, however, if only because gambling is illegal in their own country, except in Macau on the southern coast near Hong Kong, and because the forest northeast of Vladivostok offers the only accessible casino for the more than 100 million Chinese who live in provinces just across the border from Russia.Li Yunhui, a 45-year-old businessman and gambler from Mudanjiang, a Chinese city about 150 miles from Vladivostok, said the Russian casino lacked the amenities and service of established gambling centers like Macau, but added: \u201cAt least it is close. And the air is clean.\u201dHe said he had visited Vladivostok regularly since the early 1990s and could not fathom why Russia had lagged so far behind China in building its economy. \u201cIt feels like a developing country here. This is how China was decades ago,\u201d he said. He added that he had tried to set up a small business in Vladivostok but had despaired at all the red tape: \u201cWhat you can do in a day in China takes weeks here.\u201dThe gambling venture is itself a showcase of how slowly things gets done. Government officials began pursuing the idea nearly a decade ago. They enlisted a well-connected local businessman, Oleg Drozdov, to build the hotel and casino complex now housing Tigre de Cristal. But Mr. Drozdov was arrested in 2013 on corruption charges after the ouster of the Primorye region\u2019s disgraced former governor, Sergey Darkin.Summit Ascent, the Hong Kong company that now owns 60 percent of the casino venture, took over the concrete shell left by Mr. Drozdov\u2019s builders and, after investing $200 million with other investors, finished the construction and opened the casino at the end of 2015. The company, which reported a modest profit for last year, now plans to invest an additional $500 million to build a second luxury hotel, a golf club, extra gambling rooms and other facilities in the same entertainment zone.Four other casinos planned by other companies, due to be open by now, are far behind schedule. Empty plots of land with scant signs of construction dot the forest. A Russian court recently canceled the casino project of a Russian developer because it was too slow in getting off the ground.Eric Landheer, Summit Ascent\u2019s director for corporate finance and strategy in Hong Kong, said that his company had \u201cfirst mover advantage and a monopoly,\u201d but that it did not want to be alone in the forest for long because gamblers preferred a more vibrant cluster of casinos.Gambling has a long and often troubled history in Russia, where attitudes have been shaped by the Orthodox Church, which opposes casinos as the devil\u2019s work, and by the writings of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a gambling addict who explored the allure and perils of addiction in his novel \u201cThe Gambler.\u201dA champion of traditional Christian values, Mr. Putin banned casinos and slot machines in 2009, complaining that too many Russians \u201close their last penny and pensions through gambling.\u201dHaving Chinese and other foreigners lose their money, however, is apparently not a problem. Indeed, their losses now cover the salaries of around 1,000 Russians working for the Tigre de Cristal casino and provide a badly needed source of income for the Primorsky region around Vladivostok, a city that, aside from corruption-addled, state-funded infrastructure projects, has struggled to attract outside investment. Closed to foreigners during the Soviet era, the city now has regular flights to and from Harbin, Beijing and other Chinese cities, and can also be reached by road and train.To make the fleecing of foreigners and a restricted number of Russians possible, Moscow gave permission for the establishment of four special gambling zones. The westernmost of these, in Kaliningrad, targets gamblers from neighboring Poland, while the others are in the resort town of Sochi and in the Siberian region of Altai.Russians are also allowed to gamble at the Tigre de Cristal, so long as they show their passports and register. This has not gone down well with Russian priests and those who see casinos as a poor substitute for healthy economic development.\u201cAnyone who has read Dostoyevsky knows all the problems that gambling brings,\u201d complained Andrei Kalachinsky, a veteran journalist in Vladivostok. \u201cThe spread of prostitution will definitely create jobs, but what kind?\u201dTransportation infrastructure has been another problem. A new highway connecting the casino area to the Vladivostok airport turns into a mud track in the final stretch. A winding road to the center of Vladivostok, around 35 miles away, is so clogged with traffic that Yuri Trutnev, Mr. Putin\u2019s envoy for the Russian Far East, proposed opening a ferry service to speed up the journey to the casino.The authorities have also been sluggish in delivering on a promise of visa-free entry for visitors from China and other selected countries. Despite the delay, Chinese can still obtain visas relatively easily if they sign up for a tour, and their numbers visiting Vladivostok and the surrounding Primorsky last year more than doubled to around 300,000.Yuri Kuchin, an opposition member of the Vladivostok City Council, said local bureaucrats usually hindered rather than helped foreign investments, dragging their feet on most issues unless there is a financial benefit for themselves. While a bitter critic of the government, he said he supported the foreign-led casino project as a source of jobs and a good way to squeeze out illegal gambling dens in the area, which he said were often protected by corrupt officials.The Primorye Development Corporation, the government agency now responsible for the project, declined to say what was being done to combat illegal clubs or explain how the casino project fit into the region\u2019s overall development strategy.A number of foreign projects in Vladivostok have fizzled, including two five-star Hyatt Hotels that were supposed to have opened for business five years ago but are still under construction. Yet the Tigre de Cristal casino, though delayed by various mishaps like the arrest of a local business partner, is now not only up and running, but is making a profit.Lawrence Ho, Summit Ascent\u2019s chairman and son of the Macau gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, acknowledged in a report to investors that the \u201cyear has not been without its challenges\u201d but said, \u201cOver all, I am very optimistic about the potential of our investment in the jewel of the Russian Far East.\u201dThe most lucrative sources of business at the casino are Chinese high-rollers recruited by so-called junket operators, agents who find gamblers, provide credit, make travel arrangements and manage private V.I.P. rooms at the casino. For these services, the casino pays the junket operators a chunk of what it wins from their clients \u2014 more, Mr. Landheer said, than the 40 percent to 50 percent paid to them in Macau.All the same, Tommy Li, a junket manager from northeastern China, complained that Vladivostok offered few of the attractions of Macau and was far too cold in winter. Its only real appeal for Chinese gamblers, he said, is its proximity.One of his main gripes is that there are not enough prostitutes, who he said were far more readily available, and cheaper, in Macau. Mr. Landheer, the corporate finance director, said his company was not in the business of providing prostitutes and would \u201clike to see all illegal activities eliminated.\u201dBut, he added, there \u201care many other service providers\u201d in Vladivostok ready to satisfy all the gamblers\u2019 needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Party Drifts Left, Pragmatic Democratic Governors Have Eye on White House", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Many elected Democrats have drifted left since the party\u2019s shattering defeat last November, turning to a brand of progressive politics that is closer to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s democratic socialism than the more market-friendly liberalism that characterized the Obama era.But when the nation\u2019s governors gathered here over the weekend for their annual summer meeting, a group of pragmatic Democrats took center stage. And now one of them is taking the first steps toward seeking the presidency in 2020.\u201cI believe the time is right to lend my voice, the voice of someone that after getting elected has been able to govern in what\u2019s viewed as a red state,\u201d Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana said in an interview. \u201cSome of the things that I\u2019ve been able to do in Montana can also translate beyond just the state\u2019s border.\u201dMr. Bullock is creating a federal political action committee, Big Sky Values PAC, that will offer a political infrastructure to let him meet Democratic donors, contribute to the party\u2019s candidates and fund his out-of-state electoral travels.As is typical for most potential candidates this far out from the next White House campaign, he said it was premature to discuss whether he would actually run.Yet Mr. Bullock already has the makings of a national stump speech. He boasts about his progressive accomplishments with a Republican-dominated legislature: He expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, cutting the rate of the state\u2019s uninsured by over half, implemented stricter campaign finance laws and made Montana one of the few states to increase support for higher education.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks out there talking that are a lot older than middle-aged guys like me,\u201d said Mr. Bullock, 51, alluding to some of the party\u2019s best-known figures.And if the contrast with the likes of Mr. Sanders, 75, were not obvious enough, the governor held up one of his accomplishments against one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s calling cards.\u201cWe can talk free college for all all we want, but there\u2019s a whole lot of people that can get a darn good job, like in Montana, out of an apprenticeship,\u201d Mr. Bullock said, citing programs he has supported as governor. \u201cSixty-thousand-dollar average salary, and they\u2019re making money while they\u2019re getting there.\u201dHe also said he was uneasy about immediately implementing another of Mr. Sanders\u2019s signature promises, Medicare for all.He may be more overt about his ambitions, but Mr. Bullock was by no means the only Democratic governor here eyeing the White House.Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, the chairman of the National Governors Association, exuberantly led a panel that drew Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk, with an eye toward raising his profile. The host governor, Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, may also be open to a presidential run.And while each is from a decidedly more Democratic state than Mr. Bullock, both are also unapologetic, business-friendly pragmatists with a focus on economic development that borders on obsessive.Mr. McAuliffe will not retreat from his support for free trade pacts, slyly noting that he stands with \u201cthe president\u201d (as in: Barack Obama) on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.And Ms. Raimondo, noting that \u201call I\u2019m doing is jobs,\u201d recalled with a touch of incredulity how she recently gave an economic speech and was told afterward by attendees that it was \u201crisky\u201d to \u201chave that pro-growth, pro-job message as a Democrat.\u201dRecounting her efforts to promote apprenticeships in Rhode Island\u2019s shipyards, Ms. Raimondo echoed Mr. Bullock on free college for all. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they ever go and get a four-year degree or not,\u201d she said, warning her party not to be \u201csnobby\u201d about higher education.The challenge for the would-be presidential contenders on the center left, however, can be found in how Mr. Trump found success.Unlike Republican nominees before him, the president ran on a platform of racially tinged nationalism, vowing to tear up trade deals and protect entitlements while using language rarely heard from mainstream politicians about minority communities.In attempting to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, many Democrats have therefore chalked it up to his racial demagogy and rhetorical populism. They find the first of these tactics reprehensible, but many have an impulse to counter the president with their own, more robust brand of populism.This reaction does not point toward budget-balancing governors preaching pragmatism.Yet the whims of political fate can be fickle.After the 2004 election, Democrats\u2019 second consecutive presidential loss, some in the party believed that they could win in 2008 only by nominating a red-state centrist. They won with an African-American Chicagoan named Barack Hussein Obama.And after their own back-to-back presidential defeats, Republicans said after 2012 that the path back to the White House could be found in nominating a candidate better able to connect with the younger and more diverse rising American electorate. Enter Mr. Trump.So there may be hope yet for Mr. Bullock, a former state attorney general whose down-home boosterism about Montana\u2019s natural wonders belies a Columbia Law degree and stint as a Washington lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson. He has already started on the Democratic speaking circuit, appearing before a Center for American Progress forum in May. Next week, he will attend another donor-filled gathering on the \u201cDivided States of America\u201d at the Aspen Institute.To the barricades it is not.\u201cThe values folks want is for government to run its own budgets and be as careful with their money as a family is with their own,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Maids and Nannies for Jihad", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Ayu is a 34-year-old Indonesian maid, and the head of a pro-Islamic State network in Hong Kong. She recruits, raises funds and spreads propaganda for the group. She is just one of several dozen Indonesian domestic workers in East Asia known to endorse jihad.Ayu \u2014 I\u2019m using a pseudonym, because she fears trouble from the police \u2014 became pregnant young, ran away from abusive in-laws and left her baby behind to go work in Hong Kong in 2003. She consumed alcohol and drugs to numb depression. In late 2011, after losing her job as a maid for the third time, she went to Macau, sleeping on the streets for months, until she overdosed.A Muslim only nominally until then, she now sought spiritual refuge. Surfing Islamic websites, she became absorbed by news of the war in Syria. She began to befriend international jihadis on social media. She returned to Hong Kong and enrolled in an Islamic course run by a puritan, though non-extremist, Salafist institute \u2014 but left it in mid-2014 when her teacher reported her to the police because she had voiced support for the Islamic State.She started translating propaganda material for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from English into Indonesian and spreading it on Twitter and the messaging app Telegram. After marrying an Indonesian jihadi she\u2019d met on Facebook, she was introduced to the inner circles of Indonesian pro-ISIS groups.Some 500,000 migrants from Indonesia work in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, most of them, like Ayu, women employed as maids, nannies or caretakers for the elderly. Based on official reports by the Indonesian police and interviews and social media monitoring conducted by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), where I am a researcher, about 45 Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong alone have been identified as active supporters of the Islamic State. There may be twice as many.These numbers may seem small, but the radicalization of Indonesian maids and nannies working in East Asia is alarming. It takes very few dedicated people to do considerable harm, and these supporters of jihad are more resourceful than others: Their incomes are much higher than those of most Indonesians, they speak better English and they have more contacts internationally.Two Indonesian women who had been migrant workers were foiled last December as they were preparing suicide bombings at the presidential palace in Jakarta and a tourist site in Bali. Others have traveled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, provided funds to the group, recruited new members or connected local jihadis with fighters in Syria and Iraq.Far less activity of the kind has been recorded among the roughly one million Indonesian domestic helpers working in the Persian Gulf. Only about a dozen radical maids in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are active on social media, for example. None is reported to have joined jihadis in Syria.As migrants from a Muslim-majority country working in non-Muslim territories, Indonesian maids and nannies in Hong Kong or Singapore radicalize for different reasons than either Indonesian helpers in the Middle East or converts to jihad in the West.Based on IPAC\u2019s monitoring of social media since mid-2015, as well as our interviews with several dozen Indonesian migrant workers and Muslim leaders in Hong Kong, these workers seem to have started out as nominal or non-devout Muslims and then undergone a rapid religious transformation while living abroad.Jihadi sites like voa-islam.com and kiblat.net appear at the top of result lists when one searches for \u201cIslamic news\u201d on Google in Indonesian. Their narratives \u2014 prophesizing an Islamic Armageddon in Syria and the like \u2014 are then spread by social media. Encrypted chat apps, particularly Telegram, serve as support groups for new recruits.\u201cI was online 24 hours every day, the Wi-Fi was so good,\u201d Firda, an Indonesian maid who worked in Singapore, told me in April. \u201cAt first I used it to watch movies, but after a while I felt empty. I had a decent job and money, my boss was nice to me, but I felt dry spiritually.\u201dFor some domestic workers, joining the Islamic State is a form of emancipation \u2014 from pasts they sometimes regret, from the hardships of exile, from subservience to men. Ika Puspitasari, a former domestic helper in Hong Kong, was arrested in central Java in December 2016 for plotting a suicide attack in Bali: She told the police that after helping finance her husband\u2019s terrorist plans for a time, she had wanted to play a more active role.It is these desires, and the helplessness they often stem from, that deradicalization efforts must address. The Indonesian government currently conducts training for migrant workers before they go abroad, but it focuses on languages and practical skills. The preparation should also incorporate modules about religious extremism, and describe recruitment by radical groups as a form of exploitation because jihadis often extract money from migrant workers.Indonesian Muslim business associations in Hong Kong and elsewhere may also have a part to play. They could be encouraged by the Indonesian consulate to set up ventures with migrant workers, allowing workers who are attracted to extremist views to be exposed to other perspectives in a collegial setting.Such exposure has proved effective in other contexts. For example, a reformed terrorist in Lamongan, in East Java, has set up a livestock cooperative bringing together former radicals and nonradicals, and that proximity reportedly helped change some of the jihadis\u2019 views over time. Programs could be put in place in Hong Kong to get radical domestic workers involved in, for example, businesses selling Muslim garments and Islamic herbal medicine, goods in high demand among migrants.Nava Nuraniyah is an analyst at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, in Jakarta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the East River Ferry, a Party Before the Party", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Nate Hodge\u2019s mother-in-law was visiting from Massachusetts, he and his wife, Catherine Greeley, wanted to treat her to a drink before dinner. It was a gorgeous weekend evening in New York City, 75 degrees and sunny, so they wanted to be outside. They could have gone to a cafe with a patio or a rooftop bar, but they opted for a more unlikely venue for cocktail hour: the South Brooklyn ferry to Manhattan.NYC Ferry, which began in May, provides a new way for New Yorkers to travel among East River ports in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, with stops including East 34th Street, Brooklyn Bridge Park and Rockaway Beach. It is inexpensive (a one-way trip is $2.75) and quick. The ride from Wall Street to Greenpoint, for example, takes only 21 minutes.The ferries are somewhat chic \u2014 each one is 86 feet long and looks more like a yacht than public transportation \u2014 and enjoyable to ride. There are cup-holders and electrical outlets at seats, as well as an open-air deck with picnic tables. There\u2019s a boutique that sells beach toys and coloring books, as well as a snack counter. And, crucially, there is a bar stocked with ros\u00e9 and beer.The family boarded the boat in Red Hook, where Mr. Hodge and his wife live, bought glasses of ros\u00e9 at the bar and then headed up to the top deck. There they took pictures of the Manhattan skyline and toasted their visit. They needed to get off at a Manhattan stop to get to dinner at an Italian restaurant in NoMad, but they were having such a great time, they decided to skip their stop and take a long loop around.\u201cWe are going all the way to the end and back,\u201d said Mr. Hodge, who clearly seemed interested in extending cocktail hour.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day, and you\u2019re getting air-conditioning for free,\u201d said Rita Greeley, his mother-in-law. \u201cYou can\u2019t get better than this. I love the view.\u201dChristina Gil, 40, was headed to Rockaway Beach for a day in the sun with a friend. Instead of hopping on the subway, she decided a ferry ride was a much better option. \u201cIt feels like part of the beach day,\u201d she said, \u201cand you get to enjoy the water from the get-go.\u201d She had to wait for a few crowded ferries to pass before she was able to board, but her friend grabbed a beer at the bar in the Wall Street terminal to make the time more pleasant.Jeff Cumming, a 29-year-old who works in finance and lives in the East Village, took the South Brooklyn route with his girlfriend to get to a seafood restaurant in Red Hook. \u201cNow we can have a drink and relax and have an easy ride instead of the subway,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice summer Saturday.\u201d While the couple spent most of their time cuddling on the top deck while taking in the views, they also socialized with other passengers, making a new friend at the bar.As more people flock to the ferries to party, it raises the question of whether this behavior could get annoying for those that are simply trying to put their head down and get from place to place. So far there have been no complaints, according to NYC Ferry.A security guard stationed at Pier 11, where Manhattan ferries embark, who didn\u2019t want to be named because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to a reporter, said drunken passengers had been asked to leave the older ferries in the past. So far it hasn\u2019t happened on the new ferry service, but he said he expected that it would, eventually.Still, most riders say the ferry is a unique social experiment, and an efficient mode of transportation.Richard Dutierrec, a construction worker, cut his commute home from Dumbo, where he worked on a job site, to Sunset Park. Before the ferry, his subway ride was a full hour longer than it is on the water. As a bonus, he and a workmate sipped happy-hour beers as they made their way home. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to unwind after work,\u201d he said.Virginia Mancuso, a 23-year-old student, and her friend Irene Kafkis, a 22-year-old physical therapist aide, who live in Bay Ridge, were headed to Stone Street in the Financial District for a Saturday night out. Normally they would take an Uber car into Manhattan, but on this night there was so much traffic it would have taken an hour and cost close to $30.Instead, they tried the ferry. The young women spent the boat ride taking selfies and giggling as their hair blew in the wind on the top deck. They were both single, they said, and were aware of other young professionals on the boat. \u201cThat would be fun, to meet someone on the ferry,\u201d Ms. Kafkis said. Either way, they said, the ferry was a great \u201cpregame\u201d for their night out.\u201cYou can drink in an Uber,\u201d Ms Kafkis said. \u201cBut this is classier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Beaches Empty, Christie Wages One More Fight", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe political standoff that shut down New Jersey state beaches and parks over the weekend began in February with a signature laugh line delivered by Gov. Chris Christie.Mr. Christie said during his budget address that he thought Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest health insurer, would turn over to the state millions of dollars a year, initially to finance his favorite social cause, battling opioid addiction. The lawmakers chuckled at the thought.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d Mr. Christie responded in mock disbelief. \u201cYou laugh \u2014 so cynical.\u201dIt was vintage Chris Christie, a thinly veiled threat to get his way, this time by putting forward a questionable plan that would seem to be anathema to his fellow Republicans. It was an approach that had worked many times \u2014 to cow the teachers\u2019 union or opponents of his court nominees.Now, with Mr. Christie\u2019s punches weakened by scandal and support among voters sagging, the State Assembly is refusing to go along. Lawmakers rejected his effort to link passage of the state budget to his plan to force Horizon to hand over $300 million of its roughly $2.4 billion reserve.The resulting shutdown will enter its third day on Monday.The statehouse was mostly empty on Sunday, and Mr. Christie said he expected the government to remain closed at least through Monday. He sent a letter to lawmakers on Sunday demanding special legislative sessions on Monday morning. Also on Monday, Robert A. Marino, the chief executive of Horizon, was scheduled to meet with state officials in Trenton.It may prove to be the final battle for a governor who for a time seemed to redefine what it meant to be brash in modern politics, at least until President Trump\u2019s emergence as a political figure. It was a style that Mr. Christie thought would punch his ticket to the White House, but with his presidential dreams dashed, he appears nonetheless determined to end his last fight with a win.New Jersey is one of at least nine states that failed to meet their July 1 budget deadline. That had an immediate effect on residents of three of the states \u2014 Illinois, Maine and New Jersey.The other six states \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin \u2014 either have laws that maintain current spending levels or provide for stopgap measures in case of a budget impasse.Officials said states without budgets would feel the full effects on Wednesday, after the Fourth of July holiday, when courts, motor-vehicle agencies and other state offices are to resume normal business. Monday is not a holiday, but because it falls between the weekend and the holiday, state officials expected less activity than usual.New Jersey\u2019s Constitution requires the government to cease spending on everything except public safety and emergency services if a budget is not signed by July 1, and so state parks closed on Saturday, and government offices were not expected to open on Monday. Thousands of workers have been furloughed, and Mr. Christie said they should not expect to receive back pay when a budget is ultimately approved.After months of attacking Horizon and its leaders, Mr. Christie blamed the leader of the State Assembly, Vincent Prieto, a Democrat, for the shutdown. The governor\u2019s office adorned buildings around the state with posters showing Mr. Prieto and a caption that said, \u201cThis Facility Is CLOSED Because of This Man.\u201dAt a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Christie said Mr. Prieto\u2019s suggestion that the Horizon bill should be considered after the passage of a budget was \u201ca fake, phony offer.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Vinnie Prieto since Friday when he walked out of my office,\u201d the governor said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who dug his heels in and drew a line in the sand.\u201dAt his own news conference, Mr. Prieto said, \u201cThis Chris Christie shutdown, it\u2019s atrocious. We\u2019re in Chris Christie hostage crisis Day Two. We can\u2019t keep government shut down. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201dMr. Christie made clear during his news conference that he was not concerned with what anyone thought about the fact that he had enjoyed the holiday weekend at a governor\u2019s residence in Island Beach State Park, a popular beach that was closed to his constituents as a result of the broader shutdown.New Jersey\u2019s government does not have a unique hold over Horizon. Mr. Christie has mentioned Horizon\u2019s \u201ccharitable mission\u201d and its nonprofit status, but the company is not a charity and does, in fact, pay taxes. It does not pay dividends; surpluses remain with the company.The bill passed by the State Senate would make several changes to state law on the operation of health service corporations. (Horizon is the only such entity operating in New Jersey.) The bill would require Horizon to become an insurer of last resort, paying for the medical care of the state\u2019s sickest and poorest residents. Horizon said that would mean that its customers would be forced to shoulder a burden that should be the government\u2019s responsibility.\u201cWe feel sorry for Governor Christie,\u201d Kevin McArdle, Horizon\u2019s public affairs manager, said in a statement. \u201cIn the twilight of his failed tenure, Governor Christie is resorting again to bullying and distortions to retaliate against Horizon\u2019s 3.8 million policyholders for opposing his $300 million reserve raid that has been called a shakedown and extortion.\u201dAfter his budget address in February, Mr. Christie escalated his public attacks on Horizon.

{"Headline": "City Councilman Convicted of Stealing Thousands in Public Funds", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn embattled New York City councilman was found guilty on Thursday of stealing more than $30,000 in public funds that were meant for charity and campaign expenditures.The councilman, Ruben W. Wills, a Democrat who represents southeastern Queens, was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and grand larceny after prosecutors argued that he had used more than half of a $33,000 state grant earmarked for single parents and obesity prevention on personal shopping sprees. He was found not guilty on one charge of falsifying business records.Prosecutors said Mr. Wills spent the money on items like a Louis Vuitton handbag, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and terry cloth slippers. They also said he created a shell company to swindle $11,500 from the city\u2019s campaign finance board.\u201cRuben Wills stole taxpayer dollars to buy fancy purses and clothes for himself and his friends,\u201d Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general, said in a statement. \u201cNew Yorkers deserved better.\u201dMr. Wills, who faces up to seven years in prison, said he planned to file an appeal. Mr. Wills\u2019s sentencing is set for Aug. 10, after which he will be automatically expelled from the council. (Prosecutors initially asked for an Aug. 3 sentencing, but Mr. Wills\u2019s lawyer, Kevin O\u2019Donnell, asked to postpone by a week. \u201cIt\u2019s his birthday Aug. 9,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell explained.)In a statement, the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, called Mr. Wills \u201cunfit to be a member\u201d of the group.After the verdict was announced, Mr. Wills remained upbeat. \u201cI\u2019m innocent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to come out and be downtrodden. God has put me through a process, and when I come out, I\u2019ll be better.\u201dAs he spoke outside the courthouse, a passer-by shouted, \u201cSellout!\u201dMr. Wills did not testify at his trial but made his indignation clear in other ways, shaking his head in disapproval of witnesses\u2019 statements. On several occasions, Justice Ira H. Margulis rebuked him for outbursts in the courtroom, even threatening to hold him in contempt of court.Mr. O\u2019Donnell sought to cast Mr. Wills as a fierce community advocate but a novice politician, afflicted by poorly written contracts and sloppy bookkeeping.But the jury ultimately sided with prosecutors, who said Mr. Wills went to great lengths to hide how he redirected money earmarked for his charity, New York 4 Life, into personal purchases at department stores, gas stations and fast food chains. They also found that the firm he claimed to have paid to translate campaign brochures was nothing but a conduit to his own bank account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Outside Groups Aren\u2019t Spending in the New York Mayor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFast-forward to last week, and the message from Mr. de Blasio was the same. Special interest groups \u201chave spent $13 million to beat us so far,\u201d the mayor wrote in a fund-raising email. The number referred to past spending on issues before City Hall by Uber, landlords and charter school groups.The reason the $13 million figure had not changed is simple: Outside money has been almost nonexistent in the 2017 election.So far, according to the latest filing by the New York City Campaign Finance Board, independent spending in the election has been limited to one aborted effort last year by Bradley Tusk, a former top aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Mr. Tusk created online advertisements in the hope of attracting a candidate worthy of his support to challenge Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary. He spent $71,000 in total \u2014 the bulk of it to his own company, Tusk Strategies \u2014 and failed to find a candidate.Alison Gendar, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, which spent heavily last time around, said the group currently has no independent expenditures in the 2017 races. \u201c2017 has mostly incumbents running; 2013 had hardly any,\u201d she said.Other dynamics are at work this time around, according to consultants and interest groups who spent heavily last time and have, so far, remained on the sidelines. For one, new city legislation after the last election imposed rules on outside spending, including that advertisements and mailings show not only the name of the outside group paying for the message, but also the group\u2019s top funders. That caused consternation among some potential donors, particularly among real estate interests.\u201cThey\u2019ve been dissuaded, or chilled, by some of the reaction to 2013 spending,\u201d said Scott Levenson, the president and founder of the Advance Group, which ran an independent spending campaign against Christine C. Quinn, then the City Council speaker and the presumptive favorite for mayor. By that point, $780,000 had already been spent against her through the group known as New York City Is Not For Sale.\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at running against an incumbent at this time,\u201d said Chris Coffey, of Tusk Strategies, who is representing NYClass in its 2017 efforts. \u201cThis is certainly not against the mayor. These are focused on the City Council races.\u201d (Mr. Coffey is also representing the police union.)Others that backed big spending last time include the Real Estate Board of New York, which supported 22 City Council candidates under the auspices of a group known as Jobs for New York. So far it is holding its fire.\u201cWe are considering our options including how to deal with new laws that were clearly designed to inhibit participation in the political process,\u201d John Banks, the board\u2019s president, said in a statement.Ten of the 51 seats in the City Council do not have an incumbent running for re-election in 2017, a big drop from 2013 when there were roughly twice as many. The limited number of open races means that outside players have fewer places to put their money.The city\u2019s public and private sector unions are likely to spend on favored candidates, but not until much closer to the Sept. 12 primary. Already, the influential union for hotel workers, the Hotel Trades Council, has announced its intention to do so, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending in support of candidates including Laurie Cumbo, an incumbent Brooklyn councilwoman who is in a hard-fought race, and candidates running for open seats in Manhattan, including Keith Powers and Carlina Rivera.The main issue this time will be spending money to get voters to the polls in a year when turnout is expected to be low.Local 32BJ, which represents private-sector janitors, security guards and others, said it would make \u201cupwards of $200,000\u201d in independent expenditures in 2017, said Elaine Kim, a spokeswoman for the union. \u201cIn 2013 we had the opportunity to elect a Democratic mayor after 12 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year is different in that there is no real mayoral contest.\u201d\u201cLandlords, hedge fund billionaires and special interests have not been shy in spending millions to attack the mayor and the city\u2019s progressive agenda,\u201d said Dan Levitan, a campaign spokesman for Mr. de Blasio. \u201cOur Republican opponent is backed by the far-right billionaires that fund Breitbart News and helped launch Donald Trump into the White House.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Spain, Santander Hopes a New Arts Center Will Reinvigorate the City", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRenzo Piano, the center\u2019s Italian architect, got his inspiration from the sea. \u201cWater makes things beautiful, and that is the reason why this building is flirting with the water,\u201d he said of his first edifice in Spain.But Mr. Piano\u2019s financing came from the Bot\u00edn banking family, whose foundation paid entirely for the 80 million euro (about $90 million) construction. This arts center is a rarity in Spain, a project financed by family philanthropy in a country whose cultural assets are otherwise largely dependent on public funding.Santander hopes the center will reinvigorate the city in northern Spain the same way Bilbao, about 60 miles east, was transformed by its Guggenheim museum, opened two decades ago. The Bot\u00edn family\u2019s wealth, in turn, is seen to assure that a project kick-started at the height of Spain\u2019s banking crisis will stay on course, as well as at arm\u2019s length from politicians who let other such projects fall by the wayside. West of Santander sits a half-built arts complex in Santiago de Compostela and a struggling arts center in Avil\u00e9s, designed by Oscar Niemeyer.\u201cI\u2019m sure that the Bot\u00edn Foundation will guarantee continuity here and not do anything suicidal,\u201d said Vicente Todol\u00ed, a former director of the Tate Modern in London who now leads the center\u2019s visual arts advisory committee. \u201cYou don\u2019t invest in a Formula One car and then not have it compete.\u201dMr. Bot\u00edn \u201ccould have chosen another place, but of course he had to put his center right in front of his own bank, on the spot where the Romans disembarked and this city was born,\u201d said Carlos Garc\u00eda, a former president of Arca, an environmental association, who also rejects any comparison with the Guggenheim, built in what was a run-down industrial district of Bilbao.Fernando Merodio, a Santander lawyer, said he was ready to pursue his lawsuit before European courts against a museum project that promoted \u201cthe culture of money more than the culture of art.\u201dStill, most residents have clearly been won over by the project. About a fifth of the budget went toward improving the area around the building, including building an underground road tunnel that also fitted in with Mr. Piano\u2019s idea of a museum space that helps link the city center and the sea. Mr. Piano\u2019s split building structure is raised onto pillars, to let people stroll below and also not block the sea view. (Mr. Piano also designed the headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan.)Ahead of the June 23 inauguration, about 80,000 of the Cantabria region\u2019s 580,000 residents took advantage of a special membership deal, granting locals unlimited access to the Bot\u00edn Center for a one-time \u20ac2 payment (about $2.25), compared with the normal \u20ac8 (about $9) entrance ticket.\u201cIf the museum in Bilbao worked, I don\u2019t see why this one won\u2019t do better,\u201d said Emilio G\u00f3mez Cicero, a retired boat welder, who proudly showed his new membership card. \u201cWhether you like the Bot\u00edns or not, you should accept that everything in this world is moved by money.\u201dThe center\u2019s management, however, has published no forecast about the project\u2019s economic impact on Santander. \u201cWe care about the quality of the visit rather than the quantity of visitors,\u201d \u00cd\u00f1igo S\u00e1enz de Miera, the Bot\u00edn Foundation\u2019s director general, said at a news conference.The center was inaugurated by King Felipe VI and opened with two very different exhibitions. One floor is partitioned into separate rooms to hang 81 drawings by Francisco de Goya on loan from the Prado museum in Madrid. The walls also help protect the fragile works from damaging light.In contrast, the other floor remains open and bathed in natural light, even if some of the installations by the artist Carsten H\u00f6ller are already brightly lit. Mr. H\u00f6ller\u2019s \u201cY\u201d show opens onto a light corridor, which he also compared to a uterus, that lets the viewer choose between two itineraries exploring the relationship between life and death. At one end, Mr. H\u00f6ller suspended two bird cages filled with canaries, a bird valued for its bright singing and color but also as a harbinger of death when detecting toxic gases in mines. Because of the center\u2019s construction delay, Mr. H\u00f6ller said he had the rare opportunity of \u201chaving three years to prepare one exhibition.\u201d His goal, he said, was also \u201cnot to take anything away from this immaculate new space.\u201dThe center also displays its own collection, half of which comes from artists who received grants from the foundation. Mr. Todol\u00ed said that the center would focus on contemporary art, including works by Julie Mehretu, a South African artist, in October. The center will also occasionally host classical exhibitions like that of Goya, \u201cas long as the work can say something new,\u201d Mr. Todol\u00ed said. One of Goya\u2019s main themes was social injustice, with satirical scenes of aristocratic decadence contrasting with drawings of famine and hardship in the countryside. One black crayon drawing, \u201cThey Eat a Lot,\u201d shows a friar struggling to defecate because of his gluttony. The drawings were selected from the Prado\u2019s vast Goya collection because \u201cthese ones really are pertinent to the issues of today,\u201d Mr. Todol\u00ed said. While the economy in Spain has been recovering since its 2012 banking bailout, that crisis also increased significantly the wealth gap across Spanish society.In Santander, once a summer royal residence and built on banking and shipping wealth, the Bot\u00edn Center will \u201cchange people\u2019s perception of art and also their experience of the sea,\u201d said Cristina Iglesias, an artist who built the water sculptures outside the building and who will have her own exhibition there next year. \u201cFor a conservative city, I think this opening of the mind is in itself an important contribution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big German Bank, Key to Trump\u2019s Finances, Faces New Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump pointed to his relationship with Deutsche Bank to counter reports that big banks were skeptical of doing business with him.After a string of bankruptcies in his casino and hotel businesses in the 1990s, Mr. Trump became somewhat of an outsider on Wall Street, leaving the giant German bank among the few major financial institutions willing to lend him money.Now that two-decades-long relationship is coming under scrutiny.Banking regulators are reviewing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans made to Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses through Deutsche Bank\u2019s private wealth management unit, which caters to an ultrarich clientele, according to three people briefed on the review who were not authorized to speak publicly. The regulators want to know if the loans might expose the bank to heightened risks.Separately, Deutsche Bank has been in contact with federal investigators about the Trump accounts, according to two people briefed on the matter. And the bank is expecting to eventually have to provide information to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the federal investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.It was not clear what information the bank might ultimately provide. Generally, the bank is seen as central to understanding Mr. Trump\u2019s finances since it is the only major financial institution that continues to conduct sizable business with him. Deutsche Bank has also lent money to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and to his family real estate business.Although Deutsche Bank recently landed in legal trouble for laundering money for Russian entities \u2014 paying more than $600 million in penalties to New York and British regulators \u2014 there is no indication of a Russian connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s loans or accounts at Deutsche Bank, people briefed on the matter said. The bank, which declined to comment, scrutinizes its accounts for problematic ties as part of so-called \u201cknow your customer\u201d banking rules and other requirements.And with one of its most famous clients headed to the White House, the bank designed a plan for overseeing the accounts of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner and presented it to regulators at the New York State Department of Financial Services early this year. The plan essentially called for monitoring the accounts for red flags such as exceptionally favorable loan terms or unusual partners.Additionally, the New York regulators recently requested information related to the hundreds of millions in loans Deutsche Bank\u2019s private wealth management division provided Mr. Trump, one of the people said, paying particular attention to personal guarantees he made to obtain the loans. Those guarantees have declined as the loans were paid down and the property values increased, but it remains a source of interest to the regulators.While there is no formal investigation of the bank \u2014 and personal guarantees are often required when people receive big loans from their wealth managers \u2014 the New York regulators have questioned whether the guarantee could create problems for Deutsche Bank should Mr. Trump fail to pay his debts. To collect, the bank would either have to sue the president, or risk being seen as cutting him a special deal.It is not a hypothetical concern: Mr. Trump sued the bank in 2008 to delay paying back an earlier loan.Mr. Trump has had a complicated relationship with the bank over the past 20 years, which has included more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, according to a New York Times review of securities filings and interviews with people with knowledge of the deals. Despite all the risk-taking \u2014 and a brief loan default that spurred the 2008 litigation \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s business has made the bank money, the people said.A spokesman for the New York regulators declined to comment, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.A few years after Mr. Trump sued the bank in 2008, he moved his business from the bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending division to its private wealth division, where executives were more willing to deal with him, according to the people briefed on the matter.In the past six years, the private wealth unit helped finance three of Mr. Trump\u2019s properties, including a golf course near Miami and a hotel in Washington, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s most recent financial disclosures and the people with knowledge of the loans.The size of the loans \u2014 totaling about $300 million \u2014 is somewhat unusual by Wall Street standards, according to former and current Deutsche Bank executives and wealth managers at other Wall Street firms.While it is not unheard-of for real estate developers to obtain large wealth management loans for projects deemed too risky for an investment bank, it differs from bank to bank, and those that do issue loans of that size typically do so for top clients known to pay their bills.Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth manager at Deutsche Bank, Rosemary Vrablic, has specialized in real estate lending and is known for taking risks on clients, two of the executives and wealth managers said. And her relationship with Mr. Trump is close enough that Ms. Vrablic attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to a person who attended.Mr. Kushner has established his own relationship with the bank. He and his mother have an unsecured line of credit from Deutsche Bank, valued at up to $25 million, and the family business he ran until January, Kushner Companies, received a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank last year.Mr. Kushner\u2019s dealings at the bank have included Ms. Vrablic. In 2013, he ordered up a glowing profile of her in the real estate magazine he owned, The Mortgage Observer, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The piece concluded with a disclaimer that her \u201cpast clients\u201d included Mr. Kushner.In an interview with The Times last year, Mr. Trump suggested reporters speak with Ms. Vrablic about his banking relationships.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is the boss.\u201dIt was 1998, and Mike Offit, fresh off the trading floor of Goldman Sachs for a new job at Deutsche Bank, was hired to put Deutsche Bank\u2019s real estate lending business on the map. To do that, Mr. Offit knew he had to snag big name developers.That moment arrived when Rob Horowitz, with the real estate firm Cooper-Horowitz, approached him with an idea: Would he work with Mr. Trump, who at the time had a tarnished reputation after several of his casinos landed in bankruptcy?\u201cMy reaction was, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Mr. Offit recalled in a recent interview.To Mr. Offit, there was little downside to hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s pitch. A short time later, Mr. Trump came by Mr. Offit\u2019s Midtown Manhattan office to discuss a loan for renovations at his 40 Wall Street building. Unlike other developers who arrived with their entourages, Mr. Trump showed up alone, Mr. Offit said, and despite a reputation for bluster, he knew the financials of the deal cold.\u201cThere was some resistance from management because of Donald\u2019s reputation, but I told them that our loan would be wildly overly collateralized even in the worst-case scenario,\u201d Mr. Offit said.More deals followed. Later in the year, Mr. Trump needed $300 million to build Trump World Tower near the United Nations. But he required a construction loan, which, at the time, Deutsche did not have the right staff to manage. Determined to get the deal nonetheless, Mr. Offit found another German bank to make the loan with the commitment that Deutsche Bank would take possession once the building was constructed.But as the deal was being finalized, the other German bank had second thoughts because of worries of a labor strike. Just as the deal seemed to be falling apart, Mr. Trump produced a signed commitment from all the major construction unions promising not to strike.\u201cWe were all amazed he managed to get that,\u201d said Mr. Offit, who retired from the bank in 1999.In the mid 2000s, Mr. Trump was in need of another construction loan. But this time, the loan \u2014 up to $640 million to build Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago \u2014 did not go as well.A few years after the project began, the 2008 financial crisis upended the global economy and Mr. Trump fell behind on loan payments. According to a person briefed on the deal, Deutsche Bank was discussing a possible extension, when Mr. Trump sued it to avoid paying $40 million that he had personally guaranteed.His argument, as detailed in a letter to the bank, was novel: \u201cDeutsche Bank is one of the banks primarily responsible for the economic dysfunction we are currently facing,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.With the help of a lawyer \u2014 Steven Schlesinger of Garden City, N.Y. \u2014 Mr. Trump argued that the financial crisis allowed him to invoke the extraordinary event clause in his contract with the bank. Mr. Trump argued Deutsche Bank should pay him $3 billion in damages.The bank filed its own action against Mr. Trump, demanding he make good on the loan. In a legal filing, Deutsche Bank, which had distributed the loan to a number of other banks, called the lawsuit \u201cclassic Trump.\u201dThe standoff culminated with a meeting in Trump Tower, Mr. Schlesinger said.At the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened to remove his name from the building if he did not get more time to pay. That move, Mr. Trump suggested, would reduce the value of the building.Ultimately, the bank granted Mr. Trump additional time to repay. And when he did, it was through the Wall Street equivalent of borrowing from one parent to repay the other.Mr. Trump received a loan from Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth management unit to pay off the debt he owed the bank\u2019s real estate lending division, according to two people briefed on the transaction. The wealth management unit later issued another loan for the Chicago project that is valued at $25 million to $50 million.Ms. Vrablic, who helped facilitate the wealth management unit\u2019s loans to Mr. Trump, has built a career lending to the rich and famous.She got her start on Wall Street at Citibank\u2019s private bank in the late 1980s and later worked at Bank of America before joining Deutsche Bank in 2006.Ms. Vrablic, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has a reputation for being an aggressive advocate for her clients, according to two executives familiar with her work and profiles written in The American Banker and The Mortgage Observer.In a 2013 Mortgage Observer article, one of her clients, Herbert Simon, owner of the Indiana Pacers, remarked that \u201cwhen she came into the picture, it was a tough time to get money, and she was able to be very creative and get us what we needed.\u201dIn a 1999 American Banker article, Ms. Vrablic described her clients as having \u201cmany homes, ex-wives, and many children.\u201dMr. Trump fit that mold, but he was far from her only client in the rarefied world of New York real estate. Others included Stephen Ross, the chairman and founder of the Related Companies in New York.Mr. Ross extolled Ms. Vrablic\u2019s ability to make deals happen. \u201cShe brings knowledge \u2014 and the fact is that if she tells you something, you know it\u2019s going to get done,\u201d he told The Mortgage Observer.Ms. Vrablic was quoted in the same article as saying that real estate is her \u201cdeep dive.\u201dWhile Mr. Kushner has never disclosed the exact nature of his business with Ms. Vrablic, his financial disclosure shows a line of credit worth between $5 million and $25 million. And according to securities filings, Deutsche Bank provided a $285 million mortgage to Kushner Companies to help it refinance the loan it used to purchase several floors of retail space in the former New York Times building on 43rd Street in Manhattan.Mr. Kushner\u2019s company bought the space from Africa Israel Investments, a company owned by Lev Leviev, which has a sizable real estate portfolio in Russia.Deutsche Bank, other securities filings show, is also involved in loans the Kushner Companies received for the Puck Building in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood and a property on Maiden Lane near Wall Street. The bank was responsible for either pooling those loans into mortgage-backed securities that were sold to investors, according to Trepp, a data and analytics firm, or distributing payments to the investors.In the autumn of 2014, Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Kushner attended the Frick Collection\u2019s dinner, a black-tie event where patrons dined among famous works of art by Manet, El Greco and Turner.A picture of the pair appeared in the New York Social Diary. Mr. Kushner, dressed in a tuxedo, had his arm around Ms. Vrablic.There is no indication that federal investigators suspect a Russian connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Deutsche Bank, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Horowitz, of the real estate firm Cooper-Horowitz, also saw no Russian ties in his many years of working with Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve arranged financing for the majority of Mr. Trump\u2019s transactions, and I\u2019ve never once seen any money coming to him from Russia,\u201d he said. Mr. Horowitz was not involved in any of the private wealth management loans from Ms. Vrablic.But separate from Mr. Trump, the German bank has a host of Russian connections.Soon after Mr. Trump took office, the bank settled allegations that it helped Russian investors launder as much as $10 billion through its branches in Moscow, London and New York. In May, the Federal Reserve reached its own settlement with the bank over the money laundering violations.Deutsche Bank also had a \u201ccooperation agreement\u201d with the Russian state-owned development bank, Vnesheconombank, which has been swept up in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. And it had ties to VTB Bank, a far larger Russian bank facing sanctions in the United States and the European Union. The Russian firm\u2019s investment banking arm, VTB Capital, was created by hiring dozens of bankers from Deutsche Bank\u2019s Moscow office.Some ties are less direct. Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank\u2019s former chief executive, is now chairman of the board at the Bank of Cyprus. A large shareholder of that bank was Dmitry Rybolovlev, the Russian oligarch who purchased Mr. Trump\u2019s estate in Florida.And in May, federal prosecutors settled a case with a Cyprus investment vehicle owned by a Russian businessman with close family connections to the Kremlin.The firm, Prevezon Holdings, was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who was among the people who met during the presidential campaign with Donald Trump Jr. about Hillary Clinton.Federal prosecutors in the United States claimed Prevezon, which admitted no wrongdoing, laundered the proceeds of an alleged Russian tax fraud through real estate. Prevezon and its partner relied in part on $90 million in financing from a big European financial institution, court records show.It was Deutsche Bank.Adam Goldman and Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting from Washington, and Steve Eder from New York.

Luc Besson Says \u2018Who Cares?\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Luc Besson\u2019s latest sci-fi extravaganza, \u201cValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,\u201d has every hallmark of his work: action, romance, sassy women packing heat, underwater scenes, special effects and a sense of humor that finds room for Rihanna to perform a shape-shifting Moulin Rouge-style number in outer space, before helping the hero save the world.What do you mean who cares? The film seems genetically engineered to make money, with plot twists and a range of characters designed to appeal to every man, woman, child and Instagram follower on the planet. \u201cI\u2019m happy we paid everyone,\u201d Mr. Besson said, speaking in English. He was sitting in a large armchair and squeezing honey into a cup of Lipton Yellow Label Tea. \u201cAll the money went to the special effects.\u201dMr. Besson, 58, was wearing a black T-shirt with an image of Valerian from the French graphic novel series on which the film is based. The series, by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, first appeared in 1967, and Mr. Besson discovered the books as a lonely 10-year-old who had moved to the French countryside with his mother after his parents, both scuba-diving instructors, split up.The series tells of the special agents Valerian and Laureline, who travel through space and time. Laureline \u201cis kicking butt, and she\u2019s driving a spaceship. It\u2019s revolution for me,\u201d Mr. Besson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my only way to escape. It\u2019s my ticket for dreaming. I fall in love with Laureline.\u201dTime went by. A decade ago, he bought the rights from an American studio. It was only after James Cameron\u2019s 2009 blockbuster, \u201cAvatar,\u201d that Mr. Besson realized technology had advanced enough for him to attempt \u201cValerian.\u201d\u201cJames Cameron offered to the entire community to do whatever we want now; thanks to him,\u201d Mr. Besson said.In \u201cValerian,\u201d which is also in 3-D, the hero, played by Dane DeHaan (\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\u201d), and Laureline, played by Cara Delevingne, race through actual and virtual worlds to save Planet Alpha and ultimately help a species known as the Pearls, who lost six million of their kind when their own planet was destroyed. Yes, six million. \u201cI like to suggest things without pointing them out,\u201d Mr. Besson said about the Holocaust reference. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good start of a conversation for people who watch the movie and especially for parents and their kids.\u201dBut \u201cValerian\u201d isn\u2019t gloomy. It\u2019s not scary like \u201cAlien\u201d or pensive like \u201cArrival.\u201d The soundtrack includes David Bowie and Bob Marley. Clive Owen plays a bad guy, Ethan Hawke a space-age brothel owner, Herbie Hancock the minister of defense, and John Goodman does the voice for a creature with six nostrils.\u201cThere are so many sci-fi films that are so dark \u2014 it\u2019s raining, the aliens are the villains,\u201d Mr. Besson said. \u201cThe future is a blank page. Why do we project so much pessimism on it? Why not at least try to say: \u2018Maybe there\u2019s peace in the future. Maybe I can have a bunch of friends who are aliens.\u2019\u201dMr. Besson\u2019s film seems aimed to please, and to get noticed across platforms. The publicity notes point out how many Instagram followers Ms. Delevingne has (now more than 40 million), while Rihanna has 75 million Twitter followers. Mr. Besson said that social media clout wasn\u2019t a factor in his casting decisions. \u201cI discovered that after,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing for me is to choose the right person for the part.\u201dReally? \u201cFor his whole life, Besson has been ahead of everyone in France on how to communicate about a film,\u201d said Geoffrey Le Guilcher, a French journalist who wrote a 2016 unauthorized biography, \u201cLuc Besson: The Man Who Wanted to Be Loved.\u201dTo help finance \u201cValerian,\u201d Fundamental Films, a Chinese company, acquired a large stake in Mr. Besson\u2019s EuropaCorp production company. The film was produced by Virginie Besson-Silla, Mr. Besson\u2019s wife, and about 2,000 workers were involved, including those who focused on the special effects. \u201cThere\u2019s basically three actors, and the rest are aliens,\u201d Mr. Besson said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t even know where to start. There is an entire scene in two parallel worlds at the same time, and the hero has his arm in one and his body in the another one.\u201dAfter years of storyboarding, he shot the film in 20 weeks last year, entirely at the Cit\u00e9 du Cin\u00e9ma. To make \u201cValerian\u201d in France, and not elsewhere with cheaper labor, Mr. Besson lobbied the French government to change the country\u2019s tax credit system to allow films not in the French language to receive a tax break. But he ruffled a few feathers when most of the film\u2019s budget was spent outside the country for special effects, including some by Industrial Light & Magic, the California company behind the visual effects for \u201cStar Wars,\u201d and Weta, the New Zealand outfit that also worked on \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy.\u201cThere were 45 shots without special effects, and there were 2,744 with special effects,\u201d Mr. Besson said.Mr. Besson, who lives in Los Angeles, has always straddled two worlds. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s French and loves my country, and there\u2019s a part that isn\u2019t French,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I see something big and I like it, I want to say, \u2018Congratulations.\u2019 In France, they hate you for that. If you succeed at something they\u2019ll say, \u2018Yeah, his parents probably have money,\u2019 or \u2018You probably cheat.\u2019 But maybe he woke up earlier and worked more? No, it\u2019s not possible.\u201dIn France, Mr. Besson has been in the news more for his activities as a businessman than as a director. He had the idea for the Cit\u00e9 du Cin\u00e9ma \u2014 which houses nine private film studios and a public film school \u2014 as a one-stop shop to rival the Pinewood Studios in Britain or Cinecitt\u00e0 in Rome. EuropaCorp rents space in the Cit\u00e9 and is an investor in the studio, along with a consortium of French banks. Since the Cit\u00e9 opened in 2012, around 30 productions have been filmed there, of which Mr. Besson directed three and EuropaCorp produced nine. The studio\u2019s director, Brigitte Segal, said she was satisfied with its occupancy, which she projected at 81 percent for 2017.\u201cValerian\u201d might not win over French critics, but Mr. Besson has global ambitions for it. He said that he wanted audiences to see it as an escapist fantasy. \u201cIf they can forget everything for two hours, and live another life for two hours, that would be perfect for me,\u201d he said, back in his office, where his coffee table was piled high with Valerian comics. \u201cI want them to be drunk with the story, the images. I want them to lose their minds.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Journalist Joins His Jailer\u2019s Side in a Bizarre Persian Gulf Feud", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The journalist Mohamed Fahmy had been working in Cairo for Al Jazeera when the Egyptian authorities threw him in prison for more than a year, accusing him of stirring up unrest as an agent of the channel\u2019s owner, the Qatari government.Now, less than two years after his release, he has filed a lawsuit for more than $100 million. But the target of the suit is not Egypt; it is his former employers: Al Jazeera and Qatar.And a recent campaign of surveillance and computer hacking against Mr. Fahmy, for Qatar\u2019s benefit, revealed that a senior official of the United Arab Emirates later provided $250,000 to help pay for the legal action.Behind these bizarre twists and turns is a Persian Gulf family feud, pitting Qatar against the United Arab Emirates and its regional clients, including Egypt.Mr. Fahmy, no longer a neutral bystander, has become a pawn exploited and abused by both sides.Mr. Fahmy, 43, has eagerly joined in, holding a recent news conference in Washington to add his voice to Saudi and Emirati accusations that Qatar and Al Jazeera conspire with Islamist extremists. \u201cQatar has been given so many chances, and they have been warned so many times,\u201d he said, commending the Saudi and Emirati blockade.Asked at the news conference if he had consulted Saudi or Emirati officials, or if he was close to the Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, Mr. Fahmy said, falsely, \u201cTo simply answer your question, no.\u201d (Mr. Fahmy said this past week that he was protecting a friend.)Mr. Fahmy, an Egyptian-Canadian, now lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He acknowledged in a recent telephone interview that he had received what he described as a \u201cloan\u201d from Mr. Otaiba to finance the legal action against Qatar. The ambassador had been a friend since they attended high school together in Egypt, at the Cairo American College, and he was one of several people asked for financial support, Mr. Fahmy said.He insisted that the money for the lawsuit had gone to a third party, whom Mr. Fahmy refused to name. \u201cI have not received a penny from Yousef,\u201d he said.But he dismissed many of the other claims raised by investigators who conducted the surveillance against him. He called the assertions in their resulting report \u201cabsurd,\u201d saying they were \u201cfabrications\u201d by Al Jazeera and Qatar in \u201ca systematic campaign to smear my reputation.\u201dThe investigation raised far-fetched allegations that Mr. Fahmy had worked covertly for nearly two decades as a spy for Italy, beginning when he was still a full-time college student in Vancouver. The report included many handwritten observations, presented as originating with Israeli intelligence, that describe dozens of sightings of Mr. Fahmy in Rome and at Italian diplomatic facilities in Paris, Cairo and Morocco.But in an interview this past week, Mr. Fahmy said he had never been to Italy or Morocco, nor to the other Italian diplomatic facilities mentioned in the report. For several of the dates in question, he provided detailed evidence that he had been far from the alleged meeting locations.The investigative report \u2014 hundreds of pages in length \u2014 was provided to The New York Times and other journalists by intermediaries sympathetic to Qatar in an apparent attempt to discredit Mr. Fahmy. The name of the client who commissioned the research was deleted from the copy provided to The Times. But the report indicates that the anonymous client had given the investigators a copy of Mr. Fahmy\u2019s Canadian passport and already had a \u201ccomprehensive knowledge of the subject and his activities,\u201d as a former employer might.A spokesman for the government of Qatar said it had no knowledge of any investigation of Mr. Fahmy, and a representative of the Emirati Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Fahmy worked for a few months in 2007 as a freelance reporter for the Cairo bureau of The Times. He went on to work as a reporter and producer for CNN, where he helped cover the Arab Spring revolts of 2011 in Egypt and Libya.Al Jazeera was known in Egypt for its sympathetic coverage of Mohamed Morsi, the ousted Egyptian president, and his political faction, the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt\u2019s Emirati-backed military government, which removed Mr. Morsi from power in July 2013, considered Al Jazeera a tool of Qatar and the Brotherhood, and Egyptian security forces had already raided the offices of Al Jazeera\u2019s Arabic language channels before the network hired Mr. Fahmy, in September 2013.Mr. Fahmy, a nominal Muslim who drank alcohol and seldom prayed, personally opposed the Brotherhood and cheered for the military takeover, he told friends at the time.But Al Jazeera offered him a job as the Cairo bureau chief for its English-language arm, which was less conspicuously supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood than its Arabic-language counterparts. Mr. Fahmy later wrote in a memoir that he had been convinced that Al Jazeera would maintain, and the Egyptian government would accept, a bright-line distinction between the sister Arabic and English networks. His lawsuit centers on claims that Al Jazeera broke promises to uphold that separation and to secure a proper Egyptian broadcasting license.The Egyptian police arrested Mr. Fahmy and two colleagues in Cairo in December 2013 on charges that they had conspired with the Muslim Brotherhood to broadcast false reports of unrest in Egypt. (Prosecutors never presented any evidence to support the charges.)Former fellow inmates say Mr. Fahmy started talking avidly of suing Al Jazeera almost as soon as he was arrested. He soon also echoed the claims of the Egyptian government and its Emirati patrons that Al Jazeera had been conspiring with the Brotherhood and promoting dangerous extremism. He initiated his lawsuit against Al Jazeera in a Canadian court in May 2015, before he was released from jail in September of that year.His fellow prisoners said the lawsuit appeared motivated in part by a desire for a big payoff from Qatar and was in part a strategy to win over the Egyptian authorities.After his release, Mr. Fahmy also began corresponding with Mr. Otaiba. When Mr. Fahmy gave a news conference in Cairo in May 2015, for example, Mr. Otaiba emailed an offer to arrange coverage by the Emirati-linked news network SkyNews Arabia.\u201cSkyNews to take it live would be awesome, I think a nudge to their C.E.O. could make it happen,\u201d Mr. Fahmy wrote back.\u201cAlready done,\u201d Mr. Otaiba responded. \u201cLet\u2019s hope they can get there.\u201dAfter the news conference, Mr. Fahmy wrote to the ambassador, \u201cI plan to keep the pressure on through the media,\u201d and he alluded to documents from the Qatari opposition that would \u201cembarrass the government.\u201dHe asked for money, too. \u201cI am looking for a personal loan with a written agreement to pay back on success plus interest, and or a profit margin,\u201d Mr. Fahmy wrote in the same email.His appeal seems to have worked. That October, Mr. Otaiba emailed an Egyptian businessman, Tawfik Diab, a relative, to arrange a transfer of $250,000 to an account under Mr. Fahmy\u2019s name at the Royal Bank of Canada in Montreal. (Mr. Fahmy said in the interview that the Montreal account had belonged to the unnamed third party and that he had been unaware until now of Mr. Diab\u2019s involvement.)A few days later, Mr. Fahmy confirmed the transaction. \u201cThe money is in,\u201d he wrote, and he promised \u201ca progress report that we were planning to send to AD\u201d \u2014 presumably Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. \u201cMy team here will start working on the media blitz to revive the case in U.S. media,\u201d he added.The next May, in 2016, Mr. Fahmy emailed information about his personal checking account, in Vancouver, to Mr. Otaiba. But it is unclear how Mr. Otaiba responded. Mr. Fahmy said in the interview that there had been no payment, and he provided corroborating bank statements.The investigation into Mr. Fahmy began in late November, according to a footnote to the report. The investigators obtained telephone bills, call lists, credit reports, court records, electronic communications, and photographs of Mr. Fahmy\u2019s residences and workplaces. They also compiled a list of places where his wife likes to shop.A second report by the same investigators mixed in the handwritten notes, allegedly compiled by Israeli intelligence, claiming that Mr. Fahmy had worked as a spy for Italy since as early as 1997. Other handwritten documents, also unconfirmed, purport to indicate a secret account in his name in the Vatican Bank.Mr. Fahmy called the report defamation and said he would add it to his lawsuit. There is no turning back, he said. \u201cI am in too deep now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "M.T.A. Board Pushes Back Against Plans to Raise Fares in 2019 and 2021", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the wrangling begins over how to pay for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s ambitious new subway rescue plan, officials offered news on Wednesday that was unlikely to make riders happy: Fares will probably rise again.At the authority\u2019s monthly board meeting in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Foran said the agency needed to continue to raise fares by about 4 percent every other year as part of its long-term financial plans. But some board members bristled at the biennial ritual, especially as service deteriorated.\u201cI think it is time now for us and our partners at the state to review or re-evaluate the every-other-year fare and toll discussion,\u201d said Mitchell Pally, a longtime board member. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s sustainable.\u201dAnother board member, Andrew Albert, said the authority had to secure other funding streams to support operations, instead of continuing to raise fares.\u201cIf you take these to their logical conclusion, at some point, the fare will be $10 and tolls will be $50, and I\u2019m not sure that is sustainable,\u201d Mr. Albert said.The authority\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, said he was prepared to examine new funding sources to avoid regular fare increases.\u201cIt was clearly the sense of the board that we need to replace the biennial fare increases with a new stream of revenue,\u201d Mr. Lhota said in an interview.\u201cPut politics aside, Mayor de Blasio,\u201d the ad said. \u201cFifty-fifty is fair. Fund your share.\u201dThe union said the ad was part of a six-figure campaign that would run on NY1, CNN and MSNBC. The union supports the subway rescue plan, which calls for fixing signals and tracks and hiring 2,700 workers.\u201cPart of what I\u2019m trying to make clear is it begins with responsibility,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThe M.T.A. has to take responsibility for its own actions. The State of New York has to take responsibility for the fact it controls the M.T.A.\u201dMr. Lhota, who returned to lead the authority in June to help fix the subway after an earlier stint as chairman, said he would continue to try to work with city officials to persuade them to fund the plan.The budget presentation by Mr. Foran also revealed the steep costs of the agency\u2019s contingency plans for summer repairs at Pennsylvania Station in New York \u2014 a transit headache Mr. Cuomo called the \u201csummer of hell.\u201d The authority is providing discounts for Long Island Rail Road riders and an array of travel options to help commuters whose lives have been disrupted by the closing of several tracks at the busy train station.The authority expected to lose $58 million from higher expenses and lower revenue in July and August, Mr. Foran said. That includes more than $21 million in lost revenue, about $18 million for buses and $5 million for ferries.Mr. Lhota said the agency\u2019s approach had been working well.\u201cWas it a lot of money?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes. Is it well worth it? Yes. Because not doing it \u2014 the catastrophe that it would have caused would have been unbearable for the entire region over all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could the Rockaways Survive Another Sandy?", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd this spring, the final slab of concrete was laid on a new five-and-a-half-mile boardwalk, with Mayor Bill de Blasio proclaiming its completion a symbol of the area\u2019s resiliency.But the government\u2019s most ambitious plan to shelter Rockaway from the elements is far from assured.An estimated $400 million has been secured so far, Army Corps engineers said. But that money cannot be used until the agency gives the project the final approval.Construction would not begin until 2020.\u201cWith the Trump administration in place, people who don\u2019t necessarily even believe in climate change, I\u2019m really worried whether the money will even be there,\u201d said Councilman Donovan Richards, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Rockaway.On the beachside of the peninsula, the Army Corps has proposed building 13 new jetties and extending five existing jetties \u2014 rock formations that jut out perpendicularly to trap sand and build up the beaches they protect.Sand is widely regarded as an effective mitigator of storm damage: A wider beach can dissipate the energy of storm tides.But a significant amount of the sand replenished in Rockaway by the Army Corps in 2014 after Sandy has already been washed away. In certain sections of Rockaway Beach, the water has eaten away at the shoreline, reaching the sand dunes and the boardwalk that shield the neighborhood.Jetties are meant to slow this type of coastal erosion, a natural phenomenon exacerbated by climate change, experts say.\u201cWe are working as fast as we can, and we understand the urgency of it,\u201d said Daniel Falt, the project\u2019s manager at the Army Corps. \u201cWe have a very significant and thorough review process that is required from us.\u201dThe plan also proposes additional sand replenishment to extend the beachfront and to build 18-foot-tall reinforced dunes.Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, has been urging the federal government to begin construction on the Rockaway beachside.Indeed, agency officials acknowledge that the $400 million the agency already has in hand would pay for the work on the beachside.The other $3.6 billion needed would pay for a proposed system of flood walls, levees and gates to control water levels in Jamaica Bay \u2014 a side of Rockaway mostly overshadowed by the beachside.\u201cAll of these neighborhoods, tens of thousands of people, will just get flooded again from the back in another Sandy event,\u201d said Dan Mundy Jr., who lives on the bay and is the president of the Broad Channel Civic Association. \u201cAll our hopes are on the gate.\u201dBut the specifics of a large-scale, national infrastructure bill would most likely be determined by Republicans, who control Congress. Neither the Trump administration nor the Republicans in Congress have presented such a plan.Rockaway residents acknowledge the post-Sandy improvements in their neighborhoods, but are bracing for the worst, wondering whether measures taken so far are enough to protect the community.Yet, some noted that the reinforced boardwalk does not extend to the western half of the peninsula.\u201cThat concrete boardwalk will be there for a long time,\u201d said John Cori, a 54-year-old Rockaway resident who is the president of the Rockaway Beach Civic Association.\u201cOur homes will be gone, but we\u2019ll be able to come back and walk the boardwalk,\u201d he added, half-joking.As the federal government slowly unfurls its long-awaited construction in Rockaway, the city points to other federally funded initiatives. The city plans to spend $120 million to finance the construction of seven parks designed to be more resilient than those destroyed in Rockaway during Sandy.But, ultimately, city officials are looking at the federal government to do the heavy lifting.\u201cThe short answer, I think on this, is that we really need our federal partners to step in here,\u201d said Michael Shaikh, the deputy director for external affairs for climate policy and programs at the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cThis is a huge, gigantic project.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Wanda Deal, Chinese Property Developer Faces Debt Risk", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese property developer Sunac China Holdings has turned into one of the country\u2019s biggest white knights, swooping in to help troubled companies with too much debt. The risk: Sunac is amassing its own large pile of debt in the process.\u201cThe problem for Sunac is twofold,\u201d said Peter Fuhrman, chairman of China First Capital, an investment bank. \u201cThey themselves are already rather overleveraged and they are not paying distressed prices.\u201dSunac is offering a much-needed lifeline.Sunac, China\u2019s seventh-largest property developer in terms of sales, has been able to tap into its financial strength to help companies under pressure. Since 2012, Sunac\u2019s property sales have grown at double-digit rates nearly every year, giving it the firepower to scoop up assets and land plots.It is a remarkable turnabout for the company\u2019s founder, Sun Hongbin.Mr. Sun started his career at the Lenovo Group, where he was promoted to run enterprise development. But he had a falling out with Liu Chuanzhi, the founder of Lenovo, over a business dispute. Related to the dispute, Mr. Sun was sentenced in 1992 to five years in jail for misappropriation of public funds.After his release in 1994, he met with the founder of Lenovo and apologized, according to the website of The People\u2019s Daily, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper. The Lenovo founder eventually lent Mr. Sun about $74,000, which he used to start a predecessor real estate firm to Sunac.Lenovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.When Mr. Sun started Sunac in 2003, he focused on the cities of Wuxi and Chongqing and then moved on to China\u2019s most developed cities, among them Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Hangzhou, building apartments with names like Beijing Fontainebleau Chateau. Sunac built its residential projects in good locations near city centers and was aggressive in acquiring land plots \u2014 with higher debt.\u201cPeople who have failed are those who have been defeated by themselves,\u201d Mr. Sun told a newspaper, China Business News, in 2013. \u201cBut I often tell others: After you fail, you can start again.\u201dWith the Wanda deal, Sunac is extending its reach into tourism, paying $9.3 billion for 76 hotels and a major chunk of its 13 tourism projects, in the country\u2019s largest property acquisition ever. The purchase will help Sunac diversify its business, which is hurting from government restrictions on home sales as Beijing seeks to cool a frothy property market. It also strengthens the company\u2019s hand in an industry dominated by bigwigs like the China Vanke Group and Country Garden.\u201cWithin the housing industry, the powerhouses are really strong,\u201d said Lu Wenxi, an analyst for Centaline Properties who is based in Shanghai. \u201cIf you don\u2019t gobble up the fat ones, it is easy to be eaten up by others. Taking on more projects will prevent you from being eaten.\u201dInvestors have rewarded Sunac for the deal. Shares of Sunac rose 14 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday after they resumed trading after the deal announcement.But the deal will add to an already significant debt load. In 2016, the company\u2019s net gearing ratio \u2014 a measure of total debt to shareholders\u2019 equity \u2014 rose to 121.5 percent, from to 75.9 percent in 2015. Fitch Ratings recently downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating to BB-, saying Sunac\u2019s acquisitive approach had made its financial profile \u201cmore volatile.\u201dWanda is helping finance the acquisition. Sunac, in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, said Wanda would procure a loan for the company worth about $4.4 billion.Seller financing is not uncommon, both in China and the West. But Wanda\u2019s role means that Sunac doesn\u2019t have all the money upfront.\u201cIn my experience, I\u2019ve never seen it anywhere,\u201d said Lester Ross, a Beijing-based partner with the law firm WilmerHale, who has advised deals in China for the last 20 years. \u201cNo client that I represent would accept a deal like that where you\u2019re responsible for raising the money to pay for somebody else.\u201dSunac did not return multiple calls for comment. The company said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday that the deal with Wanda \u201cwill add a large number of prime land reserves and property assets for the company at a reasonable cost.\u201dThe LeEco deal is also prompting concern.Sunac invested $2.2 billion in LeEco, buying minority stakes in three of the conglomerate\u2019s more stable businesses, including the smart TV affiliate Leshi Zhixin, Le Vision Pictures, and Leshi Internet. The two companies don\u2019t have many overlapping interests, and LeEco\u2019s finances have continued to sour. Before the Wanda deal, shares of Sunac were falling on fears that LeEco\u2019s problems would spread.In a January news conference, Mr. Sun said many people had tried to dissuade him from investing in LeEco, adding that several were \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to it.\u201cI seriously considered their views, but I don\u2019t think their opinions are sufficient to change my mind,\u201d he said.Research was contributed by Ryan McMorrow, Tang Yucheng, Zhang Tiantian and Amy Cheng.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Medicare for All\u2019 Isn\u2019t Sounding So Crazy Anymore", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionDuring the 2016 campaign, Andrea Barton Gurney thought that single-payer health care was simply out of the question. A self-described moderate, Ms. Gurney, 56, assumed that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats would keep trying to make the Affordable Care Act work.Now she has changed her mind. She believes the best solution to America\u2019s health care woes is government-financed coverage for everyone. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking big enough,\u201d said Ms. Gurney, a marketing professional from New Jersey. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything else that\u2019s going to get us out of this.\u201dSingle payer is now poised to become the standard position for the Democratic base. More elected Democrats are following suit as Republicans struggle to get their deeply unpopular health care bill past Congress. The prevailing assumption is that the G.O.P. effort will ultimately implode, clearing the way for a bold alternative. Senator Dick Durbin, the upper chamber\u2019s second-highest-ranking Democrat, told me that he\u2019d happily sign onto a single-payer bill \u2014 and might even bring one to the floor himself.But while liberals have spent decades pining for single payer \u2014 Ted Kennedy drew up a bill in 1970 \u2014 there are surprisingly few detailed proposals.During the 2016 campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders released a skeletal framework for single payer that went into great detail on new taxes while skating over most everything else. In the House, Representative John Conyers\u2019s single-payer proposal has 114 co-sponsors, but it\u2019s essentially a messaging bill that signals a political position but is not expected to pass.While billed as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d both these plans would be more generous than traditional Medicare and most private insurance plans: They would eliminate all co-pays and deductibles and include costly services like long-term care, which Medicare doesn\u2019t cover.What\u2019s far less clear is how we\u2019d get there. To be able to deliver on its promises, single payer would not only require trillions in new revenue through higher taxes, but also huge cost savings from slashing payments to drug companies, doctors and hospitals. \u201cThere are a million and one complexities\u201d to single payer that no one has really dealt with, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cAll of those are really morasses when you get down to that level of detail.\u201dSenator Sanders went out of his way to list all the tax hikes he\u2019d use to pay for his 2016 proposal, including an across-the-board 2.2 percent income tax. But two prominent policy analysts said the plan would cost about twice as much as the senator claimed.Underlying the dispute are different assumptions about how single payer would work. How much could we save if the government negotiated directly with drug companies? How much care would patients seek in a world without co-pays?These aren\u2019t minor details; they get to the heart of the most common attack on single payer \u2014 that it\u2019s too costly and too disruptive. Moving to true single payer would effectively end the current role of the private insurance industry, not only getting rid of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges but also the employer-based plans that cover more than half of non-elderly Americans.Single-payer advocates believe that radical change is necessary, pointing out that the United States spends more on health care than any other wealthy country, with some of the worst health outcomes. But many advanced, industrialized democracies with universal coverage don\u2019t have a pure single-payer system. France, for instance, has health care for all that is largely state-financed, but most people also buy private supplemental coverage.While \u201csingle payer\u201d has become an effective political rallying cry, advocates still need to figure out what it would mean for one of the largest, most complex health care systems in the world. Senator Sanders himself is preparing to introduce a single-payer bill that will be \u201cfar more detailed than the campaign plan\u201d and include changes to address cost concerns, said a spokesman, Josh Miller-Lewis.Mr. Baker believes the top priority is a credible transition plan. \u201cIf you just take everyone with employer-provided insurance and put all of them on a public plan, you\u2019re going to freak people out,\u201d he said. He\u2019s interested in reviving the public option \u2014 a government-run plan that would compete with private insurance on the exchanges \u2014 as well as opening up Medicare or Medicaid to those who want to buy in.It\u2019s unclear how receptive the base would be to incremental reforms. They could be a reminder of what\u2019s hamstrung Democrats in the past: ceding ground to centrists who insist on largely unobjectionable \u2014 and uninspiring \u2014 white papers. Jeff Hauser, a progressive strategist, argues that the movement should come before the details. \u201cYou don\u2019t build a political coalition around wonks,\u201d he says.What Democrats need to emphasize above all, Mr. Hauser argues, are big ideas that can energize their supporters. More than anything, \u201csingle payer\u201d has become shorthand for the notion that everyone deserves health care. \u201cHealth care should be a right. It should never be a privilege,\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and a potential 2020 presidential candidate, recently asserted. \u201cWe should have Medicare for all in this country.\u201dBut the more political headway that single payer makes, the more supporters will need to explain how it could actually work in practice. Otherwise, Democrats risk making the same mistake on health care as Republicans: big promises without a plan to follow through.Suzy Khimm is a freelance writer in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the (Empty) Apartment Next Door Is Owned by an Oligarch", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn each of these cities there are at least some indications that what is troubling the housing market can be traced elsewhere \u2014 to Russian oligarchs, Brazilian bank accounts, Chinese businessmen. It\u2019s possible that foreign money isn\u2019t just driving up prices for penthouses; it may also be distorting the market, to the detriment of lifelong residents.But the true extent of the phenomenon is maddeningly hard to measure. So are its broader economic effects. Local governments have barely attempted to track the cash influx. And each of these global cities has become attractive to investors partly because housing in them is scarce, making claims of insufficient supply and excessive demand all the more difficult to untangle.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about an asset bubble in apples, or copper or something that you could easily forgo,\u201d said Josh Gordon, a professor in the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. Worrisome things happen when one person\u2019s asset is another\u2019s shelter.That is the largest sum since the organization began tracking foreign investment in 2009, and those purchases amounted to 10 percent of the dollar value of all existing-home sales in the United States last year. Nearly half of that money went into just three states: California, Florida and Texas.\u201cWithout a doubt, foreigners are pushing up the prices in California and Florida,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. That is good for existing homeowners, he said, and it is positive for the American economy that foreigners are confident about investing here. But it also pushes first-time buyers out of local markets, Mr. Yun said.Data they obtained from CoreLogic shows that the share of home purchases made by out-of-town buyers has increased steadily since 2004 in both metropolitan New York and Manhattan. More than one in 10 purchases in Manhattan now includes such a buyer (the \u201cout-of-town\u201d definition here doesn\u2019t distinguish between domestic investors and Russian oligarchs, but the effects are the same in the modeling, and the authors think of the problem as one of foreign money).When they assume a worst-case scenario \u2014 all of these out-of-town purchases sit vacant \u2014 rents and home prices in the city rise, wages tick up thanks to new construction jobs, commute times for workers grow longer, and center city neighborhoods become less diverse as the wealthy move in. All else equal, they conclude, the rise in out-of-town buyers from levels seen a decade ago pushes home prices up in New York by about 1.1 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but the net effect is a negative one for the city\u2019s welfare, the researchers conclude.\u201cAnd then there are costs that are harder to quantify,\u201d Professor Van Nieuwerburgh said. \u201cThe texture of the city, the socioeconomic makeup of the city, is changing.\u201dRhys Kesselman, another professor at Simon Fraser University, has proposed an intriguing alternative: a property surtax tilted toward high-end homes that would be deductible against the owner\u2019s income tax. Local residents paying income taxes would effectively owe no surtax. Out-of-town investors, foreign or domestic, who don\u2019t work in the local economy would be hardest hit (with some concessions for resident retirees).The elegance of that idea is that it doesn\u2019t require local governments to figure out who is foreign and who is not, or which homes are vacant and which are occupied. And it recognizes that the real problem isn\u2019t foreigners; it\u2019s speculation in the housing market that, these days, often tends to come from abroad.Advertisement"}

Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict.Aleppo was locked in battle for years as government and rebel forces fought to control the city.

Some animals were killed by bombs or shells, while others were left to starve in their cages.Dr. Khalil said he had also worried that the animals could pose a threat to humans if left neglected in poorly maintained enclosures.At least two lions and two dogs remain in the zoo and are expected to be evacuated in the coming days, Mr. Margolis said.\u201cWe are waiting day by day now; we hope it will happen this week,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are literally risking their lives to go into a war zone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But they would not have happened 10 years ago, never mind a few decades ago, she said.These changes, Ms. Weiner added, represent real progress in what she described as a sad situation for older lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, including early pioneers in the pride movement who are now in their 60s, 70s and 80s.\u201cIt\u2019s become abundantly clear that there are a lot of elders who feel they have to go back in the closet when they enter nursing homes or any care facility,\u201d Ms. Weiner said.Sensitizing nursing home workers is not the only avenue to improvement. Since 2010, several independent living communities designed for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender retirees have opened.\u201cThere are at least a half-dozen that are up and running, and maybe another half-dozen far enough along in the development process that we can confidently say they\u2019re going to open,\u201d said Michael Adams, the C.E.O. of Sage. The nonprofit is building one retirement community with subsidized rents in the Bronx and another in Brooklyn, he said. Market-rate communities, he added, are scattered across the country.Such problems for older people are, sadly, not surprising, he said, because \u201cif you look at research, you find that the older a person is, the more likely he is to harbor bias.\u201dThe two new Sage buildings \u2014 the 145-unit Ingersoll Senior Residences in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and the 82-unit Crotona Senior Residences in the Bronx \u2014 were financed under Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s 10-year housing plan aimed at creating and preserving 200,000 units of affordable housing. Both are expected to open in summer 2019 and to have long waiting lists.More than 1,000 people have already expressed interest in becoming among the first to move in, Mr. Adams said. A lottery to determine the first batch of residents will open in January 2019.\u201cWe know for sure that the demand for these apartments is going to outstrip the supply,\u201d he said, which seems to be a common problem across the United States.A sign on the front of the building reads \u201cL.G.B.T. friendly.\u201d Events like a community birthday party to celebrate residents born in a given month are held regularly to promote neighborly bonding. As is customary in affordable buildings devoted to this community, residents pay varied rents, not in excess of 30 percent of their income.\u201cWe say it\u2019s L.G.B.T. friendly, not L.G.B.T. exclusive, because the apartments are federally funded,\u201d Mr. Miller said. He estimated that 85 percent of the residents are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.Ms. Larson said Town Hall was the second affordable retirement home focused on this community to open in the Midwest and the fourth in the country.\u201cWhich is surprising but it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe L.G.B.T. movement tends to be youth focused. Older adults are less visible.\u201d With less visibility comes more vulnerability, she added: \u201cPeople forget that this is a population that faced a lifetime of discrimination. They\u2019ve had unequal access to health care because of workplace discrimination. And many of them don\u2019t have children, so they\u2019re aging alone.\u201dOften, the new communities make up for that. Ms. Larson has seen neighbors cooking for one another and driving one another to the hospital in lieu of family members.\u201cBut that\u2019s normal for one of these communities, unfortunately,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many twists and turns.\u201d They mostly revolve around cutting through the red tape that goes along with establishing funding for affordable housing.If the process of building is slow going, the process of filling the units can be dizzying. When Openhouse Community\u2019s application window was open for seven days last year, 1,800 people applied; all but the 50 current residents were turned away. Construction is expected to start this summer on a second Openhouse Community in San Francisco, with 79 more units. But that won\u2019t be enough.\u201cThere really is a severe housing crisis for L.G.B.T. elders,\u201d Dr. Skultety said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly sad.\u201dThose fortunate enough to secure an apartment in one of the new retirement communities, like Michael Palumbaro, a 74-year-old retired nurse, often cannot believe their luck.\u201cIs it paradise? No,\u201d said Mr. Palumbaro, who was the second person to move into the John C.

{"Headline": "G.E. Results Show Next Chief\u2019s Challenges at Revamped Company", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Flannery will not formally assume the job of chief executive of General Electric until August. But he made a cameo appearance in an earnings conference call on Friday, and said he was conducting a rigorous review of each of the company\u2019s businesses and would present his plans in November.His analysis, Mr. Flannery said, was a big task across a large global corporation. He said he was \u201cnot worried about the company being dead in the water until then.\u201dBut G.E. said earnings for the year would probably be at the low end of the company\u2019s previous projection of operating earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 a share. That sent G.E. shares down about 4 percent in early trading.The company\u2019s financial performance continues to be hurt by the impact of low energy prices on its big oil-field equipment business. And as G.E. has sold off much of its once-huge financial arm, the contribution from GE Capital has shrunk as well \u2014 a streamlining by design as the company returns to its industrial roots.G.E. reported operating earnings per share of 28 cents, a 45 percent decline from the year-earlier quarter, but slightly above the average estimate of analysts of 25 cents a share, as complied by Thomson Reuters.The company reported a 12 percent falloff in revenue, to $29.56 billion, somewhat higher than the Wall Street average forecast of $29.02 billion. But organic revenue from industrial operations, which excludes one-time gains or losses from asset sales or acquisitions, increased 2 percent, to $28 billion. Industrial results are the crucial yardstick for G.E. now as its finance unit is pared back.But the number that investors were watching most closely was cash flow. A Wall Street maxim states that earnings are an opinion, but cash is a fact. That is, big companies can often employ financial-engineering tactics to lift reported earnings.Free cash flow \u2014 cash generated, minus capital expenses \u2014 can be a purer measure of the financial health of a business. For G.E., the cash flow numbers have been disappointing since last year. And in the first quarter, the company reported a negative cash flow of $1.6 billion from industrial operations, $1 billion below management\u2019s earlier forecast.G.E.\u2019s executives said the shortfall was largely explained by the increase in inventory for orders on new products coming to market, including jet engines, power generators and locomotives. That capital-intensive buildup is a short-term drain on cash, but it reflects strong orders that later convert to sales and profit.On Friday, G.E. reported free cash flow from industrial operations of $1.5 billion, a reassuring move into positive territory. Much of the company\u2019s cash flow comes at the end of the year, because that is when industrial customers buy new equipment. Still, it will need a strong second half to achieve its forecast of cash flow of $12 billion to $14 billion for the year.Investors are keeping a close eye on cash generation because G.E. has pulled back from its profit goal for 2018. The target for next year is significant because in 2015, when G.E. announced plans for shedding most of GE Capital, it also laid out its three-year plan for the company. It would pare back to its industrial core, and its earnings would rise to $2 a share by 2018.On May 24, speaking to analysts at a G.E. conference in Florida, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, recalled the 2015 plan and the years since. The oil and gas market, given the price declines, was \u201cmuch tougher\u201d than anticipated, he said. A bit later, referring to the 2018 profit goal, he said, \u201cTwo dollars will be at the high end of the range\u201d of likely outcomes. Translated: scarcely a chance.\u201cWhen he had to talk down the number, that became a lightning rod for criticism,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Less than a month later, Mr. Flannery was named the new chief at G.E. After 16 years as chief executive, Mr. Immelt was expected to step down, but the timing surprised analysts.On Friday, G.E. executives offered no guidance for 2018 earnings \u2014 that will come in November from Mr. Flannery. But Wall Street analysts have already scaled back their profit forecast for 2018 to $1.81 a share.Under Mr. Immelt, G.E. has stepped up its expense reduction efforts under pressure from Trian Fund Management, an activist fund led by the investor Nelson Peltz. G.E. said it was on pace to cut its costs by $1 billion this year. Mr. Flannery pledged to accelerate the cost-cutting campaign.G.E.\u2019s new chief inherits a fundamentally strong company, with industry-leading businesses led by jet engines and electrical power generators. It is once again an industrial giant, and no longer one attached to a sprawling financial institution.G.E. not only weathered the financial crisis but also made large investments. A crucial initiative has been to transform G.E. into a \u201cdigital-industrial\u201d company, adding software and data analysis to its heavy equipment. The digital technology opens the door to predictive maintenance, lower fuel consumption, reduced carbon emissions and longer-lived equipment. G.E. has hired thousands of software engineers and developed a data collection and analysis software product. More than 100 of the world\u2019s airlines have signed up to use it.But the digital buildup has been costly. G.E. will have invested $6.6 billion, from 2011 through the end of this year, with most of the spending in the last two years, estimates Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Company.Such investments, however, had a trade-off, as they sacrificed near-term profit for a hoped-for future payoff.Mr. Flannery will now have to decide where to continue spending and where to cut.\u201cG.E. has great technology, but none of that means a thing if you can\u2019t deliver strong profits from it,\u201d said Scott Davis, a former Barclays analyst who is setting up a research boutique.Advertisement"}

In places like south Chicago\u2019s Pullman neighborhood, this was the reality of U.S. manufacturing less than a century ago.Today, things have changed. Large and small companies across industries are adopting more sustainable models for manufacturing. These efforts not only contribute to a cleaner environment, they are also boosting the bottom line for companies by reducing costs and building customer loyalty. Reflecting this change, the nonprofit organization B Lab has now certified more than 2,000 companies worldwide as B Corps that meet exacting standards for environmental, social and other measures of sustainability.Maximizing the impact of sustainable manufacturing requires a multipronged approach. A factory should do more than just have a light footprint, says David Fannon, architecture professor and sustainable design expert at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cSustainability [alone] is probably not sufficient. We need buildings that are actively beneficial rather than merely being somewhat less harmful.\u201dThis is the philosophy behind Method\u2019s South Side Soapbox factory in Pullman, located on the same plot of Chicago land where the Pullman Company made its famous railroad cars until 1955. The factory generates much of its own power, uses recycled materials and offsets its water use by financing sustainable farming practices. By developing a range of operations that benefit not only the company but also the environment, workers and customers, Method\u2019s Soapbox is helping lead the movement for sustainable manufacturing. Method is among the first companies to receive a B Corp certification, and it has also reincorporated itself as a benefit corporation. Such companies count goals for social, workforce and environmental benefit along with profit among their legal obligations. For Method, these principles were part of the company\u2019s culture from its founding in 2001, when high school buddies Eric Ryan and Adam Lowry took on an entrenched industry with the bold idea that cleaning products should be good for the home and the environment.The Greenhouse / Gotham GreensThe farm atop the Method factory \u2014 owned and operated by partner Gotham Greens \u2014 is a green oasis in what is otherwise a food desert in this industrial neighborhood. Inside, urban farmers pick leafy greens and herbs for local consumers, who receive them only a day after harvest. Hydroponics and a computer-controlled climate enable farmers to grow as much food in a rooftop acre and a half as nearly 50 acres on a conventional farm \u2014 without pesticides or herbicides and using a tenth of the water.Community / WorkforceThe partners involved in building the factory chose the Pullman district of Chicago because of community input. Not only does the factory honor a rich history of community-based manufacturing in Pullman, but its managers also give preference to residents when hiring \u2014 even those without prior manufacturing experience. The result is a factory that supports the community as well as a workforce that is uniquely motivated and empowered to help foster the innovations that a small company like Method needs to compete against larger competitors.WaterTo offset water use by the factory \u2014 which ships water out of the Great Lakes region with every bottle of soap \u2014 Method turned to The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy, with funding from Method, works with farmers in the region to use less water with practices such as no-till agriculture and the use of cover crops to shelter the land in winter. Besides offsetting the water used by the factory, these techniques have the added benefit of cutting costs for farmers and reducing soil erosion, thus helping to preserve the fertility of their land.EnergyThe Method South Side Soapbox factory\u2019s 230-foot, 600-kilowatt wind turbine \u2014 refurbished and thus recycled after first seeing service in Europe \u2014 generates about a third of the power the factory uses.

In a 2014 survey conducted by management consultancy McKinsey & Company, 43 percent of CEOs said that their companies had made sustainability a major focus for their businesses \u2014 up 30 percent from a 2012 survey.Today, companies are going beyond just sustainability, placing eco-friendly operations at the core of their businesses.In their 2002 book, \u201cCradle to Cradle,\u201d architect William McDonough and industrial chemist Michael Braungart put forth a vision for industry to benefit people and the natural world as well as generate profits. It was time, they said, to move to a new paradigm of sustainability they call eco-effectiveness.McDonough says that the purpose of commerce should be to create positives rather than negatives. Instead of taking resources from surrounding communities, companies should strive to benefit the environment in which they operate. \u201cWhy would you privatize the benefit and socialize the damage?\u201d he asks.A key tenet of eco-effectiveness is not just to reuse and recycle products but to recover materials so they can be \u201cupcycled\u201d into new products with no loss of quality \u2014 much as Apple is doing with its \u201cRenew\u201d program. Rather than simply melt down metallic components into low-grade alloys that can\u2019t be used for new phones and other devices, the metals are recovered separately in their pure form and put back into new products.Similarly, Method\u2019s soap bottles are made from clear recycled plastic. By colocating bottle manufacturer Amcor in its factory, Method skips the time-consuming and energy-intensive step of shipping in empty bottles from a remote facility; instead it transforms recycled-plastic pellets into the bottles you see on store shelves. In just that one area of production, costs are reduced in multiple ways with no sacrifice to quality and with significant environmental benefits.The most sustainable approach also seeks to benefit the communities where manufacturing takes place, which often means factory employees themselves. \u201cSustainable factories give back to the community by creating steady jobs in urban communities while maintaining the quality of local air and water. This helps in increasing and/or strengthening the local middle class, who can live safely with their families nearby. It\u2019s a win for both company and community,\u201d says Ramon Sanchez, director of the sustainable technologies and health program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.A recent study found that worker morale was 55 percent higher in companies with strong sustainability programs. Ripple effects include greater employee loyalty, higher motivation and positive impacts on turnover and recruitment.When choosing a location for its factory, Method had a vision to stimulate a local economy and tap into a community of motivated workers. It incorporated features such as an abundance of natural light, recreational areas and a rooftop garden to contribute to mental well-being.The result is a workforce eager to learn and engage in the kind of creative problem solving that companies need to remain globally competitive, says Garry Embleton, vice president of operations and supply chain at Method. More and more, studies show that employees desire mission and purpose in their work lives.\u201cWhen you walk into this factory, you\u2019re contributing to something bigger,\u201d says Embleton.This new breed of manufacturing does more than lead to greener products and better communities \u2014 it also boosts the bottom line. In 2013, GE saved $300 million by significantly reducing its water use and gas emissions compared to its 2004 and 2006 baselines.Method\u2019s South Side Soapbox factory, the only Platinum LEED\u2013certified factory in its industry, is headed toward similar results, inspiring other companies to follow suit. The factory launched in January 2015 with a single assembly line, and it is already adding another to keep up with double-digit growth. At the same time, B Lab named Method as a 2016 Best for the World company. This year the company achieved a B Impact Assessment score of 146 out of a possible 200, putting it in the top 2 percent of B Corps.\u201cMethod\u2019s South Side Soapbox factory might represent the new normal for many small urban manufacturing corporations in the U.S.,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cThese companies use sustainability as a way to increase their competitiveness in the global markets.\u201dJust like those making goods, customers increasingly feel the need to be part of a broader movement contributing to greater customer retention and, ultimately, revenue.\u201cNew customers, particularly millennials, consider one of the main goals of any business is to improve society more than just generating profits,\u201d Sanchez says.It\u2019s all part of the virtuous cycle envisioned by companies defining what it means to manufacture sustainably: to benefit not just the manufacturer but also surrounding eco- and economic systems.At Method, McDonough says, it comes down to a feeling: \u201cThis factory is looking at the idea of being able to humbly experience the joy of working toward the good.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Mapping the Brutality of North Korea, and Where the Bodies Are Buried", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For two years, from a cramped office in central Seoul, activists and volunteers from five countries have been doing something never tried before: creating interactive maps of places where North Korea is thought to have executed and buried prisoners.Over the years, defectors from the isolated country have testified to widespread human rights violations there, including what United Nations investigators have determined were extrajudicial executions of political prisoners and others. But there has never been a coordinated attempt to locate where those killings took place because the country remains off limits to outside rights investigators.\u201cIt is not unreasonable to assume that mass grave sites in existence today will still be there years from now,\u201d said Sarah A. Son, the group\u2019s research director. \u201cAs we have seen in many other post-conflict settings around the world, people will want to know what happened to family members, and an accurate historical record will need to be created as part of the process of recovery, particularly on a scale such as that in North Korea.\u201dArmed with Google Earth satellite imagery, the group has interviewed 375 North Korean defectors, asking them to help locate sites so that international rights officials can one day visit them to investigate, exhume bodies, secure forensic evidence and possibly bring charges against perpetrators. With the maps, the group said it aimed to provide \u201ca sense of the scale of the human rights violations, their locations, and their victims and their approximate numbers.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know when there will be a trial or other steps to hold perpetrators of the human rights abuses accountable, but that time will come, and we want to be as ready as possible,\u201d said Dan Bielefeld, a web developer and human rights activist from Milwaukee. \u201cOur location-based map of suspected sites is a start down that road.\u201dThe North vehemently denied the findings, and its allies China and Russia have stalled any attempt to bring the North before the tribunal.The activists\u2019 group, whose mapping project was financed by the National Endowment for Democracy, based in Washington, did not include the interactive maps in its report for fear North Korea would tamper with the sites. But it allowed a reporter to examine them on the condition that the locations of the sites would not be revealed.More than 200 locations where killings are suspected, marked with blue squares, were clustered in Hamgyongbukdo, a northeastern province of North Korea. Most of the defectors interviewed hailed from that province. (A vast majority of 30,000 North Korean defectors living in South Korea come from the provinces bordering China.)When Mr. Bielefeld zoomed in on one town, 53 blue squares appeared within 2.5 miles of a hillside site where burials are suspected. When he clicked on a square, a brief summary popped up: a public execution by firing squad on charges the victim stole parts of mining equipment. The victim was shot by three officers from the Ministry of People\u2019s Security.Each square was linked to digital testimonials, including audio files, from defectors. Some testimonials gave detailed firsthand accounts with the name and profession of the victim, while others relied on secondhand information.In one testimonial, a defector cited a neighbor who saw security officers hacking a victim to death in a garage. The neighbor later confirmed from a relative working as a security officer that such extrajudicial killings were common in the garage. Mr. Bielefeld put a blue square on the building on his program based on the open-source OpenStreetMap.The group said North Koreans were executed for such crimes as smuggling mushrooms to China, stealing copper from factories, distributing South Korean dramas, human trafficking and \u201ca slip of the tongue,\u201d usually a reference to criticism of the government.It said public executions took place most often between 1994 and 2000, during which North Korea struggled to control its people, who were suffering in a nationwide famine.\u201cThey hanged people in crowded places like markets and left the bodies there for hours to instill fear among the people,\u201d said Oh Se-hyek, a North Korean defector who conducted the interviews for the mapping project.Mr. Oh said the biggest challenge for him was to persuade other defectors to testify for the mapping project, even when he promised not to reveal their personal information. Even after resettling in South Korea, defectors feared that the North Korean authorities would trace their whereabouts and retaliate against their relatives back in the North.Some of the executions on the digital maps dated from the 1960s, but some were as recent as 2015. As many as 15 people were executed at the same time, usually by firing squad.Lee Young-hwan, executive director of the Transitional Justice Working Group, recalled the shock he felt when he was a college student doing volunteer work with North Korean defectors in 1999. During a painting class, a 7-year-old boy from the North depicted a scene he saw in his old homeland: uniformed North Korean soldiers executing people by shooting.Encouraged by the 2014 United Nations report, Mr. Lee began putting together the international team to use satellite imagery and open-source mapping technology to record North Korean human rights violations, just as security analysts use such technology to monitor the North\u2019s military and nuclear sites.\u201cAs we interview more defectors down the road, we expect to locate more killing and burial sites across the North,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cOur work is still at an early stage. This is a collaborative work, and we expect more technical and other volunteers to join us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mind-Boggling Ascent of Amazon and Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesAmazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are having a moment.Yet noteworthy as these real-world achievements are, they may understate Amazon\u2019s importance. Despite an earnings report on Thursday evening that disappointed the market and led to a 2.5 percent decline in its share price, Amazon is remarkable as a purely financial entity. Its stature as one of the most successful companies in the history of the stock market is already assured. In fact, the numbers show that since 1997, when it became a publicly traded company, Amazon has evolved into one of the century\u2019s greatest wealth-generating machines.When I first spoke with Professor Bessembinder in May, he had prepared a list of the 30 greatest wealth creators in the stock market through 2015. But this past week, he showed me a Lifetime Wealth Creation list, with fresh rankings through 2016. The stocks at the very top remained the same: Exxon Mobil, followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM.But further down the list, Amazon appears for the first time. It is ranked 14th, just behind such august names as Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble and ahead of Coca-Cola and DuPont.In essence, the list shows which stocks have been the most profitable for shareholders over history. A very small group \u2014 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks \u2014 account for all of the stock market\u2019s net gains from 1926 through 2016, he found. And only 30 stocks \u2014 Amazon is now one of them \u2014 account for more than 30 percent of all of the market\u2019s wealth creation in that 90-year period.What\u2019s more, Professor Bessembinder found that Amazon\u2019s annualized return through 2016 was 37.4 percent, the highest of all the top 30 wealth creators. That is partly because Amazon hasn\u2019t existed for that long: It\u2019s easier to sustain fast growth for shorter periods. Exxon, for example, which has created more than $1 trillion in wealth for shareholders since 1926, more than any other company, ground out its gains at a slower pace: It has an annualized return of only 11.9 percent, Professor Bessembinder said.Even after the earnings blip on Thursday, Amazon\u2019s value in the market has skyrocketed this year. It has risen more than 36 percent. \u201cIf it holds onto those gains, we can expect that it will climb higher on the cumulative wealth creation list,\u201d he said.Of course, while Amazon\u2019s market power has been wonderful for its own investors, it has damaged many of its competitors \u2014 diminishing the wealth of shareholders of those companies.Consider how Amazon\u2019s cumulative stock returns dwarf those of its retail competitors and the overall market. Using Thomson Reuters data, I calculated that over the last 15 years through Tuesday, Amazon returned more than 8,200 percent, compared with 125 percent for Walmart, 2.2 percent for Sears, and 302 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, dividends included.If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 \u2014 and had held onto your shares \u2014 that money would be worth $83,000 today.By comparison, $1,000 invested in the entire Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends, would amount to $4,100 \u2014 not a bad performance, until you look at the gaudy Amazon returns. Far worse, if you had put the money in Walmart shares, your investment would be worth only $2,250. And if you had stuck with Sears during all of its travails, you would be almost where you started, with $1,022.Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm, has another way of comparing Amazon\u2019s stock returns with those of its retail competitors. It has built the Death by Amazon Index, which it describes as \u201ca way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com.\u201d Those companies \u2014 there are now 54 of them \u2014 include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart.The numbers are stark. The Death by Amazon Index has declined 18.9 percent through Monday \u2014 trailing Amazon by almost 55 percentage points.Unlike Mr. Gates, who has diversified his portfolio and has been giving money to charity at a rapid pace, Mr. Bezos continues to bet heavily on Amazon. As Thursday\u2019s earnings report showed, that does entail risk. The company\u2019s ever-expanding retail operations are sapping its profits, but it has been raking in earnings through cloud computing. As has been the case since Amazon\u2019s inception, it pays no dividends, instead plowing cash back into the company\u2019s core.For now, the mighty Amazon wealth-creation machine continues to roar. Whatever happens next, this is already one of the great tales in the history of capitalism.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just How Far Can California Possibly Go on Climate?", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past decade, California has passed a sweeping set of climate laws to test a contentious theory: that it\u2019s possible to cut greenhouse gas emissions far beyond what any other state has done and still enjoy robust economic growth.So how will California pull this off?If California prevails, it could provide a model for other policy makers, even as President Trump scales back the federal government\u2019s efforts on climate change. The state may also develop new technologies that the rest of the world can use to cut emissions.And if California falters, or if the experiment proves too costly? \u201cOther states and countries will be watching that, too,\u201d Mr. Borenstein said.Second, the board envisioned the number of electric cars and other zero-emissions vehicles on California\u2019s roads rising to 4.2 million by 2030 from 250,000 today. Freight trucks would have to become more efficient or electrified, while cities would need to adopt far-reaching strategies to promote mass transit, biking and walking.So, as a complement to these efforts, Mr. Brown insisted on expanding another major program: cap and trade.In 2012, under a previous climate law signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Air Resources Board imposed a statewide ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions. It then distributed a fixed number of tradable pollution permits to power plants, refineries, factories and other large emitters.So far, California\u2019s initial cap has had a relatively minor effect on emissions, as other policies, like the renewable electricity mandate, have done most of the heavy lifting and businesses have had relatively little trouble staying under pollution limits.But as the cap keeps tightening, it\u2019s expected to have a sharper bite. The law Mr. Brown signed extends the program through 2030, and limits the ability of businesses to purchase cheap offsets to comply (by, for example, paying for tree-planting programs).Notably, the Air Resources Board must also now set a ceiling on permit prices \u2014 if they spike, regulators will flood the market with permits to prevent a political backlash. While no one is exactly sure how much California\u2019s climate policies will ultimately cost, this ceiling will set a limit on that price tag: If climate policy poses too severe a threat to economic growth, the state will prioritize growth.\u201cIf the cap-and-trade market melted down, that could be a real deterrent elsewhere,\u201d said Mr. Borenstein, the University of California professor. \u201cThe rest of the world is going to be watching closely.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to a category in the California Air Resources Board\u2019s proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions. One-third of the reductions would come from a variety of climate pollutants other than carbon dioxide, not just from methane. The error was repeated in a chart.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Tech Execs Act Like Spoiled Brats, Should We Spank Them?", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayI\u2019ve been thinking about dog collars, the ones that deliver electric shocks to keep dogs from straying out of their yards. Why not use them to correct the behavior of our bad boys of tech and finance?The tech world seems to have been field-testing that thought experiment, and the results have not been edifying.Not that I\u2019m above temptation myself. Who wants to be bound by the behavioral constraints of petty mortals. As a kid, I would fold strips of aluminum foil, stick them into the wall outlet and slap them together to see the sparks: a kind of youthful nerd vandalism. Even today, I have felt the urge to run that red light, or to boisterously split infinitives. I\u2019m a wild man!My favorite novel, William Gaddis\u2019s \u201cJR,\u201d deals with these issues. In the book, an 11-year-old boy becomes a corporate titan. Wheeling and dealing from his school\u2019s pay phone and employing a penniless music teacher as a frontman, little JR builds his improbable business empire precisely because of his childish immorality and greed. I first read the book in college, and recently read it again \u2014 and each time, I was struck by how very up-to-date that kid seemed.It was the kind of question my wife and I call chicken-eggy.Also, Dr. Frances did not really use the word \u201cjerks.\u201d His language was stronger. But this publication still has standards, unless we\u2019re quoting politicians.So what do we do to correct the ways of bratillionaires? It seems to me that sensitivity training is not enough. Nor is public scorn. Even bad publicity is publicity, and it may even encourage bad behavior.So here\u2019s my brilliant idea: Deal with these men as we would deal with very naughty children. No dessert! You\u2019re grounded! I\u2019d suggest spanking, but that could backfire, too. You never know what some people might be into.Investors can help: Demand that execs lose a big chunk of their stock options with every grope. If a frat-house sensibility pervades their corporate culture, sell their stock. As we are seeing, the bad behavior is increasingly leading to trouble, and shareholders can let them know that being a jerk carries a high price. Losing money is a shock treatment they might respond to.She explained that \u201ckids are not intentionally jerks,\u201d and that if they misbehave, usually \u201cit\u2019s because they don\u2019t know better, and they are exploring.\u201d Adults, she said, don\u2019t have that excuse. She told me that the best way to deal with problems like oppositional defiant disorder in a child is through positive reinforcement.In one technique, parents reward good behavior with stickers that can be saved up and turned in for something the child wants, like earning time to play on an iPad. She didn\u2019t like the idea of spanking, or my main inspiration \u2014 widespread use of a collar that would deliver painful electric shocks.\u201cPunishment is definitely not thought to be very productive,\u201d she explained.She suggested that positive reinforcement might work with the tech bros, but with recalibrated rewards: Their H.R. director could give them stickers for good behavior, and if they collected enough, maybe they could \u201cturn them in for a boat.\u201dThe problem, Professor Church-Lang said, is that it is best to start early to correct impulsive, destructive behavior, even before children get to school. The longer you wait, the harder it is. But, she added, it can be done with adults, too. Programs in prison, for example, are built on many of the same principles.It will be difficult, but we should do this. Let\u2019s get out there and test these techniques. We will see if we can civilize these corporate man-babies. If we are lucky enough to succeed, we can move on to an even bigger challenge: Washington. I\u2019ve got a list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Lula\u2019s Shadow, Brazil\u2019s Shipbuilders Struggle to Right Themselves", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNITER\u00d3I, Brazil \u2014 The city of Niter\u00f3i, near Rio de Janeiro, features an unusual landmark: two unfinished oil tankers emblazoned with the green and yellow of Brazil\u2019s state-run oil company, Petrobras.The giant vessels have lain beside the dock of the Mau\u00e1 shipyard for two years, a glaring monument to the country\u2019s economic woes and to ambitious policy-making gone wrong.Buoyed by rising energy prices, Brazil in 2003 set out to bolster its domestic shipbuilding sector by constructing all of the tankers, rigs and production platforms that Petrobras needed, creating tens of thousands of jobs in the process.But those plans, along with the broader economic strategy, have unraveled, undone by widespread graft, weak commodity prices and a na\u00efvet\u00e9 over what it takes to succeed in a highly competitive global industry.The shipbuilding industry is still dealing with the roller-coaster ride that was the \u201cLula\u201d era.In the late 1970s, when Brazil was still under a dictatorship, the country\u2019s shipyards employed almost 40,000 people, according to Sinaval, an industry association. It was bolstered by subsidies and protectionist deals that meant 40 percent of Brazil\u2019s international cargo was carried by ships built within the country.But after economic turbulence in the 1980s, maritime trade was liberalized, opening the industry to foreign competition. The shipbuilding industry fell into decline, and by the turn of the century, it employed just 2,000 workers.After Mr. da Silva was elected president in 2003, the left-wing leader immediately ordered Petrobras to build and source more of its materials at home. A few years later, Petrobras found vast oil reserves below a salt layer deep under the Atlantic seabed. Mr. da Silva proclaimed: \u201cGod is Brazilian.\u201dBuoyed by the policies and the discoveries, the country began building new shipyards and reopened others. Demand boomed.During this rapid expansion, the faults of the strategy started to show.\u201cThey set the bar very high and they went too fast,\u201d said Andreas Theophanatos, a regional director of Aqualis, an offshore services company. \u201cThey overheated the market, basically, and they promised things that were unrealistic.\u201dIn Niter\u00f3i, a city of half a million people just a half-hour drive from Rio, the Mau\u00e1 shipyard struggled with an order to build four ships for Petrobras. The energy company modified its design, pushing up the cost, said Ricardo Vanderlei, Mau\u00e1\u2019s chief executive.Despite the financial difficulties on the initial order, the shipyard in 2008 signed up to build more vessels, believing profit would eventually materialize. It did not. Mau\u00e1 delivered the first ship in the new contract, but Petrobras stopped paying for the rest, according to Mr. Vanderlei.Mau\u00e1 was left with the two unfinished vessels in the Niter\u00f3i harbor, as well as another half-built ship. Mr. Vanderlei described the pair that sit unfinished in Niter\u00f3i waters as \u201can embarrassment\u201d that between them cost nearly $200 million and are \u201cstuck in the Guanabara Bay, rotting.\u201dPetrobras\u2019s distribution arm said in an email that it had canceled 20 contracts, including the unfinished ships at Mau\u00e1 \u201cas a result of noncompliance with contract obligations.\u201d It did not comment further.Despite the experience of Mau\u00e1, Brazil\u2019s political leaders were unwavering, turning vessel launches into political rallies.In June 2011, Mr. da Silva\u2019s handpicked successor, President Dilma Rousseff, told thousands of cheering workers at the BrasFELS shipyard near Rio that Brazil had silenced the doubters, leaving no question that she would continue the industry efforts.\u201cYou today can look at all of this and say, \u2018We produced it. We were capable,\u2019\u201d she said.The orders kept coming in. By early 2014, Petrobras\u2019s $221 billion investment plan included building more than 100 production platforms, drilling rigs and oil tankers. In all, the country\u2019s shipyards were employing 82,000 workers.But many Brazilian shipyards soon started coming up against the same harsh truth as Mau\u00e1: Modern shipbuilding is a complex, highly technical and capital-intensive business.Asian yards had a decades-long head start, said Carlos Rocha, the director of costs and technology at the Rio offices of IHS, an international consulting firm. He said Brazilian shipyards were 20 percent to 55 percent more expensive than rivals in Japan, South Korea and China. Some Brazilian deliveries took three times as long.Asian yards benefited from cheaper financing and better economies of scale, because they often worked on multiple orders with more sophisticated supply chains. Compared with Brazilian competitors, their engineering was superior and their work forces more agile.The competitive pressures proved untenable after the shipbuilders were dealt the one-two punch of the corruption scandal and slumping oil prices.In March 2014, the police uncovered a graft scheme at Petrobras. The company had already been hemorrhaging money because Rousseff\u2019s government made it sell imported gasoline and diesel at a loss to control inflation.The scandal tainted the legacy of Mr. da Silva and helped force Ms. Rousseff from office. (Mr. da Silva\u2019s lawyers say the sentence amounts to political persecution. He has not yet been jailed, and intends to appeal.)Then the price of oil began falling, from a peak of over $100 per barrel to below $30. In 2015, Petrobras wrote off $2 billion over the corruption scandal, and stopped paying some suppliers.None of the 28 rigs it ordered from Brazilian yards were ever delivered \u2014 three lie unfinished at the shipyard where Ms. Rousseff spoke in 2011. In all, 52,000 shipyard workers have lost their jobs.Such a move could prove fatal for shipyards like Brasa, which is near Mau\u00e1 in Niter\u00f3i.The yard has just 400 workers left of the 7,000 it had hired. If no contract lands by the end of the year, it may close, said Marcus Cirio, Brasa\u2019s planning manager.\u201cThe future is not very promising,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very anxious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Summer Beach Reading: The Personal Finance Edition", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfHere\u2019s the problem: It\u2019s summertime and, yes, we know we should still be paying attention to personal finance issues.But really. If we\u2019re lucky enough to get away for a few days, do we actually want to take a book about investing to the beach?Publishers have inadvertently solved the problem for us.The protagonist, Anil Jha, 52, has been managing a technical training franchise and teaching computer programming on the side, enjoying a quiet life with his wife, Bindu, in a modest housing complex in East Delhi, India. He becomes wealthy overnight when he sells a website he created for what \u201cfelt like more money than was in the whole world,\u201d the equivalent of $20 million.He decides to move to \u201cone of the richest new neighborhoods of Delhi.\u201dWorried that he does not have the trappings of success, Mr. Jha starts aping the lifestyle of a new wealthy neighbor, who, in turn, starts to study Mr. Jha\u2019s lifestyle. A conspicuous-consumption race follows, and one character observes, \u201cOnly the rich claim that money can\u2019t buy happiness.\u201dThe financial lessons in the book are these:1. True financial independence comes from starting a successful business (something not all of us can do).2. Keeping up with the Joneses, or the Jhas in this case, is just silly. (And if the Jhas decide, in turn, to keep up with you, it becomes sillier.)3. It is probably a good idea to periodically re-evaluate why you are trying to acquire wealth.While Ms. Basu concentrates on upward mobility, Angelica Baker deals with what happens to the lives of the extremely rich when it all goes away.Ms. Baker\u2019s debut novel, \u201cOur Little Racket\u201d (Ecco, $27.99), centers on the downfall of an investment bank C.E.O. during the financial crisis of a decade ago, told from the perspective of three women in his life: his unfulfilled spouse, his teenage daughter and the nanny.Bob D\u2019Amico \u2014 nicknamed Silverback (as in gorilla) \u2014 is trying to stave off allegations of wrongdoing as his poor decisions cause his firm, Weiss & Partners, to slowly disintegrate.While his actions tarnish his own reputation, they have a big impact on the three women who lose status in Greenwich, Conn., the New York City suburb where the D\u2019Amicos have their primary home. (They own three others.) Gossip spreads, rumors fly and the three women are forced to fend for themselves in the wake of Weiss & Partners\u2019 death spiral.The financial lessons:1. Live within your means.2. Make sure you have adequate liquid reserves to cover an emergency. (The family is forced to auction off its art collection to pay the bills.)3. Diversify your holdings. The family is overly invested in both real estate and the stock of Mr. D\u2019Amico\u2019s failing company.For pure escapism \u2014 literally, since some of the characters have the ability to leave their bodies and fly about \u2014 there is \u201cSpoonbenders\u201d (Knopf, $27.95), by Daryl Gregory, who is also author of the novel \u201cAfterparty.\u201dIn his new book, a down-on-their-luck family battles two sets of issues simultaneously. On the one hand, each member is trying to come to grips with being \u201cblessed\u201d with extrasensory powers (the ability to see the future; telekinesis; pyrokinesis and the unfailing facility to tell if someone is lying).On the other, the entire family is fending off: The government, which wants them to become superspies. The mob, which wants its money back because one of the family members (in a remarkable lack of foresight for a psychic) has been borrowing heavily from them as he tries unsuccessfully to become an entrepreneur. A psychic debunker, \u201ca short bald man with a ridiculous black handlebar mustache,\u201d who is out to prove they are all frauds.The writing is crisp and frequently clever. (\u201cThey piled into Irene\u2019s Festiva, a car that won the award for most ironic distance between name and driving experience.\u201d) And after the bleakness of Ms. Baker\u2019s novel and the ambiguity in Ms. Basu\u2019s, this one has a classic happy ending.The financial lessons:1. Read financial documents carefully. One of the characters works, briefly, at a sleazy company that dupes its customers into signing away control of their investments so that the firm can churn their accounts.2. Get-rich-quick schemes invariably fail or are outright fraudulent.3. Don\u2019t borrow from the mob.Enjoy the summer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elliott Hedge Fund Seeks to Challenge Buffett\u2019s Bid for Energy Company", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hedge fund Elliott Management is hoping to block Warren E. Buffett\u2019s $9 billion takeover bid for Energy Future Holdings, the bankrupt Texas power giant, by working on an even higher offer.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment beyond the public materials. Oncor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The disclosures by Elliott highlight a brewing battle between billionaires. On one side is Paul E. Singer, the founder of Elliott, which began buying Energy Future debt last fall and now says it is the company\u2019s biggest creditor with $2.9 billion in holdings.On the other is Mr. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Energy emerged as the power company\u2019s white knight after its nearly decade-long struggle to reorganize its finances.Energy Future, once known as TXU, was taken private in 2007 for $45 billion in what was the biggest leveraged buyout ever at the time. But the ill-starred deal was struck at the beginning of the credit crisis, and the mountain of debt required to finance the transaction became a millstone around the company\u2019s neck.The company filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and has struggled to emerge amid disputes with creditors and Texas power regulators, who rejected two previous takeover bids.Now Elliott is pressing to halt Berkshire\u2019s takeover effort, using its weight as a major creditor in an attempt to block the deal in bankruptcy court.In the July 5 letter, Elliott officials complained to Energy Future that they had heard rumors of a potential deal with Mr. Buffett and demanded to have a seat at the negotiating table.The hedge fund said in the correspondence with Energy Future that it intended to convert some of the debt it holds in the utility operator into equity and then team up with financing partners.\u201cWe are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott\u2019s ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed,\u201d the Elliott executives wrote.The hedge fund has argued that its potential restructuring plan would provide owners of some Energy Future debt with significantly better payouts than they would receive under other takeover offers. At the same time, it was willing to comply with any conditions that would be imposed by Texas power regulators.Elliott has complained for some time that Energy Future declined to engage in talks over potential alternatives for reorganizing the company\u2019s financing. The hedge fund sued in bankruptcy court in May to halt a takeover bid by NextEra, although ultimately the Public Utility Commission of Texas blocked that offer.But while the hedge fund has talked with potential investment partners for an Oncor bid, according to people briefed on the talks, it is unclear whether it will put together a final proposal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Guns Off the Streets, $100 at a Time", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrototypeJames Ronald Lee III pulled his cherry red Volkswagen up to a pair of detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department in a parking lot in South Los Angeles. The detectives pulled a handgun, a rifle and a sock stuffed with ammunition from the trunk.Mr. Lee had kept the guns in a liquor store he once owned and did not have a use for them anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t want them around my house, because anything could happen,\u201d he said. Mr. Lee received a $100 Target gift card for each weapon.Gun by Gun is the brainchild of Ian Johnstone, a tech entrepreneur, and Eric King, an expert on innovation. The two friends use contemporary technology and financing to address the vexing problem of gun violence. Since its founding in 2013, Gun by Gun donors have given a total of $100,000 toward the purchase and destruction of 1,100 weapons.Given the scale of the problem, Mr. Johnstone and Mr. King, both 35, acknowledge that buybacks are not a definitive solution, but they see any reduction in the rate of gun ownership in a community as a boon. \u201cEvery $100 donated means one less gun on the streets,\u201d Mr. Johnstone said.For him, the issue of gun violence couldn\u2019t be more personal. In 1992, when he was 10 and living on Staten Island, his father was shot in the back in a botched robbery while on a business trip in San Francisco. He died from his injuries a month later.Mr. Johnstone said he became frustrated with advocacy as a solution to gun violence. \u201cI came to see it tends to go nowhere,\u201d he said. In his view, there has not been major federal legislation on the issue since the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004.\u201cWhat are the techie solves we could come up with for this?\u201d is how Mr. King describes their mind-set. The answer: a Kickstarter campaign for gun buybacks.Gun by Gun, they decided, would be \u201cabout getting guns off the street, but also about creating community and giving people a sense of agency,\u201d Mr. Johnstone said.They helped raise money for a gun buyback program in San Francisco, which got them started, and have done so in other cities, including Los Angeles.\u201cPeople tend to think you publish a page and then the internet just sends people there and the money starts rolling in,\u201d Mr. Johnstone said. \u201cThe reality is that it takes a lot of old-school organizing,\u201d like reaching out and asking people for donations directly. He said one of the unwritten rules of crowdfunding is that success hinges on a campaign raising 20 to 40 percent of its goal within the first 48 hours.\u201cYou need to kind of manufacture that, find the people who are going to support it early on and get commitments so that you can launch with momentum,\u201d he said.Buybacks have become more effective, Dr. Wintemute said, as organizers have offered bigger financial incentives for newer, higher-powered weapons. At the Los Angeles buyback, for instance, those surrendering assault weapons received $200 gift cards, twice the amount for revolvers and other handguns. An Uzi submachine gun and an antitank rocket launcher were among the weapons turned in.Cities are using buybacks as part of broad crime-reduction strategies. In an interview, Mr. Garcetti said he saw buybacks as a way to send a positive message.\u201cIt gives us an opportunity to state our cultural values, that we believe guns should not just be lying around unprotected, unwanted,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we can try to make a dent in the number of guns on the streets of L.A.\u201dGun by Gun, he said, adds financial strength that previous buybacks have not had. \u201cA lot of times we\u2019ve run out of gift cards,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said of past buybacks. Money raised by Gun by Gun in May allowed his office to purchase an additional 100 guns, he said.Mr. Johnstone compares crowdfunded gun buybacks to volunteering for beach cleanups and at soup kitchens. \u201cIs the beach cleanup going to make a dent in climate change?\u201d Mr. Johnstone said. \u201cProbably not. But it\u2019s an opportunity for like-minded people to get together and on a very small scale, make a difference.\u201dSimilarly, there\u2019s a limit to what crowdfunded buybacks can accomplish. They \u201cwon\u2019t end gun violence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they can help reduce the likelihood of it in any given community, and they help people feel engaged.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "White House and G.O.P. Leaders Reach Deal on Principles of Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After six months of deliberations and occasional quarreling, the top Republican tax negotiators in Congress and the Trump administration declared on Thursday that they had united behind a set of common principles that would guide them as they rush to complete the first overhaul of the tax code in three decades \u2014 and that they would do it by the end of this year.The five-paragraph joint statement in many respects raised more questions than it answered, providing fewer specifics than the previous plans released by House Republicans and President Trump. The lack of detail highlighted the challenge that Republicans face as they try to make difficult trade-offs on legislation that could reshape the entire economy.But the long-awaited sign of progress may help generate momentum behind the Republicans\u2019 agenda as their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act remains unfulfilled and as infighting plagues the White House.The most notable development was the jettisoning of the proposed border adjustment tax on imports. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, had suggested the tax a year ago as a central plank of the plan, arguing that it would accelerate economic growth and protect American manufacturers. But the idea drew the ire of retailers, energy companies and the billionaire Koch brothers, who invested heavily to undermine it. Mr. Trump was cool to it from the beginning, and many Republicans in the House and the Senate began voicing concerns in recent months.To the glee of border tax skeptics, on Thursday the provision officially died.\u201cWe are now confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the U.S. tax base,\u201d the negotiators said in the statement, acknowledging that there were too many \u201cunknowns\u201d associated with the idea.The so-called big six \u2014 Mr. Ryan; Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Senate Finance Committee chairman; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the National Economic Council director \u2014 huddled on Wednesday evening to hash out differences ahead of the August recess.Republicans appear poised to heed the lessons from their health care legislation efforts and use a more conventional process to get a tax bill drafted. Policy staff members for the House Ways and Means Committee and for the Senate Finance Committee are expected to work through August to write the tax legislation. Mr. Trump is expected to spend time next month barnstorming the country to make the case for the tax overhaul.How the legislation will actually look remains unclear. The statement on Thursday said Republican leaders were prioritizing permanent changes that would reduce tax rates for all American businesses, encourage companies to bring back cash parked abroad and allow \u201cunprecedented\u201d capital expensing, or write-offs of big investments.\u201cAbove all, the mission of the committees is to protect American jobs and make taxes simpler, fairer and lower for hard-working American families,\u201d they wrote.No major changes have been made to the tax code since 1986, and Republicans face big obstacles as they try to reach their goal of passing a bill in 2017. Delays in passing health care legislation laid bare the deep divisions within the Republican Party and suggested that sweeping changes to tax laws \u2014 which are generally considered even more complicated than health care policy \u2014 could take even longer and drag into next year.Republicans in Congress must also finish or abandon their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, raise the debt ceiling and pass a budget resolution before they can expect to fully dig in to a tax bill.The fate of the border adjustment tax underscored how difficult it would be to make other big changes to the tax code. Armies of lobbyists have been trawling Washington, preparing to fight for and against various provisions. The taxation of small businesses, deductions for corporate interest expenses and the state and local tax deduction are expected to lead to the biggest battles. And no guidance was offered on these fronts on Thursday.To avoid getting bogged down, some Republicans have said that the party should simply push through short-term tax cuts, even if they would add to deficits and expire in 10 years. So far, however, Republican leaders remain committed to a deficit-neutral tax plan that would not reduce tax revenue.Wall Street and business groups have grown increasingly impatient that the centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda is stalling. The statement of progress was welcomed as a sign of hope that something might get done.\u201cThe engagement and enthusiasm for pro-growth tax reform from Trump administration officials and congressional lawmakers is what will propel this over the finish line,\u201d said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The demise of the border tax, which would have taxed imports and let exports go untaxed, also came as a relief to retailers, who have said for months that it would cripple an industry. On Thursday, they cheered the development.\u201cIt\u2019s an important win for retailers and American families,\u201d said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. \u201cIt allows us to pivot to working with lawmakers to getting tax reform done.\u201dAmerican exporters expressed hope that they would still benefit from a tax overhaul. \u201cFrom the beginning, we have pushed for significantly lower corporate tax rates, permanent reforms that give businesses the certainty they need to invest here in the U.S., and a territorial tax system that levels the playing field for American companies competing abroad,\u201d said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the American Made Coalition.Democrats scoffed at the latest Republican outline as another vague set of ideas that would benefit the rich. \u201cRepublicans are dripping tax ideas out like a leaky faucet with no specifics to back them up,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. He urged Republicans to work with his party in a bipartisan manner.Despite claims that they are open to working with Democrats, it was clear on Thursday that such overtures from Republicans were halfhearted.Mr. Brady said that lawmakers from the House and Senate tax-writing committees would convene next month at the Ronald Reagan Ranch in California, where they would contemplate the tax code and seek inspiration to conquer the big legislative task that awaits. Mr. Brady plans to give a speech at the event, which is still in the planning stages.Asked if Democrats would be coming along, Mr. Brady did not hesitate.\"No,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Home Bargain Became a \u2018Pain in the Butt,\u2019 and Worse", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames R. Williams thought he had found a great deal on a home. The monthly fee on the three-story fixer-upper in Cincinnati was cheaper than the rent on his last home. And the payments would go toward the $40,000 he needed to own the place.But Mr. Williams will almost certainly never own the house. Instead, he was left with a grandson with lead poisoning from peeling paint in the 98-year-old home and he says around $10,000 in critical repairs to the plumbing system.And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, in the five years that Mr. Williams has been in the house, the ownership has changed three times, making it difficult for him to deal with an overdue water bill of several thousand dollars, keep current with the property taxes and figure out where to send the monthly checks under the 30-year contract he signed.\u201cIt\u2019s confusing,\u201d said Mr. Williams, 61, a manufacturing parts assembler, who lives in the home with his wife, Mary Ann. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the butt, and it\u2019s aggravating as hell.\u2019\u2019Across the country, people like Mr. Williams have found themselves in similar predicaments. Unable to obtain a traditional mortgage, they have signed a high-interest, seller-financed deal known as a contract for deed that works like an installment plan for housing. For many, these deals can quickly turn into money traps.The deals also have added to neighborhood blight when the houses fall into further disrepair.Contracts for deeds are difficult to track because the transactions are not recorded in many states. It can become difficult to determine who actually owns the property \u2014 and who is responsible for its upkeep and paying property taxes \u2014 often because the original contract is sold to several investors over time.Even in Ohio, where contracts for deeds are supposed to be recorded, Mr. Williams\u2019s case slipped between the cracks.But Harbour, one of the nation\u2019s largest contract for deed firms, has pushed back, contending that it had sold many of those homes \u2014 often with existing long-term installment contracts in place \u2014 to other investment firms.Mr. Williams\u2019s contract was one of them.For Jessica Powell, chief counsel in the Cincinnati Law Department, figuring out where the buck stops is frustrating. Her office plans to amend its lawsuit to add in new parties.\u201cIt is mind boggling; nobody is recording them,\u201d Ms. Powell said.Led by Charles A. Vose III, Harbour once owned more than 7,000 homes in over a dozen states, but more recently it has been selling off the contracts for deeds it signed with borrowers over the last six years.Provisions in a contract for deed are enforceable as long as they do not conflict with state law. The home dweller has more limited protections than a person buying a house with a mortgage, and residents are typically responsible for repairs and paying property taxes. But since legal title does not transfer until the final payment is made, city officials often look to hold the actual owner of a home liable.The Uniform Law Commission conducted a survey that \u201cfound problems or abuses with contract for deed in 80 percent of the states.\u201dMr. Vose has complained that the coverage in The Times focused on a small group of Harbour\u2019s customers, writing in an email that he is \u201chardly the rich, arrogant Wall Street guy that you paint me as.\u201d He said he created Harbour in response to the housing crisis \u201cto step in and help clean up the mess and help families get a new start.\u201dValerie Hletko, a lawyer with Buckley Sandler who represents Harbour, disputed Mr. Williams\u2019s claims that the Dallas firm failed to pay any outstanding water bills or taxes on the home. She added that there was no confusion about title to the property and that \u201crecording is the contractual responsibility of the buyer,\u201d not Harbour\u2019s.Those familiar with Harbour\u2019s activities say it now owns fewer than 1,000 homes, having sold most of its homes and contracts to a wide array of investors, including hedge funds, small investment firms, mom-and-pop investors and even one Bitcoin entrepreneur from Canada, Haseeb Awan, who referred to his small investment in contracts for deeds as \u201cgambling money.\u201dHarbour has used Incenter, a service provider to mortgage lenders and an affiliate of the Blackstone Group, to assist with the sales.Cincinnati is not the only city struggling to follow the daisy chain of property title ownership. The firm bought homes from the government mortgage finance firm Fannie Mae in other cities, too.Robert A. Cutler, who runs Hamilton Green Crest, a small investment fund in Westport, Conn., says he now regrets buying a contract for deed from Harbour.In May 2016, Mr. Cutler bought a contract in Atlanta for a home Harbour sold on an installment plan for $41,000. Mr. Cutler and his firm are included in a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, contending that Harbour had targeted African-American communities to sell contracts for deeds on homes at inflated prices. (Ms. Hletko said there was \u201cno basis for that deplorable allegation\u201d in the lawsuit.)\u201cWe thought we had done enough due diligence on this, but obviously we were wrong,\u201d said Mr. Cutler, a corporate lawyer who added he had little prior experience with contracts for deeds. \u201cWe had no idea they were pushing properties on people with oppressive terms.\u201dLegal Aid lawyers say that the woman living in the home, Anita Jordan, 39, was confused as to whom to make payments to when she received a letter last September from Mr. Cutler\u2019s firm saying it had officially acquired the contract she signed with Harbour in August 2012. Mr. Cutler, who paid Harbour $16,000 for the contract, said he now believed he was misled by Harbour and an independent broker peddling the contract.Ms. Hletko said that buyers of Harbour contracts were \u201csophisticated real estate investors who are fully informed about the properties and transactions.\u201dA representative for Incenter declined to comment.Nicholas Press of Clark Partners in San Diego, a small residential investment firm that is the current owner of Mr. Williams\u2019s contract in Cincinnati, said he was looking to reverse the deal.Mr. Press, who bought a half-dozen contracts in March, said he faulted Park Street Group, a firm in Michigan, which sold him the contracts, for not being upfront with the looming problems facing Harbour in Cincinnati and elsewhere.\u201cI want my money back,\u201d Mr. Press said. \u201cI think Harbour is doing damage to low-income borrowers.\u201dMr. Press said he made numerous requests to Park Street to complete the necessary paperwork to record the deed of sale and transfer of the contract.David Prentice, who co-founded Park Street and also operates under the name DMP Holdings, said he was merely serving as middleman between Harbour and buyers \u2014 taking temporary title to contracts and homes before reselling them. He said he was no longer selling Harbour contracts or homes.But for Mr. Williams, the confusion led to him owing taxes to Cincinnati.Mr. Williams, represented by the Legal Aid Society of Southwest Ohio, said he has had enough. He said he cannot get a traditional mortgage for the house because of its run-down condition. For him there are two options.\u201cEither buy me out,\u201d he said, \u201cor give me the money to fix it up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chocolate Aplenty, but Nary a Wonka Bar to Be Found", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sign over the door of the Lunt-Fontanne Theater reads \u201cWonka Chocolate Factory.\u201d But at the concession stands inside, there are no Wonka Bars to be found.\u201cFor the first time in decades,\u201d said Luke Kelly, Mr. Dahl\u2019s grandson and managing director of his literary estate, \u201cthere is no Wonka candy at all.\u201dGone are the gobstoppers and swudge of Dahl\u2019s imagination, as well as the milk chocolate bars filled with graham cracker pieces that for a time were manufactured under the Wonka label. The theater has plenty of candy for sale \u2014 Dylan Lauren (daughter of Ralph) of Dylan\u2019s Candy Bar, is curating an assortment of sweet treats \u2014 but none with the Wonka name, because Wonka-branded candy no longer exists in the United States or Britain.The Wonka bar was born in Dahl\u2019s imagination, inspired by a chapter in his childhood when, while studying at a British boarding school, he was invited to test Cadbury chocolates. His fantasies about chocolate factories later led him to write the book, which tells the story of an ingenious but eccentric candymaker, Willy Wonka, whose treats were treasured by an imaginative and impoverished boy, Charlie Bucket.The novel, released in the United States in 1964, was adapted into \u201cWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\u201d a 1971 film starring Gene Wilder, and that\u2019s when the imaginary Wonka Bar became a reality. The film was financed by Quaker Oats, which put up $3 million for the project, persuaded by an entrepreneurial producer, David L. Wolper, who suggested the food company could use the film to promote a candy line it was planning.The effort was not especially successful. The film\u2019s initial reception was tepid. And Quaker Oats struggled with developing a chocolate bar.As the first Wonka Bars were shipped across the country, many of them turned to mush; their melting point was too low.\u201cThe candy bar collapsed, but the movie ultimately succeeded,\u201d said Mark Wolper, the son of Mr. Wolper and president of the Wolper Organization, which continues to produce shows and movies.The Wonka brand passed from company to company in a wave of late-20th-century corporate mergers and acquisitions, and along the way came a real-world Wonka Bar, Peanut Butter Oompas, Everlasting Gobstoppers and other candies. In 1993 Nestl\u00e9, a Swiss conglomerate, acquired the Wonka name from a British candymaker, Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery, and, for a time, nurtured the Wonka brand, which eventually encompassed candies including SweeTarts, Nerds and Laffy Taffy, followed by Wonka Exceptionals. But the entire Wonka line has since been discontinued.Nestl\u00e9 has been hoping \u201cto refocus the magic of Wonka toward future product offerings around the world,\u201d according to Roz O\u2019Hearn, a company spokeswoman. \u201cWe\u2019re considering a variety of options, but for now, our innovation plans remain confidential, so I cannot share more info.\u201dThe disappearance of the Wonka Bar is a frustration for producers of the musical, an early version of which ran for nearly four years in London. On Broadway, where it opened in April, it has been playing to packed houses \u2014 it grossed an impressive $1.3 million during the week that ended June 25 \u2014 despite negative reviews.Fully aware that patrons would be curious to taste Wonka\u2019s wares, the producers managed to sell Wonka bars from the concession stands when the show first opened in London in 2013, because Nestl\u00e9 was again making Wonka candy at a European plant. But there wasn\u2019t much appetite for the candy outside the theater.\u201dIt landed with a thud,\u201d said Kevin McCormick, an executive vice president of Warner Bros. Pictures and a lead producer of the Broadway musical. \u201cThere were adult flavors like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which were nice, but no Wonka bar \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the way people remembered it.\u201dNestl\u00e9 soon stopped the manufacturing. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be in the candy business \u2014 they wanted to be in water and baby formula,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. When the musical sold out its stash, that was it.\u201cAt the last performance in London, I sat there as kids kept going up to people selling ice cream and saying, \u2018Can I get a Wonka bar?\u2019\u201d Mr. McCormick recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018We can\u2019t let this happen again.\u2019\u201dWhen a revamped version of the show came to Broadway (opening song: \u201cThe Candy Man\u201d), there was no Wonka product to be found. As an alternative, the show\u2019s publicists at one point sent journalists Hershey bars camouflaged as Wonka bars \u2014 sheathed in gold foil with a purple outer wrapper.Ms. Lauren, who happens to be a longtime fan of \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d and created some candy to celebrate the centennial of Dahl\u2019s birth, was hired by the theater to capture the spirit, if not the exact substance, of Wonka\u2019s factory.Tushar Adya, chief operating officer at Dylan\u2019s, said, \u201cBack in the day, when the Wonka Bar was made by Nestl\u00e9, it was one of the No. 1 sellers in our stores.\u201d Even today, Mr. Adya said, customers routinely ask for Wonka Bars at Dylan\u2019s shops around the country.So, inside the Lunt-Fontanne on West 46th Street, a pop-up Dylan\u2019s store dominates the lobby. There is a lot of winking to Willy \u2014 the Dylan\u2019s chocolate bars have golden wrappers; there are golden ticket souvenirs on offer, and the shop\u2019s bags are purple (the color of Wonka\u2019s topcoat) with a big golden W.Candy fans are still hoping for a comeback. \u201cThe flavor was unique and delightful and the wrapping was appealing,\u201d said Elly Marie, a student in Adelaide, Australia, who talks about her passions on an internet forum for candy aficionados. \u201cI certainly miss them!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Reopens Harley Settlement, Cutting Funds for Pollution Reduction Plan", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year the United States government fined Harley-Davidson $15 million for selling devices that shut down its motorcycles\u2019 emissions controls \u2014 and said part of that money would go toward a project to reduce pollution from wood-fired stoves.On Thursday, the Trump administration said Harley-Davidson was no longer required to fund the antipollution program, knocking $3 million off the company\u2019s bill.Harley-Davidson declined to discuss those changes. \u201cBy settling this matter, we can focus our attention on new products rather than on a legal battle,\u201d the company wrote by email.Environmental and health groups expressed disappointment.The funds \u201cabsolutely\u201d would have had a demonstrable effect on cutting air pollution in the Northeast, said Michael Seilback, vice president for public policy at the lung association.The money would have funded vouchers to help low-income households replace older wood stoves with more efficient ones, he said, resulting in significant health benefits. The association estimates that more than 32 million Americans had from chronic lung disease in 2015, including 6.2 million children with asthma.\u201cWe were looking forward to moving forward with the project,\u201d Mr. Seilback said.\u201cWhat a great, great group of people and what a fantastic job you do,\u201d Mr. Trump said after the February meeting. \u201cAnd thank you for all of the votes you gave me in Wisconsin.\u201dThe Obama administration\u2019s approach to such cases had already received criticism.

{"Headline": "The Private Equity Firm That Quietly Profits on Top-Selling Drugs", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCashing in on rising drug prices often unleashes an outcry from consumers and politicians.While Royalty Pharma has benefited by riding the rising tide of drug prices, the drug companies play the largest role in setting prices. George Lloyd, Royalty Pharma\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said: \u201cRoyalty Pharma has no influence over how drugs in which it invests are priced. These prices are set by the marketer of the product, and we play no role in that process.\u201dTo make big money on promising drugs, investors like venture capital firms and biotechnology funds typically place long-shot bets on drugs that are still in the development stage. Royalty Pharma, based in New York, steps in later in the game: It generally buys rights to the royalties on drugs that have already been approved for sale by regulators. It buys them from patent holders, often hospitals or universities, that want to convert their future royalties into cash right now.In addition to Humira, Royalty Pharma has partial rights to sales of Remicade, which is No. 4 in overall drug sales in the United States. Other drugs in its portfolio include Lyrica, which treats pain associated with diabetes, shingles and fibromyalgia, and Januvia, which treats diabetes. In all, the firm owns royalty rights to more than 30 drugs, which typically yield 3 percent to 5 percent of the drugs\u2019 total sales revenues.Royalty Pharma has successfully created \u201ca new segment of the investment management industry,\u201d which has helped offset a decline in other types of funds for drug investments, said Andrew Lo, a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management, in a 2014 study written with Sourya Naraharisetti of M.I.T. and Duke University.Royalty Pharma has also made big payments to a number of scientists at major universities who helped discover the drugs in question, as well as to their institutions, which share in the royalty rights.Among the beneficiaries were three researchers at Emory University, who together in 2005 reaped 40 percent of a $525 million sale of the rights to the anti-H.I.V. drug Emtriva.Richard Silverman\u2019s work at Northwestern University on the nerve-pain drug Lyrica earned him an amount estimated at more than $100 million when he and Northwestern sold some of the rights in 2007 for $700 million. Dr. Silverman shared the proceeds with colleagues and helped finance a $100 million laboratory center on the campus.In recent years, Royalty Pharma\u2019s deals have grown larger. In 2014, it agreed to pay $3.3 billion to an affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for rights to the drug Kalydeco and other treatments for cystic fibrosis marketed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Last year, Royalty Pharma paid $1.14 billion to the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-owners of the rights to Xtandi, which treats advanced prostate cancer. This year, it agreed to pay up to $2.85 billion to Perrigo for rights to the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri.Royalty Pharma had tried in 2013 to acquire rights to Tysabri with an audacious but unsuccessful $8 billion hostile takeover bid for Elan Corporation. Elan, an Irish company whose stock had fallen after an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment failed in trials, sold itself to Perrigo a few months after Royalty Pharma dropped its bid.While Mr. Legorreta was still a mergers banker at Lazard Fr\u00e8res in the early 1990s, he spotted a 1987 investment by wealthy clients of PaineWebber in rights to a chemotherapy drug. It opened his eyes to the amount of royalties held by potential sellers. He left Lazard in 1996 and, with the former PaineWebber banker Rory Riggs, raised $60 million to start what became Royalty Pharma.After assembling a diversified royalty portfolio \u2014 including the popular anticancer drug Rituxan, which helped triple the value of early investments \u2014 Mr. Legorreta raised $190 million in debt in 2003. As Royalty Pharma\u2019s investment fund has grown, the annual revenue growth rate has slowed to a still-heady 17 percent for the past five years.Royalty Pharma\u2019s use of low-cost debt financing helped the fund outbid competitors, said Neil Kumar, chief executive of BridgeBio Pharma, a start-up with backing from the private-equity giant K.K.R. that aims to discover and develop drugs for genetic diseases. \u201cPablo won the arms race for a lower cost of capital,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.While it is pharmaceutical companies that generally set drug prices, some of the drugs in which Royalty Pharma owns royalty rights have been criticized for their high prices.Last year, Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called on the National Institutes of Health to override the patent on Xtandi because the drug was being sold wholesale for $129,000 a year in the United States, triple the price in Japan, Sweden and Canada. Mr. Sanders also criticized the high prices for Humira. The cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco costs $311,000 a year.A March report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service noted that Royalty Pharma\u2019s portfolio \u201chas benefited from high price increases in the U.S. pharmaceutical market\u201d and could be \u201cadversely affected if the environment for U.S. pricing dramatically changes or if new legislation is passed that targets U.S. drug pricing.\u201dRoyalty Pharma\u2019s top three drugs have had average annual price increases of 15.7 percent over the past three years, according to Elsevier\u2019s Gold Standard Drug Database. That number is slightly above the average of 14.4 percent for branded drugs tracked by the Truveris drug index.Royalty holders who sell to Royalty Pharma are like lottery winners who choose the upfront cash option over future annual payouts. The sellers accept a discount to the cash expected to roll in over the 20-year patent life, in part reflecting the built-in uncertainty of future drug sales, but can use the upfront dollars to diversify their investments or for capital projects.Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, for example, used part of its $400 million proceeds from sales in 2004 and 2005 of rights to two drugs used in cancer chemotherapy to build a $500 million research center.Eugene Sunshine, former senior vice president for business and finance at Northwestern, said the university took a discount of roughly 10 percent to estimated future sales of Lyrica and hedged its bets by selling only a little over half of its rights initially. Proceeds were used for undergraduate financial aid, graduate fellowships and research.In the case of Humira, the top-selling drug that was released in 2003, Royalty Pharma paid $700 million for a royalty interest of less than 3 percent, which helped the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca finance a $1.3 billion purchase in 2006 of the drug developer Cambridge Antibody Technology.One reason Mr. Legorreta won the financing arms race was that he kept all his investments in one \u201cevergreen\u201d fund, unlike most private equity firms, which raise new funds every few years, according to bankers and investors.\u201cThey just kept putting everything in one ever-increasing pool whose growing size and diversification helped lower its borrowing costs,\u201d said Lionel Leventhal, who ran similar funds at Paul Capital for 15 years starting in 1999. Mr. Leventhal estimates there are more than 15 competing drug royalty funds that together manage about as much as Royalty Pharma alone.Royalty Pharma has financed the growth of its assets by raising more money from investors and from debt. It raised $1.1 billion in equity in 2015, and recently increased its debt level to fund the Perrigo deal by refinancing $3.4 billion in debt with a new $4.5 billion loan, the report by Moody\u2019s said. Investors, however, may sometimes face waiting periods of several years to cash in and exit the fund.As the deal sizes have grown, so have the risks. While Moody\u2019s lauded Royalty Pharma\u2019s \u201cstrong product portfolio\u201d and \u201cexcellent track record,\u201d it also warned of its \u201cmoderately high\u201d debt level and an approaching revenue \u201ccliff\u201d in the scheduled expiration in 2018 of royalties on \u201cseveral major products,\u201d including Humira, Remicade and the multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera.In recent years, Royalty Pharma has diversified its sources of financing. In addition to the recent $4.5 billion loan led by Bank of America, a Royalty Pharma affiliate, BioPharma Credit, raised $762 million in an initial public offering in March on the London Stock Exchange.Royalty Pharma has also taken greater risk by occasionally funding late-stage drug trials before they win regulatory approval.

{"Headline": "World Leaders Move Forward on Climate Change, Without U.S.", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 World leaders struck a compromise on Saturday to move forward collectively on climate change without the United States, declaring the Paris accord \u201cirreversible\u201d while acknowledging President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the agreement.In a final communiqu\u00e9 at the conclusion of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, the nations took \u201cnote\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the pact and \u201cimmediately cease\u201d efforts to enact former President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge of curbing greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.But the other 19 members of the group broke explicitly with Mr. Trump in their embrace of the international deal, signing off on a detailed policy blueprint outlining how their countries could meet their goals in the pact.The statement and the adoption of the G20 Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth ended three days of intense negotiations over how to characterize the world\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, and it came as this year\u2019s meeting of major world economies here laid bare the stark divide between the United States and the rest.\u201cThis is a clear indication that the U.S. has isolated itself on climate change once again, and is falling back while all other major economies step up and compete in the clean energy marketplace created by the Paris Agreement estimated to be worth over 20 trillion dollars,\u201d said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under Mr. Obama.Differences between the United States and other nations on climate, trade and migration made for a tricky summit meeting, which unfolded amid large protests that sometimes turned violent, with several injured and demonstrators setting fire to cars and looting in the streets of the German city.\u201cNothing\u2019s easy,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the gathering on Saturday as he complimented its host, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has toiled to bridge the gap between the United States and other nations, for handling the challenge \u201cso professionally.\u201dHours later, at the start of a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Trump vowed to confront the threat posed by North Korea \u201cone way or the other,\u201d and said he appreciated the Chinese leader\u2019s efforts to respond to Pyongyang\u2019s latest provocations.\u201cIt may take longer than I\u2019d like, it may take longer that you\u2019d like, but there will be success in the end, one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSomething has to be done about it.\u201dAs he sought to build a consensus among Asian leaders about how best to deal with North Korea, Mr. Trump also held a separate meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The two leaders were tackling \u201cthe problem and menace of North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The wording on climate change in the communiqu\u00e9 represented a victory for Ms. Merkel, who played a major role in forging compromise language after France raised objections.In most other respects, though, the summit meeting had to be a bitter disappointment for the chancellor. When the meeting was first planned for Hamburg, Ms. Merkel\u2019s birthplace, she would have reasonably expected Hillary Clinton, a likely political partner, to be the American president, and she had expected the event to be a strong part of her re-election campaign for a fourth term, with voting in September.It has also been about efforts by most of the rest of the world to cajole the American president into softening his stances on global trade and the climate, with Ms. Merkel in a secondary role, trying to come up with compromises.Her standing has also suffered as Germans have been shocked by violent protests by a small bloc of anarchists who saw the G-20 as a perfect platform for their rejection of capitalism and order.The atmosphere around Hamburg has been that of an armed camp, hardly welcoming, with 20,000 police officers asking for further reinforcements to try to protect the various leaders. So far, 213 police officers have been injured, and 43 people have been arrested and 96 more detained.Ms. Merkel expressly backed the 100,000 or so peaceful demonstrators who massed here in recent days and were marching on Saturday. She may have been hoping to show authoritarian leaders like Mr. Putin and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, how to tolerate protests in a democracy. If so, she and the security forces failed, losing control in parts of the city. Ms. Merkel was born in Hamburg in 1954, weeks before her parents moved east to Communist Germany.This was always going to be risky for Ms. Merkel, and Mr. Trump\u2019s presence only intensified what were widely anticipated to be widespread and sometimes violent protests against globalization, even though Mr. Trump is a sharp critic of globalization.Whether the criticism of holding the summit meeting here will hurt Ms. Merkel in the September elections is not clear. Her popular conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared on national television on Friday strongly defending the decision. Only large cities like Hamburg, a picturesque Hanseatic port, have the infrastructure to host the thousands of leaders, delegates, journalists and lobbyists who gather at a G-20 meeting, he said.And some diplomatic work was done at the meeting, even beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings and his hyperbolic praise \u2014 regardless of his private views \u2014 of every leader he meets, including Ms. Merkel. (\u201cYou have been amazing and you have done a fantastic job.\u201d)Working overnight, diplomats first agreed on a common text on trade, with a nod toward Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d demands for restrictions on unfair trade, but they had great difficulty on climate, with the Americans demanding a reference to the use of fossil fuels.President Emmanuel Macron of France said he would continue to press Mr. Trump on climate and would hold a follow-up summit meeting in Paris in December to move the Paris deal forward.The trade section in the statement the aides thrashed out read: \u201cWe will keep markets open noting the importance of reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade and investment frameworks and the principle of nondiscrimination, and continue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard.\u201dIn his meeting with China\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump said that \u201cmany things have happened that have led to trade imbalances\u201d and that he wanted a new arrangement that is \u201cequitable\u201d and \u201creciprocal.\u201dThe climate section is more of a dodge. It takes note of the American decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and says the other countries regard the deal as \u201cirreversible.\u201d Yet it subtly left open the possibility that the United States could someday come back into the pact, specifying that the country is putting the brakes on its \u201ccurrent\u201d emissions pledge.It then nods toward fossil fuels, saying: \u201cThe United States of America states it will endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.\u201dMr. Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Saturday, trying to fortify her delicate political fortunes. He said that they had had \u201ctremendous talks\u201d on trade and were working on a \u201cvery powerful\u201d trade deal for a post-\u201cBrexit\u201d Britain that could be completed \u201cvery, very quickly.\u201dIt is not clear what Mr. Trump meant, since the two sides cannot sign such an agreement until after Britain leaves the European Union, in March 2019 at the soonest.Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington on Saturday night, also confirmed that he would eventually make a state visit to Britain, but the dates continue to be unclear.Also on Saturday, American officials said that Mr. Trump would order the State Department to redirect $50 million from its foreign-aid budget to a new international public-private partnership to aid midsize businesses run by women, a group that his daughter Ivanka Trump helped create.The partnership aims to \u201chelp women in developing countries gain increased access to the finance, markets and networks necessary to start and grow a business,\u201d a spokesman for Ms. Trump said.The contribution comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s administration weighs a drastic scaling-back of foreign aid as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign pledge to target federal funding to create jobs at home.His budget, released in April but largely ignored on Capitol Hill, would include deep cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, a major conduit for foreign assistance.Steven Erlanger, Alison Smale and Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Hamburg, and Lisa Friedman from Washington.

{"Headline": "Byrd Bath: Seven Provisions That Could Disappear From the Senate Health Bill", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthWe still don\u2019t know what bill Republican senators will take up next week when they turn to health care. There are three versions of the legislation that could be considered, each with slightly different provisions.Experts from both parties make arguments before the parliamentarian, in a process somewhat like a Supreme Court oral argument. And, in the end, the parliamentarian will issue her rulings on which things stand and which must be removed from the bill.That process is known in the Senate as the Byrd Bath, named for Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who was the chief sponsor of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the bill that established the standards. Important parts of that process are expected to take place on Friday.The rules are complicated, but most come down to a key question: Does the change in the law affect the federal budget? Legislative changes with no budgetary impact are not allowed in reconciliation bills. Items that have a nominal budget impact, but are mostly there for policy reasons, are also supposed to be struck, though that\u2019s a more subjective standard.Ms. MacDonough is just one person, but as long as she continues to hold the office, her say goes. That makes predictions difficult.But we convened a panel of experts and Byrd Bath veterans from both political parties to help provide some educated guesses about what might happen to questionable portions of the Senate health bills. According to our nine experts, at least some parts of the bill are likely to be eliminated before the voting begins.All versions of the health bill say that subsidies to help people pay their insurance premiums can\u2019t be used to buy plans that cover abortion services. Seven of our nine panelists thought this provision would not survive.\u201cI worked with the drafters of the Byrd Rule,\u201d said Bill Dauster, a retired Democratic Senate staff veteran who worked on the Budget and Finance Committees, as well as in the majority leader\u2019s office. \u201cThe abortion issue was the parade example of something for which budgetary effects were merely incidental to the policy.\u201dA G.O.P. bill would strip all federal health care funding for one year to health providers with a set of specifications that apply only to Planned Parenthood. The organization has been arguing that the provision should be eliminated in the Byrd Bath, but our panelists think it will probably stay. Only one thought it would be struck, while six thought it could stay, and two thought it could remain with minor changes.A Senate bill would make it relatively easy for states to waive Obamacare rules for their insurance markets, including regulations on the benefits required of insurance products, and the funding formula used to determine how much customers receive in subsidies. A version of this provision was part of Obamacare, but a Senate bill would strip away many of the requirements for approval, making the only hard rule that a state program could not add to the federal deficit.Our panel was divided on this one. A few members thought it would be eliminated. A few thought it would survive with changes, and a few thought it could stay.Both the House and Senate health bills said that insurance companies could charge their oldest customers five times as much as they charged their youngest ones, a change from the Obamacare rule that limited the ratio to 3:1.Our panelists were split. The four experts who thought the provision would be dropped noted that it\u2019s really just a regulation of insurance products, not the federal government. The four who said it should stay noted that insurance subsidies in the bill are linked to insurance prices, meaning that changes to sticker prices could affect the federal budget.Congress and the White House are fighting in court about an Obamacare provision that awards subsidies to insurance companies so those companies can lower deductibles and co-payments for low-income customers. A direct appropriation would settle the dispute and calm insurance markets, and a Senate bill would provide one for two years.But because the cost-sharing reductions are already part of current law, most of our panelists argued that directing the White House to spend them doesn\u2019t have a direct budgetary effect. Nevertheless, many argued that they may remain anyway, since Democrats may choose not to raise a challenge. \u201cAssuming it is challenged, it is struck,\u201d said Rodney Whitlock, a former aide to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and now a vice president of health policy at ML Strategies.Obamacare requires health insurance companies to spend a minimum percentage of their premiums on medical care for customers, limiting how much they can keep as profits or overhead. A Senate bill would eliminate this rule, letting states decide whether to regulate insurer profits.Of the seven experts who answered this question, five thought it would not survive. Several described it with the phrase \u201cmerely incidental budgetary effects.\u201dOne version of the Senate bill contains a controversial provision that would allow insurers to offer plans that are not subject to many of Obamacare\u2019s consumer protections, as long as they also offer plans that follow all the rules. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has indicated that he will require such a provision to vote for the package.Only seven members of our panel answered this question, but all of them thought the provision could run into trouble. Five thought it would be eliminated, and two thought it could remain only with modifications.Panel of experts:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rooftop Solar Dims Under Pressure From Utility Lobbyists", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past six years, rooftop solar panel installations have seen explosive growth \u2014 as much as 900 percent by one estimate.That growth has come to a shuddering stop this year, with a projected decline in new installations of 2 percent, according to projections from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.A number of factors are driving the reversal, from saturation in markets like California to financial woes at several top solar panel makers.But the decline has also coincided with a concerted and well-funded lobbying campaign by traditional utilities, which have been working in state capitals across the country to reverse incentives for homeowners to install solar panels.Utilities argue that rules allowing private solar customers to sell excess power back to the grid at the retail price \u2014 a practice known as net metering \u2014 can be unfair to homeowners who do not want or cannot afford their own solar installations.Their effort has met with considerable success, dimming the prospects for renewable energy across the United States.Prodded in part by the utilities\u2019 campaign, nearly every state in the country is engaged in a review of its solar energy policies. Since 2013, Hawaii, Nevada, Arizona, Maine and Indiana have decided to phase out net metering, crippling programs that spurred explosive growth in the rooftop solar market. (Nevada recently reversed its decision.)Many more states are considering new or higher fees on solar customers.The same group of investor-owned utilities is now poised to sway solar policy at the federal level. Brian McCormack, a former top executive at the Edison institute, is Energy Secretary Rick Perry\u2019s chief of staff. The Energy Department did not make Mr. McCormack available for an interview.Charged with spearheading the study, due this summer, is Mr. McCormack.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt these utilities are out to kill rooftop solar, and they\u2019re succeeding,\u201d said David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, a renewable energy advocacy group. \u201cThey\u2019re now driving the agenda.\u201dEarly on a March morning in the Indiana State Capitol, under a mural of the Greek sun god Apollo, solar energy enthusiasts swarmed a committee hearing to defend the state\u2019s embattled solar policy.A school superintendent said that his underfunded district needed solar power to reduce energy costs. A local farmer pleaded that his pine tree nursery depended on power from his solar panels. A Baptist pastor said he saw drawing energy from the sun as an \u201cexpression of our love of God\u2019s creation.\u201dThe coalition was fighting a losing battle.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Indiana\u2019s five investor-owned utilities are among the biggest contributors to Indiana\u2019s elected officials, together giving at least $3 million to mostly Republican candidates over the past four election cycles, according to campaign finance filings. They are also known to play an outsize role in drafting energy-related bills.Mr. Hershman said utility contributions had not swayed him against net metering. He said his bill, which was passed and signed into law this spring, protects current solar customers by locking in their rates for many years.\u201cI receive donations from a wide variety of groups across the ideological spectrum because I tackle tough issues fairly, listen to both sides and promote good policy,\u201d he said by email.The pushback against renewable energy has been years in the making.Four years ago, the Edison institute, an industry group made up of the country\u2019s largest investor-owned electric companies, declared that the business of generating electricity was in danger of being sucked into what has since become known as a \u201cutility death spiral.\u201dThe prospect of more customers \u201cfully exiting from the grid,\u201d the group said, \u201craises the potential for irreparable damages to revenues and growth.\u201dSince then, the utilities have targeted state solar power incentives, particularly net metering, which credits solar customers for the electricity they generate but do not use and send back to the grid. That offsets the cost of electricity they may still buy from their local utility during cloudy days and at night, reducing or even eliminating their electricity bills.Utilities argue that net metering, in place in over 40 states, turns many homeowners into free riders on the grid, giving them an unfair advantage over customers who do not want or cannot afford solar panels. The utilities say that means fewer ratepayers cover the huge costs of traditional power generation.Utilities found a receptive audience in many states.Arizona legislators voted in December to move away from net metering, lowering the credit solar customers receive for the excess energy they generate and limiting how long customers keep their favorable rates.2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.Some of the slowdown in smaller-scale rooftop solar has come in maturing markets in states like California, where rooftop solar companies are having trouble expanding their customer base beyond early adopters. Financial struggles at rooftop solar companies like SolarCity and Vivint have also weighed on growth.Uncertainty over net metering in Indiana has slowed the market further. \u201cIt\u2019s totally shut us down,\u201d said Michael A. Mullett, a volunteer at Indiana\u2019s Columbus Community Solar Initiative, who has helped two dozen households sign up for solar panels since 2014.Still, at a January 2016 board meeting of the Edison institute, attended by chief executives of the country\u2019s largest utilities, Thomas R. Kuhn, the group\u2019s president, counseled against complacency.\u201cYears, ago, I think a lot of people said, \u2018That\u2019s not going to come to our area,\u2019\u201d he said, according to a recording of his remarks made available by a participant. \u201cAnd now we see it in each and every state,\u201d he said.\u201cE.E.I. is happy to come to any state at any time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have two dozen states we are working on.\u201dOn March 14, the Edison institute hosted a fund-raising reception at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington for Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. The cheapest tickets went for $5,000.The reception underscored the utilities\u2019 attempt to cement ties with an administration that already appeared ambivalent toward any rapid shift to renewable energy.Proponents of renewable energy fear that the study could threaten policies at the federal level, like the renewables tax credits for businesses and homeowners, which have also spurred investment in wind and solar.Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, dismissed the environmentalists\u2019 concerns. \u201cThe department has no preconceived notions as to the findings and recommendations that will result from this review,\u201d she said.Mr. McCormack has assigned Travis Fisher, a former economist at the Institute for Energy Research, a nonprofit funded by the Koch family foundations, to be principal author of the study.\u201cFor those who want to ensure that Americans have access to reliable electricity long into the future,\u201d Mr. Fisher said in the study, \u201cthe time has come to push back.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly an initiative on the ballot in Florida last November. The measure, which ultimately failed, would have banned third-party leasing of rooftop solar panels, not roll back net metering.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Equity-Like Fund Aims to Speed Up Diabetes Research", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersDave Johnson says his immediate reaction to his daughter\u2019s diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes at age 4 was typical of any father\u2019s.\u201cIt was my baby girl, and my response was I\u2019m going to fix it or pay someone to fix it,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, president and chief executive of the hotel management company Aimbridge Hospitality. \u201cI dove in, spoke to some smart people. But then, I was hit between the eyes that there wasn\u2019t a lot that I was going to be able to do.\u201d\u201cThe fund is extremely transparent and crystal clear in its mission,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe have a quarterly call and get updates when we\u2019re making investments. It\u2019s run similar to a for-profit.\u201dStructured like a private equity fund, the T1D Fund has a minimum donation of $500,000. The fund, which received $32 million in seed funding from the foundation, has a goal of reaching $80 million. It already has $55 million.Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that attacks the pancreas and its ability to produce insulin, while Type 2 is a metabolic condition that affects how the body uses glucose. Type 1 also affects fewer people \u2014 about 200,000 new cases a year compared with three million for Type 2. Given the number of those affected, Type 2 diabetes has attracted ample funding, while Type 1, which is generally diagnosed in children, has attracted fewer resources.The fund\u2019s goal is not only to attract more money for research into the disease, but also to move faster than a foundation and speed along advances in treatments.Given the nature of life science research, the fund\u2019s backers point to the possibility of advances in research into other autoimmune diseases. While those advances would not directly affect people with Type 1 diabetes, they could bring returns to the fund that could then be reinvested in different companies.\u201cThe fund makes very quick decisions from start to finish,\u201d said Ellen Leake, vice chairwoman of the foundation\u2019s international board, which has also agreed to cover all operating expenses over the next four years.In 2015, the foundation asked Sean Doherty, general counsel of the private equity fund Bain Capital, to create a nonprofit fund and to be its chairman. The goal was to use a different structure to speed new technologies and products to market.\u201cThere was a lot of money on the sidelines that wasn\u2019t giving,\u201d said Mr. Doherty, whose son, Finn, has Type 1 diabetes. Because the foundation funds 70 percent of the nongovernment money going to Type 1 diabetes research, he added, \u201cyou were kind of throwing your money into a very large pond, and that created a donor disconnect.\u201dThe new fund aims to invest all of its money in four years. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a vehicle that has 100 percent concentration risk in one disease that affects 1.5 million Americans, and there is no investment return track record,\u201d Mr. Doherty said. \u201cDoing so philanthropically, we have the luxury to take that risk.\u201dPerhaps not surprisingly, it has attracted donors who have made their money in finance and business and are comfortable with risk.John Mallory, a partner in the investment management division at Goldman Sachs in Los Angeles, said he wasn\u2019t attracted to the foundation\u2019s model, which relies heavily on fund-raising through events like walks and galas, when he learned his son had Type 1 diabetes almost three years ago.Mr. Mallory initially thought of investing directly in an insulin therapy company, but thought better of it given his lack of knowledge of companies researching diabetes treatments.When he heard about the new fund, he said, he and his wife immediately wanted to participate. \u201cWhat the fund was good at doing was saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to try to fill some of that gap,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to back some of the companies even if they don\u2019t have the same investment potential. We\u2019re going to do it at an earlier stage.\u2019\u201dThe T1D Fund is also using the imprimatur of the foundation\u2019s researchers and its own due diligence process to act as a stamp of approval for the companies it invests in.Ashleigh Palmer, chief executive of Provention Bio, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company in New Jersey that is working on vaccines, including one for Type 1 diabetes, said he raised $28 million in a recent fund-raising round, with a comparatively small amount coming from the T1D Fund.\u201cWe\u2019ll benefit enormously from their network and their know-how and the doors they can open for us,\u201d Mr. Palmer said.The T1D Fund has announced seven investments of $1 million to $2.5 million since the beginning of the year, Mr. Doherty said.As is the case with other nonprofit groups, donors are asked to give their knowledge in addition to money. Mr. Mallory has been working to identify other donors with a connection to Type 1 diabetes in the Los Angeles area.Jay Eastman, who runs the private equity fund EG Capital in New York, and his wife, Katama Eastman, have been enlisted for their expertise and networking skills. Mr. Eastman said he had talked to Mr. Doherty and Jonathan Behr, the managing director of the fund, about investments.Ms. Eastman, who is the president of the New York branch of the foundation, had great success raising money from her friends and families at events. But the fund, she said, allowed their families to come together and make a large gift. (They would not disclose the amount.)The Eastmans are motivated by the fund\u2019s ability to speed technologies along. Their daughter, Merrill, was 15 months old in 2004 when they learned she had Type 1 diabetes. She recently received a monitoring system that measures blood glucose and then releases the right amount of insulin. It had been in the works for years.\u201cWhen she was diagnosed, doctors\u2019 offices and manufacturers said it was two years away,\u201d Ms. Eastman said. \u201cHaving a fund that was going to go and get these things more quickly was big.\u201dBut an approach like this, which falls broadly into social impact philanthropy, carries some caveats. \u201cThe pros are the potential for larger amounts of money raised more efficiently \u2014 or a class of potential investors who will be less attracted to the world of donations than the world of investments,\u201d Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University, said. \u201cThe negatives are the organization really has to prove that it can do things.\u201d\u201cTo the extent the return is blended between social value and financial value, measuring the social value is difficult and very long term,\u201d he added.There is also the risk that the money disappears without much to show for it.But Ms. Leake, who is on the foundation\u2019s international board, said the new fund \u201cis a little bit different because it\u2019s looking for viability and commercial uptake where a basic research grant is just about the learning.\u201d\u201cCertainly the downside risk would be the perception that we would take riskier bets,\u201d she added. \u201cBut stacked up against research grants, we\u2019re willing to put our money out there for the learning that comes from the investment.\u201dFor its backers, though, this is about scientific advancement.\u201cSelfishly, I\u2019d like to make a difference in my daughter\u2019s life,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cBut my heartstrings have also been torn by children whose parents don\u2019t have the resources my wife and I do. These are great young people, and we\u2019ve got to give them a shot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Development-Weary Neighborhood Tries to Block a New Luxury Tower", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past 15 years, developers in seemingly every corner of the city have built luxury towers claiming to be the tallest residential skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 or, in less grandiose cases, in Queens, or SoHo, or near Central Park in Midtown Manhattan.But in a test of wills, residents and elected officials on the East Side have drawn a line in the sand.They are in a race against the clock with a developer who plans to erect a 67-story supertower on a stretch of East 58th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place.The developer, Gamma Real Estate, has already demolished three four-story walk-ups and started digging a hole for the slim tower\u2019s foundation.But at the end of June, the Buildings Department shut down work on the site, after inspectors responding to an emergency call discovered small cracks in the foundation of a building next door.Opponents of the project are hoping that the city will approve a zoning change for the neighborhood by Labor Day \u2014 before Gamma can resume work \u2014 that would limit the height of towers on side streets to about 21 stories.If Gamma is instead able to get permission to resume construction and complete a substantial portion of the foundation before the rezoning, its tower will be allowed to rise to its full 800-foot height.\u201cNew Yorkers are exhausted by overdevelopment,\u201d said Ben Kallos, the city councilman who represents the area and a leading opponent of the tall tower. \u201cThis is about standing up and showing the city that there\u2019s another way to do things.\u201dCritics of the project say that supertall towers in residential areas tend to overwhelm the neighborhood and displace less wealthy residents. Still, both Mayor Bill de Blasio and his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, rezoned large sections of the city for ever taller buildings.The zoning change, which was proposed by Mr. Kallos and other elected officials as well as neighborhood residents, has been in the works for two years. The proposed rezoning was recently approved by the Manhattan borough president, Gale Brewer, and unanimously endorsed by the local community board. Mr. Kallos hopes that the City Council will approve the proposal after the city\u2019s Planning Department holds a public hearing on the matter in August.Jon Kalikow, the president of Gamma Real Estate, said that it would be a \u201cdisastrous outcome\u201d if the city were to adopt the rezoning proposal for a small portion of the Upper East Side, a process known as spot zoning.\u201cThis would set a horrendous precedent in New York, enabling rich folks to stop a nearby building they didn\u2019t like,\u201d he said.\u201cThe last thing we want to do is go to the courts,\u201d Mr. Kalikow added. \u201cOur goal is not to fight with our neighbors. The fact of the matter is that the amount of money we invested here is based on what we can build\u201d under the current zoning.Mr. Beninati\u2019s intention was to build an 80-story, 900-foot-tall tower, the latest addition to Billionaires\u2019 Row, a stretch of Midtown where developers have erected skyscrapers with apartments selling in the $5,000-a-square-foot range, affordable only to those whose assets exceed mere millions. But he alienated local residents and was unable to secure financing.Rather than marketing the apartments to wealthy foreigners who could afford Mr. Beninati\u2019s planned $43.5 million penthouse, Mr. Kalikow said the tower would attract wealthy New Yorkers. \u201cThis is very much New York,\u201d he said.But Mr. Kalikow said he had been hampered by local opponents, many of whom live in the Sovereign, a 47-story apartment building directly across the street from Gamma\u2019s site. They do not want to lose their view, Mr. Kalikow said.In an irony not lost on anyone, the Sovereign was the overly tall luxury tower that residents complained about when it opened its doors in 1975. The architecture critic Paul Goldberger, writing for The New York Times, described it at the time as \u201cbrutally destructive of the scale of 58th Street and Sutton Place.\u201dAlan Kersh, a resident of the Sovereign and the founding president of the East River Fifties Alliance, which opposes the new tower, said there was a great deal of opposition in his building. But with an apartment on the 26th floor, his views would be blocked regardless of whether Gamma\u2019s proposed tower or a smaller building was built.The rezoning, he said, would protect residential side streets in the area from tall towers. Developers would be able to increase the size of their buildings by a couple of floors if they included units reserved for poor and moderate-income tenants who live in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s not about one building, the Sovereign \u2014 it\u2019s about the whole neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Kersh said. \u201cThis building could dramatically change the character of our neighborhood.\u201dMr. Kersh, whose day job involves investing pension funds in multifamily rental housing, said that the alliance was composed of more than 2,200 supporters, and that 45 co-ops and condominiums contributed varying amounts of money for the campaign against the tower.Mr. Kallos, the city councilman, began organizing against the tower shortly after he heard about Mr. Beninati\u2019s plans. He was joined by City Councilman Dan Garodnick, who represents an adjoining district, and State Senator Liz Krueger.As Gamma started demolition earlier this year, Mr. Kallos said he had urged local residents like Charles Fernandez to call 911 if they felt their buildings were in jeopardy from the demolition and excavation work on the cramped site.At the end of June, Mr. Fernandez said his sister Isabel Fernandez had called the Fire Department after she felt the building shudder.\u201cIt\u2019s an old building,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said. \u201cWe feared the building might collapse.\u201dThe Buildings Department said that buildings on either side of the construction site were not in danger of collapsing. But the developer was ordered to shore up the underpinning for the adjoining buildings and to continually monitor the site. Work cannot restart until there is another inspection.Mr. Kalikow said that he had complied with the inspector\u2019s instructions, but worried that the situation had become so politicized that he does not know when he can resume work.His opponent Mr. Kallos said, \u201cI\u2019m seeing some daylight,\u201d and added: \u201cIt\u2019s a fight to the finish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lonely Giant of the Taipei Skyline Is About to Get Some Company", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetTAIPEI \u2014 The Taipei 101 building, which was for five years the world\u2019s tallest, has towered over the Taiwanese capital for more than a decade.Very much a build-it-and-they-will-come venture, the 1,666.7-foot tower was erected in one of the city\u2019s least built-up areas, Xinyi District, as a symbol of a modern and ambitious Taiwan.Thirteen years later, Xinyi is Taipei\u2019s center for finance, business, offices and shopping. And in a sign that Taipei 101 has accomplished its mission of attraction, other skyscrapers are finally rising next door, altering the skyline of an otherwise surprisingly low-rise city.The first of the new buildings, the 48-story, 892-foot Nan Shan Plaza, is scheduled for completion at the end of this year. Already topped out, the high-rise, and its neighbors to come, will stand roughly half the height of Taipei 101, which will remain the district\u2019s dominant edifice for the foreseeable future.The project takes its name from Nan Shan Life Insurance. Nan Shan won rights to a 50-year lease of the former site of Taipei World Trade Center\u2019s Hall 2 with an $894 million bid. To date, Nan Shan has spent more than $1.6 billion on the project, the company said.\u201cXinyi\u201d is a Chinese word roughly analogous to \u201cgood faith,\u201d which shaped the project\u2019s design goal of expressing thanks to Taiwan. The main building, an elongated triangle, is intended to represent two hands pressed together as a gesture of thanks and prayer for Taiwan\u2019s continued good fortune, said the project\u2019s architect, Yasuhiro Sube, of the Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei.Mr. Sube said he also had chess pieces in mind as he drew up the building, with Taipei 101 as king and Nan Shan Plaza as queen.\u201cThe biggest challenge was already having Taipei 101 next door \u2014 if we were going to build its queen, then we would have to harmonize our design to do so,\u201d Mr. Sube said. \u201cAdditionally there was the concept of giving thanks, which required us to consider how to use the external form of the building to convey this.\u201dAt street level, Nan Shan Plaza complements its surroundings. It bookends the pedestrian- and bike-friendly retail zone stretching between it and Taipei 101, which, just a stone\u2019s throw to its west, has its own thriving shopping center, including Taiwan\u2019s first Apple store. A block north is the Taipei City Hall subway station, which is dominated by the Breeze Songgao and Shin Kong Mitsukoshi mall complexes, brimming with global and domestic restaurants and lifestyle brands.Given Nan Shan Plaza\u2019s prime location, rents inside are not cheap by Taipei standards, but remain a fraction of the cost of prime office space in Shanghai, Singapore or Hong Kong. Depending on the floor and view, rent can run between $3.50 and $4.20 per square foot. Rather than work with an agent, Nan Shan Life is handling rentals itself.\u201cWe believe the office building is best suited for national or regional headquarters,\u201d said Jason Chen, assistant vice president of Nan Shan\u2019s real estate department. \u201cWe\u2019re currently in talks with several financial institutions, I.T. companies and global professional services companies.\u201dMr. Chen and his colleagues are tasked with filling Nan Shan Plaza\u2019s 570,000 square feet of commercial space, including a mall at its base and a dining area on the 46th through 48th floors. There is also 1.13 million square feet of office space between the sixth and 43rd floors. Tenants will begin moving in during the third quarter of 2018, he said.Andrew Huang, associate director at the Taipei office of the real estate consultancy Knight Frank, which is not involved in leasing at Nan Shan Plaza, said Xinyi should benefit from the new supply of office space.\u201cMany people are concerned that there will be an oversupply problem, due to the addition of so much new supply, including a million square feet of office space,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cBut Nan Shan has been preleasing since last year, and their rental prices are not as high as we\u2019d expected.\u201dThe Nan Shan team\u2019s initial success in signing the Executive Centre, a serviced office provider, and an international accountancy would help attract more tenants, he added.If all goes well, the next addition to the Xinyi skyline will be the 51-story, 919-foot Taipei Sky Tower just north of Nan Shan Plaza, and the 52-story, 873.8-foot Fubon Group Xinyi Headquarters to its northeast.The Taipei Sky Tower, designed by Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel, is planned for completion in 2020. The project, led by the Taipei-based real estate private equity investment company Riant Capital Limited, will feature two hotels, both of which are expected to be international brands.The arrival of Taipei Sky Tower and Fubon Xinyi Headquarters is unlikely to hurt the office space market, Mr. Huang said. Fubon, for instance, is moving many of its operations from older buildings in nearby Neihu District.Another reason Mr. Huang is sanguine about the future of the central business district in Xinyi: \u201cRight now rents in Taipei are extremely cheap.\u201d Taipei 101\u2019s most expensive units, for example, rent for about $3.70 per square foot.\u201cCompared with Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing or Singapore, Taipei rents don\u2019t even compare,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the designer of Taipei Sky Tower.

{"Headline": "No Links to Cuomo? Their Ad Was Labeled \u2018Client: Andrew Cuomo\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the end of a video promoting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s immigration policies, a disclaimer noted the advertisement\u2019s funding source: an obscure anti-discrimination group called New Yorkers United Together.The fledgling group, which has financed only the one online video, claims it has no ties to any politician. Two of the group\u2019s co-founders said in interviews that the governor had nothing to do with the ad, other than agreeing to appear in it alongside several celebrities.But a closer examination shows otherwise. All of the group\u2019s co-founders are close friends of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s. Three celebrities who spoke in the ad said they were asked to do so by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office, and another person said he was asked by the office to identify others who might be willing to participate.The man hired to film the ad, Jimmy Siegel, has shot political spots for the governor in previous campaigns. And until Wednesday, his website\u2019s gallery of work examples seemed to make clear where the idea for the video originated.To government watchdogs, the connections are evidence that Mr. Cuomo is once again skirting campaign finance rules by using a secretive nonprofit to advance his agenda.The rules limit donations to political campaigns and require disclosure, and politicians are not supposed to get around them by using organizations that can accept unlimited secret donations. But New Yorkers United Together is the third nonprofit formed by allies of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s to emerge and support his policies.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office said the governor\u2019s appearance in the New Yorkers United Together video, which circulated online this spring, was aboveboard. The office pointed to a 2014 ruling by the state\u2019s Joint Commission on Public Ethics that found that politicians could appear in an ad funded by a nonprofit group if the message was in the public interest and promoted government services and did not promote any candidate or policy.Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, added that the state did not support the ad financially.\u201cNo money was spent to promote an online public service announcement that appeared months ago and was in full compliance with all laws and guidelines,\u201d Mr. Azzopardi said. \u201cNo amount of false outrage changes these facts.\u201dNew Yorkers United Together was founded in late March by Steven M. Cohen, a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo; Christine C. Quinn, the former New York City Council speaker; and the public relations consultant Ken Sunshine.The goal of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, according to documents filed with the New York secretary of state, is to fight discrimination, support diversity and raise money for immigrant legal defense.\u201cIt\u2019s an informal group established in reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban,\u201d Mr. Sunshine said, referring to the president\u2019s order blocking people from six mostly Muslim nations from entering the United States. \u201cWe were discussing what to do, and we came up with this.\u201dMr. Sunshine, Ms. Quinn and Mr. Cohen all said the group was planning to do much more in the future, but they declined to give any specifics or to say who funded its creation, whether it would ever disclose its donors or how exactly it planned to support immigrant legal defense. Mr. Siegel declined to say anything.The group\u2019s first effort, the digital ad, was a 30-second spot featuring celebrities and regular people cheering the diversity and inclusiveness of New York.Mr. Cuomo had announced the Liberty Defense Project with fanfare and followed it with op-ed articles and a new line in speeches: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to deport immigrants, start with me.\u201d (The governor\u2019s grandparents emigrated from Italy.)He was criticized, however, for not initially funding the effort, instead relying on philanthropists and white-collar lawyers, many whom have business before the state. Ultimately, the project received $10 million in state funding.The project was unveiled on March 24 \u2014 six days before New Yorkers United Together registered with the state, records show.Ms. Quinn called the timing coincidental and insisted that Mr. Cuomo was not involved in planning the group. The nonprofit asked the governor to appear in the digital ad only because it wanted to include a diverse group of New Yorkers, she said.\u201cOur vision was to have a mix of everyday people and some celebrities and boldfaced names, if you will,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s an addition of the actors and celebrities and the governor. I think it\u2019s powerful to have everyday people, and I think it\u2019s powerful to have faces and voices that you recognize.\u201dThe people who said Mr. Cuomo played a much bigger role in the ad said his office called friends directly to ask them to participate. \u201cThe request came from Governor Cuomo\u2019s office in late March, and it was filmed then,\u201d said Molly Barnett, a spokeswoman for Mr. Fierstein, echoing answers from Mr. Buscemi and others.The video\u2019s release drew media attention and stirred speculation about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s presidential ambitions.For nearly a month, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office declined to say anything about the ad. Only after others had divulged its involvement to The New York Times did the office provide a statement: \u201cKen Sunshine and the other members of the group wanted to do something that spoke to the moment re: immigration and what New York stands for. He and Steve (Cohen) came to the governor and the video is what came out of that group discussion.\u201d(On Wednesday, after The Times published a version of this article online, the ad maker, Mr. Siegel, removed the reference to Mr. Cuomo from his website.)Susan Lerner of Common Cause New York, a watchdog group, said the video seemed commendable, and so \u201cit\u2019s really surprising that the people involved and the governor are not willing to disclose who they\u2019re raising money from and what they\u2019re planning to spend it on.\u201dMs. Lerner drew a comparison with the past.\u201cIt\u2019s all too similar to other nonprofits set up by elected officials who want to hide from the public who they\u2019re taking money from and how they\u2019re spending it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like the Committee to Save New York and the Campaign for One New York.\u201dThe Committee to Save New York was formed in late 2010 and spent more than $16 million on ads supporting Mr. Cuomo\u2019s agenda before closing in 2013 after The Times revealed it was financed by entities with business before the state, including a gambling group seeking the governor\u2019s support for more casinos.After that controversy, Mr. Cuomo supported legislation requiring nonprofits that lobby to disclose their donors. That law will not apply to New Yorkers United Together, however, because its co-founders say it will not lobby for any specific policies.Still, during the investigation into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s relationship with the Campaign for One New York, the governor took the opportunity to harshly criticize nonprofits aligned with politicians.\u201cThey\u2019re just another way to get around the law,\u201d he said in a June 2016 speech at Fordham Law School. \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s in collusion and cahoots with the candidates.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of state funds directed to the Liberty Defense Project. The state initially did not offer any money, but later contributed $10 million to the project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Takata Expands Recall Again, Citing New Airbag Hazard", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTakata has added an additional 2.7 million airbags to the nation\u2019s largest automobile industry recall after a new hazard was detected in testing.Ford, Mazda and Nissan installed these inflaters in vehicles manufactured for the United States market from 2005 through 2012, according to Takata, of Japan. All are on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicles.The recall adds to an effort that was previously expected to cover 70 million Takata airbag inflaters in 42 million vehicles. Takata\u2019s problems with defective devices began in 2008, when Honda initially recalled 4,000 vehicles that used Takata technology. So far, the safety agency says, about 17 million airbags have been replaced in the United States.Takata and the safety agency said they knew of no ruptures related to the hazard that prompted the latest recall.Defective airbags made by Takata have been tied to 12 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the United States alone. The ensuing recall \u2014 the largest in automotive history \u2014 has turned out to be messy, confusing and frustrating for car owners.The latest recall is the first involving the inflaters that use calcium sulfate as a drying agent. The inflater can combust in an \u201cover-aggressive\u201d manner, potentially rupturing and causing harm, according to a filing Takata submitted to the highway safety administration.Takata\u2019s latest admission brought fresh criticism of the company in Washington.\u201cThis recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takata\u2019s ammonium-nitrate-based airbags,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said in a statement. \u201cIf even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling.\u201dHe called on regulators to quickly determine \u201cwhether all remaining Takata airbag inflaters are safe.\u201dIn a statement, Takata said it had decided to recall inflaters that use calcium sulfate \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d The devices are Takata\u2019s earliest generation of ammonium-nitrate inflaters using calcium sulfate as a drying agent. The company is now testing later generations of those devices.The company has said that it expects to fund the airbag repairs through the asset sale and that it has secured financing to ensure it can continue operations, including dealing with the defective inflaters, while it restructures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Program to Spur Low-Income Housing Is Keeping Cities Segregated", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 A mural on the wall of an elementary school here proclaimed, \u201cAll the world is all of us,\u201d but the hundreds of people packing the auditorium one night were determined to stop a low-income housing project from coming to their upscale neighborhood.The proposed 233-unit building, which was to be funded with federal tax credits, would burden their already overcrowded elementary school with new children, many people argued during a lively meeting last year. Some urged the Houston Housing Authority to pursue cheaper sites elsewhere.As cheers rang out over nearly three hours for every objection raised, Chrishelle Palay, a fair-housing advocate, confronted the mostly white crowd.\u201cIt\u2019s time to face your fears,\u201d Ms. Palay said as boos rang out. \u201cStop succumbing to misleading rhetoric, and begin practicing the inclusive lifestyles that many of you claim to lead.\u201dThe outcome was familiar. Elected officials sided with the opposition. And an effort to bring affordable housing to an affluent, majority white neighborhood failed in Houston, where low-income housing is overwhelmingly confined to poor, predominantly black and Latino communities.A review of federal data by The New York Times found that in the United States\u2019 biggest metropolitan areas, low-income housing projects that use federal tax credits \u2014 the nation\u2019s biggest source of funding for affordable housing \u2014 are disproportionately built in majority nonwhite communities.What this means, fair-housing advocates say, is that the government is essentially helping to maintain entrenched racial divides, even though federal law requires government agencies to promote integration.The nearly $8-billion-a-year tax credit program allows private developers to apply for credits they can use to help finance new housing or the rehabilitation of existing units.The program offers developers larger credits for building in poorer communities, which tend to need affordable housing the most but also have large minority populations. That has meant that even in a place like Houston, one of the country\u2019s most diverse cities, racial divides can run deep.When she got a federal housing voucher many years ago, Tonya McKinney said, she searched far and wide for an apartment but ended up in Houston\u2019s Fifth Ward, a neighborhood she was not happy with. Founded by former slaves, the community, just east of downtown, has a long history of blight but has undergone significant redevelopment in recent years.Her three children want change, she said.\u201cThey talk about this all the time, about us moving into a better area,\u201d said Ms. McKinney, 46, who used to work in retail but is now disabled. \u201cThey\u2019re actually tired of living in what they call the ghetto.\u201dThe proposed Houston housing, known as the Fountain View Drive project, would be built in the Galleria district, which sits a few miles west of downtown and features shiny office towers and stores. And at 87 percent white, it is an unlikely site for low-income tax-credit housing.While only about a third of census tracts in the nation\u2019s hundred largest metropolitan areas have a majority nonwhite population, 54 percent of new tax-credit projects have been built in those tracts since 2000, according to a Times analysis. And that pattern of placing tax-credit projects in communities with disproportionately high black and Latino populations has been consistent over time, the data shows.The Treasury Department, which administers the program, includes no provisions in its regulations that address segregation. That, fair-housing advocates argue, runs afoul of the Fair Housing Act, which requires government agencies that administer housing programs to do so in a way that reduces racial segregation.\u201cIt\u2019s been clear for a long time that the tax-credit program is perpetuating racial segregation,\u201d said Michael Daniel, a fair-housing lawyer.While nearly 58 percent of the people living in all tax-credit properties in Houston are black, the area proposed for the housing development is just 3 percent black.At the meeting last year, Galleria residents complained mostly of school overcrowding, the effect on their property values and the cost of the project. Yet some people hinted at deeper social discomforts.One man, Richard Caldwell, stepped to the microphone and described a low-income area in Oxnard, Calif., where he had lived previously. The families there, he said, jammed a lot of people into the apartments by subletting rooms.\u201cThey\u2019re going to sublet it out, and you won\u2019t have any control over it,\u201d he said.In a letter to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, one Galleria resident warned that the development would introduce an \u201cunwelcome resident who, due to poverty and lack of education, will bring the threat of crime, drugs and prostitution to the neighborhood.\u201dShe had made it to the neighborhood, she wrote, through the hard work and sacrifice of her family.\u201cI will fight very hard,\u201d she continued, \u201cbefore I give up that privilege and dignity to those who, either from lack of initiative or misfortune, don\u2019t deserve to be there.\u201dMayor Sylvester Turner, who is black and in his first term, vehemently opposed the project and decided not to put it before the City Council for a vote. His opposition was mostly due to the cost, he said, but he acknowledged that race may have motivated other critics.\u201cI know for a fact that there were some who did not want it because they did not want, quote-unquote, those people coming over there,\u201d he said. \u201cI got that. But that is their right to exercise their freedom of speech, even though I fundamentally disagree.\u201dGreg Travis, the city councilman representing the area, said race was not a concern in the community, where about 29 percent of the elementary students are Latino and 7 percent are black. Rather, for some residents it was about how low-income neighbors might fit in, he said.\u201cPeople of different socioeconomic status sometimes have different values based on their socioeconomic status,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people can afford things that other people can\u2019t.\u201cYou go to certain places, their houses would be painted,\u201d he continued. \u201cOthers, they can\u2019t afford that as much, so you don\u2019t see it as often. It\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s just a socioeconomic thing.\u201dSeveral United States senators reintroduced a bipartisan bill this year that would greatly increase funding for the tax-credit program and prohibit community members from vetoing projects.\u201cOne of the biggest obstacles that has always existed and that remains in building affordable housing in higher-income, higher-opportunity neighborhoods is local opposition,\u201d said Diane Yentel, the president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.Whether that is what\u2019s best for low-income families is at the center of a dispute between Houston and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is the government\u2019s chief enforcer of fair-housing laws.In January, in the waning days of the Obama presidency, the department sent a scathing letter to Houston, saying that the opposition to the Fountain View project was partly motivated by race. The department had found that 81 percent of tax-credit developments in Houston were in census tracts where eight in 10 people are minorities. HUD threatened to take the city to court if it did not approve the development.Mr. Turner took exception to the department\u2019s demands.\u201cI don\u2019t think the right message to be sending to kids in low-income families is that the only way they can succeed is that they have to move into affluent communities to do that,\u201d he said.Instead, Mr. Turner has strongly advocated investing in black and Latino communities that lack resources, saying new housing could be one tool to help improve them.\u201cBut this is the same thing we have been hearing for years, if not decades,\u201d said Gustavo Velasquez, a former assistant HUD secretary who worked on the Houston investigation.Mr. Velasquez described telling Mr. Turner in a meeting that Fountain View represented a balanced approach to developing affordable housing in both poor and affluent areas.\u201cThis was the opportunity for the city to take that bold step and start reversing Houston\u2019s legacy of segregation,\u201d he said.Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, declined to comment on the Houston project, but he has publicly stressed the importance of investing in low-income communities and questioned government-driven efforts to promote integration.\u201cThe secretary strongly believes that all cities should provide the opportunity for their residents to have a diverse range of housing options,\u201d Raphael Williams, a HUD spokesman, said in a statement.He added that the department was still contemplating what to do about the Fountain View project. The city has asked HUD to withdraw its complaint, and the fate of the project hinges on whether the department complies or tries to force Houston to allow it to be built.One Houston resident, Katrina Rhodes, wants the development to be built. As she sat in her second-floor apartment one afternoon, holding her 21-month-old daughter, Chassity, Ms. Rhodes had fresh worries about her 9-year-old daughter, Leeah.Just a day earlier, Leeah, who walks more than a mile to and from school every day because school buses do not come out that way, was chased home by fourth graders in a dispute over someone being sprayed with Silly String, Ms. Rhodes said. Without any extracurricular activities at the school, Ms. Rhodes, 31, worries about what will keep her children busy.She wants a neighborhood like the Galleria, where, she believes, the schools are better and they will have the best chance to succeed.\u201cIf there was an opportunity for me to move over there, guess what: I would go,\u201d she said.Not everyone thinks it would be a good idea to move.\u201cNo,\u201d Erica Ashton, 38, said of whether she would move to the Galleria from her spartan, low-income apartment complex in a predominantly black part of northwest Houston. She was worried about the discrimination she might face.Her brother-in-law, James Smith, wondered if integration could even work as he bounced his 15-month-old daughter, Jamie, on his lap. If black people moved into the Galleria, white people would flee, he said, adding that it would be more instinctive than intentional.\u201cOut there,\u201d said Mr. Smith, 46, \u201cthey were taught: \u2018This is us. If anything from the outside tries to come in, we shall stop it.\u2019\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Follow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligon and Yamiche Alcindor @Yamiche.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Single-Payer Health Care Saves Money", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewSometimes described as Medicare for all, single-payer is a system in which a public agency handles health care financing while the delivery of care remains largely in private hands.By analogy, suppose that your state\u2019s government took over road maintenance from the county governments within it, in the process reducing total maintenance costs by 30 percent. Your state taxes would obviously have to go up under this arrangement.But if roads would be as well maintained as before, would that be a reason to oppose the move? Clearly not, since the resulting cost savings would reduce your county taxes by more than your state taxes went up. Likewise, it makes no sense to oppose single-payer on the grounds that it would require additional tax revenue. In each case, the resulting gains in efficiency would leave you with greater effective purchasing power than before.But this comparison is misleading. In most other countries, single-payer covers the whole population, most of which has only minimal health needs. In contrast, single-payer components of the United States system disproportionately cover population subgroups with the heaviest medical needs: older people (Medicare), the poor and disabled (Medicaid) and returned service personnel (Department of Veterans Affairs).In short, the evidence is clear that single-payer delivers quality care at significantly lower cost than the current American hybrid system. It thus makes no sense to reject single-payer on the grounds that it would require higher tax revenues. That\u2019s true, of course, but it\u2019s an irrelevant objection.In addition to being far cheaper, single-payer would also defuse the powerful political objections to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s participation mandate. Polls consistently show that large majorities want people with pre-existing conditions to be able to obtain health coverage at affordable rates. But that goal cannot be achieved unless healthy people are required to join the insured pool. Officials in the Obama administration tried, largely in vain, to explain why the program\u2019s insurance exchanges would collapse in the absence of the participation mandate.But the logic of the underlying argument is actually very simple. Most people seem able to grasp it if you ask them what would happen if the government required companies to sell fire insurance at affordable rates to people whose houses had already burned down.No home insurer could remain in business if each policy it sold required it to replace a house costing several hundred thousand dollars. Similarly, no health insurer could remain in business if each of its policy holders generated many thousands of dollars in health care reimbursements each month.That\u2019s why the lack of a mandate in the alternative plans under consideration means that millions of people with pre-existing conditions will become uninsurable if repeal efforts are successful. An underappreciated advantage of the single-payer approach is that it sidesteps the mandate objection by paying to cover everyone out of tax revenue.Of course, having to pay taxes is itself a mandate of a sort, but it\u2019s one the electorate has largely come to terms with. Apart from fringe groups that denounce all taxation as theft, most people understand that our entire system would collapse if tax payments were purely voluntary.The Affordable Care Act is an inefficient system that was adopted only because its architects believed, plausibly, that the more efficient single-payer approach would not be politically achievable in 2009. But single-payer now enjoys significantly higher support than it did then, and is actually strongly favored by voters in some states.Solid majorities nationwide now favor expansion of the existing single-payer elements of our current system, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Medicaid cuts proposed in Congress have been roundly criticized. Perhaps it\u2019s time to go further: Individual states and, eventually, the entire country, can save money and improve services by embracing single-payer health care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Benefits of Private Financing for Public Works", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsPresident Trump has announced the outlines of an ambitious $1 trillion agenda to rebuild America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges, outdated water systems and dilapidated public buildings. While the general goal of investing in infrastructure has broad bipartisan support, Mr. Trump\u2019s call for relying heavily on private financing has come under fierce criticism. As consultants and advocates for such public-private partnerships, we believe those attacks are wrongheaded.Critics assert that public-private partnerships enrich investors at taxpayers\u2019 expense, are more expensive and less accountable, lead to public bailouts and do little to help rural areas. But this ignores strong evidence to the contrary in states like Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Colorado, North Dakota and California.The private sector is already involved in building our infrastructure, but usually with public funds. President Trump would allow private investment in those projects for a good reason: private funds increase accountability. As a partner in a public project, the private sector is on the hook for cost overruns and delays and may be contractually obligated to pay hefty fines or other penalties when the results are lackluster.If a project is behind schedule or over budget, private companies pay a hefty fee and make up the difference, since they financed that project. If a project isn\u2019t maintained and operated according to strict standards throughout the contract, the private sector could pay substantial fines. The same is often not true of purely publicly financed projects.There is a widespread perception that most public-private transportation projects sell off assets or give private companies the authority to collect tolls. But this is not usually the case. Of the 18 public-private transportation projects advanced since 2010, only eight involved transferring toll or revenue risk to the private sector. Most projects involve contracts that pay companies based on performance, not toll collection.La Guardia Airport, often mocked for its antiquated facilities, is today completely overhauling its central terminal, thanks to a public-private partnership. Almost 80 percent of the $8 billion design and construction costs will be paid for by private financing and existing passenger fees. The risk of cost overruns or construction delays is transferred from the Port Authority to a private consortium.Project owners of such partnerships estimate that their projects have saved taxpayers on average about 25 percent, including on the construction of the PortMiami Tunnel and the expansion of Denver\u2019s mass transit system. A public-private partnership is on track to deliver the Interstate 4 highway expansion in Florida with an estimated $1.4 billion in savings, faster than originally projected.We believe public-private partnerships can help rural America and would urge skeptics to consider that in Pennsylvania, 558 deficient rural bridges are being replaced at least 10 years early through a $1 billion public-private project. In Merced, Calif., the University of California system is doubling the size of its campus \u2014 which mostly serves rural students \u2014 with a $1 billion public-private project. And in Fargo, N.D., a public-private partnership is working with the Army Corps of Engineers on a $2 billion project to alleviate flooding.Criticism of these projects has also been directed at a few projects that have gone bankrupt, as evidence that they hurt taxpayers. One such project, the South Bay Expressway in San Diego, earned lower-than-projected revenue because of the Great Recession and the Southern California housing market collapse. But no state funds were used for the project, and taxpayers were largely protected in the bankruptcy. The regional authority purchased the rest of the project for significantly less than the private partner\u2019s construction cost.Critics of partnerships have one fact right: Private financing can never fully replace the need for federal and state funding. Private investment, however, can help leverage limited but essential public dollars into successful projects that are completed ahead of schedule, at lower cost and with greater accountability.When Congress begins considering an infrastructure plan, members should seriously explore President Trump\u2019s idea of using private financing as a catalyst. Private funds are not going to single-handedly solve our nation\u2019s huge infrastructure needs, but they must be a critical piece of the equation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s $800 Billion Sovereign Wealth Fund Seeks More U.S. Access", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund is looking at big bets in America. But the $800 billion investment behemoth said on Tuesday it faced an obstacle: the United States government.\u201cWe hope that the U.S. government will provide us with a more liberal, equal and nondiscriminatory investment environment,\u201d said Liu Fangyu, the fund\u2019s managing director and head of public relations and international cooperation.In some ways, the fund\u2019s interests are aligned with those of the United States.But the flood of Chinese money flowing into the United States has prompted concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s influence.The committee, which includes representatives from the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, Treasury and Homeland Security, reviews deals by sovereign wealth funds and other foreign investors. Although its process is rather opaque, the panel in recent years has blocked deals, many of them in the semiconductor industry.The fund knows the investment terrain.The United States was the largest investment destination for the fund, with more than $90 billion in the country, mostly in the financial markets. In January, Ding Xuedong, the fund\u2019s chairman at the time, said it wanted to invest in American real estate, infrastructure and technology, according to The Paper, a state-funded Chinese news website.A global investor with a vast portfolio, the China Investment Corporation is already a player in infrastructure, with projects like Heathrow Airport, serving London; Thames Water, which supplies the British capital; and the Port of Melbourne in Australia. But regulatory barriers have made such \u201csymbolic investments\u201d difficult in America, Ms. Liu said.Li Weiwei, a director of the fund\u2019s public relations, said on Tuesday that it had invested in several office buildings and logistics businesses in the United States, though she said she could not provide a \u201cdetailed answer\u201d on the projects.In its 2016 annual report published on Tuesday, the China Investment Corporation said it earned a 6.2 percent net return on its overseas investments, raising its assets to $813.5 billion. The fund was set up in 2007 to diversify China\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves, the world\u2019s largest, which stand at around $3.1 trillion.The fund\u2019s push follows the broader move by Chinese buyers into the United States, as they acquire buildings, factories and movie theater chains. In 2016, Chinese investment in America jumped threefold, to $46 billion, from the year before, according to the research firm Rhodium Group.But China\u2019s government and companies have repeatedly criticized investment regulations in the United States, saying the country imposed unfair restrictions on Chinese funding. In 2015, President Xi Jinping raised the issue in talks with the United States, saying Washington should relax restrictions on high-tech exports and make it easier to invest in the country.In May, the fund opened an office in New York to engage with the United States government and regulatory agencies, according to Ms. Liu.Mr. Trump, who initially struck a conciliatory tone in relations with China after meeting Mr. Xi, is under pressure to improve the investment climate for American companies in China. In recent years, Western businesses have complained bitterly about unequal access to the Chinese market.Many lobbying groups have also urged the Trump administration to push for reciprocity. That is, if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States.\u201cAny Chinese sovereign investment must be scrutinized. That\u2019s not to say the answer should be no to everything. But much greater questions need to be asked,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia who has helped write three books on the Chinese financial system.\u201cThey are a sovereign wealth fund; they are a government foreign reserve-backed fund of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are, by definition, political.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The report delves into concerns about subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation that are more applicable to countries such as China than they are to the United States\u2019 neighbors. The Trump administration, which prefers bilateral deals over sprawling multicountry trade agreements, has said that a new Nafta will most likely serve as a template for its pacts with other countries.Several of the objectives could be sticking points in negotiations, such as the elimination of the Chapter 19 dispute settlement panel that allows Canada and Mexico to appeal duties imposed by the United States. Another potentially contentious proposal would scrap the global safeguard exclusion that limits the ability of the United States to impose import restrictions on Canada and Mexico.The Trump administration has given conflicting signals on how it plans to deal with Nafta, a 23-year-old trade agreement that Mr. Trump assailed as an economic scourge on the campaign trail last year.Upon taking office, Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and suggested that he was considering pulling out of Nafta, which he had billed as the \u201cworst trade deal.\u201dThen, a month later, Mr. Trump signaled through advisers that he was preparing to scrap the pact entirely. After the peso plummeted in response to the news and Mr. Trump\u2019s faction of globalist advisers staged a frantic intervention, he quickly reversed course again.Trade has been one of the few issues that has made Democrats hopeful they could work with Mr. Trump and that has made Republicans particularly wary.On Monday, some Democrats were disappointed in the list of objectives and felt that the Trump administration was not going far enough.\u201cIt is surprising that in key areas the Trump administration is seeking outcomes that were achieved in the T.P.P., which the president said was a bad agreement,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, said that she was concerned by the vagueness of the report and that the objectives did not directly buttress Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d vision.\u201cIf you were expecting a transformation of trade policy, whether or not that is their plan for Nafta renegotiations, that\u2019s not what this document lays out,\u201d Ms. Wallach said.Advertisement"}

His affectionate nickname on Wall Street is \u201cThe Mooch.\u201dAnthony has the skills to make a big difference in this White House. He is smart, generous and funny, open-minded and ambitious \u2014 but not in an obnoxious way. He cares about being able to disagree without being disagreeable. I have always been impressed by the way he could proclaim his support for Mitt Romney, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush or David Koch while at the same time admiring Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.We have shared many beers at Bill\u2019s, on East 54th Street, debating our opposing political viewpoints and sharing our life experiences. We first really got to know each other at SALT, where he invited me on four occasions and paid for me to interview, on stage, the likes of Oliver Stone and Michael Lewis. One year, SkyBridge bought copies of my controversial book, \u201cThe Price of Silence,\u201d about the Duke lacrosse scandal, to give away to conference attendees, even though the SALT regular David Rubenstein, the powerful founder of the Carlyle Group and the chairman of the Duke board of trustees, objected vehemently.But the Anthony Scaramucci I know and admire was not the Anthony Scaramucci who stepped up to the lectern in the White House briefing room on Friday afternoon.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Tries to Break Impasse in \u2018Diller Island\u2019 Battle", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a telephone call to a wealthy developer last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio waded into the battle over a planned $250 million arts center on a pier in the Hudson River, known as Pier 55 and often called Diller Island, for its major sponsor, the entertainment mogul Barry Diller.\u201cIn all likelihood,\u201d said Richard D. Emery, a lawyer for the project\u2019s opponents, \u201cwe\u2019re going to file a new challenge and then sit down and negotiate with them.\u201dA precondition for the talks, Mr. Emery said, would be that the park trust operate in a more open manner in the future that allows supporters and critics alike to articulate their positions.The trust, however, asserts that it conducted a proper review, held public meetings and had the support of the local community board.After a series of secret discussions with the park trust, Mr. Diller, the chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, agreed to cover most of the cost of building a replacement for the crumbling pier within the Hudson River Park and future operations.Mr. Diller and the trust came up with a design for an exotic undulating platform with lush landscaping and three stages for dance, theater and musical performances.The estimated cost of the project has soared to $250 million, from $130 million when it was first announced in 2014.Both Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who rarely agree on anything, have been outspoken in their support for the project.It is unclear what a settlement might include. In its lawsuits, the opponents have raised environmental issues relating to the impact that a new pier sitting on 550 concrete pilings would have.In recent conversations between city officials and the Durst Organization, which Mr. Durst runs, there has been discussion regarding Pier 97, at 57th Street, which the park trust has used for concerts and events, according to a City Hall official who spoke anonymously because he did not want to disrupt the talks. That pier is in front of three residential buildings built by the company: the Helena, the Frank and the pyramid-shaped Via 57 West.In 2015, tenants at the Helena complained about the concerts and the Durst Organization went so far as to install noise meters in apartments facing the pier that measured the decibel levels. But a concert series on the pier ended after 2015, though Pier 97 is still the site of public events sponsored by the park trust, including the 18th Annual Blues BBQ on Aug. 19.Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said, \u201cEndless and costly litigation that challenges Hudson River Park\u2019s ability to grow and build out its capital plan serves no one \u2014 least of all the public.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019d like to lay this to rest so we can deliver the new public space the community deserves.\u201dMr. Durst had originally not been involved with the litigation over Diller Island, although he did have misgivings about the project. He had once been chairman of the Friends of Hudson River Park, a group affiliated with the park, and contributed $1 million to the group and the park.But more recently, Mr. Durst quit Friends, which is now mainly a fund-raising operation, and has grown critical of the park trust.The City Club, along with Tom Fox, a longtime advocate for the park, and Roy Buchanan, a professor and environmental activist, filed lawsuits challenging the Pier 55 project on procedural and environmental grounds.Mr. Durst agreed to finance the lawsuits after an environmental organization dropped out.The suits were largely unsuccessful until March when Judge Lorna G. Schofield of the United States District Court in Manhattan ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers had failed to adequately assess the impact of a new, larger pier in what is a protected fish and wildlife sanctuary.\u201cIf the Trust and others were willing to behave differently in the future,\u201d said Mr. Emery, the lawyer for the opposition, \u201cthere might be grounds for discussion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In part it\u2019s a tour of the island\u2019s faux-casual charms, and as such it\u2019s threaded with mindless chitchat of the sort you find in the TripAdvisor comments section.\u201cIn Vineyard Haven you can find bracelets and earrings and pendants shaped like a map of the island,\u201d Blais writes, \u201cyou can find fudge, and you can shop at Midnight Farm: gauze skirts for about $300, expensive bedding, and rustic pre-dented furniture.\u201d(Honey, grab a sponge, little Whitaker got fudge on the pre-dented coffee table again.)In part it\u2019s a memoir about her husband\u2019s family\u2019s long association with the island, and about the quaintly ramshackle waterfront house on five and a half acres they were forced to sell for $3 million after her father-in-law\u2019s death in 2012.Most notably, perhaps, as its title hints, \u201cTo the New Owners\u201d is a steaming load dropped on the author\u2019s former doorstep, a book-length act of revenge, a cleat-hitch slap that will reverberate up and down the Eastern coastline.The new owners had the temerity not merely to be the new owners, but to tear the old house down and rebuild, never mind that the author\u2019s in-laws did the same thing when they bought the place. More insidiously, the new folks added (cue the scary organ music) a lap pool.In your mind, Photoshop Chris Christie in a beach chair into this scene. Now you will understand the impression Blais hopes to create.Everyone feels possessive and sentimental about the houses they occupy, even summer rentals. But Blais squanders what sympathy we might have, the way those noisy spinning extractors force the water out of swimsuits.In part the problem is a cloying, saltwater taffy tone. The first time one of the new owners drives up, \u201cthe air danced with sunlight.\u201d We are forced to read about \u201cthe drama of finding the perfect tomato\u201d and a ride in \u201ca soulful canoe\u201d and an \u201cextremely sincere ratatouille.\u201d \u201cExtremely sincere ratatouille\u201d is a not-bad description of many of this book\u2019s sentences.The level of self-drama is set at 9.8 on the Lena Dunham scale. About falling in love with her husband, the thriller writer John Katzenbach, Blais writes: \u201cJohn and I met in New Jersey during the 1970s, a skittish time in the history of the republic\u201d \u2014 as if they were clinging to the landing skids of the last helicopter out of Weehawken.Other patches are like a college alumni magazine update, filled with memories of chicken fajita casseroles and panini makers past. A regular summer guest who gets dragged into all this is the writer Philip Caputo. There\u2019s a glowing report of \u201cPhil\u2019s swordfish roll-ups.\u201d Nonguest celebrity sightings include some you would like to unsee, such as \u201clawyer Alan Dershowitz on his cellphone at the nude beach at Lucy Vincent.\u201dBlais, who won a Pulitzer Prize for feature writing in 1980 while at The Miami Herald and has written several books, makes it plain that she wasn\u2019t born to privilege. She grew up in a small farming community in Massachusetts, one of six children raised by a single mother, an Irish-Catholic childhood she unpacked in her book \u201cUphill Walkers: Portrait of a Family\u201d (2001).Her husband, on the other hand, grew up in rarefied social circles. His best friend as a boy was Robert McNamara\u2019s son. His schoolboy high jinks included accidentally consuming, as an afternoon snack, filets mignons meant to be served to Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon.One of David Halberstam\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest,\u201d he served as attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson and confronted Gov. George Wallace at the door of the University of Alabama during the desegregation of the school.Blais\u2019s portraits of Nicholas Katzenbach and of his wife, Lydia King Phelps Stokes, are among this book\u2019s highlights.\u201cThe new owners had no idea what they were getting,\u201d Blais writes, as they considered tearing down the Katzenbach home. \u201cA dwelling that meant so much to us could clearly never have the same meaning to anyone else.\u201dShe goes out of her way to make sure this will be so. In this book\u2019s lowest moment, she prints several pages of what are apparently official notes from the West Tisbury Planning Board about the new owners\u2019 plans to build a much larger house on the land.At this point, all you\u2019ll want is a soulful canoe in which to paddle back to the mainland.Advertisement"}

Scott Fitzgerald Obsession", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "\u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d a nine-episode series, is the latest good-looking attempt to adapt F. Scott Fitzgerald for the screen.Supported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Meltdowns are not Matt Bomer\u2019s style, not even remotely, but he would have been due one in mid-March.Then I arrived to ask him jagged questions. For more than 90 years, Hollywood has been trying and failing to pull off the perfect Fitzgerald adaptation. Why couldn\u2019t anyone seem to get it right? What would keep this \u201cLast Tycoon,\u201d arriving on Amazon Prime on Friday, July 28, from becoming another sad example?\u201cMaking a great television show is hard enough,\u201d Mr. Bomer said carefully. \u201cTo also tackle F. Scott \u2014 whoa. But when you have brilliant people guiding you, people like Billy, you trust their vision and go for it.\u201dAdding a degree of difficulty, \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d will serve as a vehicle for commentary about modern-day Hollywood and America as a whole. \u201cAll these things that are coming to a head right now in our country \u2014 immigrants, sexism, the generational clash \u2014 are really big elements in our show,\u201d Mr. Bomer said. \u201cThere are so many American ideals that Fitzgerald was wrestling with and that we\u2019re still struggling to perfect.\u201dIt all sounds fascinating. But cracking Fitzgerald would be a feat unto itself.Of \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d in particular, she added, \u201cIt is awfully hard to film Hollywood \u2014 to make it look authentic.\u201dMr. Berg, whose books include \u201cGoldwyn: A Biography,\u201d about the movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, is a consulting producer of Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d and he vetted every script. Hollywood\u2019s challenges with Fitzgerald, he explained, start with his words.\u201cWhat makes his work so intoxicating is the writing \u2014 \u2018So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berg said, quoting the last line from \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t film language. You can use narration, of course. But narration is usually something pasted on a film when the visual storytelling isn\u2019t working.\u201dRewrite too much, and Fitzgeraldophiles have a fit. But his novels are generally not structured for film. (\u201cTender Is the Night,\u201d for one, uses shifting perspectives and moves forward and backward in time.) So screenwriters have no choice. Novels heavier on plot \u2014 works by Charles Dickens, for example \u2014 lend themselves more easily to adaptation, Mr. Berg noted. \u201cFitzgerald, on the other hand, fought metaphorically in his writing,\u201d he said.But the creative ensemble behind the new \u201cLast Tycoon\u201d saw the unfinished aspect of the book as an opening.\u201cKeep the icons from the novel \u2014 the Shiva head, the two-dimes-and-a-matchbox speech \u2014 but polish them up, move things around, explore characters in deeper ways,\u201d Mr. Berg said. \u201cThere could be 50 episodes here if done correctly.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat was put together as a book was extrapolated itself, so let\u2019s extrapolate from there.\u201d\u201cThere is just so much going on with Celia \u2014 steadfast, tenacious, passionate, na\u00efve but saucy,\u201d Ms. Collins told me between takes. \u201cI think fleshing Celia out was a little bit of how Billy and Chris solved the puzzle, and, you know, made this story into something that can last multiple seasons.\u201d\u201cWho has power, what do they do to get it, what do they do when they\u2019ve lost it?\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cWhat are the trades, compromises and deals that you\u2019d make to get your movie made? No difference between 1936 and 2017. None.\u201dMr. Ray pointed to a plotline in the pilot, which has been available on Amazon since last summer, about how Mr. Bomer\u2019s character wants to make a movie but can\u2019t because the German government might find the story objectionable. In the 1930s, Germany was a huge box-office market.\u201cThose exact same conversations are being had about China right now all over Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cIt\u2019s too big of a market to offend.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis is a world \u2014 then, now \u2014 where creative impulses are systematically tempered if not squashed by the system.\u201d He insisted, however, that the companies behind \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d which include Sony Pictures Television in addition to Amazon, had made requests that only improved his show. \u201cThey were interested in the glamour and the romance, and they were right,\u201d Mr. Ray said.(Amazon executives do seem to have a fondness for the period \u2014 and Fitzgerald. In January, the streaming service unveiled the series \u201cZ: The Beginning of Everything,\u201d starring Christina Ricci as a fictionalized version of Fitzgerald\u2019s wife, Zelda.)The same scene could well have unfolded in 1936.Filming soon resumed, with Mr. Bomer and Mr. Grammer performing that confrontational scene. Their fictional studio had fallen on hard times and borrowed money from a cutthroat competitor. Mr. Grammer\u2019s character wanted to pay back the loan by requiring all employees to take a 30 percent pay cut. And he wanted his popular production chief to break the news.\u201cYou can\u2019t treat people this way and expect them to do good work!\u201d Mr. Bomer shouted.The director called cut.A swarm of crew members came out of hiding to fuss over various details. One woman adjusted Mr. Grammer\u2019s pocket square ever so slightly, and a man holding a rolled-up script gave a suggestion to Mr. Bomer. Perhaps add a touch more smoke to the air, someone suggested. (It filters the light in a pretty period way.)\u201cLet\u2019s try it again,\u201d the director said.After all, the pressure was on. This time, Fitzgerald was going to be done right.An article last Sunday about adaptations of works by F. Scott Fitzgerald misstated the title of his second novel, published in 1922. It is \u201cThe Beautiful and Damned,\u201d not \u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Charlie Blackmon (a.k.a. Chuck Nazty) Bluffed His Way Into a Career", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballLOS ANGELES \u2014 Few players come to bat as often as Charlie Blackmon, the irrepressible leadoff man of the Colorado Rockies. Nobody in baseball has more hits or total bases \u2014 or, perhaps, a deeper appreciation for every swing.On Sunday, Blackmon was named a starting outfielder for the National League All-Star team, collecting more than three million fan votes as a reward for a scintillating first half: a .313 average, 17 homers, 58 runs batted in and five steals to go with all those hits and bases. It was not the future he expected in 2007, the year the Rockies reached their only World Series, and the year he reached a crossroad.Blackmon, now 31, began that year as a sore-armed afterthought of a pitcher with two low-round draft selections in his past. He ended it as a promising outfielder with speed and power who would soon become a second-round draft pick.And he was still cleanshaven.\u201cHe looks menacing now, but he\u2019s one of the nicest guys you\u2019ll ever meet,\u201d said Rusty Greer, a former major league outfielder. \u201cBack then, he was just a baby-faced kid who could run and swing the bat a little bit.\u201dGreer, a .305 hitter over nine seasons with the Texas Rangers, met Blackmon that summer, after Blackmon\u2019s discouraging spring at Georgia Tech. He had transferred there after two seasons at Young Harris College in Georgia, where he had been a 20th-round draft choice of the Red Sox. Before that, after a high school career near Atlanta, Blackmon was chosen by the Marlins in the 28th round.He was tall and lanky \u2014 a projectable body, as scouts say, perfect for a left-handed pitcher. Blackmon considered himself a pitcher, too. He did not hit a home run over the fence until his senior year of high school, and once had season tickets to Braves games at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, where he marveled at the artistry of Atlanta\u2019s star pitchers \u2014 Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.After he transferred to Georgia Tech, though, Blackmon developed tendinitis in his elbow and changed his arm action to compensate. His velocity dipped and he pitched just one inning all season \u2014 two hits, two runs, two walks. The Yellow Jackets left him behind on trips, so Blackmon would haul a bucket of balls into the batting cage and pitch to a target on a screen.\u201cThat was a really hard time for me,\u201d he said before a recent game at Dodger Stadium. \u201cI had to figure out what was important in life, what were my priorities. I just missed baseball and wanted to play.\u201dDuring summers in junior college, Blackmon had pitched in the prestigious Cape Cod League. After his first year at Georgia Tech, he found a different summer opportunity \u2014 with the Colleyville LoneStars of the Texas Collegiate League. Greer coached the team but did not know much about his roster beforehand. That was a relief to Blackmon, who planned to assume a new identity.Blackmon had looked good in pitchers\u2019 batting practice that spring, and a coach, Bobby Moranda, told him he might have a future at the plate. Blackmon did not think much of it then, but by the end of that lonely season at Georgia Tech, he was desperate enough to try. He billed himself as a hitter in Colleyville.\u201cI was basically just going in there bluffing,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them I was a two-way player because I just wanted to play. I figured, worst-case scenario, I don\u2019t get any hits and I still get a chance to pitch, but at least I get to go out there and take some batting practice and feel like a baseball player again.\u201dGreer said he was not impressed with Blackmon\u2019s pitching; he threw 88 to 90 miles per hour with an ordinary slider, nothing that would give him a chance for a long, productive playing career. But Greer liked how he pulled the ball with authority as a designated hitter, and how close he came to beating out routine grounders.One day, as Greer dragged the infield dirt at Colleyville Heritage High School, he noticed Blackmon blazing across the outfield grass, practicing 50-yard sprints. In the course of just four sweeps on a John Deere Gator, Greer said, he plotted a new course for Blackmon.Greer coached only that one season for the LoneStars, a team that no longer exists. But he took the job seriously, encouraging Blackmon to learn the outfield and calling Georgia Tech Coach Danny Hall with an encouraging report.That fall, in an intrasquad game, Hall let Blackmon bat against the team\u2019s star pitcher: a 6-foot-8-inch left-hander, David Duncan.\u201cHe\u2019s the last guy I want to see,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cHe falls behind, 2-0, and I\u2019m like, \u2018All right, I\u2019m just gonna let it eat.\u2019 He throws it right down the middle, and I hit it, like, way out. So the first swing anybody saw me take, I murdered this ball.\u201dThe home run cleared the right-field wall, some trees and another retaining wall before landing on Fowler Street. It was settled: In the spring of 2008, Blackmon would be an outfielder. He hit .396 with eight home runs and 25 steals for the Yellow Jackets, and by the end of the summer he had hit .338 for a Rockies Class A team.\u201cI think he\u2019s a better hitter because he pitched, because I think he realized how hard it was to pitch,\u201d Rockies second baseman D. J. LeMahieu said. \u201cI\u2019ve played with him pretty much every game since 2012, minors and majors, and he\u2019s done nothing but get better \u2014 defensively, base running, hitting, hitting for power. He can drive balls with anybody now.\u201dYet it took Blackmon a while to establish himself in the majors. His first season, in 2011, ended that July with a broken foot (Blackmon used the downtime to finish his finance degree at Georgia Tech). He shuffled between the Rockies and Class AAA for two more seasons, and then vacationed in Australia in late 2013.That fall, a gang of thickly bearded Red Sox won the World Series. Blackmon noticed and decided not to shave on his trip, just to see how it looked. As his beard grew, he liked what it represented.\u201cI was just kind of sick of getting cut from the team, not playing well when I did get the opportunities,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cI was just over being so serious about myself. It was kind of a personally rebellious thing, like, \u2018I\u2019m just going to have fun, do my own thing and try to be myself.\u2019\u201dHe has never returned to the minors, earning his first All-Star selection in 2014, stealing 43 bases in 2015 and batting .324 last year. Along the way, he logged postgame entries into notebooks, compiling a dossier on opponents that he has now mostly internalized.Blackmon still drives the car he had in high school, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 150,000 miles on it; he likes not having to keep it clean. He lets his hair go, too, with a stringy mullet (\u201cIt evens out my head,\u201d he said) descending from the back of his cap.On social media, Blackmon calls himself Chuck Nazty. His Instagram account has chronicled his adventures as a trout fisherman, on a solo backpacking trip through Europe and wearing a Batman costume for Christmas.\u201cHe\u2019s the greatest of all the superheroes,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cHe always had the cool gadgets, and he wasn\u2019t invincible. It\u2019s easy to be brave if you\u2019re immortal, if you can\u2019t die, like Superman. Batman was the real deal.\u201dNolan Arenado, the Rockies\u2019 All-Star third baseman, said he envied Blackmon\u2019s carefree persona, the way he can lock in for a game and then let go: Charlie on the field, Chuck Nazty away from it.\u201cIt\u2019s like an alter ego in a way,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cLike, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be this shy center fielder. I want to be a dude, and this is who I want to be.\u2019\u201dTen years ago, Blackmon just wanted to be a baseball player again, even if he had to leave the mound to do it. Now he is one of the best, a dude with a style all his own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Only Six Nations Have Evaluated Readiness for Global Pandemic", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal HealthJust three wealthy countries \u2014 Finland, Saudi Arabia and the United States \u2014 have gone through two external evaluations of their readiness to face pandemics, one for human diseases and one for animal outbreaks, the study found.As of last April, only three poor countries \u2014 Eritrea, Pakistan and Tanzania \u2014 had undergone both evaluations and had described how they planned to find the money to rectify their weaknesses.The unusually concise and crisp report, \u201cFrom Panic and Neglect to Investing in Health Security,\u201d was written by experts from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the African and Asian development banks, and finance officials from various governments.The external evaluations are done in cooperation with the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health, a Paris-based United Nations agency. (Even diseases that infect only animals can damage economies by curtailing meat exports, for example, or driving up domestic food prices.)The annual number of disease outbreaks around the globe has more than tripled since 1980, and air travel spreads contagions across oceans far more often.To convince countries that preparedness pays, the report included estimates of the economic damage various epidemics had done. For example, the viral pneumonia SARS \u2014 which ultimately killed only 774 people \u2014 shrank China\u2019s gross domestic product by 0.5 percent in 2003.The report also broke down costs on a per capita basis. A major flu pandemic, for example, would cost Afghanistan only $12 per citizen, but the United States $248.The American government pays 60 percent of the $4 billion disbursed each year to stop pandemics; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation alone is the third-biggest donor, covering 10 percent of the costs. Britain pays 13 percent. Canada, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Norway pay the rest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Herd of \u2018Gray Rhinos\u2019 Threatens Economy", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Let the West worry about so-called black swans, rare and unexpected events that can upset financial markets. China is more concerned about \u201cgray rhinos\u201d \u2014 large and visible problems in the economy that are ignored until they start moving fast.The rhinos are a herd of Chinese tycoons who have used a combination of political connections and raw ambition to create sprawling global conglomerates. Companies like Anbang Insurance Group, Fosun International, HNA Group and Dalian Wanda Group have feasted on cheap debt provided by state banks, spending lavishly to build their empires.Such players are now so big, so complex, so indebted and so enmeshed in the economy that the Chinese government is abruptly bringing them to heel. President Xi Jinping recently warned that financial stability is crucial to national security, while the official newspaper of the Communist Party pointed to the dangers of a \u201cgray rhinoceros,\u201d without naming specific companies.The turnabout for the first generation of post-Mao Chinese capitalists, once seen as exemplars of the country\u2019s ingenuity and economic prowess, has been swift.Fosun, run by a professed \u201cWarren Buffett of China,\u201d made multibillion-dollar deals for Club Med, Cirque du Soleil and other brands. The company was recently forced to deny speculation that its chairman, Guo Guangchang, who was briefly held by officials in 2015 for unknown reasons, was in custody again.\u201cThe downside of these new companies is that there was no one with the political or regulatory strength who could control these companies,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a boutique investment banking advisory service in Shanghai.The gray rhinos have a common characteristic: a lot of debt and many deals.For years, China\u2019s banks readily doled out loans, eager to keep pumping money into the economy. They doubled down after the global financial crisis in 2008, to prop up growth and push down the value of the currency.The conglomerates, with their stellar reputations and strong profits, were at the front of the lending line. HNA has secured a $90 billion credit line from state-controlled banks. Anbang spent more than $10 billion in three years, deals that were financed mostly by selling so-called wealth management products \u2014 opaque investments promising high rates and low risk.With state money in hand, companies looked beyond their borders, at the urging of the government. Over the past five years, Wanda, Anbang, HNA Group and Fosun have made at least $41 billion of overseas acquisitions, according to Dealogic, a research firm.The country\u2019s debt levels soared. In 2011, total credit extended to private, nonfinancial companies was about 120 percent of economic output in China. It is now 166 percent.\u201cThe Chinese government played the role of an indispensable enabler,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics. \u201cIf you look at how they got so big, it\u2019s all through taking on debt.\u201dBy 2015, China\u2019s economy was losing steam. And the government, which had been looking for ways to reinvest all the dollars pouring into the country, suddenly needed to prevent all the money from flowing out. Beijing had to dip deep into its pockets to keep the currency from sinking.The government started taking a closer look at the most prolific deal makers. In December, four big Chinese regulators, in a rare joint statement, warned about \u201cirrational\u201d investments in overseas real estate, entertainment and sports, calling the areas rife with \u201crisks and hidden dangers.\u201dSome of the conglomerates\u2019 purchases appeared to fit that description.Fosun bought Britain\u2019s Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club. It was among a number of Chinese deals for soccer teams, including AC Milan, Inter Milan and FC Sochaux.Anbang was in a protracted battle for the Starwood hotel chain, bidding up the price and drawing scrutiny. It eventually walked away from Starwood, which Marriott purchased for $13 billion.In recent months, the political and regulatory environment has quickly shifted. Chinese officials have also become preoccupied with preventing any disruption to the Communist Party\u2019s next congress, where the leadership is selected every five years. In the lead-up to the event this fall, the government is putting a premium on stability.The climate has put a chill on big deal makers. Fosun has nearly stopped its frenetic deal making. HNA\u2019s purchases have also slowed.Both companies said their finances remain in good shape. \u201cWe maintain strict control over our financial risk and continue to improve our debt and cash flow,\u201d Fosun said in a statement.HNA said that its ratio of debt to assets had declined over the last seven years. \u201cHNA Group is a financially strong company with a robust, diversified balance sheet that reflects our continued growth and engagement across the capital markets,\u201d the company said. On its relationship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the conglomerate said, \u201cWith the exception of some modest asset-backed financing provided to some of our leasing subsidiaries, where business continues as usual, HNA Group has never engaged B.A.M.L. for any significant business.\u201d\u201cEveryone is concerned about Wanda Commercial\u2019s debt problems,\u201d Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, said about the group\u2019s main real estate subsidiary at a news conference on Wednesday.Anbang said that operations were normal and that it had ample cash. The company\u2019s longtime chairman, who has been on leave since his detention, has not been publicly charged with any crimes.The Chinese giants now look more like gray rhinos. The term itself comes not from biology but from an eponymous business book that has become somewhat popular this year in China.People\u2019s Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, used the term last week in a strong warning after President Xi expressed concern about debt. \u201cRisks in the financial sector are sophisticated,\u201d said the unsigned commentary. \u201cTherefore, precautionary measures should be taken to prevent not only \u2018black swan\u2019 but also \u2018gray rhino\u2019 events.\u201dThe concern facing these conglomerates is whether they can manage their high-priced expansions well enough to earn the profits needed even to repay loans issued at low rates. If regulators or banks take more decisive actions to rein in credit, the rhinos could become endangered.\u201cWhen that stops, there will be a reaction,\u201d Mr. Silvers said. \u201cWhether that will be a crash or something modulated over time is hard to see.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee on Twitter, @KeithBradsher and @suilee.Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing.

And, until that last-minute vote, McCain, who has demanded a return to \u201cregular order\u201d in the Senate, turns out to be perfectly willing to help the bums get rushed.When we look at the degeneration of American politics, it\u2019s natural to blame the naked partisans \u2014 people like Mitch McConnell, with his principle-free will to power, or Ted Cruz, with his ideological rigidity. And Trump has, of course, done more to degrade his office than any previous occupant of the White House.But none of what is happening right now would be possible without the acquiescence of politicians who pretend to be open-minded, decry partisanship, tut-tut about incivility and act as enablers for the extremists again and again.I started with McCain because so many journalists still fall for his pose as an independent-minded maverick, ignoring the reality that he has almost always been a reliable partisan yes-man whenever it matters. Incredibly, some commentators actually praised his performance earlier this week, focusing on his noble-sounding words and ignoring his utterly craven actions.Credit where credit is due: two senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have stood up against the effort to betray every promise Republicans have made \u2014 and McCain did something right in the end. But every other supposed moderate in the Senate has offered a profile in cowardice.And let\u2019s be clear: This story didn\u2019t start in the last few weeks, or the past few months. Republicans have been denouncing Obamacare and pledging to repeal and replace it for seven years, only to be caught flat-footed when given the chance to come up with an alternative. Shouldn\u2019t someone in the G.O.P. have asked, \u201cHey, guys, what is our plan, anyway? If we don\u2019t have one, shouldn\u2019t we consider helping make this law work?\u201d But nobody did.So will the Senate pass something awful? If it does, will the House pass it, too, or try to use it as a Trojan horse for something even worse? I don\u2019t know. But whatever happens, every Senate Republican besides Collins and Murkowski should be deeply ashamed.This column has been updated to reflect news developments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just. Cut. Taxes.", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the world is what it is, and a party that offers nothing, whose ideological sclerosis and internal contradictions allow it to offer nothing, might as well just go pass a tax cut and call it a day.It is no secret that this is what President Trump desires. The only reason we have spent so many months wandering the dark wood of Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that the Republican leadership in Congress persuaded itself that it could pull off a complicated fiscal maneuver, using health care reform to change the budget baseline in anticipation of a tax reform more comprehensive and enduring than George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts 15 years ago.It couldn\u2019t, because there was never anything close to a Republican consensus about what health care reform should do. But this grand strategy\u2019s failure still leaves the party with a simpler option, one that would satisfy the yearning for tax cuts that remains a divided conservatism\u2019s only certain common ground. Republicans could just go ahead and cut taxes the way Bush did \u2014 without major offsets but with a 10-year expiration date, so that all you would need is 50 votes plus Mike Pence to do it.I\u2019m not saying that Republicans couldn\u2019t still do a comprehensive and permanent tax reform in theory. Set health care aside entirely and there are still lots of clever and plausible ways to overhaul and improve the tax code without sacrificing revenue.But Republicans don\u2019t seem equipped to pull off anything complicated, they don\u2019t look united enough to take political risks, and they aren\u2019t ideologically ready to pass anything heretical. So barring a sudden transformation in the party and its leadership, a temporary, deficit-financed tax cut is the only thing that has a decent chance of happening.And while it\u2019s not the greatest idea, neither is it a terrible one. One reason among many that Obamacare repeal has run aground is that the deficit picture doesn\u2019t look as dire as it did when the health care law was passed \u2014 and Obamacare itself is not driving the kind of spending surge that many of its critics (myself included) feared.Meanwhile, economic growth is still sluggish, wage growth is tepid, and the work force participation rate is still below pre-recession levels. The best time for right-wing Keynesianism was probably four years ago \u2014 ah, for the Romney administration. But the economy is stagnant enough that you can make a decent tax-cuts-as-stimulus case, especially if Republicans were to focus on corporate and payroll taxes, on business and workers, instead of just aiming for the lowest possible top income tax rate.And if the tax cuts are pegged to expire in a decade, you\u2019ll have a built-in opportunity to negotiate deficit reduction in 2027, when the Rock is president, Kid Rock is running the Senate, and the speaker of the House is an as-yet-undiscovered YouTube star.Sorry, slipped into nihilism for a minute there. Back to deficit-financed tax cuts: They\u2019re suboptimal and risky, but they have a basic appeal to Republican politicians, they\u2019re more politically marketable than what the party was trying (I use that word loosely) to accomplish with health care, and they might actually give the Trump economy a still-needed boost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron\u2019s Shaky Embrace of de Gaulle", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs the first president of the Fifth Republic, de Gaulle wished to impose on the nation \u2014 and on its military \u2014 an executive authority so powerful that France would regain not just stability, but also its former glory in world affairs. Military spending was key to this ambition.De Gaulle did not hold back. By 1960, France was spending 5.4 percent of its gross domestic product on the armed forces. In the decade that followed, the foundation was laid for the country\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet and aircraft carriers, allowing France to project power far and wide.De Gaulle\u2019s vision could not have been realized without a flourishing economy. During the decade he was in power, France\u2019s annual G.D.P. growth was a 5.7 percent, outpacing that of every other European nation except West Germany.Mr. Macron, a political neophyte who rose to the nation\u2019s top office in May, has taken control of a much different country, one dismissed in many quarters as \u201cthe sick man of Europe.\u201d And not only has France\u2019s economy long been stagnant, but its sense of identity has also been shaken.Mr. Macron\u2019s neoliberalism is offered as part of the antidote to the economic woes: He seems determined to loosen workplace rules and lighten corporate tax burdens. He is also promising to make substantial state investments in infrastructure and innovative industries in order to lift the economy and lower unemployment.Enter General de Villiers. Reappointed to his post last month by the president, the general has been vocal about the depleted state of the armed forces. \u201cI have a fine army,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is doing 130 percent of what it was meant to do.\u201dFor the past two years, France has had some 20,000 men and women active in operational theaters \u2014 a strain on any army \u2014 the majority committed to regions in Africa and the Middle East once under French control. Moreover, several thousand soldiers have been called up to reinforce the police since the wave of terrorist attacks began in 2015.Crucially, it is not just a matter of material, but also morale. How to attract and retain recruits if the services are battered by years of budget cuts?General de Villiers told the French media that Mr. Macron had promised he would fulfill his campaign pledge to increase military spending to 2 percent of G.D.P. from around 1.78 percent. And Mr. Macron has seemed sympathetic, making several visits with military personnel during his first days in office.Mr. Macron was not amused. Following General de Villiers comments to the parliamentary committee, he reminded an audience of top military brass (including General de Villiers) who their boss was \u2014 \u201cJe suis votre chef\u201d \u2014 and warned them against engaging in public pressure or commentary. He insisted he would keep his word and begin the military buildup in 2018. Moreover, if the military command does not agree with the president, he said to the French media, it is the former that must change or be changed.On Wednesday, General de Villiers took Mr. Macron\u2019s words to heart, declaring in his resignation letter that he no longer believed he could guarantee the French Army\u2019s ability to both protect France and support the nation\u2019s global ambitions. On Thursday, as unease deepened in the ranks of military leaders, Mr. Macron made an unscheduled visit to a military base to announce that, come 2018, the defense budget will be increased by nearly 1.8 billion euros.Mr. Macron\u2019s rhetoric and theatrics reveal that he is committed to the Gaullist projection of hard power, but his experience in finance and government show that he is wedded to budgetary restraint.In his speech at the military base, he told the soldiers that he knows \u201cwhat France owes\u201d them. But he has also told the French what his government owes them: a 50 billion euro investment in training programs and infrastructure, all the while offering tax relief and keeping the national deficit at the European Union-imposed 3 percent of G.D.P.The coming months will reveal how Mr. Macron will balance these priorities. As another of his political heroes, Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France, observed, \u201cTo govern means to choose.\u201dRobert Zaretsky teaches at the University of Houston and is at work on a book on Catherine the Great and the French Enlightenment.Advertisement"}

A. J. Tarpley, a linebacker on the Buffalo Bills who played at Stanford University, retired last year after sustaining several concussions. The year before, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland left the N.F.L. after one season, citing a fear of long-term cognitive damage.A neuropathologist has examined the brains of 111 N.F.L. players \u2014 and 110 were found to have C.T.E., the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head.\u201cRight now, I spend most of my time thinking about discrete Schr\u00f6dinger operators, high-dimensional data compression, algebraic multigrid and Voronoi diagrams,\u201d he said on his M.I.T. web page.In the article, Urschel wrote, \u201cobjectively, I shouldn\u2019t\u201d play football.\u201cI have a bright career ahead of me in mathematics. Beyond that, I have the means to make a good living and provide for my family, without playing football.\u201dThe collision in 2015 knocked him out. Urschel told HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports With Bryant Gumbel\u201d that his ability to do high-level math was temporarily affected.Eugene Monroe, a fellow lineman on the Ravens that season, said he spoke with Urschel after he sustained that concussion. Urschel, he said, told him that he was unnerved that it had affected his ability to solve math problems.\u201cHe was nervous; he was frightened about it,\u201d said Monroe, who retired last year in part because he worried about the long-term effects of repeated hits to the head. \u201cFor something he loves, he\u2019s been thinking about it. How could he not.\u201dStill, Monroe said he was not surprised that Urschel returned to the field three weeks after the concussion, \u201cfootball ready,\u2019\u2019 as Urschel said on the HBO program, although it took him longer to recover his math skills.Despite the severity of the concussion, Urschel said that he wanted to continue doing the two things he loved: math and football.\u201cI recognize that this is somewhat irrational,\u201d Urschel said on the segment. \u201cBut I am doing it.\u201dNot anymore.Advertisement"}

Soon, It Will Run Out.", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "Pistoia\u2019s train factory benefited from the European Central Bank\u2019s bond buying program, which is drawing to a close.Supported byPISTOIA, Italy \u2014 As Europe\u2019s era of easy money slowly draws to a close, the talk in Frankfurt and London is of bond yields, exchange rates and core inflation. In this medieval city at the foot of the Apennines, it\u2019s all about trains.A stimulus program by the European Central Bank helped revive the train factory that is the largest employer in Pistoia, hauling the city out of a deep economic slump and putting people back to work.But the bank is now preparing to take away that stimulus, raising an existential question for Pistoia, a case study in what central bank largess has achieved, and in what might happen when it is no longer there.But analysts agree that the day is not far away when places like Pistoia will have to stand on their own.Only a few years ago Pistoia, which has a population of 92,000, was mired in economic gloom. The local factory, then owned by the Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, had produced trains for more than a century, but the downturn was taking its toll.The factory was short of orders and in danger of closing. It laid off hundreds of workers and put others on reduced hours. Dozens of companies that supplied it went out of business. Young people emigrated to Australia in search of better opportunities, while right-wing and populist parties exploited the insecurity to increase their influence in the local government.\u201cThere was a lot of fear,\u201d said Jury Citera, secretary of the main union representing workers at the plant. \u201cNo one thought there was a future at the company.\u201dAll told, the bank has spent 2 trillion newly conjured euros, or $2.3 trillion, buying bonds in a bid to push down market interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and easier.Among the bonds it bought were those issued by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, the government-owned company that manages the Italian rail network. It, in turn, used the money to order 39 trains for regional services.Suddenly there was work in Pistoia again.\u201cA few years ago we felt like we were on a stationary bicycle, pedaling but going nowhere,\u201d said Antonella Nannetti, another union official. \u201cNow we are moving again.\u201dFerrovie dello Stato Italiane had been planning to buy new trains anyway, said Stefano Pierini, its finance director. But lower interest rates helped speed up the investment and allowed a bigger order. The same principle, writ large, has helped the eurozone achieve its most solid growth in a decade.The European Central Bank says its bond buying program does not target specific countries, let alone individual communities.But by buying public sector and corporate bonds in grand style, the bank creates more demand and allows governments and companies to issue debt with lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case. The program\u2019s ultimate aim is to lower the cost of credit, stimulate growth and raise annual inflation closer to the official target of nearly 2 percent.If central bank bond buying is helping companies in places like Pistoia to invest and expand, \u201cit is definitely a positive,\u201d Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview.The purchases of corporate bonds have covered a broad range of industries across the 19 nations of the eurozone. They include debt issued by the brewers Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken, by the pharmaceutical makers Novartis and Roche, by the fashion eyewear maker Luxottica, and by consumer products companies including Nestl\u00e9, Unilever and a Belgian unit of Coca-Cola.But an examination by The New York Times of the purchases, which the central bank identifies only by bond serial numbers, reveals one clear theme: infrastructure.That is especially true in Italy.In addition to the railroad company, the central bank has bought debt issued by Autostrade per l\u2019Italia, which builds and manages Italian roads, as well as by utilities and energy companies. One is Hera, a waste and water management company in Bologna, which is using part of the money it raised to build a plant that will convert organic waste into natural gas.Effectively, the European Central Bank is financing an enormous public works program in Italy.Despite sunny weather, Pistoia\u2019s pedestrian zone was practically empty on Monday. Edda Iozzini was still in a good mood. \u201cMoney is in circulation again,\u201d the 66-year-old, who owns a newsstand, said between drags of a cigarette. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy in Pistoia.\u201dWhether that feeling remains once the stimulus punch bowl is removed is an open question. After a slump that lasted a decade, growth in the eurozone has surpassed the United States\u2019, and unemployment is falling. For all intents and purposes, the credit crunch is over, analysts say.But there remain trouble spots \u2014 notably Italy. The country\u2019s banks are still working off an enormous backlog of problem loans, and credit remains tight.\u201cQuantitative easing has been very important,\u201d Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian oil and gas giant Eni, said in an interview. \u201cWithout it, Italy would have had a lot of problems.\u201dBut Ms. Marcegaglia said she thought the Italian economy was improving and could withstand a gradual decline in central bank stimulus.Pistoia\u2019s prospects appear good because money flowing into the area since 2015 has been used to improve the region\u2019s competitiveness.The Japanese industrial conglomerate Hitachi bought the train factory from Finmeccanica just as the European Central Bank released its gusher of cheap credit. Workers in Pistoia say Hitachi brought technological know-how as well as a willingness to modernize the plant. (Hitachi declined to comment for this article.)The revival of the factory has restored not only the workers\u2019 livelihoods but also their pride.\u201cNow we feel we can show what we can do,\u201d said Marco Fontana, who represents administrative employees at the factory. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show we are real members of the European Union and not some little province.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Then a credit-rating agency expressed skepticism about the company\u2019s debt.The market reaction was swift on Monday, with shares and debt issued by several subsidiaries of Wanda falling sharply.The mounting pressure on Wanda reflects the challenges facing large Chinese companies that borrowed heavily to finance their breathtaking growth over the last few years.The mysterious document that went viral, before being blocked by Chinese censors, appeared to be a cellphone photo of the first page of an internal document from the Agricultural Bank of China. The document described two supposed meetings about Dalian Wanda, one involving a National Development and Reform Commission official, Zheng Chiping, and the other with China Banking Regulatory Commission officials.The bank, the document said, was told by regulators that it was forbidden to lend to six of Wanda\u2019s overseas acquisitions even if those ventures ran into difficulty raising money abroad. The regulators, the document said, also told the bank that it could not help the overseas projects with foreign currency or financial registrations.The reform commission and the Agricultural Bank of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wanda declined to comment.At least two projects listed in the document fall under Wanda\u2019s AMC Entertainment: its deals to acquire Carmike Cinemas and the Nordic Cinema Group deal. It is unclear to what extent AMC, as an American company, needs financing from Chinese banks \u2014 although controversy in China about the creditworthiness of AMC\u2019s corporate parent could make non-Chinese lenders more wary as well.To investors, it did not matter whether the document was authentic or regulators\u2019 warnings were real: In this shaky environment, company stocks and bonds are proving volatile.Shares in Wanda Hotel Development Company fell 5.8 percent in trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday.

{"Headline": "U.S. Agency Moves to Allow Class-Action Lawsuits Against Financial Firms", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s consumer watchdog adopted a rule on Monday that would pry open the courtroom doors for millions of Americans, by prohibiting financial firms from forcing them into arbitration in disputes over their bank and credit card accounts.The action, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, would deal a serious blow to banks and other financial firms, freeing consumers to band together in class-action lawsuits that could cost the institutions billions of dollars.\u201cA cherished tenet of our justice system is that no one, no matter how big or how powerful, should escape accountability if they break the law,\u201d Richard Cordray, the director of the consumer agency, said in a statement.The new rule, which could take effect next year, is almost certain to set off a political firestorm in Washington. Both the Trump administration and House Republicans have pushed to rein in the consumer finance agency as part of a broader effort to lighten regulation on the financial industry.The rule \u201cshould be thoroughly rejected by Congress under the Congressional Review Act,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who has been leading the charge to weaken the agency. \u201cIn the last election, the American people voted to drain the D.C. swamp of capricious, unaccountable bureaucrats who wish to control their lives.\u201dUnder the Congressional Review Act \u2014 a 1996 law that had been rarely used before the current Congress employed it to reverse 14 rules from the Obama administration \u2014 lawmakers have about 60 legislative days to overturn the rule blocking mandatory arbitrations.But as much as Republicans deplore the consumer protection agency, they may find it difficult to kill a rule that could have wide populist appeal. Across the country, judges, prosecutors and regulators have sharply criticized arbitration clauses for allowing corporations to circumvent the courts and for taking away tools to fight abusive business practices.The new rule would unwind a series of legal maneuvers undertaken by major American companies to block customers from going to court to fight potentially harmful business practices.The rule is one of the signature efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul to safeguard the rights of millions of Americans in the aftermath of the mortgage crisis.At a time when Dodd-Frank has come under attack, the arbitration initiative from the consumer finance agency \u2014 which operates independently from the Trump administration \u2014 is a provocative stand against the prevailing political tide in Washington.Indeed, the rule is largely unchanged from when it was issued in draft form in May 2016 and the agency began soliciting comments from industry.It is that kind of independence that has drawn particular ire from Republicans.Mr. Hensarling already sent a letter last week threatening contempt proceedings against Mr. Cordray, the agency\u2019s director, faulting the agency for failing to comply with a subpoena related to its work on the arbitration issue.The Chamber of Commerce echoed Mr. Hensarling\u2019s critique, saying, \u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s brazen finalization of the arbitration rule is a prime example of an agency gone rogue.\u201dThe chamber and other pro-business groups have belittled the rule as nothing more than a gift to class-action lawyers, who tend to be Democratic donors.Last month, the Treasury Department issued a report recommending that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau be held in check, accusing it of regulatory overreach and calling for the president to be able to remove its director.Supporters of the agency say arbitration is exactly the kind of issue that requires independence from corporate interests.Over decades, financial institutions, led by credit card companies, figured out a way to use the fine print of their contracts to force consumers into private arbitration, a secretive process in which borrowers have to go up on their own against powerful companies with deep pockets.Prevented from banding together in a class and pooling their resources, most people simply abandon their claims entirely, never making it to arbitration at all.The new rule could change all that when it comes to consumer finance. While the protections would not apply to existing accounts, consumers could pay off old loans and get new accounts that would fall under the new rule.The rule, which would take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register, does not explicitly outlaw arbitration, but industry lawyers say it will effectively kill the practice.\u201cIf this rule goes into effect, what we are going to see is a huge avalanche of litigation and a loss to consumers of the benefits of arbitration,\u201d said Alan S. Kaplinsky, a lawyer with the firm Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia who is widely considered the father of arbitration clauses.To Mr. Kaplinsky, who opposes the rule, arbitration offers a faster and more efficient way to resolve legal disputes.In the debate about arbitration, those assertions were almost entirely anecdotal. There is no federal database that tracks arbitrations, and the process is entirely secretive.In financial disputes, the numbers are particularly startling. In its investigation, The Times found that from 2010 to 2014, only 505 consumers \u2014 a fraction of the tens of millions of Americans whose financial contracts have arbitration clauses \u2014 went to arbitration over disputes of $2,500 or less.That reluctance is why one federal judge remarked in an opinion that \u201conly a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\u201dBy banning class actions, companies essentially squashed challenges to practices such as predatory lending, wage theft, sexual discrimination and medical malpractice.Among the class actions derailed over the years by arbitration was a case brought by Citigroup customers who accused the bank of tricking them into insurance that they were never eligible to use. In another, a group of merchants challenged American Express over high processing fees.The rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would apply only to the financial companies regulated by the agency and would not touch arbitration clauses buried in the fine print of nursing home or employment contracts.Clauses embedded in those contracts have pushed out of view disputes about elder abuse, sexual harassment and even wrongful deaths.Recognizing that problem, the federal agency that controls more than $1 trillion in Medicare and Medicaid funding proposed a rule last September that would have barred any nursing home that gets federal funding from requiring residents to resolve disputes in arbitration. But the protection was fleeting. Soon after Mr. Trump took office, his administration moved to scrap it.In some ways, the fate of the nursing home rule adds urgency to the efforts by the consumer bureau. The agency\u2019s action represents the first significant blow to arbitration since two Supreme Court decisions, in 2011 and 2013, enshrined its use.Those rulings, which initially drew scant attention outside the cloistered legal world, upended decades of jurisprudence that had been put in place to protect workers and consumers.To stop the spread of class-action lawsuits, a coalition of credit card companies used an arcane federal law dating to 1925 that formalized arbitration as a way for companies of equal bargaining power to resolve corporate disputes. Starting in the early 2000s, the credit card companies began to use arbitration for disputes with their customers.Today, it is virtually impossible to apply for a credit card, rent a car, get cable or internet service, or shop online without agreeing to private arbitration.As arbitration crept into tens of millions of contracts, prosecutors, judges and lawmakers started sounding alarms. In the Dodd-Frank law, the consumer agency was specifically mandated to examine arbitration.The analysis culminated in a 728-page report, released in March 2015, that showed how few consumers went to arbitration once they were prevented from joining a class action. For those who did go through with arbitration, the agency found, the results were dismal. During the period studied, only 78 arbitration claims resulted in judgments in favor of consumers, who got $400,000 in total relief.The financial industry balked at the findings, arguing that on a person-by-person basis, consumers wound up with more money in arbitration than in class actions.But law professors and judges, including some appointed by conservative presidents, say the amount of money an individual obtains in a class action is beside the point. Class actions, they argue, are intended to help big groups of people get back small amounts of money \u2014 say a $35 overdraft fee. More important, supporters say, class actions can push companies to get rid of questionable business practices.Big banks, for example, had to pay more than $1 billion to settle class-action lawsuits that started in 2009 and accused them of monkeying with checking account policies to maximize the number of overdraft fees they could charge customers.In the aftermath of the litigation, seven of the banks involved have adopted arbitration clauses to their contracts.videoAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s arguably not bad compared with the 5,800 fires that the M.T.A. recorded back in 1981, when the subways were at their nadir. Still, it means an average of nearly two such fires a day, each with a potential for dire consequences.But riders could pitch in themselves by doing just that: pitching in. All too often, a peculiar paralysis keeps people from tossing a newspaper or a bagel wrapper into a trash bin mere feet away. Routinely, they drop the garbage where they are standing. Just as routinely, it ends up on the tracks.This is in no way meant to pin the subways\u2019 most severe woes on its passengers. The real solutions lie elsewhere \u2014 in decent financing, strong management and firm political will. Nonetheless, too many riders make life tough on one another.Take another form of New York paralysis: the sudden failure of legs to function at the moment of entry into a subway car. These people plant themselves at the door, refusing to move deeper in. Some can\u2019t even be bothered to make the body turn necessary to let others get easily on and off. A few earbud-wearers among them seem to feign unawareness of what pains they are making of themselves.Similarly oblivious are those with overstuffed backpacks who stand there blocking the entire aisle instead of putting the bags on the floor between their legs. Same goes for those who practically wrap their bodies around the aisle poles, or who make themselves comfortable by taking up more than one seat, or who prevent the doors from closing smoothly, sending conductors into their Vegematic routine \u2014 the maddening stutter-start opening and closing of doors that wastes precious seconds.Each assault on etiquette has logistical consequences. Each can increase the train\u2019s \u201cdwell time\u201d in a station. Add an extra 15 seconds of dwell time here, another 20 seconds there, and you have a cascading effect that appreciably lengthens travel time. \u201cIt boils down to being considerate to everybody,\u201d said Benjamin Kabak, who writes a subway blog, Second Ave. Sagas. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Nuclear Weapons Program Would Be Legal, German Review Finds", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe assessment provides a legal framework for such a plan. Britain or France, it finds, could legally base nuclear warheads on German soil.The document states that \u201cPresident Trump and his contradictory statements on NATO\u201d have led to fears \u201cthat the U.S. could reduce its nuclear commitment\u201d to Europe.While the review is only an endorsement of the plan\u2019s legality \u2014 not a determination to take action \u2014 it is the first indication that such an idea has escalated from informal discussion to official policy-making channels.Few analysts believe that Germany or the European Union is on the verge of pursuing a replacement nuclear umbrella. Most German officials still oppose such a plan, which would face steep public opposition and diplomatic hurdles. Even proponents consider it a last resort.Nonetheless, analysts say, the review indicates the growing seriousness with which Germany is preparing for the possible loss of the American guarantees that have safeguarded and united European allies since World War II.\u201cSomeone wanted to see whether this could work,\u201d said Ulrich Kuhn, a German nuclear analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIt suggests people consider this a possibility.\u201dWhile few are convinced Germany could overcome its taboo against nuclear weapons anytime soon, the existence of the assessment suggests that under pressure from Mr. Trump and growing Russian aggression, the taboo has eroded to an extent.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re asking the question in itself is pretty important,\u201d said Vipin Narang, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology political scientist who studies nuclear states.\u201cWhat\u2019s the line? \u2018Amateurs worry about strategy, professionals worry about logistics,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Narang added, saying that the assessment, by evaluating fine-grain legal questions, \u201cis getting into the logistics\u201d of a European nuclear program.Germany, the assessment finds, could be granted shared control over deploying those warheads under something called a \u201cdual key\u201d system, an arrangement that currently applies to American warheads based there. This would be intended to signal that the weapons would be used to protect all of Europe.Mr. Kuhn suggested that the timing could be related to the French presidential election, which elevated Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European centrist who has advocated closer defensive cooperation between France and Germany.Mr. Macron was elected on May 7. The legal review was concluded on May 23. It is unclear how long after that the findings were made public.Any version of this plan would likely hinge on French-German cooperation. Britain\u2019s nuclear program is small and submarine-based. Its pending exit from the European Union could also preclude British involvement.France\u2019s nuclear program, larger and more advanced, would be better suited to replace American capabilities, particularly the small, battlefield warheads that would be most useful in repelling a potential Russian invasion.Some versions of the plan, including one floated by Mr. Kiesewetter this winter, would see the European Union co-finance the French nuclear umbrella in order to demonstrate France\u2019s commitment to use the warheads in defense of all member states.Still, analysts say that securing legal authority is only a small, initial step, and one that might suggest Germany\u2019s desire to avoid, more than pursue, such a drastic option.Mr. Narang compared the document to a review by the Japanese government in the 1960s. Tokyo, fearing the United States might withdraw its protection, issued a report outlining how Japan could build a small nuclear arsenal of its own.Mr. Narang said the Japanese study was intended both to dissuade the Americans from withdrawing and to prepare a fallback in case they did. Germany, he added, today faces a similar dilemma.While it is unclear whether Japan would have really followed through, the country did develop something called a \u201cturnscrew\u201d capability, which left it only a few months from converting civilian nuclear materials into warheads.\u201cThese legal findings are part of that insurance hedging,\u201d Mr. Narang said, referring to the technical term for when countries seek alternatives to existing alliances.Even if allies have little intention of breaking from the status quo, he added, the act of planning for a worst-case situation makes it easier to imagine and, if necessary, pursue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Closing of the Republican Mind", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a recent survey showing a fundamental shift in the attitude of Republicans toward the value of higher education.From 2010 to 2015, solid majorities of Republicans and Democrats agreed that institutions of higher learning had a positive effect on America. In 2010, Republicans were 58-32 positive and Democrats 65-22. For Democrats, this pattern grew stronger over time, reaching 72-19 in the most recent polling in June.At a time when countries around the world are doing all they can to attract and retain talented individuals to come to their shores to build and grow innovative companies, the Trump Administration is signaling its intent to do the exact opposite.Imagine if we had sent half of Silicon Valley\u2019s immigrant entrepreneurs away. The 44 immigrant-founded billion-dollar start-ups now in the U.S. have created an average of 760 American jobs per company. Without these immigrant entrepreneurs, it is unlikely America would stand as the beacon of innovation that it is today.Countless analyses have demonstrated that Trump won the election by combining support from traditional Republican voters with a surge in backing from constituencies that contemporary economic and cultural developments have left behind.In recent decades, this class has become increasingly influential in setting cultural standards and in shaping contemporary values. Its success has provoked deepening resentment, to say the least.Far from spending their college years in a meritocratic melting pot, the New Elite spend school with people who are mostly just like them \u2014 which might not be so bad, except that so many of them have been ensconced in affluent suburbs from birth and have never been outside the bubble of privilege.hardworking, highly educated, jet-setting meritocrats who feel they are the deserving winners of a tough, worldwide economic competition \u2014 and many of them, as a result, have an ambivalent attitude toward those of us who didn\u2019t succeed so spectacularly. Perhaps most noteworthy, they are becoming a trans-global community of peers who have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back home.Picture a coffee shop in a big city almost anywhere on earth. It is filled with stylish, firm-bodied people aged under 50 drinking $5 coffees. Fresh from yoga class, they are reading New Yorker magazine articles about inequality before returning to their tiny $1.5 million apartments. This is the cultural elite.Trump, Kuper explains, labels this constituency\u201cthe elite\u201d but not all class members are rich. Adjunct professors, NGO workers and unemployed screenwriters belong alongside Mark Zuckerberg. Rather, what defines the cultural elite is education. Most of its members went to brand-name universities, and consider themselves deserving rather than entitled. They believe in facts and experts. Most grew up comfortably off in the post-1970s boom. Their education is their insurance policy and, so almost whatever their income, they suffer less economic anxiety than older or lesser educated people. Their political utopia is high-tax, egalitarian, feminist and green.The reaction against this class, which found expression in the 2016 election, has proved deeply troubling in some quarters.Richard Florida, in an email to me, was harsh in his assessment of consequences of the current anti-elite reaction:The United States is the first advanced nation since Japan and Germany during World War II to turn its back on progress and liberalism.In doing so, the United States threatens its status as \u201cthe most innovative, most knowledge driven, most powerful nation on earth,\u201d according to Florida:The political backlash from this divide can kill us. It is the only thing that can hold back our cities and stop talented and ambitious people from coming here.Such people have portable \u201cachieved\u201d identities, based on educational and career success which makes them generally comfortable and confident with new places and people.The anywhere voter values \u201cautonomy, mobility and novelty\u201d while giving much lower priority to group identity, tradition and patriotic expression. They view globalization, immigration, self-realization and meritocracy as positive concepts.Somewhere voters, in Goodhart\u2019s description, aremore rooted and have \u201cascribed\u201d identities \u2014 Scottish farmer, working class Geordie, Cornish housewife \u2014 based on group belonging and particular places, which is why they find rapid change more unsettling. One core group of Somewheres have been the so-called \u2018left behind\u2019 \u2013 mainly older white working class men with little education.Most are neither bigots nor xenophobes, according to Goodhart, and they generally accept the liberalization of \u201cattitudes to race, gender and sexuality,\u201d but this acceptance hasbeen more selective and tentative, and has not extended to enthusiasm for mass immigration or European integration.Among voters for Clinton, 27 percent lived in their hometown and 43 percent lived 2 hours or more away from their hometown; among Trump supporters, 36 percent lived in their hometown and 37 percent lived 2 or more hours away.James Stimson, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, sent me his own critical assessment of this phenomenon:Give a randomly selected group the choice, stay or go, and those who choose to go will be profoundly different from those who stay. And thus when we observe the behavior of those who live in distressed areas, we are not observing the effect of economic decline on the working class, we are observing a highly selected group of people who faced economic adversity and choose to stay at home and accept it when others sought and found opportunity elsewhere.Those who choose to leave such communities and find their fortune elsewhere are, in Stimson\u2019s view,ambitious and confident in their abilities. Those who are fearful, conservative, in the social sense, and lack ambition stay and accept decline.Given that, Stimson says:I don\u2019t see them as once proud workers, now dispossessed, but rather as people of limited ambition who might have sought better opportunity elsewhere and did not. I see their social problems more as explanations of why they didn\u2019t seek out opportunity when they might have than as the result of lost employment.Stimson then poses another question: \u201cShould the Democratic Party cater to these voters?\u201d His answer is an unequivocal no:The [rural] working class was once mainstream America, the most common and typical of all of us. It is now the residue of failed social mobility, when most have been mobile. After decades of social mobility, that residue is now more distinctive, it is those who are not willing to grab the ring, but rather to remain in the hometown and fear change and others. These people should be Trump voters.While Stimson\u2019s analysis is harsh \u2014 criticizing as it does many hardworking men and women whose loyalties to family, friend, community and church may supersede personal ambition \u2014 he captures a crucial element of contemporary politics. This is the potential of an angry electorate to provide a key base of support to a politician like Trump who capitalizes on resentment, intensifies racial and ethnic hostility and lies with abandon as a means to his ends.While Trump pulled out an Electoral College victory by mobilizing resentful voters and turning out more traditional Republicans, there are significant questions about the continuing viability of his coalition.\u201cI think that \u2018somewhere people\u2019 are a fast shrinking sliver of the American population.\u201d As the economy changes, Frey argued,younger people, millennials and upcoming generations are increasingly moving to where the jobs are, and are more comfortable with diversity and global connectivity.If Democrats have one thing to be grateful for, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s failure to live up to his campaign promises on health care and taxes, at least so far.In practice, Trump is going in the opposite direction, pressing for a radical alteration of health care policy that directly conflicts with the interests of millions of his supporters, and for legislation catering to the demands of the wealthiest Republicans for reduced tax burdens.We will massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country.American politics has become fluid and volatile. Income differences have been supplanted by cultural and social practices closely linked to levels of educational attainment. Political partisanship is now firmly linked to race, with whiteness defining one of the two major political parties. Religiosity has taken on new meaning \u2014 if one can call it that \u2014 with devout churchgoers supporting an avowed libertine. In that sense, both sides agree that morality has become a matter of personal discretion. Partisans impute evil to their adversaries, and the meritocratic elect have barred the gates.Trump has intuitively exploited this chaos. He is not at the end of his string, not by a long shot. His life demonstrates his will to win. His vulnerabilities and his pathologies are also astoundingly clear. While his critics are convinced that Trump the chameleon is masquerading as the protector of the left behind, he has in fact tapped into vast anger over immigration, which has shot up over the past 50 years \u2014 and there is no good reason to believe that this anger will dissipate by 2020.The question that remains is whether President Trump can continue to exploit the fissures he opened as candidate Trump. The answers history provides are not altogether reassuring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Campaign Is Sued Over Leaked Emails Linked to Russians", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump and his political advisers, including Mr. Stone, have repeatedly denied colluding with Russia, and the 44-page complaint, filed on Wednesday in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, does not contain any hard evidence that his campaign did. But it is seeking to depose witnesses and obtain campaign emails and other documents during the discovery process that is a standard part of lawsuits.If a judge permits the case to reach that stage, the lawsuit would become a new and independent fact-finding investigation into the Trump-Russia issue \u2014 one that is overseen by a judge rather than by congressional Republicans, like the oversight inquiries conducted by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, or by the Trump administration, like the criminal inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cThese plaintiffs are using the law and the American civil justice system the way it was intended: to vindicate important rights and values, such as the right to privacy and the right to participate in the political process; and to deter others who might consider colluding with a foreign government for political gain,\u201d said Ian Bassin, the executive director of Protect Democracy. \u201cThey want to ensure that what they have gone through does not become something we accept as part of our democracy.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s outside legal team did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Stone called the lawsuit meritless and said he expected it to be \u201cquickly dismissed.\u201dHe also said \u201cthere is no evidence whatsoever\u201d that he had advance knowledge of the hacking or that the Trump campaign was involved in it \u201cif they were even hacked.\u201dAmong the plaintiffs is Scott Comer, who was the chief of staff in the finance department of the Democratic National Committee, and whose hacked emails revealed to his grandparents that he is gay, which strained family relations, the lawsuit said.Mr. Comer also received harassing and threatening phone calls, and was marginalized at work because of comments he had made about co-workers, and eventually left his job, it said.The plaintiffs also include two Democratic Party donors, Roy Cockrum and Eric Schoenberg, whose Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses and other personal details became public when WikiLeaks published the files.The lawsuit said the disclosures resulted in attempts by strangers to steal the plaintiffs\u2019 identities and obtain credit in their names, which caused \u201csignificant distress and anxiety and will require lifelong vigilance and expense.\u201dThe complaint noted that the goal of the hacking \u201cwas to harm the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate for president of the United States and improve the Trump campaign\u2019s likelihood of success.\u201d But, it said, \u201cthe direct victims included Mr. Cockrum, Mr. Schoenberg and Mr. Comer.\u201dThe complaint largely consists of a catalog of publicly known facts that it presents as circumstantial evidence that the defendants had the motive, desire and opportunity to conspire with Russia. It noted public statements by the defendants and revelations about meetings and contacts with Russians that various associates of Mr. Trump concealed when applying for security clearances.It does not name as defendants Russia, which has sovereign immunity, or WikiLeaks, whose founder Julian Assange, an Australian citizen, is living in the embassy of Ecuador in London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Soothe Luxury-Car Buyers: Add Perks and Subtract Haggling", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe automobile \u2014 connected to the internet, powered by electricity, driven with computer support \u2014 is evolving faster than at any point in its history.Buying one, though, remains just about the same as always.But luxury dealers are betting that technology, and a healthy dose of more personal interaction, can vastly reduce bad buying experiences.\u201cHow do I have a sustainable business when everyone laughs thinking about car salespeople?\u201d asked Peter Cooper, owner of Lexus of Lehigh Valley, in Allentown, Pa. \u201cWe\u2019re so out of touch with the consumer.\u201dAware that many buyers hate haggling, Lexus introduced a fixed-price program in May 2016, called Lexus Plus, in which the customer deals with only one person from beginning to end. Only 10 of its 238 dealers in the United States are involved so far; another three are preparing to enter.\u201cBuyers won\u2019t have to wait 45 minutes to see a finance director,\u201d said Jim Dunn, general manager for JM Lexus of Margate, Fla., the world\u2019s highest-volume Lexus dealer, which will offer Lexus Plus. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put your best price up front and live with that.\u201dAt Mr. Cooper\u2019s dealership, the program has been well received. Unit sales are up 28.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.Not getting a straight answer on price is one reason Will Kunkel, who wanted to acquire three new Audis for his family, left two dealerships in disgust.\u201cThe first dealer told me that I had to buy immediately because the car would be gone that night,\u201d Mr. Kunkel said. \u201cAnd the second would only talk about monthly payments rather than price. They may as well call you an idiot to your face.\u201dCadillac is testing a program whereby customers never buy any particular vehicle at all. Instead, they buy rights to a car and can change which one they want to drive using a mobile app.Book by Cadillac, being tested in New York City, offers the ability to switch among Cadillac models up to 18 times per year. Using the Book app, customers can reserve a vehicle that, if it is available, will be delivered the next morning to the location of their choice.The program costs $1,500 per month, which includes registration, insurance, service and repairs. All vehicles, including the Escalade, CT6, XT5, CTS-V and ATS-V, have high-end trims, plus a 4G LTE connection and hot spot, OnStar and satellite radio.About 8,000 people have asked to be part of the program, the company said. And the high-tech, no-commitment approach has attracted younger drivers: Although the average age of a Cadillac owner is 62, the average age of those signing up for Book is 34, 90 percent of them first-time Cadillac drivers.\u201cWe\u2019re a Netflix for cars,\u201d said Melody Lee, Cadillac\u2019s director of brand marketing.When customers do go to a dealership to buy, they have often done research online before leaving home, industry experts say. That makes it harder for dealers to keep the upper hand when discussing typical prices, features or available inventory.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge for dealers when customers have instant access to vehicle information,\u201d said Chris Sutton, vice president for United States automotive retail practice at the research firm J. D. Power.Alfa Romeo, trying to make a comeback in the United States, is arming its dealers\u2019 sales teams with iPads to help them communicate on more equal terms with their customers, said Pieter Hogeveen, director of Alfa Romeo North America.Lincoln Motor Company, Ford\u2019s luxury division, is approaching the problem of selling to a well-informed, focused public by reshaping a car sale as a luxury experience. Customers don\u2019t want to submit themselves to one salesperson to haggle with, then to a closer and finally to a finance manager, surrendering the better part of a day.\u201cFor affluent customers, time is the key thing; it\u2019s their ultimate luxury,\u201d said Kumar Galhotra, Lincoln\u2019s president.To reduce the time that people spend buying and servicing their vehicles, Lincoln is offering at-home test drives and service pickups and deliveries. Customers can even evaluate a vehicle over the weekend.Such convenience-based initiatives are part of Lincoln\u2019s Black Label program, a sales and service package that was first offered in 2014 and is available at 106 of the company\u2019s 800 dealers, in 29 states.Black Label models have certain levels of trim and are offered in unique color and fabric combinations. Sales representatives visit customers at their homes or businesses with a sample swatch kit to determine how the car will look inside. Once purchased, Black Label vehicles are picked up and delivered for servicing, and replaced with a loaner car.Lincoln\u2019s theory is that a good sales process continues after the sale, so the company offers additional features to keep customers coming back.One example: The company is also testing a chauffeur service in Miami and San Diego. For $30 an hour, drivers will take customers, in their own vehicles, anywhere they wish to go \u2014 a useful feature for those who can\u2019t drive after doctor\u2019s appointments or a night on the town or simply have too much to do. The chauffeur can also handle shopping trips or pick up the kids at a soccer practice.\u201cIn the Black Label program, we\u2019re getting wealthier, substantially younger customers,\u201d Mr. Galhotra said. \u201cCompared to the mid-50s age for luxury car buyers in general, our Black Label customers are mostly in their 40s.\u201dThat is the kind of program that Mr. Kunkel, creative director at Grayling, a public relations firm based in New York, would have welcomed. He walked out of two dealerships before finding an online price at a third-party website to lease two vehicles and buy a third.\u201cI told the dealer I didn\u2019t want to haggle,\u201d Mr. Kunkel said. \u201cI was not going to buy mudguards. They said they\u2019re a no-haggle dealership.\u201dHe then got the dealership to agree to his price without even stepping through the front door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Killing Obamacare Softly", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe political opportunism behind the Republicans\u2019 determination to undo legislation that makes federally financed health care more broadly available has deep roots.If enacted, Kristol continued,it will relegitimize middle-class dependence for \u201csecurity\u201d on government spending and regulation. It will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates, the Democrats, as the generous protector of middle-class interests.

The Kristol memo captures the reasoning and the philosophy behind the many covert (and overt) Republican attempts to eviscerate Obamacare.the rule would reduce the amount of health care that marketplace plans have to cover. That would allow individual-market insurers to offer plans with higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs than they can now sell through the marketplaces.Most important, according to the center\u2019s analysis, is the covert aspect of the rule which hasthe hidden impact of reducing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s premium tax credits, which help moderate-income marketplace consumers afford health care. As a result, the rule would force millions of families to choose between higher premiums or worse coverage.ruled that the federal government could not withhold Medicaid funding from states that did not expand Medicaid. This had the effect of making the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion optional, which has, in turn, hobbled the ACA\u2019s progress in many states.Faced with more a costly clientele, insurance companies increased premiums. This gave Republicans new ammunition to charge that Obamacare premiums were rising.The assault on the program has continued unabated, including in this recent tweet by Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services:Survey data suggests that Trump may be wrong about whom the public would blame.By nearly 2-1 voters said Trump and Republicans in Congress would be responsible, 59-30, a view shared even by Republicans, 56-35.Anthem declared thatplanning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance, including cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the restoration of taxes on fully insured coverage.Obamacare is clearly collapsing, and we have to step in before more families get hurt. We are on a rescue mission to replace this collapsing law with a better system so that people have lower costs, more choices, and real peace of mind. We need to get this done.Needless to say, a better, cheaper system failed to materialize.He retweeted this @FoxBusiness tweet:The Health and Human Services Department has the legal responsibility for administering the Affordable Care Act, but under Price the department serves as a key administration weapon in efforts to discredit the A.C.A.The Republican defections have embittered Trump.

{"Headline": "Freddie Mac Follows Fannie Mae to Rental Market, With Affordability as Goal", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the government-controlled mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae agreed this year to guarantee a $1 billion financing deal for one of the biggest private-equity-backed landlords in the United States, the move prompted an outcry.Housing advocates and legislators questioned why the landlord, Invitation Homes, which is controlled by the Blackstone Group, needed such low-cost financing, especially on the eve of an initial public offering through which Invitation Homes raised $1.7 billion in net proceeds.Now, Freddie Mac, a rival government-controlled mortgage finance company, is gearing up for its own financing deal. But it is targeting a much different slice of the single-family home-rental market.Freddie Mac wants to provide tens of millions of dollars in financing to midsize landlords, not to giants like Invitation Homes, which operates nearly 50,000 rental homes in 13 markets.In all, Freddie Mac could provide up to $1 billion in financing or loan guarantees to smaller firms that buy single-family homes and operate them as what it considers affordable-housing rentals, a company official said in an interview. Some nonprofit housing groups might also be eligible for financing.\u201cIt is, first and foremost, affordable,\u201d said the official, David D. Leopold, a Freddie Mac vice president for targeted affordable sales and investments. \u201cThe size of the sponsor is less important than affordability.\u201dFreddie Mac is still hashing out many of the details of the plan, but Mr. Leopold said the company hoped to announce the first deal within 90 days.The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, has approved the financing effort on a trial basis. The agency\u2019s view of the single-family rental market has changed since 2012, when it balked at a Freddie Mac plan to provide financing to some buyers of foreclosed homes because of concerns that low-cost loans would hurt banks and might also encourage home-flipping.Still, any specific Freddie Mac transaction would need the agency\u2019s approval, just as Fannie Mae\u2019s deal with Invitation Homes did.The approach being taken by Freddie Mac is in part a response to criticism of Fannie Mae\u2019s deal to provide a guarantee to investors in the 10-year, $1 billion loan that Wells Fargo provided to Invitation Homes and will securitize. The loan is backed by about 7,000 rental homes.But the strategy also stems from a growing consensus among housing policy makers and landlords that both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae should play roles in providing financing to single-family home operators. The market has grown since the collapse of housing prices a decade ago touched off the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and led to more than six million completed foreclosures.There are now about 17 million homes being rented, up from 11 million in 2007. About 300,000 of those rentals are operated by Invitation Homes and other big Wall Street-backed firms that sprouted up after the crisis like American Homes 4 Rent, Colony Starwood Homes and Pretium Partners.The vast majority of rentals are still managed by mom-and-pop operators who own a small number of homes. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have long provided financing to small investors. But financing has been hard to come by for nonprofit housing groups and midsize investor landlords who have had to rely mainly on private-equity-backed firms for financing.\u201cThere is no doubt they want to be in this space, and I think they should be in this space,\u201d said Julia Gordon, the executive director of the National Community Stabilization Trust, which oversees a program that helps housing organizations across the country get the first chance at buying foreclosed homes from banks.\u201cFreddie seems to want to distinguish itself from Fannie,\u201d she added.The push into single-rental housing by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae comes amid a debate over the future of the two companies, which the federal government bailed out in 2008 and placed in a government conservatorship at the height of the crisis. The main mission of both is to maintain the viability of the 30-year mortgage by ensuring such loans against default and then packaging them into mortgage-backed securities.The Federal Housing Finance Agency is also prodding the two mortgage finance giants to do more to actively support the rental market for single-family homes.\u201cF.H.F.A. has authorized both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to explore single-family rental transactions on a very limited basis,\u201d Corinne Russell, an agency spokeswoman, said. \u201cThese transactions will help the enterprises test, and learn about, the market.\u201dFannie Mae declined to comment. Claire Parker, an Invitation Homes spokeswoman, said the loan was consistent with Fannie Mae\u2019s mission to promote rental housing.\u201cThe reality is that housing needs are evolving, and single-family leasing can very often represent a better and more affordable option for families,\u201d Ms. Parker said.John O\u2019Callaghan, the president of the Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership, which has rehabilitated homes in the Atlanta area, said he would prefer that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide financing to organizations like his that work to create affordable rentals and, sometimes, to resell those homes to local families.\u201cOur No. 1 goal is to allow neighborhoods that have had homeownership stripped out of them to have it returned,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Callaghan, who also participated in the housing finance agency conference.Advertisement"}

The surge of enthusiasm across the United States and Europe for candidates offering clear, strong messages suggests that, if anything, the Democratic Party must reaffirm its commitment to economic and social justice, even as it seeks to speak to the needs and interests of rural citizens, the struggling lower middle class, the laboring poor, etc. Bedrock values, not election strategies, are vital if Democrats want voters to turn back toward the party.These values must include decent health care for all; safe streets for Americans of all identities; environmental policies that combat climate change; decent schools and access to affordable college-level education; an economic system that distributes rewards broadly; a humane immigration system; and an unwavering commitment to the civil rights of all Americans, especially those historically marginalized.The Democrats must stand for something worth fighting for. Centrism as imagined in this article failed in the last election and will continue to fail.The writer is an associate professor in the history department at the University of Michigan.To the Editor:I don\u2019t believe that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were elected and re-elected because of their positioning on the ideological spectrum. I would suggest that their political success and general popularity were more a matter of personality, a certain quality that my generation regarded as \u201ccool.\u201dThis is important for a couple of reasons. First, the Democrats need to stop putting forth candidates who seem like that kid in fifth grade who sat in the front row and always knew all the answers: Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton. Voters across the political spectrum prefer the ones who seem like that kid who sat in the back row and threw spitballs: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Donald Trump.Second, the notion that progressives should alter their core beliefs to gain traction with voters is a symptom of what is wrong with our politics. Should we ease off on demands for gun control? Should we turn our backs on the L.G.B.T. community? What about accepting desperate refugees into our country? We must stand by our principles while nominating candidates who can win.To the Editor:Kudos to Mark Penn and Andrew Stein. Unfortunately, the party hasn\u2019t learned from its past. The first presidential election in which I could vote was in 1972. The Democratic Convention that year was very contentious, with great factional differences between left-leaning and centrist groups. Mayor John Lindsay of New York summed it up at the time when he said, \u201cThis party seems to have an instinct for suicide.\u201dHopefully, the party will come to its senses in time for the 2018 and 2020 elections and move solidly to the center, where the bulk of the Democratic and independent voters are. If not, the country is ripe for the formation of a centrist third party.To the Editor:Mark Penn and Andrew Stein, harking back to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, are invoking the wrong practical role models for today\u2019s Democrats. The deepest potential sources of raw Democratic power are rooted in Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, which brought his party sustained success at the polls over many election cycles.F.D.R. managed this strategic feat by concentrating on the broad rights of workers while, often callously, ignoring the moral imperatives of identity politics, though the latter reached existential proportions during his presidency. Roosevelt established Social Security, created government-funded jobs, empowered labor unions and pushed marginal upper-income tax rates for the rich beyond anything remotely imaginable in 2017. At the same time, he placated Dixiecrats by turning a blind eye to Jim Crow, and he mollified nativists by allowing immigration quotas to keep doomed European Jews, among them my own relatives, away from our shores.Economic justice is a unifying theme for the long haul, pulling together the majoritarian power of numbers against plutocrats, even though for \u201cpragmatic\u201d reasons some legitimately aggrieved minority interests may be obscenely sacrificed.To the Editor:Mark Penn and Andrew Stein offer a breathtaking example of Orwellian doublespeak and historical rewriting for their own ends. Clintonian centrism offers nothing to working-class voters other than what got them into the crises in which they have found themselves in the past quarter century.The Democratic Party establishment, which anointed Hillary Clinton before the campaign began, seems unable to comprehend much of anything about American culture beyond the urban centers of the West Coast, the northern half of the East Coast, and about four other states. This is a big, diverse country, with a long history of politics and politicians who were forced to adapt their policies to a broad-based electorate.Much of the news media, which consistently diminished or denigrated Bernie Sanders with adjectives such as \u201cgrumpy,\u201d \u201cold\u201d and \u201ccrabby,\u201d enabled and supported that myopia because of their own insularity and disrespect for rural dwellers and the working class.Mrs. Clinton was one of the most unpopular Democrats in modern history, and one of the few Democrats who could have lost to Donald Trump. The Clintonian wing of the Democratic Party ultimately brought us Mr. Trump. If left in command, it will pave the way for Ted Cruz and others of his and Mr. Trump\u2019s ilk. So go ahead, loyal Democrats, keep thinking that the Russians did it or that you can ignore most of the country. Forget about the party\u2019s roots in the policies of F.D.R., J.F.K. and L.B.J.

That is what Donald Trump portrayed, though it was a false authenticity \u2014 where are the jobs he promised, and what does he know of health care?Democrats should demonstrate the real concern for the middle class that they actually feel, and stop allowing the Republicans to falsely define them. They should work with Republicans to finance infrastructure projects on a grand scale, jointly sponsor legislation to limit prison sentences for minor drug offenses, and come up with a plan to fix Obamacare, adding enrollee incentives to limit overuse.For now, stop worrying about who gets the credit. The public is not stupid. Address the issues that matter most to the greatest number. The Republican dance in Washington will fade when the tune changes.MARY MCLEOD, ST. PAULTo the Editor:Mark Penn and Andrew Stein want the Democratic Party to double down on the strategy that has brought it to its lowest point of power in a century.

{"Headline": "Rahm Emanuel: In Chicago, the Trains Actually Run on Time", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCHICAGO \u2014 On Thursday, in the wake of a subway derailment and an epidemic of train delays, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York declared a state of emergency for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the busiest mass transit system in America. That same day, the nation\u2019s third-busiest system \u2014 the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \u2014 handed out coupons for free coffee to riders stuck in the second year of slowdowns caused by repairs to prevent chronic fires.Meanwhile, in Chicago, a recent survey found that 85 percent of passengers are satisfied with service on our transit system, the nation\u2019s second most used.The L, Chicago\u2019s system, turned 125 this year. The elevated railway began as four wooden cars powered by coal and steam. Last year, more than 238 million rides were taken on the system, which, unlike the ones in New York and Washington, has not been troubled by systemic failures, breakdowns and delays. Even during a 28-day stretch of arctic temperatures in 2014, the L was never interrupted.How have we done it? First, we put reliability ahead of expansion. We focused relentlessly on modernizing tracks, signals, switches, stations and cars before extending lines to new destinations. Unlike New York, which has spent billions to reach Hudson Yards, or Washington, which has concentrated on trying to reach Dulles Airport (both laudable projects), Chicago has improved the existing system.Today, four of our seven rail lines are being completely rebuilt. By 2019, 40 stations will be reconstructed or brand new, and half of our tracks will be new. Chicago is the largest city in North America to offer 4G wireless throughout its system, and last month we broke ground on a factory that will manufacture the most modern fleet of rail cars in the country, the first cars to be built in Chicago since the historic Pullman factory closed in 1982.When the L\u2019s $8.5 billion modernization is complete, Chicago will be able to run about 15 more trains every hour on our busiest lines, cut 10 minutes off a trip from downtown to O\u2019Hare Airport and have trains run as fast as 55 m.p.h.Second, our management structure works. Chicago riders have closer contact with the person whose job it is to make the trains run on time: the mayor. In New York City, it is the governor in Albany. In Washington, it is an agency consisting of officials from the city, two states and the federal government.While there is no one-size-fits-all model, I am confident local control is essential to Chicago\u2019s transit success. It strengthens accountability, focuses priorities and ensures the people most directly affected by decisions have more of a voice in making those tough decisions.But even though we\u2019re doing our best, Chicago \u2014 like every municipal transit authority \u2014 needs federal support.Rather than tweeting about violence in Chicago, President Trump should be looking to Chicago as a model for the infrastructure investments and economic growth he wants to replicate across the country. Instead of embarking on his wrongheaded plan to privatize infrastructure construction, he should expand existing programs that have used local-federal partnerships to build transportation systems.Chicago has modernized its system thanks in part to the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s Core Capacity Improvement Program, which funds upgrades to existing corridors that are at or over capacity today, or will be in five years. Congress should double funding for the program to allow America\u2019s busiest mass transit systems to meet rising demand. It should also expand the low-interest federal infrastructure loans that have helped Chicago to rebuild rail lines and airports, and to create the downtown Riverwalk.And Washington should increase the portion of the Highway Trust Fund that supports mass transit to 25 percent, while also raising the gas tax by 10 cents. Yes, Americans would pay more at the pump, but it is a smarter alternative than the Trump administration\u2019s privatization plan, under which we will all pay more in tolls and fees to the private investors who would own our roads and bridges.Finally, local governments should look to innovative financing mechanisms like special taxing districts, known as TIFs \u2014 an idea Chicago borrowed from New York \u2014 to use growth in property taxes to finance transit improvements. Today we are using TIFs to match federal resources and modernize Chicago\u2019s busiest rail lines.Cities with reliable, modern mass transit are more economically competitive, have higher productivity, fewer carbon emissions and a better quality of life. And as we have seen in Chicago, mass transit not only connects people to opportunities, it also fuels growth. Modernizing our existing mass transit is one reason Chicago\u2019s economy has expanded faster than the economies of New York and Washington, and faster than the national average for the last five years.When Chicago\u2019s elevated train first soared above the streets and between the skyscrapers 125 years ago, it captured the imagination of Americans and visitors from around the world who rode its wooden cars to the 1893 World\u2019s Fair. It\u2019s a lesson for us all: The only way to keep a city moving is to invest in its future.Rahm Emanuel is the mayor of Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Predictably, China\u2019s Year-on-Year Growth Maintains Its Steady Pace", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Leave it to other countries to soar and swoon in their quarterly economic performance. China prefers a steady pace, at least in its officially reported data.On Monday, the country announced that its economy had expanded 6.9 percent in the second quarter, unchanged from the year-on-year growth rate in the first quarter.What keeps the growth rate of the Chinese economy so smooth? Accounting sleight of hand may play some role. Studies over the years have found that China\u2019s national statisticians appear to overstate growth during periods of economic weakness and understate growth when the economy is booming. A series of recent scandals, particularly in China\u2019s northeast, have also indicated that local officials may overreport economic activity to Beijing when local industries like coal mining and steel production run into difficulty.China said on Friday afternoon that it was revising its economic output data to take better account of fast-growing sectors like intellectual property, health care, tourism and so-called emerging industries. But Xing Zhihong, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said on Monday morning that this was a continuing project that had not been applied to the second-quarter growth statistics.China\u2019s consistent growth also reflects the government\u2019s constant intervention as officials try to reach predetermined targets for the country\u2019s economy \u2014 currently 6.5 percent growth or better.The biggest reason the Chinese economy keeps growing quickly is that the state-controlled banking system keeps pouring in loans, although the government began tapering the flow slightly during the second quarter.Total social financing plus bonds, the broadest measure of credit, expanded 14.7 percent in June compared with the same month a year earlier. In most countries, that would be a breathtaking pace. But in China, it was actually a slight slowdown: Credit was up 15.3 percent in May from a year earlier.The Communist Party Congress, which is held once every five years and chooses the country\u2019s top leadership, will be in midautumn. So China\u2019s leaders have been eager to keep the economy growing briskly at least until then.While a sizable chunk of China\u2019s economy may depend these days on building roads and rail lines into the desert using borrowed money, industrial production and services are also strong.Steel demand has been vigorous, especially in residential construction. Housing prices have surged in the past 15 months, ever since the government decided during a period of economic weakness in early 2016 to make it much easier for families to borrow for home buying. Some of the biggest cities, like Beijing, have recently tried to curb real estate speculation with administrative limits, but these rules have had limited effect, as credit has stayed plentiful. Overall industrial production rose 7.6 percent in June from a year earlier, the government announced on Monday morning, an unexpectedly faster tempo than May\u2019s 6.5 percent.Year-on-year growth in retail sales accelerated to 11 percent in June from 10.7 percent in May, while fixed-asset investment also picked up speed in June.Part of China\u2019s economic health in the second quarter reflected robust exports, with demand beginning to recover in Europe and particularly the United States after a long period of depressed growth. But what counts in the overall economy is not the value of the exports but whether the trade surplus narrows or widens. In that respect, there were a few clouds on China\u2019s horizon.China\u2019s imports rose 14.5 percent in the second quarter from the same period last year as prices soared for iron ore and other raw materials essential to Chinese manufacturing. Chinese exports rose only 9.1 percent in the second quarter.The composition of Chinese exports also changed in ways that could intensify trade friction and affect China\u2019s trade surplus. China is becoming even more dependent on exports to the United States, with sales reaching their second-highest level ever last month, trailing only September 2015.Chinese imports from the United States have also risen, but most of the extra purchases have been oil and other raw materials, which create many fewer jobs than manufacturing.President Trump promised during his campaign to create more American jobs through a more confrontational approach on trade toward China. But since taking office, he has focused more heavily on addressing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and on very narrow trade talks involving industries like steel manufacturing and beef production.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

It sits on a lot of almost an acre, along with an early 20th-century barn used as an atelier; a building for drying hops from 1926; and a stone rotunda used as a bedroom. The farmstead was renovated between 1989 and 1993 by the current owner, Dagmar Brezinova.The furniture, much of it antiques, is included in the asking price. The first floor has an office and a bedroom overlooking the village green. Nearby is a kitchen, two bathrooms and a utility room with a new biofuel stove. Beyond is a dining room for 12 people and a second kitchen, a stone fireplace and doors opening to the garden. Walls, mostly painted white, are stone and brick; the floors, windows and the staircase, generally pine. The kitchens have wooden countertops, glass-fronted storage cabinets and basic appliances.A portion of the second floor is taken up by an apartment with two bedrooms and a bathroom. The apartment faces the green and is furnished with a Biedermeier-period sofa and armchairs. The rest of the second floor contains two bedrooms, one with an outdoor staircase to the garden, and two bathrooms. The ceilings of one bedroom and a bathroom are made with traditional rounded beams.The old hops building has a porch for alfresco dining with a large fireplace and a bar. The property is landscaped with mature nut and cherry trees, along with a pond with waterfowl.Racice, a village of about 300 people, has taverns, shops, restaurants and supermarkets within a 10-minute drive. There are many castles in the region, along with trails for cycling, tennis courts, fishing, horseback riding and a small airport, Ms. Brezinova said. Racice is 50 minutes by car from Prague\u2019s center and an hour from an international airport. It is also an important center for rowing and flat-water canoeing.\u201cWe\u2019ve celebrated the victories of many Czech Olympic sportsmen, canoeists, rowers and others\u201d at the farmstead, Ms. Brezinova said.The housing market in Prague is robust, with well-priced homes in good locations often selling in a matter of weeks, often with multiple bidders, said Tomas Blahuta, a senior property consultant at Svoboda & Williams, which has the listing for this house.\u201cDue to the limited supply and the lack of new developments in Prague for bureaucratic reasons, prices have been growing in almost every location, sometimes a double-digit increase year-on-year,\u201d Mr. Blahuta said.The market is driven by a low unemployment rate, wage growth, low interest rates and the availability of mortgages that, until recently, financed up to 100 percent of a home purchase, said Blanka Vackova, the head of research at JLL Czech Republic, a real estate agency.\u201cFor foreign buyers, the Czech Republic and Prague represent a safe and stable political and economic environment with a high standard of living,\u201d she said.Demand for homes may slow this year because of imposition of stricter rules for obtaining mortgages, along with a change that shifts the 4 percent property transfer tax from the seller to the buyer, Ms. Vackova said.Still, constraints on new development may limit supply and help keep prices high, said Peter Visnovsky, the director of the real estate agency Lexxus.\u201cWhen we talk about the midrange market, you can buy a newly built one-bedroom apartment for $200,000, and a two-bedroom apartment for $260,000, including parking place and taxes,\u201d Mr. Visnovsky said.The average price of a home in Prague is about 65,000 to 75,000 koruna per square meter, or about $266 to $307 per square foot, Mr. Blahuta said. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a real push on prices lately with new homes and apartments trading above 100,000 koruna per square meter,\u201d or about $409 per square foot, he said.Foreign home buyers typically account for about 15 percent of the sales over all, and are more numerous at the upper end of the market, Mr. Visnovsky said.They tend to look for homes in and near the historic center, brokers said, including areas like Old Town, Lesser Town, the Castle District and Vinohrady.The majority of foreign buyers come from Russia, Ukraine, European Union countries, Britain and the United States, brokers said. Smaller groups include Vietnamese and Chinese people who are running businesses in the country, said Lucie Mekhail, a senior consultant with JLL Czech Republic.The Czech Republic is a member of the European Union, though it still uses the koruna. Since 2011, there have been no restrictions on foreign homeownership.\u201cHowever, since the administration process is quite extensive and done fully in Czech, we recommend to have a local agent deal with the acquisition process,\u201d Mr. Blahuta said.Many home buyers hire a lawyer, and fees for legal advice start at 2,000 koruna an hour, or $88, reaching 5,000 koruna, or $220, an hour \u2014 higher for an international law firm, Mr. Blahuta said.Closing costs include a 4 percent transfer tax paid by the buyer. Mortgages are available from Czech banks, which may finance up to 80 or 85 percent of the purchase for foreign buyers, brokers said.Czech Republic government site: vlada.czCzech; koruna (1 koruna = $0.044)The annual property taxes on this house are 3,000 koruna, or about $132.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toshiba Resumes Talks Over Contentious Sale of Microchip Unit", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba, the struggling Japanese technology conglomerate, has been locked for months in a complex dance over the sale of its $18 billion microchip business. In a series of dizzying turns, Western Digital, the American data-storage company, has acted as a supportive business partner, a would-be acquirer and a bitter legal adversary.Toshiba said on Thursday that it had resumed talks with other bidders. It previously rejected deals with Western Digital and Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer.Toshiba\u2019s announcement on Thursday came on the eve of an arbitration hearing in the dispute with Western Digital, with a hefty prize at stake: Whichever eventually wins control of the microchip unit will become a major player in NAND flash memory, the technology used to store data in millions of cellphones and digital devices.Last month, Toshiba said it would sell a stake in the unit to a consortium of investors from Japan, the United States and South Korea, anchored by financial firms with close links to the Japanese government. The group includes the American buyout firm Bain Capital and the South Korean technology company SK Hynix.But on Thursday, Toshiba said in an emailed statement that because it had not reached a final agreement with the buyers it selected last month for the NAND business, \u201cwe have started discussion with other suitors.\u201dThat has left the door open for Western Digital, which has seized the opportunity to press ahead with its own bid, made in partnership with the American investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.Western Digital this week raised the value of its offer for Toshiba\u2019s microchip unit, though precise terms were not disclosed.Legal maneuvering has added to the difficulties in the sale process.SanDisk, a subsidiary of Western Digital, is co-owner with Toshiba of a NAND production operation in Japan. Western Digital argues that its joint venture agreements with Toshiba prohibit the Japanese company from selling the microchip business without its consent.That contention had given Western Digital an edge in the bidding, but at the cost of poisoning relations with Toshiba. A year ago, the two companies were celebrating an expansion of their joint production operation in Japan: Now they are fighting each other in multiple lawsuits.Western Digital won the first round of the legal battle this week. A court in California ordered Toshiba to ensure that SanDisk employees could have access to databases and other shared assets at the Japanese operation. Toshiba had been threatening to shut them out.Toshiba, saying Western Digital is unfairly interfering in the sale process, is countersuing for about $1 billion.A separate legal round is scheduled to begin on Friday, this time at the International Court of Arbitration. The tribunal, operated by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, adjudicates corporate disputes. Analysts say the prospect of a third party deciding the deal\u2019s fate could pressure both sides to come to terms.The deal with the consortium, meanwhile, is complicated by the role of SK Hynix.Some officials in Japan were said to be concerned that SK Hynix might scoop up Toshiba\u2019s NAND manufacturing technology for itself, so Toshiba initially suggested that the South Korean company provide only debt financing for the deal. Limiting it to the status of a creditor, rather than a direct owner, would keep it at an arm\u2019s length from Toshiba\u2019s business secrets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says He Has Signed More Bills Than Any President, Ever. He Hasn\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To hear President Trump tell it, his first six months in the White House should be judged in part by the legislation he has signed into law.On Monday, he went even further, claiming to have bested all of his predecessors in turning bills into law.\u201cWe\u2019ve signed more bills \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about through the legislature \u2014 than any president, ever,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a \u201cMade in America\u201d event at the White House. \u201cFor a while, Harry Truman had us. And now, I think, we have everybody.\u201dTurning to Vice President Mike Pence, he added an aside about news media fact-checkers: \u201cI better say \u2018think\u2019; otherwise they will give you a Pinocchio. And I don\u2019t like Pinocchios.\u201dIn fact, as he approaches six months in office on Thursday, Mr. Trump is slightly behind the\u00a0lawmaking\u00a0pace for the\u00a0past six presidents, who as a group\u00a0signed an\u00a0average\u00a0of\u00a043 bills during the same period. And an analysis of the bills Mr. Trump\u00a0signed shows that about half were minor and inconsequential, passed by Congress with little debate.\u00a0Among recent presidents, both the total number of bills he signed and the legislation\u2019s substance make Mr. Trump about average.President Jimmy Carter signed 70 bills in the first six months, according to an analysis of bills signed by previous White House occupants. Bill Clinton signed 50. George W. Bush signed 20 bills into law. Barack Obama signed 39 bills during the period, including an $800 billion stimulus program to confront an economic disaster, legislation to make it easier for women to sue for equal pay, a bill to give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco and an expansion of the federal health insurance program for children.Mr. Trump has signed several significant bills, many in the works on Capitol Hill since well before he arrived in the Oval Office, as is often the case for new presidents. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies point to a\u00a0bill\u00a0he\u00a0signed\u00a0to improve accountability and overhaul services at the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department. They note that the president signed into law spending plans that will significantly raise federal expenditures on the military and border security. And they say Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress worked to methodically reduce the burden of government regulation.\u201cThese repeal bills are now law, which means those Obama regulations have been struck from the books\u00a0\u2014\u00a0forever,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said recently.And legislation is not the only tool presidents can wield to enact their agendas. His aides note that Mr. Trump has used executive orders, such as his ban on travel to the United States for refugees and those living in some Muslim countries, to get around what they say is unprecedented obstruction by Democrats. And he successfully won confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.But almost half the other bills Mr. Trump has signed into law are ceremonial or routine.\u00a0The president includes in his count laws like the one to rename the federal courthouse in Nashville after\u00a0Fred Thompson, the\u00a0actor and former senator who died in 2015. Even the Republican leadership in the Senate does not count those kinds\u00a0of bills when they tally their legislative achievements.By contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s tally\u00a0includes three laws to appoint members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents, another\u00a0to seek research into better weather reports, and one to require the Department of Homeland Security to manage its fleet of\u00a0vehicles\u00a0more efficiently.Marc Short, the president\u2019s top legislative adviser, acknowledged that no one would try to claim that renaming a building should be considered \u201clandmark legislation.\u201d But he defended the president\u2019s repeated promotion of the bills he has signed into law.\u201cIt\u2019s a response to a lot of media coverage that has tried to downplay what he\u2019s accomplished,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cThere\u2019s an overarching coverage about what\u2019s not been accomplished. The president is trying to point out what we actually have done.\u201dMr. Trump has\u00a0signed two budget bills\u00a0that would be required of any president. He signed a law largely endorsing the budget for NASA that Mr. Obama had laid out. And Mr. Trump temporarily extended Mr. Obama\u2019s program that gives veterans a choice of seeing a private doctor in certain cases.Mr. Trump may yet assemble a more far-reaching legislative record. Getting comprehensive legislation through Congress and to the president\u2019s desk takes time, even when the president\u2019s party controls both chambers of Congress. By the end of his tenure, Mr. Bush had signed major tax cuts, expanded surveillance with the Patriot Act,\u00a0authorized votes to wage war,\u00a0overhauled federal education laws, established free-trade deals\u00a0and expanded Medicare to include prescription drugs. Mr. Obama eventually passed the Affordable Care Act and imposed new rules on financial services firms. Roosevelt created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority,\u00a0enacted\u00a0Social Security and\u00a0started public works projects in response to the Great Depression,\u00a0and began farm subsidies.But for him to compile major legislative achievements will take time, said David R. Mayhew, a professor of political science at Yale who tracks the legislative achievements of American presidents.\u201cGenerally speaking, Congress needs many months to do something big,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump frequently points to his work on behalf of veterans, who supported him by almost two to one over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, as evidence of his legislative success. At a recent rally on behalf of military families, Mr. Trump bragged that he had signed legislation that \u201cwent through the House, went through the Senate, and I signed it really fast.\u201dJohn Hoellwarth, the\u00a0national\u00a0communications\u00a0director for Amvets, called the new law \u201ca positive step\u201d but said it was a small part of overall improvements at the department that had been put in place, slowly, for years.\u201cA lot of the things that are moving the Department of Veterans Affairs in the right direction actually got underway before the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Hoellwarth said, noting that Mr. Trump had appointed a former Obama administration official to be his secretary of veterans affairs.Another bill that Mr. Trump signed extended an Obama-era program that allows some veterans to see private doctors, and streamlined the way their deductibles and co-pays get processed. The law is essentially an accounting maneuver intended to give lawmakers more time to debate more substantive changes.A third new law allows community policing grants to be used to hire and train veterans to be officers.Since\u00a0becoming\u00a0law in 1996, the Congressional Review Act has allowed presidents to use legislation to roll back his predecessor\u2019s regulations. But until Mr. Trump took office, that power had been used only once \u2014 by Mr. Bush, who reversed a rule on workplace injuries.\u00a0Working with the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Trump has used it 15 times to unravel what he said were overly burdensome regulations imposed on Americans and businesses.Collectively, the 15 regulatory laws may represent the president\u2019s broadest legislative impact, though they are less about doing things and more about undoing them. Signing the bills into law allowed the president, with the flick of a pen, to erase rules on the environment, labor, financial protections, internet privacy, abortion, education and gun rights.\u201cThat\u2019s saving about $18 billion a year in compliance costs,\u201d Mr. Short said, including the impact of the president\u2019s executive orders that seek to reverse regulations. \u201cWe think they are a huge part of the economic success of the first six months.\u201dBut Mr. Trump can no longer use the tool.The review act gives presidents and lawmakers 60 legislative days to rapidly roll back major regulations put in place by a previous administration. That deadline has passed. If Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers want to overturn any more Obama-era regulations, they will have to do it through the normal\u00a0lawmaking\u00a0or regulatory processes, which can take years.Mr. Trump signed legislation that approved nearly $20 billion in spending for NASA, keeping its financing level almost unchanged from Mr. Obama\u2019s budget. The budget would allow NASA to pursue sending\u00a0humans to Mars during the next two decades, and would continue work on rockets that have long been in development.As a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to wage an all-out assault on the federal bureaucracy. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s senior strategist, has promised a daily fight for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative assault\u00a0has moved slowly. The four bills designed to improve government functions that he has signed into law since taking office have made only\u00a0small\u00a0tweaks.In addition to signing two budget bills, Mr. Trump signed a bill to improve processing of pension benefits for police officers. And he signed a dozen routine or ceremonial bills that attracted little attention.When Mr. Trump nominated\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Jim Mattis to be secretary of defense, he needed Congress to pass a law waiving the prohibition against appointing a defense secretary within seven years of\u00a0the nominee\u2019s retirement\u00a0from\u00a0active duty in the military.Mr. Trump signed that bill into law, too.Michael D.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Softening Ticket Sales Are Drawing Hollywood\u2019s Focus", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 All year, Hollywood executives have been brushing aside worries about box-office stagnation in the United States and Canada by pointing to strong ticket sales in China.Ticket sales for imported films in China are up 34 percent this year, to roughly $2.3 billion, according to the Beijing research firm EntGroup. Look at Paramount\u2019s \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight.\u201d That sequel managed only $45 million in its opening weekend in North America, but it took in $120 million in China.On closer look, however, the rosy picture doesn\u2019t quite hold up, underscoring why Hollywood has recently been pushing so hard for film-related concessions from the Chinese government.New data from comScore, a Virginia-based analytics firm, indicates that Hollywood is having a tough time in China. From Jan. 1 to June 30, Chinese cinemas played 24 movies from Hollywood, generating $1.76 billion in ticket sales. In the same period a year earlier, the country let in 22 Hollywood movies, which collected about $1.73 billion.So as they scratch for growth, studios like 20th Century Fox and Universal have been scrambling to position themselves as bigger players in China, where the number of movie screens has increased to more than 40,600 from 12,407 in 2012. The accounting firm PwC recently estimated that China would have roughly 80,377 screens by 2021 \u2014 double the number in the United States.But analysts say studios are facing systemic challenges in the country, including a slowing overall economy. Chinese moviegoers are also growing more discerning; film quality is increasingly important. Movie theaters in China may also be hurt as streaming services proliferate. More than 80 million people in the country now pay to watch video online, a 32 percent increase from last year, according to Analysys, a Beijing research firm.American movie executives are also pushing for shorter blackout periods, which China uses to promote local films, and longer marketing windows; under the current setup, Hollywood studios are given only about a month to mount advertising campaigns for their movies.\u201cThat\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d Mr. Rosen said, referring to more advance notice. (China controls the release dates.)Hollywood also wants to receive a bigger portion of ticket sales. Studios receive about 50 percent of box-office revenue in the United States, but China allows foreign companies to receive only a 25 percent cut. Studios have asked for closer to 40 percent.Mr. Rosen said negotiations over revised film terms, taking place between Chinese officials and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, could drag into next year. He noted that the Communist Party\u2019s 19th Party Congress will take place in Beijing in the fall.\u201cI would be very, very surprised if anything was in place related to Hollywood before that,\u201d Mr. Rosen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "View From the River Caf\u00e9: 40 Years of Feasts and Firsts", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis beloved nautical institution \u2014 it is not really floating, but sits atop an underwater pier \u2014 was conceived in one of New York City\u2019s bleakest hours, and its startling success infused life, and hope, into a decaying waterfront bereft of both. In the years since, it has weathered storms, recessions and other perils of a fickle town and a flood-prone setting.This summer the River Caf\u00e9 turns 40. For any restaurant in the city to achieve middle age is no small triumph. Yet the cafe, with its mesmerizing views of the churning East River and Lower Manhattan, is noteworthy on other fronts.\u201cCodfish cheeks,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keeffe added to the list. \u201cI\u2019m a fisherman, and I knew how good they were way back then.\u201dThe cafe was among the first major restaurants in the United States to promote varietal wines from leading California producers like Opus One, Jordan Wine Estate, Dominus Estate and others. Its California collection remains vast.The cafe\u2019s early success also ignited a commercial revival in a nearly deserted neighborhood that is known today as Dumbo \u2014 a seductive flame to waves of entrepreneurial moths.If not for the canine persistence of Mr. O\u2019Keeffe, the cafe would never have made an East River beachhead.After graduation from Fordham University and a hitch as an Army intelligence specialist in Massachusetts and South Carolina (\u201cI spent my time watching the Russians\u201d), Mr. O\u2019Keeffe seized the opportunity to purchase an undistinguished bar on the Upper East Side for $10,000. Rechristened Pudding\u2019s, it opened on St. Patrick\u2019s Day in 1966 and was an instant success.In the mid-1960s, as New York\u2019s commercial port was hemorrhaging business to more economical and modern rivals on the East Coast, the Brooklyn waterfront was in steady decline. The seed for a waterside restaurant was planted one day while Mr. O\u2019Keeffe was riding in a car along the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. As it reached the Brooklyn Bridge, he looked down and exclaimed, \u201cOh, my God!\u2019\u201d\u201cWe took the exit down to the shoreline,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect for building.\u201dThe city-owned parcel was not, however, perfect for financing. \u201cEvery bank in New York turned me down,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keeffe said. Undeterred, he sought money elsewhere, finding it at a New Jersey bank.Perhaps as compensation for his monklike patience, the city leased Mr. O\u2019Keeffe the land at a \u201crock-bottom\u201d price, he said \u2014 so low, in fact, that he insisted it be tripled. \u201cI was concerned there might be political problems at some point about me getting a favor,\u201d he said. Construction of the cafe began in 1976 and cost less than $1 million.If you spend an hour in Mr. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s presence, it becomes evident why he put such time and effort into creating the cafe. He is enamored of all things maritime, going back to his childhood in the Silver Beach neighborhood of the Bronx, a thumb-shape peninsula where the East River meets Long Island Sound.He sits on the board of the Waterfront Alliance, a private harbor advocacy and education organization. Late-night diners at the cafe may spot him standing on a deck, casting for striped bass.From the outset Mr. O\u2019Keeffe wanted the cafe to be \u201ca fine American restaurant with professional service that was not uptight.\u201dThis may not seem a revolutionary concept until you put it in context. In the mid-1970s, fine dining in New York, with few exceptions, meant French dining. The cafe was, and is, a reflection of the owner\u2019s cultivated tastes: a handcrafted mahogany topped bar, custom-made mirrors from a local artisan, Georgian antiques, crimson velvet-and-leather banquettes and bronze portholes punctuating one wall.Tall, spare and urbane, Mr. O\u2019Keeffe, who said he is in his late 70s, wears handsomely tailored suits, custom-made shirts, tasteful silk ties, horn-rimmed glasses and the impish expression of someone holding back a humorous anecdote for the perfect moment (and there are plenty of them).He is not a finger snapping, larger-than-life owner host. Every evening he makes the rounds in the dining room, so quietly and inconspicuously that many guests may mistake him for the sommelier.Mr. O\u2019Keeffe maintains that fine dining is a compact of mutual respect. If a gentleman arrives without a suit jacket, one is provided. If a guest\u2019s comportment is deemed inappropriate, it is noticed.The cafe is a special-occasion restaurant that does not feel like a special-occasion restaurant. Javier Rodriguez, who has worked there for 17 years, mostly overseeing the dining room, pointed out that on any given night, six to 10 couples become engaged there. The number of birthday and anniversary dinners is incalculable.\u201cBut you are not aware of any of this,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez pointed out. \u201cThere is no singing \u2018Happy Birthday,\u2019 or anything like that.\u201dIn the restaurant\u2019s menus over the years, Mr. O\u2019Keeffe has remained generally faithful to the American theme. At the same time he remains unburdened by culinary dogmas that would constrain his chefs. Above all, the River Caf\u00e9 is about ingredients.\u201cOther restaurant owners are all about food costs,\u201d said Mr. Steelman, the current chef. \u201cWith Buzzy it is no holds barred; we always get the best.\u201d Almost daily there are blind tastings of food products: eggs, fowl, beef, fish, berries, even snails. Mr. O\u2019Keeffe is passionate about coffee, sampling up to two dozen varieties a month.When Mr. Forgione took over the kitchen in 1979, he cast a wide net in pursuit of superior American products: Peconic Bay scallops, Michigan morels, New Jersey tomatoes, Belon oysters from Maine and New York State venison. Owing to Mr. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s acquaintanceship with the Rockefellers, the cafe had first dibs whenever the deer population was thinned out at the estate in Westchester County. When Mr. O\u2019Keeffe decided to feature fresh Florida stone crabs, he initiated a search for a reliable supplier.\u201cWe wound up hiring the fisherman who was the least drunk,\u201d he deadpanned.Chefs who hold diplomas from the cafe regard their tenures as transformative experiences. \u201cFor a young American chef, it was a wonderful place to be,\u201d said Mr. Palmer, the second chef, who now owns 18 restaurants nationwide.\u201cWe were these young renegade chefs who had all kinds of ideas about what we wanted to do,\u201d he added, \u201cand Buzzy created the environment for us to do it.\u201dOn Mr. Burke\u2019s menu in the late 1980s were startling \u201cAmerican\u201d conflations like cinnamon-smoked quail with apple ravioli, pecan-black-pepper consomm\u00e9 and quail eggs; and sea bream with asparagus saffron broth garnished with lotus chips. He was given full license to experiment, which in his case was like handing a teenager the keys to a Ferrari showroom.\u201cAt one point, I had 24 desserts on the menu,\u201d he said with a laugh.While Mr. Steelman\u2019s food doesn\u2019t have the dramatic flair of Mr. Burke\u2019s, it remains creative and often surprising, somewhat global, and focused on American provender. The current menu carries items like a chargrilled Niman Ranch strip steak with bone marrow duchess potato and red wine mushroom marmalade; and grilled Pacific Chinook salmon with Meyer lemon, aromatic jasmine rice and shiitake-miso consomm\u00e9. (The cafe\u2019s prix fixe menu is $125 a person; a six-course tasting menu is $155.)As ever, the main attraction \u2014 and sometimes, the biggest challenge \u2014 is the river.While the cafe has been restored to its nuptial-inducing charm, one still ponders its future in this age of rising seas.\u201cYou can only prepare so much,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keeffe mused one evening as an oil tanker slipped under the bridge. \u201cThe sea is unpredictable.\u201dMr. O\u2019Keeffe, who is single and has a sister who is not involved in the business, said retirement was not on his mind; neither is a plan of succession for the day he abandons the wheelhouse.\u201cBut whoever has it next,\u201d he predicted, \u201cwill make it better and better.\u201dAn article last Wednesday about the 40-year history of the River Caf\u00e9 in Brooklyn misstated the decade when its owner, Michael O\u2019Keeffe, first visited the restaurant La Grenouille. It was the 1960s, not the 1950s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hacking Wars Are Going to Get Much Worse", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorReports this month that the United Arab Emirates orchestrated the hacking of a Qatari news agency, helping to incite a crisis in the Middle East, are as unsurprising as they are unwelcome. For years, countries \u2014 in particular Russia \u2014 have used cyberattacks and the dissemination of disinformation through social media and news outlets to provoke protests, sway elections and undermine trust in institutions. It was only a matter of time before smaller states tried their hand at these tactics.With few accepted rules of behavior in cyberspace, countries as big as China or as small as Bahrain can be expected to use these kinds of attacks. And they may eventually spill over into real-world military conflicts.It\u2019s only a matter of time before a state\u2019s response to a cyberattack escalates into full-blown military conflict. Cyberattacks that embarrass or threaten the legitimacy of weak leaders, for example, could cause them to overreact \u2014 or worse to unleash a war to create a diversion.Big and small countries alike should want to make sure that hacking attacks do not lead to war. But there is little hope that competing states will ever be able to agree on how to define, much less limit, information operations.For now, the onus is on individual states to identify vulnerable targets, better defend them, and, if and when an attack succeeds, counter the spread of lies and disinformation. Countries should also work with like-minded partners to detail what types of interference will provoke what types of reactions, from sanctions to retaliatory cyberattacks. As the latest crisis in the Gulf shows, small states are learning from the big ones how to exploit cyberattacks to create political disruption. As a result, we all are much less secure in cyberspace \u2014 and in the real world, too.Adam Segal, a cybersecurity scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author of \u201cThe Hacked World Order: How Nations Fight, Trade, Maneuver and Manipulate in the Digital Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Paperwork Goes Missing, Private Student Loan Debts May Be Wiped Away", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTens of thousands of people who took out private loans to pay for college but have not been able to keep up payments may get their debts wiped away because critical paperwork is missing.The troubled loans, which total at least $5 billion, are at the center of a protracted legal dispute between the student borrowers and a group of creditors who have aggressively pursued them in court after they fell behind on payments.Judges have already dismissed dozens of lawsuits against former students, essentially wiping out their debt, because documents proving who owns the loans are missing. A review of court records by The New York Times shows that many other collection cases are deeply flawed, with incomplete ownership records and mass-produced documentation.Some of the problems playing out now in the $108 billion private student loan market are reminiscent of those that arose from the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago, when billions of dollars in subprime mortgage loans were ruled uncollectible by courts because of missing or fake documentation. And like those troubled mortgages, private student loans \u2014 which come with higher interest rates and fewer consumer protections than federal loans \u2014 are often targeted at the most vulnerable borrowers, like those attending for-profit schools.Last year, National Collegiate unleashed a fusillade of litigation against Samantha Watson, a 33-year-old mother of three who graduated from Lehman College in the Bronx in 2013 with a degree in psychology.Ms. Watson, the first in her family to go to college, took out private loans to finance her studies. But she said she had trouble following the fine print. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand about things like interest rates,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody tells you to go to college, get an education, and everything will be O.K. So that\u2019s what I did.\u201dMs. Watson made some payments on her loans but fell behind when her daughter got sick and she had to quit her job as an executive assistant. She now works as a nurse\u2019s aide, with more flexible hours but a smaller paycheck that barely covers her family\u2019s expenses.\u201cI tried to be honest,\u201d Ms. Watson said of her court appearance. \u201cI said, \u2018Some of these loans I took out, and I\u2019ll be responsible for them, but some I didn\u2019t take.\u2019\u201dWhen the judge\u2019s rulings wiped out $31,000 in debt, \u201cit was such a relief,\u201d Ms. Watson said. \u201cYou just feel this whole weight lifted. My mom started to cry.\u201dJoel Leiderman, a lawyer at Forster and Garbus, the law firm that represented National Collegiate in its litigation against Ms. Watson, declined to comment on the lawsuits.The trusts win many of the lawsuits they file automatically, because borrowers often do not show up to fight. Those court victories, which can be used to garnish paychecks and take federal benefits like Social Security from bank accounts, can haunt borrowers for decades.The loans that National Collegiate holds were made to college students more than a decade ago by dozens of different banks, then bundled together by a financing company and sold to investors through a process known as securitization. These private loans were not guaranteed by the federal government, which is the nation\u2019s largest student loan lender.National Collegiate\u2019s legal problems have hinged on its inability to prove it owns the student loans, not on any falsification of documents.The beneficial owner of National Collegiate\u2019s student loan trusts conducted an audit of the loans\u2019 servicer. Crucial paperwork needed to collect on the loans in court is missing, according to the auditors\u2019 report.But National Collegiate\u2019s problems are especially acute, she said. Over and over, she said, the company drops lawsuits \u2014 often on the eve of a trial or deposition \u2014 when borrowers contest them. \u201cI question whether they actually possess the documents necessary to show that they own loans,\u201d Ms. Smith said.He said he was appalled by National Collegiate\u2019s collection lawsuits and wanted them to stop, but an internal struggle between Vantage Capital and others involved in operating the trusts has prevented him from ordering a halt, he said\u201cWe don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Uderitz said in a recent interview.Like those who took on subprime mortgages, many people with private student loans end up shouldering debt that they never earn enough to repay. Borrowing to finance higher education is an economic decision that often pays off, but federal student loans \u2014 a much larger market, totaling $1.3 trillion \u2014 are directly funded by the government and come with consumer protections like income-based repayment options.Private loans lack that flexibility, and they often carry interest rates that can reach double digits. Because of those steep rates, the size of the loans can quickly balloon, leaving borrowers to pay hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of dollars each month.Other large student lenders, like Sallie Mae, also pursue delinquent borrowers in court, but National Collegiate stands apart for its size and aggressiveness, borrowers\u2019 lawyers say.Lawsuits against borrowers who have fallen behind on their consumer loans are typically filed in state or local courts, where records are often hard to search. This means that there is no national tally of just how often National Collegiate\u2019s trusts have gone to court.Very few cases ever make it to trial, according to court records and borrowers\u2019 lawyers. Once borrowers are sued, most either choose to settle or ignore the summons, which allows the trusts to obtain a default judgment.Transworld Systems, a debt collector, brings most of the lawsuits for National Collegiate against delinquent borrowers. And in legal filings, it is usually a Transworld representative who swears to the accuracy of the records backing up the loan. Transworld did not respond to a request for comment.Hundreds of cases have been dismissed when borrowers challenge them, according to lawyers, often because the trusts do not produce the paperwork needed to proceed.\u201cIt was a scary time,\u201d Mr. Mason said of being taken to court. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how they would come after me, or seize whatever I had, to get the money.\u201dNational Collegiate\u2019s beneficial owner, Mr. Uderitz, hired a contractor in 2015 to audit the servicing company that bills National Collegiate\u2019s borrowers each month and is supposed to maintain custody of many loan documents critical for collection cases.While Mr. Uderitz wants to collect money from students behind on their bills, he says he wants the lawsuits against borrowers to stop, at least until he can get more information about the documentation that underpins the loans.\u201cIt\u2019s fraud to try to collect on loans that you don\u2019t own,\u201d Mr. Uderitz said. \u201cWe want no part of that. If it\u2019s a loan we\u2019re owed fairly, we want to collect. We need answers on this.\u201dKeith New, a spokesman for the servicer, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (known to borrowers as American Education Services), said, \u201cWe believe that the auditors were misinformed about the scope of P.H.E.A.A.\u2019s contractual obligations. We are confident that the litigation will reveal that the agency has acted properly and in accordance with its agreements.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about missing paperwork for private student loans referred imprecisely to how debt collectors may garnish federal benefits like Social Security from borrowers. The collectors can in some circumstances take benefits after they are deposited in a bank account; they cannot garnish the benefits directly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Female Warlord Who Had C.I.A. Connections and Opium Routes", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileMUSE, Myanmar \u2014 She was born to royalty in British colonial Burma, but rejected that life to become a cross-dressing warlord whose C.I.A.-supplied army established opium trade routes across the Golden Triangle. By the time of her death, last week at 90, she had led hundreds of men, endured prison and torture, generated gossip for her relationship with a film actress and, finally, helped forge a truce between ethnic rebels and the government.Concerned about their unconventional daughter, her parents arranged for her to marry a younger cousin. Shortly after she became pregnant, archives show, she left her husband to pursue a life among opium-trafficking bandits. Her son, Duan Jipu \u2014 named for the American jeeps Ms. Yang had seen in the Chinese city of Kunming during World War II \u2014 was raised by other family members.By age 25, she commanded hundreds of soldiers guarding caravans of raw opium on mules and trucks across the hills to the Thai border. Those trade routes served what would eventually become the world\u2019s most productive opium-growing region, supplying raw ingredients for the heroin that was trafficked across the United States and Europe.Ms. Yang partnered with remnants of the Chinese Nationalist troops who had been defeated by Mao\u2019s Communists but continued to fight from havens in Burma. Intelligence dispatches at the National Archives in Yangon described her as a menace to the peace.The C.I.A.-supplied arms found their way into Ms. Yang\u2019s hands in 1952, as documented by the Burmese government in a complaint submitted at the United Nations General Assembly the following year. Ms. Yang\u2019s army was observed traveling across the border to an airfield in Thailand, where an unmarked C-47 aircraft arriving from Taiwan, the seat of the Chinese Nationalist government, was reported to have unloaded weapons.Mr. Lo would go on to earn the designation \u201ckingpin of the heroin traffic in Southeast Asia,\u201d by United States drug enforcement officials, after striking a deal with the Burmese military government that allowed him to resume trading in opium in return for assisting government forces against rebel forces.After her older brother Edward abdicated in 1959, along with dozens of other hereditary rulers in Shan state, Ms. Yang took control of his former army, becoming the de facto ruler of the territory. She also, according to her relatives, entered into a relationship with a Burmese movie actress, Wah Wah Win Shwe, lavishing her with gifts and adding her name to the deed of her house in Yangon.Ms. Yang\u2019s family considered them a couple, though in an interview in 2015, Ms. Win Shwe, who still lived in a house on Ms. Yang\u2019s former property, denied an affair. In any case, the arrangement came to an abrupt end in 1963, when Ms. Yang was arrested by police officials under Gen. Ne Win, who had seized power in Burma the year before.

But the highly indebted media company faced financial constraints and was wary of overpaying, The Journal reported.Negotiations to finalize a deal with Scripps may be complete within days, but there isn\u2019t a guarantee that the two sides will reach an agreement.A time limit has been set for the battle between billionaires over Energy Future Holdings, the bankrupt Texas power company.A bankruptcy judge pushed back to Aug. 21 the hearing for the approval of Berkshire\u2019s agreement to buy the utility after Elliott, the largest creditor of Oncor\u2019s bankrupt parent company, said it needed more time to finalize the financing for its $9.3 billion offer.Elliott had asked for 35 to 40 days.But a Berkshire executive testified in court that the company would walk away if it had not secured court approval for its takeover by Aug. 21.The German lender is in the midst of a reorganization, but its recovery is slow going.Where did the slump come from?\u2022 Fixed-income trading dropped 12 percent.\u2022 Revenue from equities trading fell 28 percent.\u2022 Global transaction banking revenue fell 12 percent.Profits beat expectations, but the weakness in revenue sent Deutsche Bank shares falling in Thursday morning trading.It appears to be one of the most generous donations in the history of philanthropy, involving a stake in the biggest Chinese investor in the United States.And yet there are still questions about the nearly 30 percent stake in the HNA Group that a 30-something businessman donated to a New York-based charity, the Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation.We had already noted that HNA hadn\u2019t quite cleared all the questions hanging over it about its ownership structure.Here are some of the main questions that cropped up since that donation was revealed:\u2022 How will HNA comply with United States tax law now that a large portion of it is owned by an American foundation? Should we expect to see some asset sales soon? Federal laws generally restrict foundations from owning more than 20 percent of a company. If major shareholders have a hand in running the foundation, regulations push the ownership limit to as low as 2 percent.The key takeaways:\u2022 Sales declined slightly compared with the same period last year, to 43 billion Swiss francs, or $45 billion, in part because of asset sales. But organic sales growth of 2.3 percent fell below company expectations.\u2022 Operating profit was flat at 6.8 billion Swiss francs.\u2022 Net profit rose 19 percent, to 4.9 billion Swiss francs, but the same period a year earlier was affected by a one-time accounting charge.\u2022 Organic sales growth is now expected to fall into the \u201clower half\u201d of the expected range of 2 percent to 4 percent.Analysts at UBS wrote in a research note that they expected Nestl\u00e9\u2019s shares to fall on Thursday, regardless of the profit figures. That may give Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point more ammunition to call for changes at the company.\u201cWe do not think markets can rely on Libor continuing to be available indefinitely. \u2026 The planning and the transition must now begin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS, Despite Heavy Losses, Still Inspires Global Attacks", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Three years ago, a black-clad cleric named Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ascended a mosque pulpit in the Iraqi city of Mosul and addressed the world as leader of a new terrorist state.The announcement of the so-called caliphate was a high point for the extremist fighters of the Islamic State. Their exhibitionist violence and apocalyptic ideology helped them seize vast stretches of territory in Syria and Iraq, attract legions of foreign fighters and create an administration with bureaucrats, courts and oil wells.Now, their state is crumbling.In Syria, American-backed militias have surrounded Raqqa, the group\u2019s capital, and breached its historic walls. Across the border, Iraqi forces have seized the remains of the Mosul mosque where Mr. Baghdadi appeared and besieged the remaining jihadists in a shrinking number of city blocks.But the loss of its two largest cities will not spell a final defeat for the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh \u2014 according to analysts and American and Middle Eastern officials. The group has already shifted back to its roots as an insurgent force, but one that now has an international reach and an ideology that continues to motivate attackers around the world.\u201cThese are obviously major blows to ISIS because its state-building project is over, there is no more caliphate, and that will diminish support and recruits,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington and a co-author of a book on the group. \u201cBut ISIS today is an international organization. Its leadership and its ability to grow back are still there.\u201dThe Islamic State has overshadowed its jihadist precursors like Al Qaeda by not just holding territory, but by running cities and their hinterlands for an extended period, winning the group credibility in the militant world and allowing it to build a complex organization.So even while its physical hold slips, its surviving cadres \u2014 middle managers, weapons technicians, propagandists and other operatives \u2014 will invest that experience in the group\u2019s future operations.And even though its hold on crucial urban centers is being shaken, the Islamic State is in no way homeless yet.In Iraq, the group still controls Tal Afar, Hawija, other towns and much of Anbar Province. In Syria, most of its top operatives have fled Raqqa in the past six months for other towns still under ISIS control in the Euphrates River valley, according to American and Western military and counterterrorism officials who have received intelligence briefings.Many have relocated to Mayadeen, a town 110 miles southeast of Raqqa near oil facilities and with supply lines through the surrounding desert. They have taken with them the group\u2019s most important recruiting, financing, propaganda and external operations functions, American officials said. Other leaders have been spirited out of Raqqa by a trusted network of aides to a string of towns from Deir al-Zour to Abu Kamal.American Special Operations forces have targeted this area heavily with armed Reaper drones and attack planes, disrupting and damaging the Islamic State\u2019s leadership and ability to carry out plots. But the battle for Raqqa still could last many months.It is all a new chapter in the history of a group whose roots go back to the United States\u2019 invasion of Iraq in 2003.Fighting under various names and leaders, the Sunni militants who would evolve into the Islamic State killed many Iraqis and American troops before Sunni tribal fighters paid by the United States decimated them, driving the survivors underground by the time the United States withdrew from Iraq in 2011.But new conflicts provided new opportunities. After the outbreak of the civil war in Syria in 2011, the group dispatched operatives there to build the force that later seized the country\u2019s east, including Raqqa, which became its administrative capital.Then it turned its sights back to Iraq, seizing Mosul in 2014, where Mr. Baghdadi made clear what distinguished his followers from Al Qaeda: They were not just insurgents, but also the founders of a state infused with extremist ideology.Now, senior American intelligence and counterterrorism officials say that more than 60,000 Islamic State fighters have been killed since June 2014, including much of the group\u2019s leadership, and that the group has lost about two-thirds of its peak territory.But those officials, including Lt. Gen. Michael K. Nagata, one of the Army\u2019s top Special Operations officers, also acknowledged that the Islamic State had retained much of its ability to inspire, enable and direct terrorist attacks.Internationally, the Islamic State has partly compensated for its losses at home by encouraging affiliates abroad \u2014 in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria and the Philippines \u2014 and by activating operatives elsewhere.Between 100 and 250 ideologically driven foreigners are thought to have been smuggled into Europe from late 2014 to mid-2016, nearly all through Turkey after crossing a now rigidly enforced border, European intelligence officials say.But they may not be the most dangerous threat facing the European authorities as long as Islamic State ideology continues to motivate attackers.Most were citizens of the countries they chose to strike.Since the Islamic State\u2019s rise, the United States and its allies have focused on breaking the group\u2019s control of territory, but much less planning has gone into how communities damaged by jihadist rule will be rebuilt and governed afterward. Indeed, the jihadists\u2019 departure could accelerate other conflicts.In Syria, the United States has armed and supported a militia called the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., to fight the jihadists. Most of its leaders are Kurds, many with roots in the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which the United States and Turkey consider a terrorist organization.The group\u2019s ascendance has angered Turkey, which considers it a threat, as well as many Syrian Arabs, who see it as a front for Kurdish empowerment at their expense. It also remains unclear how the bodies set up to govern areas seized from the jihadists can be financed so they can rebuild, restore services and provide security.The administration of President Trump has shown little interest in such measures, although experts consider them necessary to prevent the jihadists from returning.\u201cThere is a tension in the U.S. approach, to avoid extended commitments and nation-building on one hand and the need to prevent the possibility of a jihadist resurgence in the future on the other,\u201d said Noah Bonsey, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.In Iraq, the defeat of the Islamic State in Mosul sets the stage for new power struggles between the central government in Baghdad and the Kurds, who have taken control of the contested, oil-rich city of Kirkuk and plan to vote on independence later this year.The fight against the Islamic State has also fueled the proliferation of Shiite militias, many of which are funded by Iran and are driven by a sectarian creed that has marginalized and worried Sunnis.Many fear that with poor governance and sectarianism still the rule in Syria and Iraq, some reconstituted form of the Islamic State\u2019s extreme Sunni Islamism could yet find support.\u201cAll of these conditions in the end form the basic environment for the group,\u201d said Hassan Abu Haniyeh, a Jordanian expert in extremist groups. \u201cThey formed the environment for it to start and spread, and now they are increasing, not decreasing.\u201dThe caliphate also lives on in the virtual realm, as its operatives and supporters churn out propaganda, bomb manuals, encryption guides and suggestions for how to kill the largest number of people with trucks.Its members have played down their losses, portraying them as mere setbacks in the long-term, worldwide battle against those who reject their ideology.\u201cO brothers, I call upon you to rise up wherever you are and to surround them and monitor them, then attack them and kill them,\u201d a Chechen suicide bomber said in a video released posthumously last month. \u201cThe disbelievers have gathered today from every faith and attacked the caliphate, but this had only added to our faith and courage.\u201dAmerican officials acknowledged the difficulty of fighting the group online.\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,\u201d Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump\u2019s Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser, said last Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re proselytizing. It\u2019s troubling.\u201dStill, many Syrians and Iraqis whose lives the jihadists have ravaged are glad to see them chased out, despite worries about the future.\u201cI am happy that Daesh is dying, but the fear of what might come next is killing this happiness,\u201d said Ahmed Abdul-Qadir, a Raqqa native who was running an anti-jihadist media group in Turkey when gunmen he believes belonged to the Islamic State shot him in the jaw. He is now in France, and he communicated via Facebook chat because he is between surgeries that have made it hard to speak.\u201cIt makes me wish that this whole organization would vanish and that no one who believes in its doctrine would remain alive,\u201d he said.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Convictions of 2 Former Traders in Libor Scandal Are Dismissed", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA United States appeals court threw out the convictions of two former London-based traders at the Dutch bank Rabobank on Wednesday, in what had been the first American criminal case to arise from investigations into the manipulation of the interest rate benchmark known as Libor.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan also dismissed the indictment against the two men, saying that their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination had been violated.At issue in the Rabobank case was the Justice Department\u2019s use of testimony that Mr. Allen and Mr. Conti were compelled to give in Britain as part of an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority. The men, both British citizens, were obligated to provide statements to the British regulator in the inquiry or they could have faced imprisonment.On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit found that prosecutors in the United States improperly relied on that testimony at trial and in obtaining an indictment against the men from a grand jury.Michael S. Schachter, a lawyer for Mr. Allen, said that the appeals court\u2019s decision was \u201ca tremendous relief for Tony Allen and his family.\u201dAaron Williamson, a lawyer for Mr. Conti, said they were pleased with the court\u2019s decision. \u201cTony and his family can move forward without fear of being pulled apart for a year of their lives,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on Wednesday.The inquiry into Libor has led to billions of dollars in fines in Britain and in the United States and shook the reputations of some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, including Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.To set Libor and other benchmark rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities. Libor is used to price more than $300 trillion in securities.Prosecutors in the United States had accused Mr. Allen and Mr. Conti of accommodating requests by traders at Rabobank to adjust their Libor submissions to benefit the bank and the traders\u2019 positions, an argument the men contested a trial.At Rabobank, Mr. Allen was the global head of liquidity and finance and supervised Mr. Conti, a senior money markets trader who made daily Libor submissions. Mr. Allen was laid off in 2008, when Rabobank closed its London branch, and Mr. Conti left the bank in 2009, when his job was moved to the Netherlands.The United States government obtained the testimony at issue from Paul Robson, a co-worker at Rabobank who had seen it after the Financial Conduct Authority brought an enforcement action against him in Britain in 2013.The British regulator stayed its enforcement action against Mr. Robson to allow the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal investigation. Mr. Robson later pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge and agreed to cooperate with American prosecutors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Trump\u2019s \u2018Victims\u2019 of Obamacare, Senate Bill May Be Worse", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckAhead of a Senate vote to begin debate over health care, President Trump pressed Republicans on Monday afternoon to fulfill their seven-year promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, surrounded by families whom he characterized as \u201cvictims\u201d of the law.\u201cFor 17 years, Obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent, hard-working Americans,\u201d he mistakenly said of the law, passed in 2010, before listing \u201cterrific reforms\u201d in the Senate bill. Here\u2019s an assessment.The West Virginia man with \u201cno other option than going on Medicaid,\u201d for example, may feel the $760 billion decrease in Medicaid funding. The current law expanded Medicaid eligibility to a higher income threshold, to 138 percent of the federal poverty level from 44 percent. But the Senate bill gradually phases out federal financing for Medicaid expansion, which could cause states like West Virginia to decrease or eliminate coverage for the expansion population.Mr. Trump\u2019s claim was not entirely accurate for either the bill to repeal and replace the current law or the bill that partially repeals it without a replacement.Under the revised bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, premiums would initially increase and then drop about 20 percent in 2026, but that also comes with a few caveats. The plans under the bill would cover a smaller percentage of benefits than the ones today. The bill also allows insurers to charge older Americans more for health care. And it lowers the value of cost-sharing subsidies.The bill offers states a block grant option to provide coverage for nondisabled adults beginning in 2020, which the budget office says would give them \u201cadditional flexibility.\u201d But whether this option benefits low-income Medicaid enrollees depends on how states would offset the hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to federal Medicaid funding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Juries, Lawyers Now Favor the Uninformed", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "Jury selection in Martin Shkreli\u2019s trial followed the growing tendency to cut not only jurors who have an opinion, but also those who know anything about a case.Supported byJudge Kiyo A. Matsumoto turned to a young woman who works in accounting and asked if she had read or heard anything about the case. Just that morning, a court officer had confiscated a juror\u2019s copy of The New York Post with the case on the cover.\u201cOh, no, never,\u201d the woman said.\u201cOh, very good,\u201d Judge Matsumoto responded.The next day, after lawyers and the judge had dismissed more than 300 jurors in all, the woman made it onto the jury as an alternate.Jury selections today have moved beyond seeking the unbiased to favoring the uninformed.Dismissing potential jurors who might favor either the prosecution or the defense has long been a tenet of the American jury system; the right to an impartial jury is guaranteed by the Constitution.But now, perhaps in a sign of a polarized age, lawyers from both sides appear increasingly to be concerned that opinions mean inflexibility. They are looking for jurors who not only have no viewpoints on the case, but also little exposure to the subject matter, who don\u2019t follow the news, haven\u2019t traveled to the places discussed at trial and have pastimes as innocuous as possible.One juror at a Manhattan federal trial this year was dismissed by prosecutors who explained they were concerned about his spending his leisure time being \u201ca First Amendment advocate.\u201d \u201cEveryone in this courtroom is a First Amendment advocate, including the United States, I would hope,\u201d a defense lawyer shot back.A possible result: Jurors without the expertise to analyze specialized evidence may instead use lawyers\u2019 storylines, or their own feelings about a defendant, to decide a case.\u201cThe problem is, anybody who knows enough about the case runs the risk of being dangerous for one or both sides,\u201d said Leslie Ellis, a director at the trial consulting firm DecisionQuest. \u201cYou usually cannot ask them questions to get at how deep their knowledge on this runs, or will they get everything right when they\u2019re in deliberations.\u201cOne side or the other will strike them because they don\u2019t want anybody in the jury room who can override their witnesses, and become a bigger influence than the witnesses.\u201dYet when Judge Matsumoto asked about 45 potential jurors \u2014 who had already been weeded from a much larger group \u2014 whether any owned stocks, only five or so raised their hands. (More than half of Americans own stocks.) Few said they knew about major financial entities like the banking giant UBS, or the Securities and Exchange Commission.A similar pattern has appeared in the jury makeup for a range of cases.Donald L. Blankenship, a former chief executive of Massey Energy Company, was charged with covering up safety violations, leading to an explosion that killed 29 coal miners in 2010. The deaths and the charges were highly publicized, especially in West Virginia, the trial\u2019s location.Still, one seated juror said during the jury selection that the case was \u201csomething about embezzling\u201d or \u201cmaybe something about safety.\u201d Another, who said she only knew there was \u201csome kind of explosion or something,\u201d explained she was \u201creally not in the mood to listen to the news.\u201d She was also chosen.The jury selection in a recent terrorism case in Federal District Court in Manhattan also suggested that prosecutors were striking people who had been favorably exposed to Muslims or the Middle East.In jury selection, a judge may excuse a juror for hardship, like a work conflict, or for cause, like bias. After those jurors are dismissed, lawyers from each side get a certain number of peremptory strikes, where they cut people who they think will not support their side. The number of permitted challenges varies depending on the type of case and the court.The trial in Manhattan was of an Arizona man who, prosecutors said, assisted a New York college student in joining the Islamic State by helping coordinate his travel through Turkey to Syria.A potential juror who took part in an exchange program in Turkey and had visited there? Cut by the prosecution.A journalist who had gone to Egypt, whose sister had worked in Syria, and who had lots of friends who had visited Turkey? Cut by the prosecution.A Manhattan musician whose wife worked at the United Nations and who told the judge his wife\u2019s colleagues had \u201copened my mind to the Muslim world\u201d? Cut by the prosecution.When a defense lawyer, Daniel Habib, asked the government to explain its strikes, prosecutors said the exchange-program man\u2019s \u201cprior experience\u201d could \u201cseep into his deliberations\u201d; the journalist was \u201ctoo enthusiastic\u201d; and the United Nations spouse had talked \u201cin a loud manner.\u201dLeft in the jury were people who, for the most part, had expressed few opinions about or experiences with the Middle East or Muslims.In a recent insider trading case in San Francisco, lawyers struck several jurors with financial experience, including one who\u2019d worked in venture capital and said, \u201cYou kind of see how the sausage is made.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t always a plus to know little.John H. Langbein, professor emeritus of law and legal history at Yale, said in a 2015 speech that this setup was premised on the societal arrangements of the time, where villagers collectively made their towns run. As time went on, \u201cresponding to the growing reality that the jurors were ceasing to have knowledge of the events in dispute, jury trial changed function and became primarily an occasion for educating the jurors about the facts,\u201d he said.Generally, prosecutors look for \u201cpeople who are community-minded,\u201d like people who are married, employed in a role that requires dealing with others or involved in community groups \u2014 that is, people who can reach a consensus, said Arlo Devlin-Brown, a partner at Covington & Burling who was until last year a federal prosecutor in Manhattan. They are \u201ctrying to avoid people who may be loners,\u201d he said.And not all lawyers today look for jurors who are coming to a case with little knowledge of the subject matter. Asked about how he would pick jurors for Mr. Shkreli\u2019s trial, Robert J. A. Zito, a longtime white-collar defense lawyer who will soon become a professor at Marist College, said, \u201cI would want financial people on the jury, because the underlying transactions are very complicated.\u201dAt Mr. Shkreli\u2019s jury selection, lawyers seemed to be taking the opposite tack. A manager at a broker-dealer \u201cwould be an expert in the room,\u201d argued Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer Benjamin Brafman, and the man was dismissed.Finally, after two and a half days of questioning the jury, lawyers needed only 15 minutes to make their picks.While Mr. Shkreli and his lawyers hurried into a court conference room, prosecutors, federal agents and a paralegal for the government huddled over a table in the courtroom, making notes on pages printed with each juror\u2019s name, juror number and space to write notes on the juror.The groups of lawyers gathered around Judge Matsumoto and, in quiet voices, gave their strikes. Twelve jurors and six alternates remained when they were done, including one current and one retired United Parcel Service driver, two human resources employees at a community college, a utility company employee, a parking meter repairman, a retired veterinarian, a software support worker and a current and a retired speech pathologist.Soon after the jurors took the seats they\u2019d sit in for the next six weeks or so, Mr. Brafman gave his opening argument.\u201cYou are savvy New Yorkers: There is no expertise\u201d you need to evaluate the case, he said, no \u201cspecial math.\u201d\u201cYou need street smarts,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Several have said they strolled into Trump Tower without being asked for identification; no log of visitors was kept, and one participant said he received an impromptu invitation a few hours before the meeting.President Trump\u2019s eldest son was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to the meeting.The participants at the meeting, which took place soon after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination, now number eight. Besides Donald Trump Jr., the Trump officials at the meeting were Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time. The visitors included Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born lobbyist who has spoken openly of his past as a Soviet intelligence officer and was accused of hacking one company\u2019s computer system in American lawsuits that were later withdrawn.Besides an interpreter, the others who traveled to Trump Tower that day were tied in some way to Mr. Agalarov and his son, Emin. The elder Mr. Agalarov provided the venue where Mr. Trump held the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013, and his son Emin has remained friendly with Mr. Trump and his family.Mr. Balber, the lawyer, represents not only Mr. Kaveladze but also the Agalarov family. Court records show he has also represented President Trump in two cases.Mr. Kaveladze, who works as the United States-based financial officer for Aras Agalarov\u2019s real estate company, attended as the family\u2019s emissary \u201cjust to make sure it happened and to serve as an interpreter if necessary,\u201d Mr. Balber said.He said Mr. Agalarov arranged the meeting as a favor to a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who has worked with Mr. Agalarov on real-estate deals. Ms. Veselnitskaya also attended the meeting, as did Rob Goldstone, who wrote the email and is a publicist for Emin Agalarov.Mr. Kaveladze had an especially colorful background. Born in the Soviet republic of Georgia, he graduated from the Moscow Finance Academy in 1989. He moved to the United States two years later, eventually becoming an American citizen, his lawyer said.They found that he had helped 50 Russians obtain Citibank credit cards, using his company\u2019s address each time. He set up more than 2,000 corporations in Delaware for Russian intermediaries without knowing who owned the firms, the inquiry found. And at Citibank alone, he opened 136 American accounts for Russian clients who moved more than $560 million through those accounts to overseas destinations, investigators said.Mr. Balber said Mr. Kaveladze was never accused of any wrongdoing and was providing a legitimate financial service. \u201cNothing ever came of it. Even the banks were not disciplined,\u201d he said.The inquiry concluded that it was fairly easy for foreigners to hide their identities and launder their funds through the United States. Carl Levin, then a Democratic senator from Michigan, said at the time that he would forward the report\u2019s findings to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation, as well as to regulatory agencies. In an interview Tuesday, he said Mr. Kaveladze was \u201cthe poster child\u201d of the money-laundering schemes.At some point after the G.A.O. report came out, Mr. Kaveladze, nicknamed Ike, went to work as a financial officer for Mr. Agalarov\u2019s real estate firm, Crocus Group. He also began importing Russian wines to the United States.Mr. Mueller\u2019s team believes all the meeting participants have now been identified, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. Mr. Balber, the lawyer, said Mr. Kaveladze would cooperate fully with Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.Asked if there were more mystery guests to be revealed, Mr. Balber gave a short laugh and said: \u201cNo. These are the eight.\u201dKenneth P.

{"Headline": "Israeli Labor Party Tries a New Leader: Gabbay, Self-Made Millionaire", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Avi Gabbay, a relative novice in Israeli politics, spent his early years in an asbestos hut in a transit camp, one of eight children of Moroccan immigrants, then became a millionaire. On Monday, he also became the chairman of the center-left Labor Party, beating Amir Peretz, a Moroccan-born party veteran, in a runoff.Mr. Gabbay\u2019s victory is not likely to pose an imminent threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the conservative Likud Party, now serving his third consecutive term in office. The Labor Party has not won a general election in 18 years. Currently leading the parliamentary opposition, the party has been polling third after Likud and the centrist Yesh Atid party in recent months.The latest leadership race riveted many Israelis as it pitted old politics against new, and liberal forces against a deeply conservative government and a public that has been shifting rightward.Isaac Herzog, the departing Labor chairman who won the party 24 seats in the last election to the Likud\u2019s 30, was knocked out last week in a first round of voting. Some in the party have described the shake-up as \u201celectrifying.\u201dMr. Gabbay\u2019s path to the Labor leadership has been unorthodox. Growing up in a Jerusalem transit camp, he was identified at a young age as a gifted student and was sent to school in an affluent neighborhood of the city. His father was a technician.He studied economics and business administration at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, served in the budget division of the Ministry of Finance and then went into business and rose to become the chief executive of Bezeq, Israel\u2019s telecommunications monopoly, a post he held until 2013. He has been unapologetic about his earnings there of millions of dollars.Mr. Gabbay joined Labor about six months ago.Addressing a hall filled with cheering supporters at 11 p.m. shortly after the results were in, Mr. Gabby said, \u201cTo all those who rushed to eulogize the Labor Party as an alternative for the government, and to all those who thought the Israeli citizens had lost hope in change, to all those \u2014 tonight is the answer.\u201d\u201cTomorrow we will begin the journey to the hearts of good Israelis,\u201d he added. \u201cIsraelis who believe in our ideology and values, but Israelis who, for decades, have not voted Labor.\u201dMr. Gabbay and Mr. Peretz, 65, from the immigrant town of Sderot near the border with the Gaza Strip, are both Mizrahi, or Eastern, Jews of Moroccan descent, and their leadership contest brought to the fore the debate over Israel\u2019s identity and ethnic politics. Labor has always been identified with the old Ashkenazic elite who hailed from Europe.This is not the first time a Mizrahi, or Sephardic, Jew has headed the Labor Party. Mr. Peretz led it for a period in the past, as did Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, an Iraqi-born politician. Both Mr. Peretz and Mr. Ben-Eliezer were also defense ministers.Mizrahi Jews, who immigrated mostly in the 1950s, were resentful of the sometimes highhanded treatment by the Labor establishment, so many have traditionally voted for Likud or other right-wing or religious parties. Though Mizrahim make up roughly half of Israel\u2019s Jewish population, and about a third of Israeli children are now born into mixed Mizrahi/Ashkenazic families, economic and educational gaps remain.Despite hopes in Labor that Mr. Gabbay will be able to bring in new voters from sectors of the public that have long shunned the party, Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and political commentator, said his surveys over the years showed that the Mizrahim consistently preferred Ashkenazic candidates for prime minister.\u201cThere has not yet been a Sephardi prime minister,\u201d Mr. Barak said, \u201cand I don\u2019t see one on the horizon.\u201dThe next elections are scheduled for late 2019, though many Israeli governments do not last their full four-year terms.Ron Cahlili, a Mizrahi documentary director and left-wing activist, said in a radio interview this week: \u201cThe role of a Mizrahi leader is not to be Mizrahi and to say I\u2019m Mizrahi and I live in Sderot. The role of a Mizrahi leader is to reduce gaps between Mizrahim and Ashkenazim. Period.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the election of Avi Gabbay to lead the Labor Party in Israel included a quotation that referred incorrectly to participation in the leadership election. Tal Schneider, who writes for an independent political blog, said there were 52,000 voters, not 62,000; the figure was for the number eligible to cast ballots, not the number who actually did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Cars Offer More Models, but Find Fewer Buyers", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last several years, luxury carmakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz have added a dizzying array of variations to their model lines, in hopes of attracting buyers from rival brands.But the strategy is not working out.Fresh evidence of the auto industry\u2019s woes arrived on Monday, when automakers reported that sales of new cars and trucks declined by 3 percent in June from a year earlier, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. And luxury cars were no exception.In recent years, the industry has been riding high, with low gasoline prices pushing buyers toward bigger \u2014 and for companies, more profitable \u2014 cars like sport utility vehicles and trucks. But the luxury sector, so often a bright spot in automakers\u2019 earnings, has lost its sheen.\u201cThe luxury industry is pretty flat right now,\u201d said William Fay, senior vice president of automotive operations for Toyota North America.Among the luxury brands, BMW suffered a decline of 2.8 percent last month, while sales at Mercedes-Benz fell slightly and Toyota\u2019s Lexus division reported that its new-vehicle sales fell 5 percent.The challenges to the category have not been for lack of variety. The BMW 3 Series compact, for example, is now available as a four-door sedan, a hatchback, a station wagon, a diesel and a plug-in hybrid. Other variants made from the same basic parts but called the 4 Series include a convertible, a two-door coupe and a four-door coupe.Still, sales of BMW 3 and 4 cars plunged 24 percent in 2016 and have fallen another 8 percent this year.\u201cBMW\u2019s goal was to increase market share but it\u2019s turned out to be a little bit of cannibalization,\u201d said Shujaat Siddiqui, general manager at Dave Walter BMW in Akron, Ohio. \u201cBMW customers are just moving from one model to another,\u201d he added, but the brand has been unable to bring in new buyers and expand its market share.To a lesser extent, Mercedes has also expanded its offerings of sport utility vehicles. It enjoyed a big jump in S.U.V. sales last year, but in the first half of this year they have fallen about 2.3 percent \u2014 at a time when overall sales of S.U.V.s and lighter versions called crossovers are soaring.The proliferation of models is just one of the problems that luxury-car makers are facing. Another is that American consumers now strongly prefer S.U.V.s and crossovers and are moving away from cars, the traditional strength of the premium brands. \u201cWe are getting to a point where the market is pushing close to 65 percent trucks,\u201d once S.U.V.s and minivans are included, Mr. Fay said.Mr. Fay said Lexus would kick off new sales promotions, including increases in subsidized leases and financing offers, to push Lexus sales through the summer. Two luxury rivals, Acura and Infiniti, saw big gains in June sales after offering discounts and other deals.Luxury-car makers began to grab an increasing slice of the American car market as baby boomers reached their peak income years and splurged on upscale automobiles. In 2007, they had 11.8 percent of the market, up from about 9 percent in 2001.After the recession, they developed new models in an attempt to continue the upward trend. Cadillac added a new compact, the ATS. BMW built a small electric car, the i3. Mercedes developed an entry model, the CLA, to sell for about $30,000 and compete with mainstream cars like the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry.They had some initial success, but many models introduced in the last several years are now floundering. In June, sales of Cadillac\u2019s ATS were just 1,185, 37 percent fewer than in the same period a year ago. BMW i3 sales this year have totaled fewer than 3,000 cars, less than half the pace of two years ago. At Mercedes-Benz, sales of the CLA declined 8 percent in June \u2014 and are down 37 percent in the first six months of the year.\u201cIn some ways, their strategy has backfired on them,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com.As consumers flock to S.U.V.s, manufacturers are also finding that luxury buyers are not as enthralled with horsepower and racetrack handling anymore.\u201cThe idea of what makes a luxury brand has changed,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cA fast zero-to-60 time used to be important for any luxury car. But if you\u2019re buying an all-wheel drive S.U.V., nobody really cares about that.\u201dTesla, with its semiautonomous Autopilot technology, has become a serious competitive threat to more established premium makes, she added. \u201cLuxury doesn\u2019t have to be defined by how many cylinders or how many gears you have. For a lot of buyers, being really high tech and having this self-driving capability is luxury.\u201dBut more difficulties for the luxury brands may be on the way. Their efforts to sell new cars this year are facing increased competition from used cars that were leased two or three years ago and have been turned in to dealers. Many have been driven fewer than 40,000 miles and sell for about half the price of new models.\u201cSome of the used-car valuation has had an impact\u201d on luxury brands, Mr. Fay said.Next year, an even larger number of luxury cars will re-enter the market as used vehicles, according to industry analysts.\u201cThe cars coming off lease are a very attractive deal, and that lowers prices of new cars,\u201d said Jim Ursomarso, vice president of Union Park Automotive Group in Delaware, which operates BMW, Jaguar and Volvo franchises. \u201cSo it\u2019s not going to get easier from here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Scaling Back Goals for Business Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith President Trump\u2019s promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act nearly dead, administration officials are scaling back their ambitions to cut the corporate tax rate sharply, apparently taking a more pragmatic approach as they scramble to secure a major legislative victory this year.In recent days, discussions among Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers over promised tax cuts for corporations and individuals have taken on new urgency, a person who has been briefed on the matter said. One crucial point of discussions in the coming days, the person said, will be the proposed business tax rate. In April, a White House policy paper pegged it at 15 percent for corporations and small businesses alike. The current rate is 35 percent.But now the proposed business tax rate is \u201cdrifting higher,\u201d this person said, and may end up in the low 20 percent range.With the health care plan seemingly in ruins, this person said, the tax overhaul will very likely take top priority. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, are communicating daily over the tax proposal with the aim of drafting a bill to be introduced on the House floor in early September. To ensure the support of influential lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, the two officials are meeting weekly to discuss the bill\u2019s intricacies in a group being referred to as the Big Six: House Speaker Paul D. Ryan; Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader; and Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.The final tax rate will depend somewhat on whether corporations are permitted to deduct their interest expenses \u2014 a hot-button issue that has caused great concern for businesses that rely heavily on debt.A White House spokeswoman, Natalie Strom, said: \u201cDiscussions between the White House and Congress are progressing in a very positive direction. We have always had more areas of agreement than disagreement, and we feel confident we will develop a unified plan that will deliver on our goals of economic growth and tax relief for hard-working middle-income families.\u201dA corporate tax rate in the 20 percent range would put the Trump administration in line with the tax blueprint released last year by Mr. Ryan and would reflect a more realistic approach to overhauling the tax code.While Mr. Trump has promised the largest tax cut in history, political and fiscal realities have already begun to intervene.The collapse of the Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act means that more than $1 trillion in taxes from that law, for the time being, are expected to remain in place. Republicans have also met fierce resistance to imposing a border adjustment tax on imports, and opposition to the elimination of the state and local income tax deduction for individuals is growing louder.Cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent would reduce tax revenue about $2 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. It estimates that a reduction to 20 percent would reduce revenue by $1.6 trillion.The constraints facing Republicans on tax reform were made plain on Tuesday when the House Budget Committee released a budget resolution outline that, if passed, would unlock the legislative tool that would let Republicans rewrite the tax code without the help of Democrats. The resolution requires that changes to the tax code do not add to the deficit.Lawmakers in the House and Senate have been holding hearings this week as they prepare for tax reform. It was evident that Republicans continue to disagree on the best way to broaden the tax base so that they could set a corporate tax rate that is low enough to make the United States more competitive with other countries around the world. Most of the major economic powers have a corporate rate that is half the rate in the United States.In a sign that Republican leaders may have learned some lessons from the health care debacle, Mr. Ryan is taking his tax pitch on the road this week. On Thursday, he will visit a sneaker factory in Massachusetts, where he will make the case that rewriting the tax code is the key to improving the fortunes of American manufacturers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Secretaries of State Meeting Used to Be Friendly. Then the White House Asked for Voter Data.", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In the partisan battlefield of elective office, the National Association of Secretaries of State has always been a DMZ of sorts, an alliance of obscure officials who would rather talk charity regulations than politics, a conclave so committed to comity that it alternates its chair between Democrats (\u201ca nonpartisan organization,\u201d said Denise Miller, the outgoing president) and Republicans (\u201cwe stand together,\u201d said Connie Lawson, the incoming one).But as the group held its semiannual meeting here this weekend, a whiff of gunpowder wafted through the air.The secretaries had the bad timing to gather the week after the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity asked them for reams of data on the nation\u2019s 200 million registered voters, a request that might as well have been a political call to arms. News reports from Florida and Colorado stated that voters were asking to be removed from the rolls, fearing that their personal data would wind up in the wrong hands.Democratic secretaries have largely denounced the request as a Republican plot to conjure evidence of voter fraud out of thin air, in order to bolster President Trump\u2019s claim that three million or more illegal votes cost him a popular-vote victory in November\u2019s election.\u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience legitimize this commission, which seems to have arrived at their conclusions even before they got started,\u201d said Alex Padilla, the secretary of state of California and a Democrat. He refused to cooperate with the request.Adding to their rancor was the fact that the request came from one of their own: the vice chairman and de facto leader of the commission, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state. Mr. Kobach, a Republican and a b\u00eate noire to Democrats, insists that illegal voting, especially by undocumented immigrants, is unchecked and mostly undetected. He has called Mr. Trump\u2019s claim plausible.Republicans scrambled to distance themselves from the letter\u2019s call for private data like birthdates and partial Social Security numbers without impugning their president\u2019s claim or his commission. But giving the claim credibility placed them in the awkward position of saying either that other secretaries had overlooked millions of illegal votes, or that they had found them and lied about it.Asked at a news conference on Friday whether Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion of millions of illegal votes was credible, one of the Democratic secretaries of state on the White House panel, Matthew Dunlap of Maine, said that he \u201cwould be stunned to see a number anywhere near that.\u201d He noted that he had failed to find a single verifiable case of fraud in his 11 years on the job.Ms. Lawson, the Indiana secretary of state and a Republican on the commission, gave a more contorted response. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t get by with it in Indiana,\u201d she said, but \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what happens in other states.\u201d Asked whether she personally believed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, she repeated her answer.To be sure, the meeting remains a somewhat green-eyeshade affair, and there is no shortage of agreement on certain matters; after belated revelations that Russian hackers breached at least one state\u2019s election computers, the secretaries were united in calling for the federal government to tell them when their data is at risk.Some Democrats say the tenor worsened after Mr. Kobach arrived in 2011, and Republican-controlled legislatures began enacting laws to require more proof of identity when registering and casting ballots. \u201cI still remember my first voter participation meeting in which he was talking about what he was doing in Kansas to root out voter fraud,\u201d said Denise W. Merrill, the Connecticut secretary of state. \u201cAnd I remember saying out loud, \u2018I thought we were here talking about how to get more voters to participate, not fewer.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd everybody laughed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t really funny.\u201dMr. Kobach did not attend the weekend meeting and could not be reached for comment.Mr. Trump\u2019s election and his voter fraud claim since have brought strains to the surface. At the organization\u2019s last meeting in February, Mr. Padilla and other Democrats pressed the secretaries to adopt a resolution refuting the claim. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats and Republicans were saying the same thing: \u2018It\u2019s not true,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we came together as a group, they wouldn\u2019t go on the record.\u201dThe organization has its peacemakers. Colorado\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Wayne Williams, said he believed that some news accounts had exaggerated both the effect of Mr. Kobach\u2019s request for voter records, which made clear that compliance was voluntary, and the backlash by election officials. Remarks by some secretaries, whom he declined to name, had not helped, he added.\u201cThose of us in the leadership are working to ensure that we can still work well together on the issues on which we can agree,\u201d said Mr. Williams, a moderate who has not echoed Mr. Kobach\u2019s call for tighter constraints on registering and voting.A test of that willingness to agree could come on Monday, when Mr. Padilla is expected to introduce a resolution taking issue with Mr. Kobach\u2019s commission and its dragnet for data.\u201cMost secretaries are saying the right things\u201d in public, Mr. Padilla said, by raising doubts about seeking voters\u2019 data and storing it on federal government servers. \u201cLet\u2019s see if they have the backbone to do it as a group.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Power Authority Effectively Files for Bankruptcy", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rico\u2019s troubled power company defaulted on a deal to restructure roughly $9 billion in bond debt and sought court protection from its creditors, the government said on Sunday.Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, which announced the move, said it did not expect any disruption of service to Prepa\u2019s residential or commercial customers on the island.Bondholders had hoped that Prepa\u2019s debt could be reduced consensually, as planned. Some questioned the legality of moving into federal court to redo the deal.Bill Fallon, the chief executive of National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, a bond insurer, called the move \u201cimproper\u201d and warned that it \u201cwould leave Prepa years away from attracting the private investment necessary to modernize.\u201dElectrical power has long been a drag on the island\u2019s economy. Prepa\u2019s antiquated generating plants burn imported oil to produce electricity. Efforts to modernize the plants and shift to clean and renewable fuels have been delayed repeatedly. Customers pay rates that follow oil prices up and down, and while the rates are relatively low at the moment, they are vulnerable to rising again.In addition, there are longstanding accusations that Prepa\u2019s fuel-purchasing office for many years bought dirty oil sludge as fuel, charged consumers the much higher price of cleaner distillates, and then created a slush fund with the difference. The Puerto Rican senate held a series of hearings on Prepa\u2019s fuel-purchasing irregularities, and has referred its findings to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Prepa got into severe financial trouble before the rest of the Puerto Rican government, when it was unable to pay for fuel in 2014. Its creditors extended fuel-purchasing credit that year, and subsequently negotiated a deal to restructure about $5.7 billion of Prepa\u2019s $9 billion in total debt.The deal was held up as a model at the time, because it was achieved without the sort of leverage that can be exerted in bankruptcy. In addition to taking a 15 percent loss, the bondholders had agreed that Prepa could put a portion of the savings toward its long-promised modernization and conversion to cleaner sources of power.But the agreement also called for Prepa to continue paying down its remaining debt by adding an unpopular increase in power customers\u2019 monthly bills. It also required the restructured debt to be secured to an investment-grade rating, an insurmountable challenge with the island\u2019s central government itself effectively bankrupt, and its economy in a painful decline.Last week, the federal oversight board that is guiding Puerto Rico\u2019s finances voted to authorize Prepa to seek debt relief under Title III of Promesa, which is similar to Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy. Natalie Jaresko, the board\u2019s executive director, said then that talks could continue, and the utility\u2019s bondholders said they still hoped to pursue the consensual deal. They also offered to cover a $170 million interest payment that Prepa was required to make to bondholders on Saturday.But Prepa declined that offer, defaulting on the payment and paving the way for the move on Sunday for court protection.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Smaller Housing Markets Lure Individual Investors", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by360 ViewAfter Andrew Bahr, a structural engineer, lost a bidding war last fall for a two-bedroom apartment in Queens, he decided he was done trying to buy real estate in New York.\u201cI was tired of looking around me and seeing all the home prices shooting up and I\u2019m not getting a piece of that pie,\u201d said Mr. Bahr, 26, who was stunned when a buyer offered $15,000 more than his $345,000 bid on the apartment in Jackson Heights.Rather than wait for another apartment to come along, or save more money, he turned his gaze well beyond the city limits, all the way to Atlanta. On March 1, he bought a four-bedroom house there for $100,000.In doing so, he traded in the dream of living in a home he owns for a chance to turn a profit.A tenant lives in his Atlanta house, paying $1,050 a month \u2014 enough for Mr. Bahr to pocket $400 each month after paying his mortgage, taxes and property management fees. Mr. Bahr lives in Jackson Heights, in a studio he rents for $1,467 a month. \u201cWe live in the wrong state, we definitely do,\u201d he said.Mr. Bahr\u2019s unconventional path to ownership is one that was carved in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. After millions of distressed homes flooded the market across the country, some large institutional investors, like Blackstone, began buying and transforming single-family homes \u2014 a symbol of American upward mobility \u2014 into rental properties.In exchange, Mr. Bahr can be a landlord at arm\u2019s length. He has never visited his property and does not know the name or occupation of the person who rents it. \u201cSometimes I wish I was more involved,\u201d he said. \u201cA big part of my savings went into that property, and I feel like I should help out, but they\u2019re doing it all for me.\u201dDon Ganguly, the chief executive of HomeUnion, which started in 2014, said that most HomeUnion investors live in expensive coastal markets, like San Francisco and New York, where salaries are high but so are housing costs. Their dollars go further in smaller markets, like Indianapolis, Dallas and Orlando.The need to look farther afield for what is affordable is common for New Yorkers just searching for a place to live. Can\u2019t afford to live in Brooklyn Heights? Give Bedford-Stuyvesant a try. If all of Brooklyn is out of your budget, welcome to New Jersey.It turns out that aspiring investors face a similar conundrum. The mom-and-pop landlord who may have bought a rental property around the corner a decade ago now also needs to look farther, and since there is no need to actually live in the home, that net can be cast far and wide.\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s an extension of the search for affordability in New York,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants. \u201cThis becomes another leap.\u201dBut there is a difference between moving with your family to the suburbs and buying a house that is a plane ride away and occupied by a stranger. Buying a property that you may never see changes your relationship with it. Mr. Ganguly, who was initially surprised by how few HomeUnion investors flew out to see the houses they were about to buy, compared the process to buying stocks. \u201cThey flipped the switch in their head to say, \u2018It\u2019s an asset,\u2019\u201d he said.Like stocks, a house may appreciate in value over the years, while rental income offers a steady return in the short term. On HomeUnion\u2019s website, listings include detailed projections for returns. The company estimates that, on average, investors who put down 20 percent on a property and hold it for 15 years can expect annual returns of 11 to 19 percent, a figure that includes rental income, appreciation and increased equity.But buying a house is hardly the same as buying stock in a company. Stocks don\u2019t have roofs that leak or tenants who stop paying the rent \u2014 and stocks don\u2019t come with monthly mortgage bills.HomeUnion recommends that its investors set aside $1,000 per property in a reserve fund. However, $1,000 will not necessarily cover the cost of a boiler breaking the same month that a tenant moves out. If you lose your job or have other financial strains, you could be a paycheck away from trouble, even if your property is appreciating on paper.\u201cThe possibility of a surprise $5,000 fee is always there,\u201d said Callum Runcie, 42, who lives in Port Washington, N.Y., with his family and who owns three investment properties through HomeUnion. He earns about $2,000 a month on the portfolio. An air-conditioner recently broke at one of his properties, and he was waiting to hear back on the repair cost. \u201cThey said it\u2019s kind of a big deal,\u201d he said, referring to the property managers at HomeUnion. When a tenant moved out of one property, Mr. Runcie spent $2,000 on renovations while the home was vacant for two months.Investing in a market that you do not know, and relying on a third party to manage the property, requires research, and trust in the company providing the information. \u201cThe biggest risk, if you\u2019re investing in real estate, is that the house doesn\u2019t appreciate,\u201d said Nela Richardson, the chief economist for Redfin. \u201cNot having local expertise is like going in blind.\u201dHomeUnion offers local market reports and listings that include details about local salaries, rents and demographics. Mr. Bahr read up on Georgia tenant laws before he purchased his home to make sure that he could easily remove a difficult tenant, if necessary. And, he has relatives who live in the Atlanta area, which made him feel more confident about it.Ultimately, Mr. Bahr sees Atlanta as a more realistic option than the market where he lives. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to be able to own a home in New York, unless my salary doubles,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to wait 20 or 30 years for that to happen.\u201dInstead of waiting on New York, he is planning to buy a second rental property in Atlanta.Advertisement"}

Without revealing any specifics, he said, \u201cwe have to ask ourselves: What do we have to believe to get the returns that we expect?\u201dOne of his first moves as chief executive was to announce that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China, avoiding the cost of building a plant for it in North America. Ford had planned to build a $1.5 billion plant in Mexico but canceled it before Mr. Hackett took the helm.Over all, Ford reported net income of $2.04 billion in the period ending June 30, an increase of almost 4 percent from the same period a year ago, as Ford Credit reported a 57 percent jump in profits. Ford also cut its tax bill by taking advantage of credits from previous losses in overseas markets.

Industrywide, auto sales are slowing in the United States, and Ford\u2019s North American auto division generated pretax profit of $2.2 billion last quarter, a 19 percent drop from a year ago. It produced 841,000 cars and trucks in the quarter, but made only $2,614 in profit on each one, on average, down from $3,206 in the second quarter of 2016.After the earnings report, Ford shares opened lower and stayed down for the rest of the day. It closed down 1.9 percent, to $11.06 a share.Ford\u2019s difficulties will probably continue. The company said it planned to make 665,000 cars and trucks in the third quarter of this year, about 5 percent fewer than the year-ago period.In Europe, Ford\u2019s profit plunged to $88 million, down from $379 million a year ago. It blamed disruptions from Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union, unfavorable exchange rates and the cost of introducing a new Fiesta compact, an important model in that region.Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich., made money in Asia but suffered a loss in South America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Baker\u2019s Crusade: Rescuing the Famed French Boulangerie", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAP FERRET, France \u2014 Pascal Rigo was just 7 when he fell in love with baking. Summering with his family here on the Atlantic coast, he began an apprenticeship in a small boulangerie, one of dozens that dotted L\u00e8ge-Cap-Ferret, a spit of land about an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Bordeaux.Over the years, as he built a fortune in the baking business in the United States, one boulangerie after another closed until there was only one left in this tiny town at the tip of the peninsula where he has a home \u2014 a turn of events Mr. Rigo considers an affront to French baking.His opinion of that bakery\u2019s bread isn\u2019t much higher. \u201cPeople say the French are eating less bread because of gluten-free, because of low-carb,\u201d Mr. Rigo said, sitting in a cafe here and dunking a flaky croissant into a hot chocolate made the French way, with melted chocolate diluted by warm milk. \u201cBut bread like that \u2014 that is the reason.\u201dAnd so Mr. Rigo, an ebullient baker with a seemingly perpetual gaptoothed grin, has embarked on a personal crusade to rescue this pillar of French cuisine one bakery at a time, starting here with La P\u2019tite Boulangerie du Ferret, a shop that he opened last summer. He sees it as the first in a nationwide chain of what he calls microboulangeries.He has also started scouting for shuttered boulangeries in small towns, hoping to overhaul their finances and reopen them. The plan is to connect young bakers to defunct bakeries in communities with 2,000 or more people, 20 to 30 miles from a major city.\u201cBread is part of our heritage,\u201d said Mr. Rigo, evoking the popular demand for bread that prompted the infamous phrase \u201cLet them eat cake\u201d during the French Revolution. \u201cI\u2019d like to restore that for my country.\u201d\u201cThe problem is with the economics of the boulangerie, not the bread,\u201d Mr. Rigo said. \u201cI\u2019m going to show that you can make good bread and good money.\u201dAfter much study, he has determined that the old business model simply doesn\u2019t work anymore. \u201cThe real estate would cost 400,000 euros, and then they had to buy equipment, so by the time they opened, the average boulanger was 800,000 euros in the red,\u201d he said. \u201cThey then would be working 20 hours a day because they couldn\u2019t afford to hire anyone to help them, and still, they had trouble turning any profit.\u201dHe plans to get around that problem by shrinking each store, reducing the number of people needed to run it, buying ingredients centrally to enhance the shops\u2019 bargaining power and limiting the number of products sold. \u201cTo try to make profit, boulangers were trying to sell anything and everything, instead of trying to sell more of the things people really want \u2014 the baguettes des copains, the ficelles, the boules,\u201d Mr. Rigo said.To make matters worse, the mills that for years supplied flour to French bakers started becoming competitors in the 1990s, investing in chain bakeries that pump out pain quotidien on an industrial scale often using preformed frozen dough.\u201cThey would sell two baguettes for the price of one, three for the price of two, things like that, and soon, every time a Marie Blach\u00e8re store opened\u201d \u2014 part of a large chain of mill-backed bakeries \u2014 \u201cthree boulangeries in three small towns would close,\u201d Mr. Rigo said.The number of boulangeries in France dropped to 28,000 in 2015, from 37,800 just 20 years earlier. Alexander Goransson, the author of a 2014 report on bread in France and a lead analyst at Euromonitor, a research firm, said that rate has slowed during the past decade, although bakeries continue to close.Mr. Goransson said Mr. Rigo may be putting his plan in motion at just the right time, because more French consumers are showing an interest in high-quality breads \u2014 they call them \u201cartisanale\u201d \u2014 that use minimal ingredients and are baked fresh.On a blustery, overcast Friday morning, Virginie De Laval was picking up four baguettes at La P\u2019tite Boulangerie in Cap Ferret. \u201cI\u2019m buying it because it\u2019s good bread,\u201d she said.She said she sometimes purchased supermarket bread, but only in a pinch. \u201cI think people today are returning more and more to foods that are artisanal, without preservatives and other ingredients that are unfamiliar,\u201d Ms. De Laval said. \u201cThere\u2019s a better appreciation of the way things were done in the past.\u201dOver a span of two hours, 67 customers \u2014 just 600 people live here during the off-season \u2014 pulled up to the tiny bakery to buy baguettes, chewy ficelles and buttery croissants, all made by Maud Moinard, 23, the boulanger who runs the 290-square-foot space.She has all the equipment she needs \u2014 a water chiller, a mixer, an oven, a sink, a proofer, big sacks of flour and a refrigerator, built in under the classic marble display case \u2014 and works her doughs while she sells the breads. She knows her customers so well that before many even step out of their cars, she is already twisting a piece of thin, noisy brown paper around their customary purchases.\u201cSure, it\u2019s sometimes busy doing sales and baking, too, but that\u2019s how I know what I need to make,\u201d Ms. Moinard said.The bakery sold a daily average of 2,000 baguettes des copains last summer, until volume dropped to about 400 when the vacationers left, Mr. Rigo said. In comparison, Mr. Rigo\u2019s La Boulangerie shops in San Francisco each sell about 50 baguettes daily.La P\u2019tite Boulangerie also sells sandwiches and pastries made in a patisserie Mr. Rigo has opened in Cap Ferret, where traditional sweets are made with a local twist. A classic g\u00e2teau Basque, for instance, is made with pine nuts that grow in the forests here and a Bordeaux rum, and is playfully called G\u00e2teau Presque Basque, or \u201cnearly\u201d a g\u00e2teau Basque. And there are a few imports: The shop sells bags of the granola that is a hit at his San Francisco shops.Carole Garcia, the town\u2019s adjutant mayor, stopped in to buy a couple of savory ficelles to enjoy with aperitifs that evening, and sampled a bite of the g\u00e2teau. She said she buys loaves from the other boulangeries here as well \u2014 \u201crelationships, you know; I\u2019m adjutant mayor\u201d \u2014 but the P\u2019tite Boulangerie bread is \u201cwithout comparison.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like bread used to be,\u201d she said.Ms. Garcia has known Mr. Rigo for years. He and his business partners here played soccer together when they were children, and he has become something of a local celebrity as the boy who left home and made good.He grew up east of here in Paillet, where his mother was the postmaster. The family spent summers in Cap Ferret; Mr. Rigo apprenticed here and at two other French bakeries.Soon Mr. Rigo also was making breads for restaurants like L\u2019Hermitage and the dining room at the Checkers hotel, where Thomas Keller was chef. \u201cWe were making bread for about 70 of the best restaurants in Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Rigo said. \u201cIt was hard work, but fun.\u201dHe relocated to the Bay Area to be close to the bakery, which he still owns, and soon opened the La Boulange chain. The shops were supplied in part by his commercial kitchen, but they also had their own kitchens, and they fast developed a passionate fan base. By the time he sold the business to Starbucks in 2013, La Boulange was 23 stores, and the commercial bakery had 1,500 employees creating products for retailers like Trader Joe\u2019s and Costco.Mr. Rigo then took on another job that seemed folly to Wall Street and many Starbucks consumers: helping the coffee giant retool its baked goods, which were notoriously bad. This meant finding commercial kitchens around the country that could match the quality of his own, and finding space in Starbucks stores for ovens to heat the products.The experience left Mr. Rigo deflated and defensive. Even though many of the new baked goods sold well, he said, he felt the company was hesitant to put its marketing heft behind them. \u201cNo matter how big the improvements were that we made \u2014 and the improvements were significant \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to talk about them because they didn\u2019t want Wall Street to think they were a food company,\u201d Mr. Rigo said.(Asked to respond to that criticism, Sanja Gould, a spokeswoman for Starbucks, noted comments made late last year to Wall Street analysts and investors by Sharon Rothstein, the company\u2019s global chief marketing officer. \u201cOur food platform represents the biggest growth opportunity for our business,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said.)Since then, much of Munchery\u2019s management has changed, and the business has turned around, said Baochi Nguyen, its vice president for marketing. \u201cThere are distinctions between food delivery models,\u201d Ms. Nguyen wrote in an email. \u201cSome are proving to be not as effective at scale, while others, like Munchery, are yielding really promising results.\u201dBy the time Mr. Rigo left Munchery, he had decided to open La P\u2019tite Boulangerie here.He and his wife, Virginie, have begun spending more time in Cap Ferret now that their three children are older. He is known for tooling around town on his bicycle in shorts, whatever the weather. \u201cI never take the car when I\u2019m here \u2014 it\u2019s much more fun to get around by bicycle,\u201d he said.He issues a steady stream of ideas: a drive-through pizza business in California, how to obtain organic ingredients for the best price. \u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cI have too much energy as it is.\u201dOne of his most ambitious plans is to open a training school for young bakers here to ensure a ready supply of boulangers. If the students go on to open boulangeries in small towns, Mr. Rigo and his partners will provide financing packages that will allow those students to own up to 70 percent of their businesses.\u201cI really think we can become the biggest smallest business in France,\u201d he said.An article last Wednesday about the baker Pascal Rigo\u2019s plan to start a chain of boulangeries in France misstated the surname of an executive of Starbucks, which bought a business from Mr. Rigo. She is Sharon Rothstein, not Rothman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber\u2019s Tax Calculation May Have Cost Drivers Hundreds of Millions", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivers\u2019 trip receipts contain signs that the ride-hailing service deducted hundreds of millions of dollars from drivers\u2019 earnings in New York to pay state taxes.But even as Uber makes a concerted effort to win over drivers, it has not acknowledged all the ways it may have squeezed them in New York State.The following are signs that the ride-hailing service improperly deducted what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars from drivers\u2019 earnings to pay taxes that, under New York State law, are technically due from passengers:Uber has insisted there was nothing improper in its handling of the taxes. Here is a look at the law and the evidence on the question \u2014 including the way a major competitor, Lyft, deals with the same issue.\u2022\u00a0A 2.5 percent surcharge\u00a0for a state workers\u2019 compensation fund.The subtraction of taxes from the fare a driver receives does not in itself demonstrate that drivers were paying the tax. Uber officials argue that the $19.16 metered fare already included the tax \u2014\u00a0the same way a $1 slice of pizza includes tax\u00a0\u2014 and that it was therefore proper for Uber to collect the tax by subtracting it from the fare that drivers receive and remitting it to the government.In 2015, Uber began reflecting this approach on its passenger receipts as well, so that a passenger would see that the fare paid included sales tax and the workers' compensation surcharge. (In a quirk of Uber\u2019s system, the sales tax shown has sometimes been calculated on a passenger fare generated before the ride that doesn't necessarily match the metered fare \u2014\u00a0as appears to have happened in this case.)In practice, the way a company displays a tax on its receipts doesn\u2019t demonstrate one way or another whether a driver or a passenger actually pays the tax.To determine who\u2019s really paying in a case like this, one must determine whether the price the company charges passengers truly includes the tax. If it doesn\u2019t, then the passenger isn\u2019t paying the tax \u2014 the driver is, regardless of what the passenger receipt indicates.There is growing evidence that Uber\u2019s fares in New York were not tax-inclusive.One way to see this is to\u00a0compare\u00a0how Uber accounted for trips in New York with\u00a0how it accounted for trips in other states\u00a0that levy a tax.In Nevada, which levies a 3 percent tax on Uber rides \u2014 formally an excise tax \u2014 the metered fare listed on trip receipts did not include the tax. Instead,\u00a0that tax was added on top of the fare, so that the passenger paid the fare the driver received, plus the tax. The receipt from this trip\u00a0from Reno to Carson City\u00a0shows a $1.36 \u201ctransportation recovery charge\u201d \u2014 that is, the tax \u2014 added on top of the $42.67 fare. Both were paid by the passenger.This stands in stark contrast to the way Uber has operated in New York, where the company would typically have deducted the tax from the $42.67 fare the driver received, and the passenger would not have had to pay an additional amount for taxes.Receipts from Rhode Island, another state with a sales tax, showed that Uber added the tax on top of the fare the driver received there. Uber declined to comment for this article. The sales tax issue is being litigated as part of a lawsuit against Uber filed by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a driver\u2019s advocacy group.New York levies the tax only on trips that begin and end in the state; a trip that begins in New York and ends in Connecticut, for example, would not be subject to the tax. Yet Uber calculated the overall fare using the same base fare and the same time and distance rate on those trips, suggesting that the tax was not included.Compare two trips using Uber\u2019s black car service from August 2016, one beginning and ending in New York, and the other from New York to Connecticut. The two trips included the same fare components:\u2022\u00a0A base fare of $7.\u2022\u00a0$3.75 per mile.But Uber deducted no sales tax from the latter trip.Aug. 14, 2016Uber deducted $13.91 in sales tax and $3.93 for the workers\u2019 compensation surcharge from the total fare.Aug. 3, 2016\u2022\u00a0Total = $180.48Uber deducted no sales tax. (It deducted $4.30 for the workers\u2019 compensation surcharge because that is still assessed on interstate trips.)When asked about this, Uber has said that tax was in fact included in both fares, and drivers simply received a windfall payment on trips that ended in another state because no tax was removed from the fare.Uber\u2019s nationwide contract is perhaps the strongest indication that the company improperly made drivers rather than passengers bear the burden of the sales tax mandated by New York State.Before Uber updated it in late May, the contract appeared to give Uber permission to remove only its commission (known as the service fee) from the fare its drivers receive, stating that \u201cUber agrees to remit, or cause to be remitted, to customer on at least a weekly basis: (a) the fare less the applicable service fee.\u201d (\u201cCustomer\u201d is the term Uber typically uses in its contract to refer to drivers; passengers are referred to as \u201cusers.\u201d)Until 2014, the contract defined the fare as \u201cthe amount (including applicable taxes and fees) that the transportation company is entitled to charge the user for the ride, based on the recommended fares for the city.\u201dThis version appears consistent with Uber\u2019s tax-inclusive explanation \u2014 it is essentially the $1 pizza slice approach.But in November 2014, Uber made two changes to its contract that, together, made its meaning more ambiguous. First, it added language saying that some jurisdictions might \u201crequire taxes to be imputed in the fare\u201d \u2014 further supporting the tax-inclusive explanation. Second, it revised its definition of a fare to omit the parenthetical phrase \u201cincluding applicable taxes and fees,\u201d suggesting that the company was rethinking whether the fare should always include taxes in jurisdictions that levy them. The two changes seemed to be at odds. But when Uber revised its contract in December 2015, it appeared to resolve the ambiguity, replacing the \u201cimputed\u201d language with a reference to taxes \u201ccalculated on the fare.\u201d At this point, the contract defined the fare as including only a base fare and a time and distance component, with no mention of taxes.Collectively, the changes made in November 2014 and December 2015 appeared to indicate that the fare did not include taxes, and that the only amount Uber could subtract from this fare was its commission. The contract appeared to preclude the subtraction of taxes. But in New York, Uber deducted taxes and the workers\u2019 compensation surcharge from the fares that drivers received.According to data from New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission, Uber dispatched more than 125 million rides in the city from the beginning of 2015 to mid-March 2017. Assuming an average fare on those trips of at least $15, Uber would have deducted over $200 million for taxes and the workers\u2019 compensation fund surcharge from drivers during that time.The assumption of an average fare in excess of $15 appears reasonable: Uber calculated that the average fare for its lowest-cost service, Uber X, was over $27 in September 2014; it has dropped prices by about 15 percent since then. Uber also has higher-cost services, like Uber Black and Uber SUV, which have substantially higher fares on average.In a 2014 email to New York drivers announcing the additional charge, which appears to have been 10 percent initially, Lyft wrote: \u201cNYC\u2019s regulations have different requirements than anywhere else, since they collect both an 8 percent local sales tax as well as a 2 percent fee for the Black Car Fund. To cover these costs, we will be adding 10 percent to Lyft\u2019s commission.\u201dThe increase in the commission to largely offset taxes suggests that drivers are effectively paying most of the sales tax, even if they don\u2019t do so directly. But Lyft says the law allows this as long as it imposes the charge transparently.\u201cOur driver agreement, which we\u2019ve consistently abided by since entering the New York market in 2014, clearly\u00a0lays out what commissions and fees apply to driving on the Lyft platform,\u201d said Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman.\u00a0\u201cWe do not collect sales tax from drivers.\u201dUnlike Uber, Lyft deducts the additional 11.4 percent from what drivers receive even when there is no sales tax \u2014 as when a ride begins in New York and ends in Connecticut. This would appear to be a more egregious deduction, since it amounts to a transfer from the driver to Lyft\u2019s bottom line, with no tax rationale to support it. But Lyft denies that the 11.4 percent charge funds tax payments specifically, as opposed to offsetting a number of costs. Finally, like Uber, Lyft has accounted for sales tax differently in other states than it does in New York. In some other states that levy a tax, Lyft has assessed the tax on top of the fare the driver receives, making clear that the passenger pays it, and raising questions about the accounting in New York. Allan Fromberg, an official with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, wrote in an email that the agency had been examining the way Uber deducts the state-mandated sales tax and workers\u2019 compensation surcharge from fares, as well as the way the company took its commission. Mr. Fromberg said the inquiry had been going on for weeks before Uber\u2019s acknowledgment in late May that it had erred in how it took its commission.A representative of the New York State Department of Labor, when asked in May whether the department had looked into improper sales tax deductions or planned to do so, responded that the department \u201chas not received any complaints on this issue.\u201d Assemblyman Robert Rodriguez, who represents East Harlem, has written to the state attorney general and the state Department of Taxation and Finance calling for an investigation into Lyft\u2019s practice of deducting 11.4 percent from driver earnings on rides that begin in New York and end out of state. When asked about the possibility that Uber and Lyft had improperly deducted sales tax on in-state rides, he said that, if true, \u201cthat\u2019s a much higher level of magnitude.\u201d He said that state and city regulators should look into the handling of taxes and that \u201cif it hasn\u2019t been done correctly, they\u201d \u2014 Uber and Lyft \u2014 \u201cshould fix it and make amends.\u201d Kimberley McGee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaign Opposition Research Is Standard. But Not \u2018Oppo\u2019 From Hostile Nations.", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe younger Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that pursuing material that could prove useful against a political opponent is standard practice in campaigns. But while opposition research is part of modern presidential campaigns, it normally does not come from representatives of a hostile foreign power.Here is how the peddling of opposition research \u2014 or oppo, as political professionals and reporters call it \u2014 typically works.One of President Bill Clinton\u2019s favorite Arkansas political sayings was, \u201cIf you see a turtle on a fence post, it didn\u2019t get there by accident.\u201dMany campaign accusations and revelatory news stories about a candidate or elected official are the fruits of what is euphemistically called the research division of campaigns and political parties, where low-profile aides search for dirt.\u201cThe crackpots get routed to research,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, a veteran Democratic practitioner of the dark arts of oppo.Much of the job is fielding too-good-to-be-true (or simply unverifiable) charges via furtive phone calls, manila envelopes and untraceable email accounts. Working in the Democratic National Committee\u2019s research department in the 2004 campaign, Ms. Sefl recalled meeting a woman with a story to tell about President George W. Bush.\u201cShe said she worked as a dancer and accused President Bush of doing very specific drug-related activities on her,\u201d Ms. Sefl said. The accuser offered no proof, and the Democrats could do little but share the tale with one another.\u201cI told people when asking about the issue only that I was responsible for the popular vote and left the Electoral College for others,\u201d he cheekily said in 2010 after the Bush strategist Karl Rove published a memoir that accused him of being the man behind the story.And those unflattering stories about the Clinton Foundation in this past campaign? Yes, some of them originated with Republican researchers.In some cases, the provenance of the leaks remains murky. Mr. Obama, for example, might never have been elected to the Senate in 2004 were it not for damaging revelations about his rivals and their divorces.Secondary source opposition research largely consists of so-called votes-and-quotes \u2014 a political figure\u2019s policy positions and past comments that have appeared in the news media. The material may lack the shock effect of original material, but it can be just as memorable.It was the sort of story that, by the standards of an earlier political era, counted as peculiar behavior.The back-and-forth between news source and reporter over opposition research can recall adolescent flirtation: initial awkwardness, then apprehension over whether there is mutual interest \u2014 and neither party wants the world to find out the details of the courtship.A reporter would rather not be identified as being spoon-fed information. Most sources do not want their dirty work to splash back on their candidate or party. So both parties have an interest in keeping a story\u2019s genesis under wraps.After a reporter agrees not to reveal the identity of the source, the reporter and his or her editors or producers will confer about whether they are interested in pursuing a story about the material on offer.If the news organization is interested, there is one last issue: how to identify the source. References can be made to \u201ca rival candidate\u2019s campaign\u201d or more obliquely \u201ca source familiar with the dirt\u201d or even the bare-bones \u201csources say.\u201dThere is only one known historical parallel to the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with the Russians, and it involves Richard M. Nixon. Running for president in 1968, Nixon told H. R. Haldeman, his eventual White House chief of staff, to \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d peace talks in Vietnam in order to scuttle any deal that would have handed Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic nominee, a political victory in the closing days of the election.Nixon, a former senator and vice president, had a relationship with the South Vietnamese government. Earlier in the year, he had met with the country\u2019s ambassador and brought along Anna Chennault, a prominent Chinese-American Republican. As the author John A. Farrell writes in his new book, \u201cRichard Nixon: The Life,\u201d which reports the \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d instructions, the call between Nixon and Haldeman took place on Oct. 22, 1968, and Haldeman dutifully jotted down what he was told.A group of aides to Ronald Reagan did meet in the fall of 1980 with an individual claiming to be an emissary from the Iranian government, but that person\u2019s legitimacy was never determined.Moscow has, however, tried to meddle in previous American elections. The historian Michael R. Beschloss recounts in \u201cThe Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960-1963\u201d an account of the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Kennedy presidency, that the Soviet ambassador in Washington secretly reached out to both John F. Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson, another Democratic presidential hopeful, during the 1960 campaign. The ambassador was rebuffed by both candidates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Different Cultures, One Modern Marriage", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsBrittney Middleton was not looking for love when she met Ikenna Ogike, who is known as Ike, at the Couture nightclub in Los Angeles in October 2014.She had recently ended a six-year relationship with a man she had dated since attending the University of South Carolina. And she had more than enough to keep her occupied managing the business and personal affairs of her brother, Khris Middleton, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association.\u201cI was too busy to date,\u201d said Ms. Middleton, 29, who was born in Shreveport, La., and raised in Charleston, S.C. She had moved to Los Angeles in 2012 to pursue a career in sports and entertainment management when the job with her brother opened up. \u201cI was traveling a great deal with Khris for the N.B.A.,\u201d she said, \u201cand not thinking about romance.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t hanging around clubs, either. \u201cI rarely sit around in clubs, and after an hour, I was ready to leave,\u201d Ms. Middleton said, recalling that night at the Couture. \u201cShortly after my friend convinced me to stay a little longer, Ike walked in, and we made eye contact.\u201dWhen Mr. Ogike spotted Ms. Middleton, he felt she looked out of place. \u201cI liked that she was wearing a ruffled and pleated outfit instead of the usual short and tight attire worn by many L.A. girls,\u201d said Mr. Ogike, 39, who was born in Nigeria and operates a State Farm insurance agency in North Hollywood.\u201cI bought her a drink, and we talked for a while. She was reserved yet attractive and interesting.\u201dMs. Middleton said she \u201cliked his accent and thought he was cool, established and mature. He reminded me of a well-mannered guy from the South.\u201dThey exchanged phone numbers, and two days later, Mr. Ogike, who was ready for a relationship after years of bachelorhood, texted her. Their first date was on the rooftop at Wokcano, a restaurant in Santa Monica. Although Ms. Middleton was sick with tonsillitis, they shared Asian-fusion food, listened to music and chatted about work, family and dating in Los Angeles.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel butterflies that night, but I was intrigued,\u201d Ms. Middleton said. \u201cIke\u2019s mature viewpoints on life were refreshing, but I wondered why he never married.\u201dArranged marriages were part of Mr. Ogike\u2019s Nigerian culture, and he had met some women through introductions. But after 21 years in this country, he had assimilated to American ways and had seen how couples from varying cultures could be happy together.\u201cEven though Brittney wasn\u2019t Nigerian, which I originally wanted in a partner because it\u2019s easier, she spoke well, and I liked talking to her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she acted nonchalant and didn\u2019t show much emotion. I felt she wasn\u2019t into me.\u201dSo nothing happened for three weeks. When Mr. Ogike eventually texted her, she responded by expressing her displeasure for not being contacted sooner. \u201cI thought: \u2018Wow! She must like me,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ogike, and he quickly asked her to go bowling.They met in Studio City and had fun just being themselves. \u201cWe talked trash, were casual and let our hair down,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he kissed me good night by my car, I started to fall.\u201dThe couple began dating at least twice a week. He sent her flowers and cupcakes, and they talked constantly when not at the beach, movies or dinner, where they bonded over food.\u201cI liked the way he treated me, opening my door and talking about serious issues,\u201d Ms. Middleton said. \u201cI found him to be mature with an in-depth ability to discuss the stock market, finance, family and our different cultures.\u201dMr. Ogike liked Ms. Middleton\u2019s independent streak and feisty manner. \u201cHer hopes and dreams aligned with mine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both loved family, wanted children and experiences like travel, sports and dining in restaurants.\u201dIn December, when Mr. Ogike flew to Nigeria for his sister\u2019s wedding, they sent pictures and talked daily via FaceTime. \u201cHis commitment to me while he was in his home country made me realize that I was in love with him,\u201d said Ms. Middleton, who sent him a video professing it.But when he returned to Los Angeles in January 2015, the mood changed. Mr. Ogike had contracted malaria. He was also still struggling with the death of his mother a few years earlier.\u201cIke was awful and nasty, wanting his mother because he was sick,\u201d Ms. Middleton said, adding that while she sympathized with his feelings, she thought he should have dealt with his illness better. \u201cI grabbed my bag and left his apartment.\u201dHe entered the hospital, complaining that Ms. Middleton was insensitive. \u201cI was ill and didn\u2019t think she cared enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter texting each other, she came back sobbing, telling me that she was a great girl, and that I won\u2019t ever meet anyone like her again.\u201cThat defining moment,\u201d he continued, \u201cwas the first time I knew I would someday make her my wife.\u201dBut there were challenges to overcome. Mr. Ogike still embraced certain aspects of his Nigerian culture, like not wrapping Christmas gifts and playing down birthdays. (Ms. Middleton loves birthdays.) He also speaks in the native Igbo language to his father, a retired college professor, and other family members who live in California. (\u201cI felt left out,\u201d she said.) And he favors traditional Nigerian foods like goat meat, chewy chicken, rice and soups. (Ms. Middleton wasn\u2019t a fan.)Ms. Middleton also noted that the Nigerian culture favored traditional roles for men and women. \u201cNigerian men expect to lead, with the woman being a caretaker,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom and dad both worked, and my dad did child-rearing, too. Ike\u2019s family was not like that.\u201dBut they learned to understand each other, often resolving any conflicts the same day.\u201cIke is an uneasy guy who feels at home with Brittney because she is down-to-earth and humble,\u201d said Obi Dukes, a groomsman. \u201cHe was never that close to any girl before. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch them together.\u201dIn August 2015, Ms. Middleton complained of \u201cfeeling funny\u201d and soon learned that she was pregnant.\u201cThis was a total shock to me because it was so soon, and I thought Brittney was on birth control,\u201d Mr. Ogike said. \u201cWhile we had talked about having three children after we married, I never wanted a child out of wedlock.\u201dMs. Middleton was equally surprised. \u201cWe both freaked out, went through shock, grief and periods alone to think and evaluate for a couple of days,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he was very supportive. And since we were committed to each other, we resolved to make it work.\u201dStill, telling her family was daunting. Her brother-employer thought the baby would make their lives more hectic. But because they had \u201csuch a great comfort level, that would make it work,\u201d Khris Middleton said.Her mother, Nichelle Middleton, took the news well. \u201cBrittney was educated and could take care of herself and the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI was O.K. with it. One just came before the other.\u201dTwo months later, the couple moved in together. While they split the household chores, cooking, another traditional aspect of the Nigerian household, presented problems. Each took turns preparing meals, though it didn\u2019t come naturally for Ms. Middleton. But Mr. Ogike got over it. \u201cWhen I like a nice meal at home,\u201d he said, \u201cI just cook it myself.\u201dBy working through their cultural differences, the couple had begun to forge a modern relationship using their own rules.On Jan. 13, 2016, while Ms. Middleton was six months pregnant, she and Mr. Ogike were enjoying a beachside dinner at the Grand Bahia Principe resort in Runaway Bay, Jamaica, when their waiter brought over a plate covered in a dome and removed the top to reveal a ring box and writing in chocolate that said, \u201cWill You Marry Me?\u201dMr. Ogike grabbed the ring, got down on his knee, and proposed: \u201cYou are carrying my child and making me the happiest person.\u201dBefore Chizarankem Emory Ogike, named for Mr. Ogike\u2019s mother, was born on April 19, 2016, Ms. Middleton had converted from her Southern Baptist religious upbringing to his Roman Catholicism. \u201cI did it for him and for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI am more spiritually in tune now than I was as a Baptist.\u201dOn June 17, the couple were married before 275 guests, including the flower girl, Zara, which is how their daughter is known, in a traditional religious ceremony at Holy Spirit Catholic Church on Johns Island, S.C.Under oak-beamed ceilings, the Rev. Fidelis Omeaku, the associate pastor at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Camarillo, Calif., officiated. The Nigerian-born Father Omeaku, a longtime family friend, explained to the guests how the wedding merged two cultures. And he stressed the importance of communicating and listening to the other\u2019s point of view. \u201cMarriage is about sacrifice as you join as one,\u201d he said.Ms. Middleton\u2019s cousin Kandis Thomas, a bridesmaid, observed that \u201cas they embraced the other\u2019s culture, both have mellowed. This day begins their new life where each is excited about taking care of the other.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He singled out Saudi Arabia and the Emirates as the main foes of Qatar, accusing them of seeking to make it surrender its sovereignty.That, he said, \u201cQatar will never do.\u201dThe uncompromising statements offered little hope for a speedy resolution to a rift that opened up on June 4 with the sudden blockade on Qatar. The crisis has worried many Western countries that are concerned about critical military, business and energy interests, and are fearful that the region is tipping into a dangerous and unpredictable situation.The confrontation on Wednesday could have grown even more serious. But defying expectations, the ministers gathered in Cairo avoided imposing new sanctions on Qatar, and instead sought to reframe their demands as a series of broad principles about combating extremism and not destabilizing each other\u2019s government.Confusion over the United States\u2019 stance on the dispute may be exacerbating the problem.President Trump called leaders on both sides of the ill-tempered dispute on Sunday, but he has left little doubt that he is siding firmly with Qatar\u2019s opponents. American officials say that Mr. Trump sees the crisis as an opportunity to force changes in Qatar\u2019s maverick foreign policy, and to bolster his close alliance with the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In Cairo on Wednesday, the ministers thanked Mr. Trump for his \u201cfirm stance on extremism and terrorism.\u201dThe tension between Mr. Trump, who appears determined to make an example of Qatar, and Mr. Tillerson, who has taken a more pragmatic stance, has hobbled efforts by American officials to resolve the dispute. Mr. Trump, some officials say, seems intent on helping the Saudis as they press their demands for action against Al Jazeera and the Muslim Brotherhood in Qatar, even if Qatar is unlikely to ever agree to them.The Saudis and their allies could step up the sanctions against Qatar by seeking to expel it from regional bodies like the Gulf Cooperation Council or the Arab League, or by forcing banks and other businesses in the gulf to choose sides.In Cairo, the blockading countries said they would meet in Bahrain soon to consider their next steps. \u201cSuch significant decisions cannot be taken swiftly,\u201d said the foreign minister of Bahrain, Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa. \u201cThe decision will be taken at the right time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ramdane Touhami\u2019s New French Empire", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A large beauty emporium was scheduled to open here on Wednesday in the former foundry where Auguste Rodin\u2019s \u201cThe Thinker\u201d was cast.It will also house a Japanese florist specializing in delicate dried arrangements and Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, a revival of the famed Belle \u00c9poque coffeehouse on the Boulevard des Italiens, offering house-blended hot chocolate, homemade ice cream and, in homage to Marcel Proust, madeleines.But it will not be simply a retail space.If all goes according to plan, it will be the cornerstone of a new sort of European luxury group \u2014 one that, like those anchored by Herm\u00e8s, Cartier and Louis Vuitton, is rooted in the French Empire but reaches far beyond the traditional product segments of apparel, leather goods, watches and jewelry.\u201cFor me, luxury is not only leather handbags and clothes,\u201d Mr. Touhami said while having an espresso at a cafe counter. He was wearing a khaki jacket, T-shirt, white baggy pants, vibrant orange socks, Birkenstocks and taqiyah skullcap. Luxury, he said, is \u201ccalligraphy, fine food, beautiful d\u00e9cor, authentic details and working with artisans.\u201dIt has \u201cone foot in the past,\u201d he added, \u201cand one foot in the future.\u201dMr. Touhami is planning to roll out Caf\u00e9 Tortoni branches in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan and to open 30 more Buly boutiques worldwide in the next year. He also said he was in negotiations with a major luxury group that wants to invest in the enterprise.\u201cThe world wants Paris,\u201d Mr. Touhami said. \u201cAnd we sell Paris: a fantasy of Paris.\u201dThat Mr. Touhami is the force behind this luxury paradigm is perhaps the most startling development of all. A former skateboard kid, he has had his hands in nearly every sort of business in the last 25 years, from reality television to Cire Trudon, the French manufacturer of wax once beloved by royalty. He said his ambition had been driven primarily by three basic requisites: \u201cinciting revolution,\u201d \u201chaving fun\u201d and \u201cmeeting beautiful girls.\u201dEven now \u2014 at a relatively more-settled 42 and married to the French aristocrat Victoire de Taillac-Touhami, who runs Buly with him \u2014 Mr. Touhami is not your typical luxury brand executive. He speaks so quickly that he can leave his listeners downright dizzy, and he infuses all that he does with this same manic energy.His biography reads like a piece of wild fiction, though he swears it\u2019s all true. He is the grandson of a Moroccan hero and son of an apple picker in the Tarn-et-Garonne region of France (\u201cI grew up in apple orchards,\u201d he said), and he dropped out of technical school at 17.He had introduced a T-shirt brand called Teuchiland \u2014 riffing on the Timberland logo with a reference to cannabis \u2014 that was a youth sensation, and building that business seemed much more interesting than studying. Yet it all ended abruptly, he said, when a gang in Toulouse \u201ckidnapped me, tortured me and stole all my money.\u201dMr. Touhami fled to Paris, where he spent a year without a home. \u201cI slept in public toilets, in the M\u00e9tro,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd I still hate dogs.\u201d In an altercation with another vagrant, he said, he was stabbed and has a 10-inch scar down his shin to prove it. \u201cI almost bled out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you almost die, you embrace life.\u201dHe \u201cleft homelessness,\u201d as he puts it somewhat cryptically, when he fell for a cute girl. Not long after, he started skateboarding, and founded King Size, a skatewear and skateboard company, in partnership with a local manufacturer.He sold it in 1997, and cooked up a variety of other projects, including in 1998 co-hosting a French reality television program called \u201cStrip-Tease,\u201d which chronicled the intersection of hip-hop and middle-class life, and he opened L\u2019\u00c9picerie, a concept store with his friend the designer Jeremy Scott, who was based in Paris at the time. But it did not last long.\u201cWe lost an enormous amount of money, which wasn\u2019t ours, so we didn\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Touhami said. \u201cWe had a lot of fun and we met a lot of girls.\u201dMr. Touhami spent time in Japan, where he rebooted the fashion retail brand And A, returned to Europe to work as the men\u2019s wear director for Liberty in London, and, later, in Paris, created R\u00e9sistance, a streetwear line that paid homage to the Black Panther Party.\u201cI went to see other mysterious movements, like the Zapatistas and Hezbollah. I met all the crazy men of the world,\u201d he said, proudly. \u201cWe were anarchists! We thought it was fun!\u201dIn 1999 he met Ms. de Taillac, a French public relations executive and one of four sisters (another is the jeweler Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Taillac). The couple married a decade later in a multiday party at the Taillacs\u2019 Gascony chateau, Luxeube, not 20 miles from where Mr. Touhami grew up. Today, the Touhamis have three children.Over the years, they have lived in Jaipur, India; New York; Tangier, Morocco (where Mr. Touhami owned a cafe and had a donkey polo club); and, most recently, Tokyo. This summer, they are returning to Paris and their Left Bank contemporary duplex perched atop a historic building where, he noted with glee, the legendary French finance minister Colbert once lived.The idea for Buly came to him after he read Honor\u00e9 de Balzac\u2019s 1837 novel \u201cC\u00e9sar Birotteau,\u201d about a celebrity Parisian perfumer who loses his fortune in real estate speculation. Mr. Touhami was so seduced by the tale that he researched it and discovered that the title character was based on a French fragrance tycoon named Jean-Pierre Bully, who sold skin tonic called Vinaigre de Bully.Mr. Touhami acquired the name and, after tweaking the spelling, dreamed up a new iteration of the brand \u2014 similar in spirit to the old-school operations Penhaligons in London and Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy.He found an all-white art gallery on the Rue Bonaparte that, with the help of artisans, he transformed into a fin-de-si\u00e8cle dream of handmade oak cabinetry, antique glass vitrines, B\u00e9nou marble counters, terra cotta floors and a swan-beak faucet and sink that \u201cwe pulled out of a St. Petersburg palace,\u201d he said.There, as well as in his other one-of-a-kind shops in Taipei and Seoul and shops-within-shops at Dover Street Market in London and Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Mr. Touhami offers more than 700 products, including botanical-based masks and scrubs, and toothpastes, all without parabens, phenoxyethanol or silicone.He says his sales staff, elegant young women and men in neat navy suits, have been trained by a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the head of protocol for the emperor of Japan. \u201cThe best service in the world is in Japan,\u201d Mr. Touhami said. \u201cThat is what we master and offer.\u201dItems are personalized for clients on the spot, including monogrammed soaps and made-to-order potpourri. \u201cWe want to disrupt the beauty business the same way the food business was disrupted 20 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t some big corporation raking in profits. We don\u2019t care about money. We want to change the philosophy of the industry.\u201d Still, Buly is by all accounts a highly profitable business, though it does not release sales figures.He and Ms. de Taillac-Touhami have also produced \u201cAn Atlas of Natural Beauty,\u201d a thick, richly illustrated encyclopedia detailing their doctrine, which will be published by Ebury Press in Britain in September.To celebrate, the Touhamis are planning an empire-themed dinner for 50 in the National Archives building in Paris, inspired in part by the \u201cGrand Dictionnaire de Cuisine,\u201d Alexandre Dumas\u2019s treatise on the art of dining, and in part by a summer feast hosted in the early 1800s by the French diplomat and gourmand Talleyrand and prepared by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, who was generally considered one of the world\u2019s first celebrity chefs. Christofle is to lend antique tableware; the chef Daniel de la Falaise will oversee the cuisine.\u201cThere will be things en gel\u00e9e, and classic patisserie,\u201d Mr. Touhami said.And then there will be more projects. \u201cI sell one to pay for the next,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s right to do everything, because then you know how to do everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cost of Hudson Tunnel Project Could Hit Nearly $13 Billion, Report Says", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuilding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and fixing the existing one could cost nearly $13 billion \u2014 a steep increase over an earlier estimate of $7.7 billion, according to a report released on Thursday.Transit officials are proceeding with planning for the project, which would improve a critical link between New York and New Jersey. The tunnel proposal is considered one of the most important infrastructure projects in the country, but its fate is unclear under the Trump administration.\u201cAs of today, the tunnel is moving rapidly toward construction,\u201d Mr. Porcari said at a news conference at Pennsylvania Station in New York.Despite his optimism, the Trump administration has not committed to providing federal financing for the tunnel, raising questions about whether it supports the project. The federal Transportation Department recently withdrew from the Gateway corporation board, saying that it did not want to appear to favor the tunnel over projects elsewhere in the country.The construction of a new tunnel could begin by fall 2019, and the tunnel could open in spring 2026, according to the report, which estimated the cost of the new tunnel at $11.1 billion. Rehabilitating the existing tunnel could cost $1.8 billion, the report said.The century-old tunnel that Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains now use to cross the Hudson was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and has become increasingly unreliable. Local officials worry that the tunnel will continue to deteriorate, requiring major repairs that would wreak havoc on commuting in the region.Commuters who rely on Penn Station are already bracing for hardships this summer when several tracks are closed for repairs. Starting on Monday, there will be major cancellations and delays for the three railroads that share the weathered station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road.Infrastructure projects often become more expensive as the details are decided. Mr. Porcari said that any delay by federal officials in supporting the tunnel plan could cause the timeline to be pushed back and the costs to rise further.Now that officials have chosen a route for the new tunnel, on a curve just south of the existing tunnel, they have a better sense of how much it will cost, Mr. Porcari said. The earlier figures, he said, were a \u201cconceptual number.\u201d\u201cRemember,\u201d Mr. Porcari said, \u201cthe first \u2018p\u2019 in public-private partnership is public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lawmakers Can Use Campaign Funds for Home Security, F.E.C. Says", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Election Commission, after some debate, said on Thursday that given the threats, it would approve that use, so long as the improvements were \u201cnonstructural.\u201dThe commission had previously approved the use of campaign funds for security systems in a few cases, and then only where they said specific, credible threats warranted the expense. But after a gunman opened fire on the baseball team last month as it practiced in nearby Alexandria, Va., the House sergeant-at-arms wrote to the commission requesting it extend the ruling broadly.The shooting has left members of Congress deeply rattled and grappling anew with the risks of being a public official in a time of heightened political tension around the country. Investigators found a list with the names of six members of Congress in a pocket of the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.In a June 21 letter seeking the commission\u2019s opinion, the sergeant-at-arms, Paul D. Irving, referred to the shooting and said that House lawmakers had received 950 threats in the first six months of 2017. They received 902 in all of 2016.On Thursday, Mr. Irving said it was impractical and potentially dangerous to expect the Capitol Police to assess each individual threat against a member fast enough.\u201cThreat assessments are resource and time intensive,\u201d he told the commissioners. \u201cThey require a fair amount of lead time, and unfortunately violence or harassment of members and their families does not always wait for a thorough investigation.\u201dSince the shooting, House leaders have searched for ways to bolster security for the House\u2019s members as they travel around Washington and through their home districts. They have moved to allocate an additional $25,000 for each member to pay for security improvements at district offices and for security at public events. And they are seeking about $30 million more for the Capitol Police\u2019s roughly $375 million annual budget to add officers and strengthen security infrastructure.Senate appropriators, for their part, have not moved to include any comparable additional funds in their own version of the legislative branch funding bill, according to Chris Gallegos, the spokesman for the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate sergeant-at-arms\u2019s office has renewed efforts to work with members\u2019 offices on security planning, reducing risk and improving communication with local law enforcement officials.The Capitol Police protect the Capitol and surrounding complex of office buildings and grounds. But unlike the president and other top government officials, most members of Congress are not given official government protection when they leave the Capitol complex. Because of cost, only top House and Senate leaders have Capitol Police details, who follow them wherever they go.The principal objections to the commission\u2019s opinion initially came from Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat, who said she worried that the decision could open the door to a bevy of abuses and questioned why lawmakers did not simply allocate government funds for the cost of home security.\u201cI do have some concerns,\u201d Ms. Weintraub said, \u201cabout the limiting principles. How far could this rationale be used? Could somebody, for example, say, I feel unsafe in my current home, so I need to move to a gated community, and I need to use campaign funds to pay the higher rent and mortgage?\u201dUltimately after a series of edits, Ms. Weintraub voted to approve a compromise version of the opinion, which she said satisfied her concerns.The commission\u2019s decision found rare concurrence among advocates of stricter campaign finance rules and enforcement, even amid worries of potential abuses.\u201cThere is always potential for abuse, particularly because the F.E.C. doesn\u2019t enforce the laws,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the founder of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan advocacy group. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can make the decision here based on potential for abuse. Who knows what might come of this, but on balance, given the circumstances, I think there is a basis for allowing it.\u201dCraig Holman, a lobbyist for Public Citizen, a Washington watchdog group, added that he hoped the commission and the Capitol Police would monitor how the funds are used and hold anyone who abuses the carve-out accountable.Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Home Visits by Nurses Help Mothers and Children, Especially Boys", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFamily MattersOn her regular home visits, the nurse brought books for Aliah Arneson to read to her baby daughter, Aisaya. She taught Ms. Arneson how to safely install a car seat; how to position Aisaya when her ear hurt so the fluid would drain; and how to confront the anxiety she felt about motherhood.\u201cIt gave me a lot of confidence,\u201d said Ms. Arneson, 31, a hair stylist and a single mother in Kenosha, Wis. \u201cI did not have my mom as a person who could do that for me, so my nurse was that person.\u201d\u201cWe show that parenting matters,\u201d wrote Mr. Heckman, along with co-researchers in economics, education, medicine and nursing.\u201cI think what\u2019s been forgotten in this whole political discussion is boys are really very vulnerable and girls are more resilient,\u201d Mr. Heckman said. \u201cThere is a boy problem in this country, especially for disadvantaged boys, and working with the mothers changing their environment seems to have an effect on their well-being.\u201dThe new analysis drew on data from one of Dr. Olds\u2019s randomized controlled trials, in Memphis. It included 700 predominantly African-American single mothers, and followed children through age 12. Unlike in other analyses, the researchers tested each outcome separately, which confirmed many of the positive outcomes but found that some were not statistically significant.The biggest example was the effects on girls versus boys. Boys whose mothers were part of the home visit program were healthier at birth, but the health of newborn girls was not significantly different from that of the control group, the study found. The cognitive effects were larger for boys than for girls, but the social and emotional effects were stronger for girls.Also, the effects for boys lasted through age 12 \u2014 at which point they outperformed the control group in reading and math, and their mothers had lower participation in welfare programs \u2014 but they seemed to wear off for girls by 12. Mr. Heckman said he did not know why, but speculated that adolescent girls in low-income families might have more responsibilities placed on them, causing stress.The researchers also zeroed in on which factors caused positive results. Improvements within the home at age 2 \u2014 elements like parental involvement, role modeling and developmentally appropriate toys \u2014 led to cognitive gains in boys at age 6. That led to higher achievement scores at age 12, the research found.In girls, improvements within the home caused cognitive gains, the study showed, and also led to an increase in their warmth and empathy and a decrease in aggression. Lower maternal anxiety caused both cognitive gains and a decrease in behavior problems.\u201cThe mechanism you find is basically igniting the mother-child relationship, building attachment,\u201d Mr. Heckman said. \u201cThe parental interaction is, I think, the whole story.\u201dMs. Arneson, who was not raised by her mother and grew up with various caregivers, said the nurse visits gave her the confidence to be a mother. She and Aisaya, now 3, read books every night, a habit the nurse started.\u201cShe loves to learn and she\u2019s happy and healthy,\u201d Ms. Arneson said. \u201cIt\u2019s having your nurse encouraging you and letting you know that you can be that mom. It\u2019s breaking the cycle with mothers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup Said to Open Frankfurt Hub as Banks Consider Post-\u2018Brexit\u2019 Moves", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Score one for Frankfurt.With Britain locked in negotiations with the European Union over their post-\u201cBrexit\u201d relationship, the financial companies that dominate London\u2019s economy have forged ahead, eager to ensure they can continue to serve clients across the Continent. That has set other European cities scrambling to win a slice of the business that the British capital has long kept for itself.The American banking giant Citigroup is taking a step toward reducing its dependence on London and will open a second trading hub in Frankfurt, said a person familiar with the bank\u2019s plans, who was not authorized to speak publicly about them and so spoke anonymously. The bank has had an operation in Frankfurt for decades, but it would expand its business there with this latest decision.The development is largely symbolic, with a relatively small number of staff members in London expected to move to Germany. But it is another trickle of job losses that some British business and political leaders fear could turn into a flood in the coming months and years, as the full picture of the nation\u2019s future trading relationship with the European Union becomes clear.Britain\u2019s membership in the 28-nation bloc has bolstered London\u2019s position as a global financial hub in part because European rules allow \u201cpassporting,\u201d under which a banking license in a single member-state allows a lender to work throughout the European Union.But it is unclear whether Britain will be able to retain that access. Other questions affecting banks also remain unanswered, including whether European citizens will be able to continue to live and work in Britain, and if so, under what sort of visa.While most financial companies have said they would prefer to stay in London \u2014 home to some of the world\u2019s biggest financial markets and a wide variety of support industries like accountants and lawyers \u2014 they also must ensure they can continue to operate across the European Union.Citi\u2019s decision shows how financial services companies are trying to strike that balance.The bank employs about 19,000 people in the European Union, including around 6,000 in London. A vast majority of its investment banking and trading jobs in London will remain in place, according to the person. But the bank will obtain a broker dealer license in Frankfurt so it can continue trading and offering investment banking services across the European Union.The jobs that may shift to Frankfurt form a small percentage of the overall figures. And while other financial companies have announced plans to move employees or to make new hires in Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and even Luxembourg, most of those plans have also involved relatively few people.Still, that has not stopped cities on the Continent \u2014 particularly Frankfurt and Paris \u2014 from making an aggressive sales pitch to business leaders, hoping to eventually lure tens of thousand of workers.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Frankfurt, despite being viewed by some as a sleepier city, has at least one definite advantage: It is the home to the European Central Bank, the region\u2019s chief banking regulator.Frankfurt Main Finance, another lobbying organization, has estimated that as many as 10,000 new jobs could move to the city over the next five years.\u201cNoted for its strong economic and political stability, Frankfurt and the region offer a top infrastructure, competitively priced and plentiful modern office space, a deep talent pool and an extremely high quality of life,\u201d Frankfurt Main Finance said.And while much appears unclear, one thing is certain: Banks in London are pushing ahead with contingency plans.The British lender Barclays said last week that it was in talks with Irish regulators to expand the license of its Barclays Bank Ireland subsidiary to continue to serve European Union clients, while HSBC has said it could move as many as 1,000 people to Paris.The American International Group and other insurers have picked Luxembourg for their European hubs, while the insurance marketplace Lloyd\u2019s of London has settled on Brussels for its new European Union subsidiary.But Citigroup will not find itself alone in Germany.The Japanese companies Daiwa Securities, Nomura and the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have said they will set up outposts in Frankfurt. Standard Chartered, which is based in Britain but generates much of its income in Asia, has said it was in discussions with regulators about opening a subsidiary in Frankfurt.Chad Bray reported from London, and Michael Corkery from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Forced Unwanted Auto Insurance on Borrowers", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than 800,000 people who took out car loans from Wells Fargo were charged for auto insurance they did not need, and some of them are still paying for it, according to an internal report prepared for the bank\u2019s executives.The expense of the unneeded insurance, which covered collision damage, pushed roughly 274,000 Wells Fargo customers into delinquency and resulted in almost 25,000 wrongful vehicle repossessions, according to the 60-page report, which was obtained by The New York Times. Among the Wells Fargo customers hurt by the practice were military service members on active duty.Asked about the findings on auto insurance, Wells Fargo officials confirmed that the improper insurance practices took place and said the bank was determined to make customers whole.Christine Worley, a spokeswoman for National General, declined to comment.For borrowers, delinquencies arose quickly because of the way the bank charged for the insurance. Say, for example, that a customer agreed to a monthly payment of $275 in principal and interest on her car loan, and arranged for the amount to be deducted from her bank account automatically. If she were not advised about the insurance and it increased her monthly payment to, say, $325, her account could become overdrawn as soon as Wells Fargo added the coverage.The report tried to determine how many Wells Fargo customers were hurt and how much they should be compensated. It estimated that the bank owed $73 million to wronged customers.State insurance regulations required Wells Fargo to notify customers of the insurance before it was imposed. But the bank did not always do so, the report said. And almost 100,000 of the policies violated the disclosure requirements of five states \u2014 Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Tennessee and Washington.Wells Fargo took issue with some of the figures in its own report. In a statement, Jennifer A. Temple, a bank spokeswoman, said the bank determined only 570,000 of its customers may qualify for a refund and that just 60,000 customers in the five states had not received complete disclosures before the insurance placement. Finally, she said, the bank estimated the insurance may have contributed to 20,000 wrongful repossessions, not 25,000.\u201cWe take full responsibility for these errors and are deeply sorry for any harm we caused customers,\u201d Ms. Temple added.Requiring borrowers to be insured is common in the mortgage arena, where banks expect customers to carry enough homeowners\u2019 insurance to protect the property backing their loans. The term for the practice is \u201clender-placed insurance.\u201d Pressing such insurance on auto borrowers, however, is not as common: Representatives of Bank of America, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase said they did not offer the policies, though some smaller banks do.In the Wells Fargo arrangement, National General receives all of the commissions on the insurance it sold to the bank\u2019s borrowers. But for a time the bank shared in those revenues. Wells stopped sharing in the commissions in February 2013, according to the report.Asked about the bank\u2019s insurance practices, Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Wells Fargo\u2019s regulator, said, \u201cI cannot comment on specific ongoing supervisory matters or potential pending actions pertaining to a particular bank.\u201dWells Fargo borrowers sustained financial damages beyond the costs of the insurance, the report said. The harm also included repossession costs, late fees, charges for insufficient funds and damage to consumers\u2019 credit reports.Such policies typically cost more than $1,000 a year, not counting interest. (Customers could pay them in full or finance them over time.) If a car was repossessed, the bank might charge a reinstatement fee of as much as $500, so a borrower could face $1,500 in charges.Here is how the process worked: When customers financed cars with Wells Fargo, the buyers\u2019 information would go to National General, which was supposed to check a database to see if the owner had insurance coverage. If not, the insurer would automatically impose coverage on the customers\u2019 accounts, adding an extra layer of premiums and interest to their loans.When customers who checked their bills saw the charges and notified Wells Fargo that they already had car insurance, the bank was supposed to cancel the insurance and credit the borrower with the amount that had been charged.The Oliver Wyman report indicated that many customers appear not to have notified Wells Fargo of the redundant insurance. This may have been because their payments were deducted automatically from their bank accounts and they did not spot the charges.This payment structure had the effect of increasing the overall interest borrowers paid on their loans, the Oliver Wyman report noted, because fewer dollars went to reducing the principal outstanding.Wells Fargo was also aggressive in repossessing vehicles: Some customers endured multiple repossessions, the report said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Soccer Power Broker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Charlie Stillitano wanted to make sure I saw the traditional exchange of gifts between Barcelona and Juventus at halftime during their match at MetLife Stadium here last Saturday, so we left his suite and walked into one nearby. Inside, board members of the two famed European clubs shook hands, exchanged trinkets and smiled for photographs.\u201cIt comes from European protocol,\u201d Stillitano said as a way of explaining the elegantly awkward moment, a fixture of matches between top European clubs rarely replicated in American sports.The real stars of the show, though, were the soccer legends mingling nearby. Pavel Nedved, the Czech star who once ran the Juventus midfield, posed with a signed jersey. Paolo Maldini, Italy\u2019s greatest defender, and Andrea Pirlo, a World Cup winner in 2006, exchanged small talk. The former Netherlands midfielder Edgar Davids walked into the suite halfway through the exchange of gifts, clad in his trademark goggle sunglasses, and made a beeline for the buffet.In the middle of all of these beautiful people, smiling and laughing, glad-handing and posing, the master of his domain, was Stillitano. He alone knew everybody in the room. He was the one who had brought Barcelona and Juventus together for the match that night, and he is the one who will host a similar scene on Saturday, when Barcelona plays Real Madrid in Miami.Who is Charlie Stillitano? The salt-and-pepper-bearded and perpetually gregarious son of a New Jersey cookie factory worker, Stillitano, 57, might be the most powerful, most well-connected soccer power broker you\u2019ve never heard of.How connected? The former United States national team coach Bob Bradley, who has known Stillitano since they were teenagers, tells this story.Just before Christmas in 2015, after Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was fired from his second stint as the manager at the English club Chelsea, Bradley wanted to send him a note.\u201cAfter things went down at Chelsea for Jos\u00e9 I wanted to send him a message, because he sent me a great message after I was fired as national team coach,\u201d Bradley wrote in a text message. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I had his best contact number, so I messaged Charlie and asked him to send it on my behalf.\u201cOne minute later Charlie sent me a picture of the two of them. He was with Jos\u00e9.\u201dStillitano has no official role with any club, or any league. Instead, he makes his living in soccer as the chairman of Relevent Sports, the promoter that put on the Barcelona-Juventus match in East Rutherford and 11 others across the United States this summer. The tournament, collectively known as the International Champions Cup, and including a corresponding Asian version in China and Singapore, has quickly become the most high-profile summer exhibition tour in the world.The connections that Stillitano brings to the tournament, and that have made it a success, mean he is full of stories like Bradley\u2019s. So many of them, in fact, that he frequently interrupts the telling of one to begin another, making even a few hours with him a veritable matryoshka doll of Charlie stories.He will tell you about playing against Bradley in high school and alongside him at Princeton. He will introduce you to Martin O\u2019Connor, a lawyer whose clients include the former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and who has known Stillitano since they became fast friends as 13-year-olds.He will tell you all about dining with Ferguson \u2014 \u201cSir Alex says the best restaurant in NJ is Charlie\u2019s house,\u201d Bradley texted \u2014 or how he served as a ball boy at a 1973 friendly in Jersey City between Lazio and Santos, the Brazilian club then featuring Pel\u00e9. The stories have become so synonymous with Stillitano that if you Google the Santos friendly to check a fact, you\u2019ll find a number of the top results about the match are Stillitano\u2019s recalling it for other reporters.This is Stillitano the salesman, the marketer. A man who has remade his career selling European teams on the commercial promise of America, and American sports fans on the promise of top-level soccer. And it is temping to conclude that with his stories, Stillitano is selling you, too. But this isn\u2019t entirely true, because he has the track record to back him up.He will ask Pirlo to spend time with you, and Pirlo will dutifully comply, shifting his daughter onto his lap so you can ask him about the value of preseason friendlies. (\u201cIt\u2019s not important, the result, but the speed and for the young guys,\u201d he said.) In a different setting, he might introduce you to Ferguson, an irascible Scot who calls Stillitano \u201cgood people\u201d and \u201clovable\u201d in two of his books. The Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti wrote in his 2010 book about the time Stillitano brokered a meeting between him and the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in 2008, resulting in Ancelotti\u2019s hiring as the Blues\u2019 coach.He knows all of these men because, on behalf of some company or another, Stillitano has been persuading top European managers and the biggest European teams to spend their preseasons in the United States for the past 15 years.His first company, ChampionsWorld, was financed with a mortgage on his house and began with a single friendly, between Real Madrid and Roma in 2002, that surprised even Stillitano by drawing 70,000 fans. (That he began with an Italian club was not accidental; Stillitano is the son of an immigrant, and he eagerly and effortlessly shifted between English and Italian with his guests at the Juventus game.) The company put on matches for four years but filed for bankruptcy in 2005, owing creditors more than $2 million. Its biggest outstanding creditor was the United States Soccer Federation, to which ChampionsWorld had to pay sanctioning fees for each match it ran.ChampionsWorld sued, arguing that U.S. Soccer and Major League Soccer \u2014 which once employed Stillitano as the general manager of its New Jersey team, the MetroStars \u2014 had conspired to drive the company out of business. After a seven-year legal battle in which ChampionsWorld lost at both the Court of Arbitration for Sport and in federal court, the sides settled out of court.\u201cWhen I went bankrupt there were a lot of people kicking me when I was down,\u201d Stillitano said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a job as a dishwasher in soccer.\u201d He found refuge at Creative Artists Agency, just as it was making a large push into sports, and founded the World Football Challenge.Two important things happened with the World Football Challenge. Inter Milan and Chelsea won almost every possible trophy the season after participating in the 2009 edition, and the Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross saw a 2011 Chivas-Barcelona match in his new team\u2019s stadium in Miami. That proved a preseason United States tour was rigorous preparation for the season, and the Miami match, which drew a crowd of about 70,000, persuaded Ross to hire Stillitano and his partner, Jon Sheiman, away from C.A.A. to create what would become the International Champions Cup.\u201cAfter I had the team, I said: \u2018Hey, I have this empty stadium. How do I get into this?\u2019\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeople in this country want to see the stars, that\u2019s what they\u2019re mostly interested in, and seeing the great teams in the world. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll really pay for and go see.\u201dRoss\u2019s vision was to turn what was effectively a ticket-selling operation into one that sold the television rights to the matches globally and sealed large sponsorship agreements \u2014 a proposition that was, potentially, far more lucrative. After losing millions of dollars during its first four years, the I.C.C., Ross said, will turn a profit this year.The marquee matchup is between Barcelona and Real Madrid in Miami, the first time the rivals have played each other outside Spain in over 30 years. Unlike the other matches in the I.C.C. this year \u2014 all of them glamorous matchups like Barcelona-Juventus, or Real Madrid-Manchester United, or United-Manchester City \u2014 Barca-Real is being sold not so much as a game but as a dayslong festival. A \u201cSuper Bowl experience,\u201d in the words of one Relevent executive.When Barcelona defeated Juventus by 2-1 on Saturday night at MetLife Stadium, it did so in front of 82,104 fans and on the strength of two goals by Neymar, its star Brazilian forward. The largest soccer crowd in New Jersey history saw two teams play their first-choice starters for at least 45 minutes, and Juventus pressed hard for the tying goal until the final whistle.\u201cWe cringe when managers say it\u2019s just a training session,\u201d Stillitano said, one day after the new Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde dismissed the match \u2014 his first in charge at the club \u2014 as \u201cnot an official competition.\u201dMaldini, the former A.C. Milan and Italian national team defender who works as an I.C.C. ambassador, disagreed. \u201c82,000 fans?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a friendly. There is no friendly game at this level.\u201dThis is what Stillitano and Relevent Sports want American soccer fans to believe: that the I.C.C. is a serious endeavor and a fixture on the soccer calendar, not a glorified exhibition tournament or a brazen cash grab.\u201cI think it is incumbent to ensure that we keep improving the quality of the matchups themselves, and keep positioning the I.C.C. as really the big reveal,\u201d said Matt Higgins, the co-founder and chief executive of RSE Ventures, which owns Relevent Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time when everyone who has been thirsting for soccer to return gets a taste of the most important narratives.\u201dIt is up to Stillitano to book the actors, and to sell the narratives, but he has been in the game long enough to know that when you have all the biggest names in soccer in one place, the buzz takes care of itself. The most important narrative on Saturday was whether Paris Saint-Germain would succeed in an audacious bid to pry Neymar away from Barcelona. Martin Kallen, the chief executive of UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, joked that he was in town just to \u201csee which players are on the Barca roster.\u201dFor Stillitano, watching Neymar\u2019s Barcelona torment the Juventus back line, it didn\u2019t really matter how the Neymar drama ended, only that everybody was talking about him.After all, Paris Saint-Germain is playing in the International Champions Cup, too.This isn\u2019t the only professional soccer currently being played this summer in the United States, of course. Major League Soccer is in the middle of its regular season, and an important regional championship, the Gold Cup, just finished a three-week run.Soccer United Marketing, M.L.S.\u2019s marketing arm, owns the commercial rights to both of those properties, as well as various others, and that makes them direct competitors of Relevent for consumers who may not even be aware of that battle. Both sides say nice things about each other \u2014 the phrase \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d was used repeatedly in recent weeks by executives on either side \u2014 but in the end they are pushing two fundamentally different visions of soccer in America.Major League Soccer believes that the I.C.C. is a two-week sideshow and that it has the deeper relationship with American soccer fans. Relevent Sports counters that American fans want to see the highest level of the sport, and points to full stadiums for its matches as proof that it is right. While the pie of revenue in American soccer may be growing, it is hard to believe each company doesn\u2019t covet the chance to cut into the other\u2019s share.In the meantime, Stillitano is more concerned with decidedly first-world soccer problems. And sometimes appeasing billion-dollar clubs and making all of their leaders feel as if they\u2019re his favorite isn\u2019t as easy as it looks.To resolve the issue, Stillitano first went to the Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, and told him Relevent would build a pool for his team.

{"Headline": "A Cleanup of \u2018Holes in the Wall\u2019 in China\u2019s Capital", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeijing JournalBEIJING \u2014 When China\u2019s leaders began the hurly-burly transition to a market economy, they encouraged dislocated workers to take up their own entrepreneurial pursuits. Many of them started small shops, bars or cafes, in what became known as kai qiang da dong, meaning \u201cto open a hole in the wall.\u201dNow, in Beijing, the holes are being bricked up.The work, which accelerated in the spring, has convulsed entire districts, churning up debris and clouds of dust and wiping out scores of the places that have given the capital a bit of its rakish charm.\u201cWe had all the proper business licenses, hoping that this would save the bookstore,\u201d he wrote on Weibo, a Twitterlike social media site. \u201cBut what we didn\u2019t anticipate was a citywide campaign, dragging us into the carnage.\u201dThe city authorities call it a beautification project. And it is, of a sort, in places where white walls, tree boxes and flowering planters have replaced jerry-built, sidewalk-clogging stalls and storefronts.It is also part of a broader campaign \u2014 some say a crackdown \u2014 meant to transform Beijing\u2019s bustling, overcrowded city center into a futuristic capital of government, finance, media and technology. That means ridding it of uncontrolled development and \u201clow end\u201d entrepreneurship, while pushing out millions of migrants from other parts of China.In the Sanlitun neighborhood, Yashow DVD Shop No. 98 survived the destruction that swept through a side street in April, but sales have plummeted since the front entrance facing the street was shuttered. Customers now have to find their way through the grimy courtyard of a six-story apartment block, piled with debris and garbage.Zhu Yi, whose family opened the shop after moving from the southern city Guangzhou in 2008, said they had been given ample warning of the work. He acknowledged that the storefront entrance, which led to a basement shop, had not been erected according to any zoning code, but rents in nearby shopping centers are too exorbitant.\u201cTo this government it is illegal,\u201d he said, but added that a shop like theirs should also be \u201ca part of Beijing\u2019s local color.\u201dAs with most government decisions in China, there was no public debate about the campaign, and those affected said there was little they could do to challenge it.A less explicit goal is to rid the capital of many of the migrants who have poured into Beijing and other principal cities in recent decades. While they were important contributors to China\u2019s economic boom, officials seem to have calculated that they are not as vital to the new phase of development.The most visible sign of that has been a related campaign to close or shrink dozens of bustling wholesale markets, also heavily populated with migrant entrepreneurs. These include the Alien Street Market, which catered to Russian shuttle traders, and a cluster of buildings near the Beijing Zoo that composed the city\u2019s largest and most famous clothing market.As with previous efforts to reshape Beijing, this one has torn the fabric of urban life. Eviction notices at one of the zoo markets prompted daily protests last month, at least one of which ended with scuffles between tenants and guards. Dozens of shopkeepers have been promised refunds on their leases, but those protesting said they had yet to see them.The police, wary as ever of public displays of discontent, moved to stifle the protest before it could draw more attention. (When I showed up the next day, a police officer stopped me within minutes, checked my documents and asked me to leave.)More evictions are coming. The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that the city plans to close or relocate 120 markets this year.\u201cWe want to reveal the dark side of the cleanup,\u201d said Di Yanjie, one of the shopkeepers who protested. She said she had been detained at the local police station for 12 hours.In an interview at a restaurant, beyond the scrutiny of the police, she described the trajectory of her business, one that reflected the extraordinary gains China has made in lifting people into prosperity over the last three decades.A native of Beijing, Ms. Di and her husband first went into business two decades ago, selling women\u2019s clothing from a blanket on the sidewalk. Over the years they gradually expanded, and in 2009 moved into the market building \u2014 which now, according to Xinhua, will be converted into offices for finance and high-tech companies.\u201cThis place is famous all over China \u2014 the Beijing Zoo wholesale market!\u201d Ms. Di said. \u201cYou could say this place is part of China\u2019s history.\u201dSo, too, were many of those \u201choles in the wall\u201d in the narrow alleyways that survived Beijing\u2019s past building booms. Increasingly coveted for their traditional character, the hutongs attracted boutiques and restaurants, cafes and even American-style brew pubs that catered to an expanding consumer class.When the municipal authorities announced plans for this year\u2019s construction work, they pledged that it would make the city greener, remove safety hazards and, above all, \u201cimprove the people\u2019s sense of achievement.\u201dAnd some people interviewed along the affected streets said it had.The work did more than disrupt the night life, though \u2014 it removed part or all of 33 shops. The prospects for the owners appear gloomy.\u201cI think the move failed to take into account the needs of a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of those owners set up their businesses in a legal manner and had invested a lot of money, but now everything they\u2019ve worked for is gone.\u201dOwen Guo, Zoe Mou, Amy Cheng and Tang Yucheng contributed research.Follow Steven Lee Myers on Twitter and Facebook at @stevenleemyersAdvertisement"}

Quite the opposite.\u201dPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said the deal signified the creation of \u201cthe world\u2019s largest free, advanced, industrialized economic zone.\u201dHere\u2019s what you need to know about the deal:The core of the agreement aims to increase the flow of Japanese cars to Europe and of European food to Japan.The Europeans are expected to scrap a 10 percent tariff on passenger cars made in Japan, over a period of seven years. Duties would come down more rapidly for some car components.Those are key concessions: The Japanese automotive giants Toyota and Honda have claimed a smaller market share in Europe than in other major markets like the United States.Europe could still reimpose restrictions if there was a \u201cvery big increase as compared to normal\u201d of imported Japanese cars, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told reporters later Thursday. She did not say, however, what specific level would cause that kind of reaction.The Japanese, in return, are expected to lower duties on European cheeses like Gouda from the Netherlands, while retaining their unusually complex regulations on dairy products.Tokyo is also likely to make it easier for European companies to bid for major government contracts, a move that could benefit train makers like Siemens of Germany and Alstom of France.Accompanying the trade deal is a separate partnership agreement in which both sides pledge greater cooperation on issues like cybercrime and climate protection.The Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.Ms. Malmstrom responded this week by saying organizations like Greenpeace would be opposed to \u201cany trade agreement,\u201d ostensibly a criticism of the group\u2019s stance against trade liberalization.Even without rules on whales and wood, the deal is the biggest bilateral trade agreement ever struck by the European Union, covering about a quarter of the global economy.Not quite. The biggest issue that has not yet been agreed on is how to ensure that investors have a way to resolve disputes arising as a result of the deal.The Europeans want to employ a court system rather than ad hoc arbitration, which has been used for decades but has been heavily criticized by European lawmakers and environmental groups as being too soft on industry interests.The Japanese, however, argue that existing institutions are enough.Negotiations have been proceeding for years, but were accelerated after Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a wide-ranging trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries that had Japan at its core.The new deal was a clear sign that other parts of the world will continue to pursue a liberalizing trade agenda, even without the United States.European and Japanese officials now expect the talks to be completed within months.In June, the Japanese Parliament passed a law that aims to address some of its dairy industry protections, which may make it easier to wrap up negotiations.The main concern, however, is the ratification process in Europe.What would happen if the Walloons \u2014 or another region or country \u2014 were to balk this time? European officials did not have an answer to that this week.Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Freezes $182 Million in Assets of Chinese Internet Tycoon", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 A court in Shanghai has frozen $182 million in assets tied to the chairman of the Chinese technology company LeEco after one of its affiliates missed loan payments.The ruling last week by the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court was the latest setback for the chairman, Jia Yueting, and for LeEco, which has piled on debt in recent years to fuel its ambitious expansion.A company spokesman confirmed that the court had frozen assets connected to a loan for LeEco\u2019s mobile phone business, Le Mobile, but said collateral was enough to cover the debt. Nie Chengzhi, LeEco\u2019s vice president for finance, said the company would work with China Merchants Bank on repayment. In a statement, the bank said it had taken legal action after many attempts to recover interest owed.Mr. Jia first admitted the cash crunch last autumn. Last week, at a shareholder meeting of LeEco\u2019s main publicly listed arm, Leshi Internet, he acknowledged that the company had made mistakes in allocating funds.\u201cThe cash problems at the nonpublicly traded businesses are more serious than when this crisis erupted,\u201d Mr. Jia told investors, according to a transcript. \u201cOur businesses are constantly using cash to repay loans, having a huge impact on their operations.\u201dAt the meeting, Mr. Jia indicated that LeEco was having difficulty securing additional loans. As of Leshi Internet\u2019s most recent filing, Mr. Jia had pledged 97 percent of his shares in the company to back loans that as of November totaled $1.7 billion.LeEco has also started selling assets to raise cash. Last week, its ride-sharing affiliate, Yidao Yongche, announced a change in control, without naming the new controlling shareholder. The company had for months delayed paying many of its drivers.And creditors are showing up in person in Beijing, asking LeEco to pay up.Last week, Zhang Jun, a supplier for Le Mobile, joined other small suppliers for a seven-day sit-in in LeEco\u2019s Beijing lobby, she said, but left with no money.\u201cI don\u2019t have any hope anymore,\u201d she said, noting that a civil suit she had filed against LeEco in Beijing courts was unlikely to produce a result until the end of the year. \u201cBy then there probably won\u2019t be any money left for us.\u201dThe overdue loan to China Merchants Bank financed LeEco\u2019s 2015 purchase of an 18 percent stake in the Hong Kong-listed Coolpad Group, the business weekly Caixin reported. Coolpad\u2019s share price has dropped this year as competition in the smartphone market has eroded its position. Hong Kong corporate records show the $324 million loan was backed by all the acquired shares of Coolpad, in addition to collateral in mainland China.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Russia, Battle Between Rosneft and Private Firm Stirs Investment Worries", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Sistema and its owner had for years assiduously steered clear of politics in Russia, hoping to avoid the kind of legal issues that often dog high-profile businesses here. But as it has grown into the country\u2019s largest privately owned conglomerate, it has found itself mired in a multi-billion-dollar legal battle.The dispute between Sistema and Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil company, dates back to a 2014 nationalization, pitting two of the country\u2019s most important companies against each other. The latest twist in their back-and-forth came on Monday, as Sistema warned banks about problems it is having repaying $66 million worth of loans.The conflict between the two companies is another worrying sign for the investment climate in Russia. As the overall economy stagnates amid sanctions and low oil prices, the environment has raised the specter of the country\u2019s elite fighting over a smaller pie, with businesses using courts and law enforcement that are widely seen as vulnerable to corruption to gain an advantage.Sistema and its principal owner, Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, have stayed away from politics \u2014 in one case, the company smoothly navigated the ouster of a former mayor, even though many of its assets are in the city of Moscow, staying aloof from the political struggle. It now employs about 150,000 people, and it says its revenues are equivalent to about 1 percent of Russia\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201cThis conflict is causing a lot of harm to the investment attractiveness of Russia,\u201d Aleksander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis case can create a precedent when any activity in the past can be contested, and property rights put in question, for any company.\u201dThe dispute traces its origins to Sistema\u2019s loss of its Bashneft oil subsidiary in the 2014 nationalization. Sistema had accumulated shares in Bashneft from regional elites, who had in turn acquired it years before from a regional government.At the time of the nationalization, officials asserted that Russia\u2019s federal government had erred in the original transfer of Bashneft to the regional government in 1993, and voided all subsequent transactions. The state property agency then sold a controlling stake in Bashneft to Rosneft.The state energy company is now suing Sistema for mismanaging Bashneft, and stripping it of assets, demanding $3 billion in compensation. Sistema denies the allegations.On Monday, Sistema declared a technical default on 3.9 billion rubles, or about $66 million, in loans. The company said the technical default, a formal notice triggered by its failure to comply with some conditions on part of its debt, had occurred because a court overseeing the case had frozen Sistema assets used as collateral for the loans.The privately owned company said that it would repay the loans, and that it did not anticipate banks demanding early repayment.\u201cThe situation is a direct consequence of the plaintiffs, who must have known that freezing our assets would lead to a technical default,\u201d Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema\u2019s director, said in a statement on Monday.In a statement issued on Monday, Rosneft\u2019s press secretary, Michael Leontiev, suggested Sistema was using the case to mislead creditors. \u201cIf Sistema wants to use a wholly formal process, such as freezing assets, to deceive its creditors, that says a lot about the business style of this company,\u201d he said. At Rosneft\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last month, Igor Sechin, the chief executive, said the lawsuit against Sistema is improving Russia\u2019s investment climate by rooting out poor corporate governance.The conflict has rattled investors, with Sistema shares falling about 3 percent on Monday.The company had been trying to attract international investment into the Russian economy. This year, it carried out an initial public offering for one of its subsidiaries, Detsky Mir, which operates a collection of toy stores. The I.P.O. was the first in Russia since crisis.It has also cast a light on the struggles facing Rosneft, which cannot raise money directly from international banks because it was sanctioned after the conflict in Ukraine. The sanctions ban any long-term lending to the energy company.In an interview last month with RBC, a Russian business newspaper, Mr. Shamolin said the case could be easier to understand, if only there was a political context.Sistema might defend itself, he said, \u201cif there was some sort of logic, that was discussed in the press, that the company had behaved improperly \u2014 by the unwritten rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For China\u2019s Global Ambitions, \u2018Iran Is at the Center of Everything\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEYSHABUR, Iran \u2014 When Zuoru Lin, a Beijing entrepreneur, first heard about business opportunities in eastern Iran, he was skeptical. But then he bought a map and began to envision the region without any borders, as one enormous market.\u201cMany countries are close by, even Europe,\u201d Mr. Lin, 49, said while driving his white BMW over the highway connecting Tehran to the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad recently. \u201cIran is at the center of everything.\u201dLike pieces of a sprawling geopolitical puzzle, components of China\u2019s infrastructure network are being put in place. In eastern Iran, Chinese workers are busily modernizing one of the country\u2019s major rail routes, standardizing gauge sizes, improving the track bed and rebuilding bridges, with the ultimate goal of connecting Tehran to Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.Much the same is happening in western Iran, where railroad crews are working to link the capital to Turkey and, eventually, to Europe. Other rail projects will connect Tehran and Mashhad with deepwater ports in the country\u2019s south.Once dependent on Beijing during the years of international isolation imposed by the West for its nuclear program, Iran is now critical to China\u2019s ability to realize its grandiose ambitions. Other routes to Western markets are longer and lead through Russia, potentially a competitor of China.\u201cIt is not as if their project is canceled if we don\u2019t participate,\u201d said Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan, the Iranian deputy minister of roads and urban development. \u201cBut if they want to save time and money, they will choose the shortest route.\u201dHe added with a smile: \u201cThere are also political advantages to Iran, compared to Russia. They are highly interested in working with us.\u201dOthers worry that with the large-scale Chinese investment and China\u2019s growing presence in the Iranian economy, Tehran will become more dependent than ever on China, already its biggest trading partner.China is also an important market for Iranian oil, and because of remaining unilateral American sanctions that intimidate global banks, it is the only source of the large amounts of capital Iran needs to finance critical infrastructure projects. But that, apparently, is a risk the leadership is prepared to take.\u201cChina is dominating Iran,\u201d said Mehdi Taghavi, an economics professor at Allameh Tabataba\u2019i University in Tehran, adding that the \u201cIranian authorities do not see any drawbacks to being dependent on China. Together, we are moving ahead.\u201dIt is not just roads and rail lines that Iran is getting from China. Iran is also becoming an increasingly popular destination for Chinese entrepreneurs like Mr. Lin. With a few words of Persian, as well as low-interest loans and tax breaks from the Chinese and Iranian governments, he has built a small empire since moving to Iran in 2002. His eight factories make a wide variety of goods that find markets in Iran and in neighboring countries.\u201cYou can say that I was even more visionary than some of our politicians,\u201d Mr. Lin said with a laugh. Since 2013, when the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan was started, he has had dozens of visitors from China and multiple meetings with the Chinese ambassador in Tehran. \u201cI was a pioneer, and they want to hear my experiences,\u201d he said.Mr. Lin established his factories along what will be a key part of the trade route \u2014 a 575-mile electrified rail line linking Tehran and Mashhad, financed with a $1.6 billion loan from China. When completed and attached to the wider network, the new line will enable Mr. Lin to export his goods as far as northern Europe, Poland and Russia, at much less cost than today.\u201cI am expecting a 50 percent increase in revenue,\u201d Mr. Lin said. He lit another cigarette. \u201cOf course, Iran\u2019s economy will also grow. China will expand. Its power will grow.\u201dHe played Chinese pop music in his car and tapped his fingers on the wheel. \u201cLife is good in Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future is good.\u201dIranians who spotted Mr. Lin driving between his factories waved and smiled. Having mastered a few basic phrases in Persian over the years, he said \u201chi\u201d and \u201cgoodbye\u201d to some of his 2,000 employees. Iranians are hard workers, he said, but he does not like their food. \u201cWe grow our own vegetables and eat Chinese food,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like home.\u201dEven when the boss was out of earshot, workers in his factories said that they were very happy with the Chinese. \u201cThey pay every month on time and only hire people instead of fire them,\u201d Amir Dalilian, a guard, said. \u201cIf more will come, our economy will flourish.\u201dWhen finished, the proposed rail link will stretch nearly 2,000 miles, from Urumqi, the capital of China\u2019s western region of Xinjiang, to Tehran. If all goes according to plan, it will connect Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, China\u2019s state-owned paper, China Daily, wrote. Track sizes need to be adjusted and new connections made, as well as upgrades to the newest trains.In a 2016 test, China and Iran drove a train from the port of Shanghai in eastern China to Tehran in just 12 days, a journey that takes 30 days by sea. In Iran, they used the existing track between Tehran and Mashhad, powered by a slower diesel-powered train. When the new line is opened in 2021, it is expected to accommodate electric trains at speeds up to 125 miles an hour.Mr. Fakhrieh-Kashan, an English speaker who oversees negotiation of most of the larger international state business deals, said the Chinese initiative would do much more than just provide a channel for transporting goods. \u201cThink infrastructure, city planning, cultural exchanges, commercial agreements, investments and tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can pick any project, they are all under this umbrella.\u201dBusiness ties between Iran and China have been growing since the United States and its European allies at the time started pressuring Iran over its nuclear program around 2007. China remains the largest buyer of Iranian crude, even after Western sanctions were lifted in 2016, allowing Iran to again sell oil in European markets.Chinese state companies are active all over the country, building highways, digging mines and making steel. Tehran\u2019s shops are flooded with Chinese products and its streets clogged with Chinese cars.Iran\u2019s leaders hope that the country\u2019s participation in the plan will enable them to piggyback on China\u2019s large economic ambitions.\u201cThe Chinese plan is designed in such a way that it will establish Chinese hegemony across half of the world,\u201d Mr. Fakhrieh-Kashan said. \u201cWhile Iran will put its own interests first, we are creating corridors at the requests of the Chinese. It will give us huge access to new markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump occupies the White House.President Trump named Rand his favorite writer and \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d his favorite novel. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has cited \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d as a favorite work, and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, said the book \u201creally had an impact on me.\u201dAs Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, put it in a recent essay, \u201cher books pretty well capture the mind-set\u201d of the Trump administration. \u201cThis new administration hates weak, unproductive, socialist people and policies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand it admires strong, can-do profit makers.\u201dIn business, Rand\u2019s influence has been especially pronounced in Silicon Valley, where her overarching philosophy that \u201cman exists for his own sake, that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose, that he must not sacrifice himself to others, nor sacrifice others to himself,\u201d as she described it in a 1964 Playboy interview, has an obvious appeal for self-made entrepreneurs. Last year Vanity Fair anointed her the most influential figure in the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs.And then there\u2019s the scandal-engulfed Trump administration, where devotion to Rand\u2019s teaching has done little to advance the president\u2019s legislative agenda.Though people close to Mr. Kalanick told me this week that he has distanced himself from many of Rand\u2019s precepts while undergoing an intense period of personal reassessment, they all acknowledged that she\u2019d had a profound influence on his development. Few companies have been as closely identified with Rand\u2019s philosophy as Uber.Uber disrupted a complacent, highly regulated and often corrupt taxi industry on a global scale, an achievement Rand\u2019s heroes Howard Roark and Dagny Taggart would surely have admired. Many of her ideas were embedded in Uber\u2019s code of values. Mr. Kalanick used the original cover art for \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d as his Twitter avatar until 2013 (when he exchanged it for an image of Alexander Hamilton, and then, in May, for one of himself).\u201cRand\u2019s entrepreneur is the Promethean hero of capitalism,\u201d said Lawrence E. Cahoone, professor of philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross, whose lecture on Rand is part of his Great Courses series, \u201cThe Modern Political Tradition.\u201d \u201cBut she never really explores how a dynamic entrepreneur actually runs a business.\u201d\u201cShe was a script and fiction writer,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe was motivated by an intense hatred of communism, and she put those things together very effectively. She can be very inspirational, especially to entrepreneurs. But she was by no means an economist. I don\u2019t think her work can be used as a business manual.\u201dRepresentatives of Uber and Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.Rand\u2019s defenders insist that the problems for Mr. Kalanick and others influenced by Rand aren\u2019t that they embraced her philosophy, but rather that they didn\u2019t go far enough.Yaron Brook, executive chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute and a former finance professor at Santa Clara University, who teaches seminars on business leadership and ethics from an Objectivist perspective, said, \u201cFew business people have actually read her essays and philosophy and studied her in depth.\u201d Mr. Brook said that while Mr. Kalanick \u201cwas obviously talented and energetic and a visionary, he took superficial inspiration from her ideas and used her philosophy to justify his obnoxiousness.\u201dHe emphasized that Rand would never have tolerated sexual harassment or any kind of mistreatment of employees. Rand \u201chad enormous respect for people who worked hard and did a good job, whether a secretary or a railroad worker,\u201d he said. \u201cHer heroes ran businesses with employees who were very loyal because they were treated fairly. Of course, some people had to be fired. But she makes a big deal out of the virtue of justice, which applies in business as well as politics.\u201dAnd even though \u201cshe\u2019d celebrate what Travis did with the taxi industry, showing the world how all those regulations made no sense, she also believed there are rules of justice that do make sense and she supported,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just run over all the regulations you don\u2019t happen to like.\u201dMr. Brook complained that Rand\u2019s critics are quick to point to her followers\u2019 failures, but rarely mention their successes. He cited the example of John A. Allison IV, the much-admired former head of BB&T Corporation, a regional bank in the Southeast that he built into one of the nation\u2019s largest before he stepped down in 2008. Mr. Allison handed out copies of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d to senior executives and is a major donor to the Ayn Rand Institute. He incorporated many of Rand\u2019s teachings into his 2014 book, \u201cThe Leadership Crisis and the Free Market Cure.\u201d\u201cJohn is a gentleman and he actually studied Rand\u2019s works in depth,\u201d Mr. Brook said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be more different from Travis.\u201dMr. Allison has called for abolishing the Federal Reserve, while acknowledging that so drastic a step is unlikely. He has met with Mr. Trump at the White House and has been widely mentioned as a potential successor to Janet L. Yellen as Fed chief.Despite Rand\u2019s pervasive influence and continuing popularity on college campuses, relatively few people embrace her version of extreme libertarianism. Former President Barack Obama, in a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, criticized her \u201cnarrow vision\u201d and described her work \u201cas one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we\u2019d pick up.\u201dShe\u2019s also dismissed by most serious academics. \u201cMention Ayn Rand to a group of academic philosophers and you\u2019ll get laughed out of the room,\u201d Mr. Cahoone said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s something to be said for Rand. She takes Nietzschean individualism to an extreme, but she\u2019s undeniably inspirational.\u201dAs the mysterious character John Galt proclaims near the end of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d: \u201cDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it\u2019s yours.\u201dBut Rand has little to say about making the transition from this kind of heroic entrepreneurial vision to a mature corporation with many stakeholders, a problem many company founders have confronted and struggled with, whether or not they\u2019ve read or been influenced by her. \u201cShe never really had to manage anything,\u201d Mr. Cahoone said. \u201cShe was surrounded by people who saw her as a cult figure. She didn\u2019t have employees, she had worshipers.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Kalanick is said to have turned this summer from Rand to what is considered one of the greatest dramatic works in the English language, Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry V\u201d \u2014 a play in which the young, reckless and wayward Prince Hal matures into one of England\u2019s most revered and beloved monarchs.An earlier version of this column misstated Andrew F. Puzder\u2019s association with CKE Restaurants. He is a former chief executive of the company, not its current chief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swimmer Matt Grevers\u2019s Revival Lets Him Continue a Career", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the 2016 United States Olympic trials, Matt Grevers clocked 52.76 seconds in the 100-meter backstroke and was devastated. A year later, Grevers clocked 52.71 at the United States world championships trials and was overjoyed.To be a world-class swimmer in the United States is to teeter on an emotional, and often a financial, seesaw. In 2016, Grevers finished third at the United States trials, missing by one place a spot on what would have been his third Olympic team. Last month in Indianapolis, he finished first in a finals field that included the gold medalist in Rio de Janeiro, Ryan Murphy, to secure a berth, along with the runner-up, Murphy, in the world championships, which are underway in Budapest. The preliminaries of the 100-meter backstroke are on Monday.\u201cI\u2019d like to say I didn\u2019t doubt that I could win again,\u201d Grevers said during the Indianapolis trials, \u201cbut I think once your ego takes a hit like mine did at trials, it\u2019s hard to convince yourself.\u201dGrevers, 32, is three months older than Michael Phelps, who was the capital that lifted all bank accounts for the United States\u2019 best swimmers. Phelps\u2019s success as a performer and a pitchman made it possible for a 7-year-old Murphy to express his desire to become a professional swimmer \u2014 a dream he fulfilled after a standout career at the University of California.But while Murphy, 22, was settling on an agent and signing a suit and apparel contract with Speedo, Grevers was sweating his future. After he failed to make the Olympic team, Grevers said, his earning power short-circuited.Grevers, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, entered this summer knowing that he had to qualify to compete in Budapest or he would lose his contract with his primary sponsor, the swimwear company TYR. Unlike athletes in other sports, swimmers typically do not receive guaranteed money. Their contracts are performance-based, \u201cso if you don\u2019t perform you don\u2019t cash in,\u201d Grevers said, adding, \u201cIt would have been over if I hadn\u2019t made the team.\u201dHe meant not only the contract but likely his career. \u201cI would have had to face the reality of \u2018I need income,\u2019\u201d Grevers said. He added, \u201cI probably would have been done.\u201dGrevers is married to Annie Chandler Grevers, a former United States national team swimmer who works for the magazine Swimming World. They live in Tucson, where his monthly stipend from the national team stretches much further than it would in Berkeley, Calif., where Murphy is based. In November, the couple had their first child, which gave Matt Grevers a richer perspective on life but also another mouth to feed.\u201cHe takes his role of provider for his family seriously,\u201d Annie Grevers said.Grevers declined to disclose his annual income, but he is fluent in finance. He used the $25,000 from U.S.A. Swimming for each of his four gold medals and the $15,000 for each of his two silver medals toward the purchase of four investment properties in Tucson.Rental income from those properties helped pay bills this year. But all the fat in the household budget was pared, starting with restaurant meals.\u201cWhen you go from having a constant flow of income coming in to the prospect of having no foreseeable income, you\u2019ve got to think differently,\u201d Matt Grevers said, adding, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to form a budget and stick to it.\u201dGrevers, a captain of the United States squad that began competition on Sunday in Budapest, is one of the more popular athletes in swimming. He said he could feel the crowd at the trials trying to will him to the wall in the backstroke. Last year, after failing to make the Olympic team, Grevers said, he felt as if he had let his family and fans down.He was hesitant to venture out in public, lest he see disappointment in fans\u2019 faces. But his wife suggested a trip to the zoo in Omaha, where the Olympic trials were held, before their flight home, and it became the first salve to his wounds. The zoo was packed with swimmers who reacted as enthusiastically to seeing Grevers as they did to any of the caged animals.\u201cA lot of people took their pictures with him,\u201d Annie Grevers said, \u201cand I think it helped him see that people weren\u2019t defining him by one bad race.\u201dThe Greverses were on a plane on the tarmac in Green Bay, Wis., during the men\u2019s Olympic 100-meter backstroke final. Ignoring the flight crew\u2019s instructions, Grevers kept his phone on so he could follow Murphy\u2019s victory and David Plummer\u2019s third-place finish. He said he was proud of his countrymen\u2019s performance but also sad not to have been there.\u201cI think there will be a little scar from 2016 trials forever in me,\u201d Grevers said after his victory here at the United States world trials. \u201cBut it\u2019s healing now, and this race helps heal it more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wider U.S. Sanctions on Venezuela Risk Biting Both Countries", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The United States and Venezuela are on a collision course as President Trump promises to inflict economic pain if President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro goes through with an election intended to enhance his powers.Mr. Maduro has pledged not to back down from the vote on Sunday, so the only question is whether the collision will be a fender-bender or a thundering crash.The two countries\u2019 economies are tightly intertwined through the oil that Venezuela sells to the United States: It accounts for roughly 10 percent of the oil America imports. And Washington has powerful tools at its disposal, including a complete prohibition on Venezuelan oil.Whatever Mr. Trump decides to do next is likely to echo, from the Venezuelan Treasury to the American gasoline pump.Despite nearly two decades of sour relations with Venezuela, the United States has enormous leverage as one of its most important customers and as one the few countries with refineries capable of processing poor-quality heavy crude.The result could be more violent strife or even a military coup. And shock waves across the hemisphere could create more complications for the Trump administration as it tries to focus on Iran and North Korea.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was a top State Department energy envoy in the Obama administration.\u201cTough sanctions could lead to a default on their bonds and a collapse of internal investment and oil production,\u201d he added. \u201cOther impacts could include civil unrest, refugee flows across their borders, and a cutoff of Venezuelan financial support to Cuba and Haiti that could lead to migration flows to the United States.\u201dThere is also the potential for collateral damage to the United States.Any trade embargo could raise gasoline prices, cost jobs in the oil patch and dampen profits for several major refiners. A decrease in Venezuelan exports could raise global oil prices, bolstering the economies of Russia and Iran just as Washington prepares to ratchet up sanctions on those countries.In briefings, administration officials would not speculate on what would come next, but they emphasized a menu of options. Mr. Trump, in a statement last week, said \u201cthe United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\u201dThe immediate concern is over Mr. Maduro\u2019s plan to hold an election this weekend for a Constituent Assembly that would circumvent the opposition-controlled Congress and write a new constitution. The new assembly, which is devised to be dominated by groups that support the regime, would presumably consolidate more control in the hands of the president.The escalating street violence and hunger in Venezuela are threatening to spread. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have already fled the country, heightening social pressures. The country\u2019s plummeting economy has added pressure on a region struggling with low commodity prices.For now, the United States is treading cautiously in its approach to Venezuela.Mr. Maduro has repeatedly said that Mr. Trump\u2019s past sanctions against his government are evidence of American imperialism and that current threats will not be heeded. If Mr. Trump \u201chas dared to say \u2018no\u2019 to the Constituent Assembly, we tell him \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 \u2014 the Constituent Assembly will go ahead \u2014 Constituent Assembly now more than ever,\u201d Mr. Maduro said recently.More consequential would be future sanctions to limit American oil companies and service companies from operating in Venezuela or to limit the ability of the Venezuelan national oil company to engage in banking activities in the United States or trade with American companies. That scenario would effectively end Venezuelan oil exports to the United States and prohibit Pdvsa from importing the American light oil used to dilute its heavy crude for transport through pipelines and processing.Such moves, at least in the short term, could result in a collapse in production of the oil that Venezuela depends on to get the foreign currency it needs to buy food and to service its debt.\u201cIt will put Pdvsa on its knees and almost certainly lead to default,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston.Depending on the details of future sanctions, Citgo, wholly owned by the Venezuelan state oil company, could also be crippled. Citgo operates roughly 4 percent of American refining capacity as well as a sprawling network of pipelines and gasoline stations in the United States.Venezuela now sells more than 700,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States, out of a total production of roughly two million barrels a day, or just over 2 percent of world production. Energy experts say Venezuela could eventually replace the American market, by exporting more heavy oil to China and India, though at a discount. And the 100,000 barrels a day of light oil it imports from the United States could be replaced by imports from Nigeria and Algeria.Venezuela would have to move quickly. It faces big bond payments later this year, and its foreign reserves are dwindling.\u201cThey have shown that they can get along, so I\u2019m not sure suspending the purchasing of 700,000 barrels will crack the government,\u201d said Luis E. Giusti, a former Pdvsa chief executive. \u201cHow much more things will deteriorate compared to what is happening now is a big question that doesn\u2019t have a straightforward answer.\u201dIn the United States, a cutoff of Venezuelan oil imports would force Chevron, Valero Energy, Phillips 66 and other refiners to replace the heavy crude with imports from places like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, producing higher tanker costs. The administration could sell the refiners supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve to help cushion the blow to their profit margins.\u201cIn the short term it\u2019s going to be very disruptive,\u201d said Chet M. Thompson, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade group that has been lobbying against sanctions that would disrupt Venezuelan oil imports. \u201cYou are going to end up driving fuel prices up.\u201dNicholas Casey contributed reporting from Lima, Peru.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maestros of the Concert Merchandise Movement", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWelcome to the world of elevated concert merch: special collections linked to specific cultural events, limited in availability, and one of the newest and fastest-growing subsectors in the fashion world. From the first half of 2014 to the first half of 2017, the amount of tour-related products sold online increased by 720 percent, according to Edited, a company that tracks analytics at more than 90,000 brands and retailers.In a twist of corporate musical chairs, Bravado\u2019s Mr. Vlasic actually founded the Thread Shop during a 12-year stint at Sony, where he began in the finance department, while Ms. Wong worked at Bravado until 2015.Now, the two are engaged in something of an arms race to own the increasingly lucrative cross-disciplinary fashion territory they have defined.The Thread Shop is a much younger operation. It began in 2009 as a straightforward T-shirt business to support touring artists, and eventually grew to provide more exclusive, higher-priced pieces and capsule collections. The company now works with some of the same retailers as Bravado, including Urban Outfitters, Pacsun and Kohl\u2019s, and, like Bravado, operates globally.Sony would not provide revenue figures for the Thread Shop. But Richard Story, the president of Commercial Music Group, which handles licensing, estate management, television and film contracts and more for Sony, acknowledged that while currently a minor contributor to the parent company\u2019s balance sheet: \u201cThere\u2019s no question that when we\u2019re in our strategic planning conversations, we look at these types of businesses and think, \u2018Can they be very robust multimillion-dollar revenue operations?\u2019 We firmly believe they can be.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at Sony\u2019s offices on Madison Square Park in Manhattan, Ms. Wong considered Bravado\u2019s position in the field. \u201cThey are the leader of our arena,\u201d Ms. Wong said. But, she added: \u201cI start from a trend standpoint because I think that\u2019s why people will come to us. How do you do a concert tee and take it to the next level? Do you crop it, do you cut it, do you put safety pins in it?\u201d Ms. Wong, who previously worked at Bloomingdale\u2019s, Calvin Klein and Benetton, was wearing an ASAP Ferg shirt that she had cut a V-shaped neckline into herself.When first releasing an artist\u2019s products, both Bravado and the Thread Shop will often do so through pop-up shops. \u201cWe\u2019ll identify the ground zero retailers that create demand, create urgency,\u201d said Frank Bartolotta, Bravado\u2019s senior vice president for national sales. \u201cThat creates a crazy amount of energy. Because it\u2019s like, \u2018If I didn\u2019t get it during that three-day cycle, I need to figure out when I\u2019m going to get it.\u2019 Then we go to a larger retail partner.\u201dThus in early May, \u201cStarboy\u201d merchandise was sold for three days only at boutiques in eight cities across the United States, including Patron of the New in New York and FourTwoFour on Fairfax in Los Angeles, and also online for limited periods. After that, Bravado went to PacSun for a larger rollout. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an experience tied into this, it becomes stale, it becomes mute,\u201d Mr. Bartolotta said. \u201cWhen we create these moments that live there for literally 72 hours, there\u2019s an alertness, and that fan is rabid.\u201dThe key is to ensure that pop-ups offer certain exclusive items. \u201cThe kid that goes to New York wants the New York piece,\u201d Mr. Bartolotta said. \u201cThe kid who goes to L.A. wants the L.A. piece. And then there\u2019s the main collection. So if you weren\u2019t in L.A., you can then go, weeks later, to PacSun to get that extended collection.\u201dMs. Wong takes it a step further and offers a different collection at each distribution point. \u201cI don\u2019t want fans to see the same thing over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan, you\u2019re going to be shopping online; if we drop something at Urban Outfitters, you\u2019ll go to Urban; and if you\u2019re at the tour, you\u2019ll buy a T-shirt, too.\u201dOr, if you know your way around the resale market, you might go to eBay, Grailed or similar online marketplaces for the items you missed. After all, not everyone lives in the city where a store pops up or a tour stops. \u201cThe reselling culture is now crossing over into the world of music and merchandise,\u201d said Lawrence Schlossman, the brand director of Grailed. \u201cWith social media, when you see a line outside of a pop-up or you see people making money or getting a lot of likes and looking cool, that creates a hype cycle that feeds itself.\u201dStill, while the pop-up shops and exclusive items are a key for building attention, the moneymakers are the items that many consumers can afford and easily access. \u201cYou always need premium to sell the mass,\u201d Ms. Wong said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a Gucci bag at $5,000, but I\u2019ll buy a wallet for $700 and still be part of that lifestyle.\u201d And in fact, according to Edited, the artists who drive the most e-commerce traffic are Run-DMC, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Ramones (all Bravado clients). Not exactly of the moment.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge middle market in this trend,\u201d said Katie Smith, senior analyst at Edited. \u201cIt\u2019s not just buzzy, like, \u2018Check out the latest Pablo tee.\u2019\u201d (Pablo being from Kanye West\u2019s album \u201cThe Life of Pablo.\u201d) \u201cFor retail, there\u2019s still a big opportunity for the older, more known artists. That stuff doesn\u2019t sell as fast, but it performs very well.\u201dLaird Adamson, the head of international at Bravado, said: \u201cThere\u2019s an evergreen business that happens at Kohl\u2019s that\u2019s in constant replenishment. It\u2019s the stuff that lives there all day long, drives volume for us, doesn\u2019t make a lot of noise. And then there\u2019s us identifying with key retailers where every other month there\u2019s a different event happening. At Urban Outfitters, there\u2019s a Gaga event for one month. Then there\u2019s a Bieber event for two months and then that goes away.\u201d\u201cThe challenge I have on a daily basis is, \u2018How do we drive traffic to these stores?\u2019\u201d Mr. Bartolotta said. \u201cYou look at malls and you see traffic is down. We\u2019re bringing an experience that\u2019s being driven by the artists. When you do that, these retailers\u2019 appetites are stimulated. If we don\u2019t do this, we\u2019ll die like a lot of malls are dying.\u201dLike all successful brand builders, Mr. Vlasic and Ms. Wong know their references.Ms. Wong calls out \u201cArmani and Valentino and Prada\u201d because \u201cyou can look at it right away and know whose hand it is. And the same goes with artists. These kids are too smart. If it\u2019s not authentic, they don\u2019t want it.\u201dAnd for Mr. Vlasic, \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Disney provide inspiration.\u201cDo consumers tire of it?\u201d he said. \u201cSure, but keep reinventing it, keep rethinking how to do it. \u2018Star Wars\u2019 products are everywhere. Your product can be in Target, in Coach, in Uniqlo. You just have to be smart about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Is Investigating Jane Sanders Over Burlington College Bank Loan", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal authorities are investigating a 2010 land deal for a Vermont college that was run at the time by Jane Sanders, the wife of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The deal ultimately contributed to her ouster as president of the college.The deal involved a $10 million sale of about 33 acres of lakefront property by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington to Burlington College \u2014 where Ms. Sanders was president \u2014 so the college could relocate and expand.To finance the purchase, the college needed to borrow from a bank and obtain additional financing from the diocese, according to David V. Dunn, a Burlington College trustee at the time.A public agency issued a bond, which the bank then bought. The college needed to demonstrate that it had the financial resources to pay the bank loan, which it did by saying that it would receive $2.6 million in donations and that it would also increase its enrollment, Mr. Dunn said. \u201cNeither of those were true,\u201d he said in an interview Monday.When the donations fell short of the $2.6 million promised by Ms. Sanders, she was forced to resign in 2011. Financially strained, the college closed last year.A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified because the matter was still under investigation, confirmed that federal authorities have been looking into the deal. The Washington Post reported on Monday that the investigation has accelerated in recent months, with prosecutors hauling boxes of records from the college.Jeff Weaver, a spokesman for Ms. Sanders and her husband, said that she was being scapegoated for the college\u2019s failure. \u201cThis was a deal that was vetted by other senior members of the staff,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like she just went in there and said, \u2018Hey, I want to borrow $10 million, could you write me a check?\u2019\u201dInitially, the board was not concerned about the financing of the deal, Mr. Dunn, the former trustee, said on Monday.\u201cAt some point, it changed when the board was made aware that the rate of donations that were pledged was not near what was received,\u201d Mr. Dunn said. \u201cIn addition to that, there was a large donor who had advised the board that the donation was actually an estate gift that was going to be paid when she died, and that she was feeling quite healthy.\u201dMr. Dunn said that the overstatement of pledges was a factor in Ms. Sanders\u2019s termination but that there were other management issues as well. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there was fraud in terms of willful intent,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that there was information that was misrepresented.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Weaver, the spokesman for Ms. Sanders, said, \u201cThe fact that the pledges did not necessarily come through does not mean they were not valid when made.\u201dMr. Weaver also characterized the investigation as politically motivated. He said it had been set in motion by Brady Toensing, a lawyer who filed a complaint about the land deal with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Vermont in January 2016 on behalf of various Catholic parishioners. A spokesman for the office did not respond to a telephone message on Monday.\u201cWe request an investigation into what appears to be federal loan fraud involving the sale of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington headquarters,\u201d to Burlington College, Mr. Toensing wrote in a letter to the federal prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201cThis apparent fraud resulted in as much as $2 million in losses to the Diocese and an unknown amount of loss to People\u2019s United Bank, a federally financed financial institution,\u201d the letter said. At the time, Mr. Toensing was the vice chairman for the Vermont Republican Party. He later became the state chairman for Donald J.

He was the public face of the mistreatment of American prisoners at the North Vietnamese camp known as the Hanoi Hilton, where as a Navy pilot he was confined and tortured for over five years. Decades later, he was the happy-go-lucky captain of the Straight Talk Express, the campaign bus where he cultivated his image as a candid political maverick in his failed 2000 presidential run. He was elected to a sixth Senate term this past November.Four presidents \u2014 Donald J. Trump, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and the elder George Bush \u2014 issued heartfelt statements wishing Mr. McCain a speedy recovery late Wednesday.\u201cSenator John McCain has always been a fighter,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 election, called the senator a \u201chero & one of the bravest fighters I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\u201cCancer doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s up against,\u201d Mr. Obama tweeted. \u201cGive it hell, John.\u201dOn Wednesday night, about a dozen lawmakers gathered in the Dirksen Senate Office Building to explore a health care compromise asked Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who is a Baptist minister, to lead them in prayer for their colleague.\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who was present. He said finding a solution to the health care impasse was \u201cmore challenging without him.\u201dMr. McConnell called Mr. McCain a hero to both Senate Republicans and the nation at large.\u201cHe has never shied from a fight, and I know that he will face this challenge with the same extraordinary courage that has characterized his life,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday night. \u201cWe all look forward to seeing this American hero again soon.\u201dMr. McCain endured grueling rehabilitation from his time in the prison camp but later led the effort to reconcile with Hanoi in a striking gesture of forgiveness. After quickly becoming prominent as a House member in his first election in 1982, Mr. McCain won the Senate seat given up by the Arizona icon Barry Goldwater in 1986. He became a fixture in the Senate, where he denounced the corrosive effects of big money in political campaigns and was a central player in congressional debates on military policy, immigration and health care.Wednesday\u2019s disclosure suggested that Mr. McCain\u2019s condition was more serious than initially believed, although the statement said that \u201che is recovering from his surgery \u2018amazingly well,\u2019\u201d according to his doctors, \u201cand his underlying health is excellent.\u201dAs the Republican health care bill teetered in recent days, Mr. Trump referred affectionately to Mr. McCain as a \u201ccrusty voice\u201d in the capital. But their relationship has been fraught.In July 2015, during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump denigrated Mr. McCain\u2019s military record, saying he was considered a war hero only because he was captured. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a comment that many suggested had gone too far. Mr. McCain, who at the time was facing conservative opposition in his re-election bid, remained a supporter of Mr. Trump throughout the campaign.However, Mr. McCain has pressed for a deep investigation into any interference into the presidential campaign by Russia, which he considers an adversary. On Tuesday, and despite his condition, Mr. McCain issued a statement warning about Russian intrusion in Ukraine and calling for new sanctions against Moscow.Mr. McCain faced an uphill battle in 2008 given public discontentment with the United States-led war in Iraq and overall fatigue with the administration of George W. Bush. Mr. McCain picked Sarah Palin, then the governor of Alaska, as his vice-presidential running mate in an effort to reinvigorate a flagging campaign with a woman on the ticket.A crucial moment in the race occurred in late September 2008 when he suddenly suspended his campaign and returned to Washington for an economic summit meeting at the White House that was also attended by Mr. Obama, then a Democratic senator from Illinois. Mr. McCain\u2019s 11th-hour effort to focus on the economy was generally considered a lost opportunity, and the financial collapse helped propel Mr. Obama to the presidency.Mr. McCain currently leads the Senate Armed Services Committee and is a top proponent of using military force overseas. The Senate is preparing to take up the annual Pentagon policy measure produced by the committee.In Congress, he is probably best known for his efforts to champion changes in campaign finance laws over the fierce objections of some of his Republican colleagues, particularly Mr. McConnell.The standard of care includes surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and then radiation and chemotherapy. In the past, radiation sometimes diminished patients\u2019 brain function, but techniques have improved so that more healthy brain tissue is spared and patients fare better, said Dr. Mitchel S. Berger, a neurosurgeon and glioblastoma expert at the University of California, San Francisco.An earlier version of this article misstated when Donald J.

He inspected thousands of People\u2019s Liberation Army troops stationed here, met with local dignitaries and swore in Carrie Lam as the city\u2019s new chief executive, the top local official.Hong Kong is a \u201cplural society\u201d with \u201cdifferent views and even major differences on some issues,\u201d Mr. Xi said while speaking to dignitaries at the inauguration of Hong Kong\u2019s government at the city\u2019s convention center along Victoria Harbor.He cautioned that \u201cmaking everything political or deliberately creating differences\u201d will \u201cseverely hinder Hong Kong\u2019s economic and social development.\u201dMr. Xi warned that \u201cany attempt to endanger China\u2019s sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government\u201d or to \u201cuse Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and is absolutely impermissible.\u201dHis comments on \u201cinfiltration and sabotage\u201d in particular signal that the government will likely try to resurrect security legislation, known as Article 23, against sedition and subversion, said Willy Lam, a political analyst and adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\u201cThis is the first time Xi Jinping or anyone in the leadership has mentioned a \u2018red line,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning to the pro-independence or other so-called anti-China elements to not challenge the authority of the central government.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s visit to the military garrison here furthered that message, Mr. Lam said. \u201cIt\u2019s an implicit threat, if the Hong Kong police are not able to do the job or there\u2019s widespread disorder, the troops will be mobilized,\u201d Mr. Lam added.Mr. Xi said the key to Hong Kong\u2019s success was the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formulation, under which Hong Kong maintains its own legal, economic and local political system. But many in the city worry that the system is eroding under growing pressure from mainland China.\u201cHong Kong originally had freedom of speech, but in the future, under the influence of the Chinese government, it won\u2019t be so easy to speak out,\u201d said Shandi Leung, 25, as she stood alongside the slow line of protesters walking through the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong island.Around her, people carried signs for a host of causes: workers\u2019 rights, community agriculture, independent media and Falun Gong, the spiritual movement banned in mainland China. They marched in stultifying heat and intermittent downpours, united by calls for a more direct say in their government and concerns their civil liberties are under threat.On Friday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Hong Kong\u2019s affairs were a domestic matter and the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which outlined Hong Kong\u2019s return to China and the protection of basic rights for its population, was \u201chistory and of no practical significance.\u201dHe was addressing comments by Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, on the importance of civil liberties in Hong Kong, and remarks by a U.S. State Department spokeswoman who said Washington was concerned about intrusions on freedom of the press and other rights in the city.A British Foreign Office spokeswoman responded that the \u201cSino-British Joint Declaration remains as valid today as it did when it was signed over 30 years ago,\u201d Reuters reported.On the streets of Hong Kong, concerns about attacks on fundamental rights were evident. A group of prominent pro-democracy activists including Joshua Wong and Leung Kwok-hung, a local lawmaker, say they were set upon by thugs when they tried to protest outside a flag-raising ceremony Saturday morning. The police took away some of the activists but later released them.One protester, Avery Ng, said he and another activist, Figo Chan, were assaulted by the police while they were in custody. The police media office did not answer calls for comment Saturday afternoon.July 1 is a public holiday in Hong Kong to mark the handover to Chinese sovereignty, but it also has become a big day for pro-democracy protests. In 2003, a half-million people took to the streets to protest the government\u2019s handling of the deadly SARS outbreak and efforts to enact the Article 23 national security law. The size of subsequent protests has varied as discontent with the government has ebbed and flowed.In the fall of 2014, thousands of demonstrators occupied key roadways for months to demand the chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, step down and that the public be given a bigger say in choosing his replacement.But Mr. Leung remained, finishing a term that ended Saturday. And Beijing refused to make any substantive changes to its proposal for the chief executive election, which allowed a public vote but only for candidates vetted by a pro-Beijing nominating committee.Pro-democracy representatives in Hong Kong\u2019s local legislature rejected the proposal. So the chief executive was chosen by the 1,194-member election committee, a body packed with supporters of Beijing. Ms. Lam, who served as Mr. Leung\u2019s chief deputy, was elected in March with 777 votes despite trailing a more popular candidate in public opinion polls.She gave a much shorter speech than Mr. Xi on Saturday, saying she would cultivate a \u201cnew style of governance to rebuild a harmonious society and renew the people\u2019s trust in the government.\u201dMrs. Lam delivered her speech in Mandarin, the national language of China, but she spoke briefly in Cantonese, the mother tongue of most Hong Kong residents, to read the lyrics of a song about social cohesion.Advertisement"}

We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe.\u201dThe frenzied addition of coal plants underscores how the world is set to remain dependent on coal for decades, despite fast growth in renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power.In China, concerns over smog and climate change have prompted a move toward renewables, as have slowing economic growth and a gradual shift in the Chinese economy away from heavy manufacturing and toward consumer industries. The addition of domestic capacity, though large on paper, does not mean there will be growth in coal consumption. The current coal plants are operating far below capacity because demand for coal-generated power has slowed considerably.But overseas, the Chinese are playing a different game.The China Energy Engineering Corporation, which has no public plans to develop coal power in China, is building 2,200 megawatts\u2019 worth of coal-fired power capacity in Vietnam and Malawi. Neither company responded to requests for comment.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Kevin P. Gallagher, a professor of global development policy at Boston University and an expert in Chinese energy investment overseas, said a strong infrastructure demand in developing countries and a sharp fall in coal financing by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank had opened up the field for Chinese involvement.\u201cIn China, you have lots of very competitive and politically influential companies \u2014 but all of a sudden there\u2019s no demand,\u201d Professor Gallagher said, referring to China\u2019s slowing economic growth. \u201cSo China is helping these companies go overseas to help make the adjustment at home less painful.\u201dSome of the countries targeted for coal-power expansion, like Egypt or Pakistan, currently burn almost no coal, and the new coal plants could set the course of their national energy policies for decades, environmentalists warn.In Egypt, coal projects by Shanghai Electric and other global developers are set to bring the country\u2019s coal-fired capacity to 17,000 megawatts, from near zero, according to the Urgewald database.Four virtual-reality films take you on, above and below the Antarctic ice.Pakistan\u2019s coal capacity is set to grow to 15,300 megawatts from 190. In Malawi, planned coal projects would bring its coal-fired capacity to 3,500 megawatts from zero.Chinese companies are not the only drivers of the global coal expansion.Western investors also continue to play a role in financing new coal plants overseas. Bonds and shares of the world\u2019s biggest coal developers, like India\u2019s National Thermal Power and Marubeni, are frequently found in the portfolios of large institutional investors and banks.To be sure, countries like China and Japan are also big players in renewables. China is a major exporter of solar panels and wind turbines, and is leading the construction of the Quaid-e-Azam solar park in Pakistan, one of the world\u2019s largest.\u201cFor now, those concerns seem not to extend elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Gimon said.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Chicago Sun-Times, New Owners Vow Return to Paper\u2019s Working-Class Roots", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 At a Christmas party in December, Edwin Eisendrath, a former Chicago alderman, bumped into Jorge Ramirez, a labor leader. As guests nibbled on decadent desserts, the two men contemplated an audacious plan.Should they buy The Chicago Sun-Times, the city\u2019s scrappy but perpetually endangered tabloid?Less than two weeks ago, their fledgling idea came to fruition, when a group led by Mr. Eisendrath overcame a rival bid by Tronc, the publisher of The Chicago Tribune. The deal not only saved The Sun-Times from possible extinction, but also created a highly unusual arrangement: Labor unions now share ownership of a news organization that covers them closely, in what is still one of the nation\u2019s strongest union towns.The idea is particularly resonant in Chicago, one of the last two-newspaper cities in the country, and the place that gave America Studs Terkel and Upton Sinclair\u2019s \u201cThe Jungle.\u201d\u201cThe North Star, for us, is great journalism that genuinely reflects the lives and interests of the working people of Chicago,\u201d Mr. Eisendrath, 59, said in an interview last week in his downtown office, a room with few trinkets or wall hangings but a sweeping view of the Chicago River.\u201cOur story is such a Chicago story,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s such an overlap of identity between the city that we love and the group that we put together and this mission that we\u2019re on. We think we\u2019re going to serve the city really well.\u201dAlong with Mr. Eisendrath, the new ownership of The Sun-Times includes several private investors and the Chicago Federation of Labor, an umbrella organization whose president is Mr. Ramirez. Since the deal closed, Mr. Eisendrath has sprinted into action, assembling a board of directors, arranging new office space in the city\u2019s booming West Loop neighborhood and sketching out his vision. The deal also included The Chicago Reader, a weekly.The sale capped a tumultuous few months for The Sun-Times. In May, Tronc said it had entered into an agreement to buy Wrapports Holdings, the paper\u2019s owner. The move, however, caught the attention of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, which immediately said it would investigate the possible acquisition \u2014 The Sun-Times is The Tribune\u2019s main competitor \u2014 and asked other suitors to submit bids.Mr. Ferro donated his stake in The Sun-Times to a charitable trust last year to avoid perceived conflicts of interest after taking a $44 million stake in Tronc, known then as Tribune Publishing.When Mr. Eisendrath\u2019s group emerged victorious, many in the country\u2019s third-biggest city \u2014 at least those who pay attention to the ownership of The Sun-Times \u2014 felt a sense of relief.\u201cIt would be wonderful to have a paper that attracted to its pages some of the literary ghosts of the great age of Chicago journalism,\u201d said Thomas Geoghegan, a labor lawyer and author in Chicago. \u201cThose journalists back then were the voices of the working class, because they were working class.\u2019\u2019Others were skeptical of how truly progressive the new owners are. \u201cIt will probably wind up being a Chicago political-establishment-oriented newspaper,\u201d said Don Rose, a longtime political operative in Chicago who has been critical of Mr. Eisendrath\u2019s political career.Mr. Eisendrath may seem to be an unlikely champion of the working class, given that he grew up wealthy on Chicago\u2019s North Side and graduated from Harvard. But he taught public school for several years and, at 29, represented the city\u2019s Lincoln Park district as an alderman. He said he believed in keeping a diversity of working-class voices in newspapers.\u201cThe Sun-Times has always had this in its DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cAround the country, it\u2019s being lost, and I think it\u2019s one of the reasons that Americans all over the country have come to distrust journalism.\u201d(Mr. Eisendrath is distantly related to the Sulzberger family, which publishes The New York Times.)Before the sale, some in Chicago feared that Tronc\u2019s ownership would shift The Sun-Times, which has traditionally been a progressive counterpoint to the more conservative Tribune, to the right. Others thought Tronc would simply close The Sun-Times.In a statement, a Tronc spokeswoman said the company had \u201calways been committed to keeping The Sun-Times an independent media voice within the city of Chicago.\u201dRocked by ownership turmoil and crippled by staff cuts, The Sun-Times is hardly the same celebrated Chicago paper that won eight Pulitzer Prizes and once featured the columnist Mike Royko. Circulation has fallen to about 120,000, compared with roughly 350,000 a decade ago, and the paper, like most print publications, has struggled to figure out how to succeed in the digital age. Its website was clunky and outdated until a recent redesign.The Sun-Times also has a burdensome $25 million-a-year contract with Tronc to print and distribute the paper, which the new ownership group has said it will honor.The Sun-Times\u2019s sports coverage remains strong, but the paltry size of its newsroom staff \u2014 about 70 employees, including fewer than 40 reporters \u2014 has made it difficult for the paper to delve deeply into some of the city\u2019s biggest issues, including immigration and gun violence.Still, the newspaper has a loyal following among minorities, progressives and members of Chicago\u2019s working class. Mr. Eisendrath\u2019s group also bought Answers Media, a production studio that could help The Sun-Times make progress digitally.Even as the arrival of the new ownership group was met with optimism in some circles, it also sent ripples of alarm through some in the newsroom. Labor unions carry a lot of might in Chicago, raising questions about whether the new owners might try to influence coverage.When Mr. Ramirez came to the Sun-Times building to introduce himself to staff members after the sale, he promised not to interfere with their work.\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I was nervous in the beginning,\u201d said Jim Kirk, the publisher and editor in chief. \u201cWe cover the unions very aggressively.\u201dMr. Kirk said he would like to add more cultural reporting in a city whose residents are obsessed with theater, art and architecture; more investigative reporters; and more feature articles about everyday life.So while the future of The Sun-Times remains uncertain, the deal has preserved one of Chicago\u2019s beloved institutions for now.Peter Alter, a historian for the Chicago History Museum, said Chicagoans had a deep affinity for The Sun-Times.\u201cEven as far back as rising like a phoenix from the ashes in the 1871 fire, Chicago has seen itself as favoring the underdog and as a working-class city,\u201d he said. The battle between The Chicago Tribune and The Sun-Times, he said, \u201chas that David and Goliath-type aspect to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Finance Meeting\u2019s Meager Results Reflect Nation\u2019s Problems", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s top leaders have gathered every five years since 1997 for a National Financial Work Conference. At past gatherings, they have created entire regulatory agencies and rearranged the rules for huge markets, almost overnight.So economists and regulators have been almost breathlessly speculating about this summer\u2019s work conference. Would the regulatory commissions overseeing the banking, securities and insurance industries be merged into the central bank? Would the legal definition of securities be broadened to shed some regulatory daylight on widespread activities like shadow banking, peer-to-peer online investment networks and off-balance-sheet wealth management products?But the actual results of the two-day work conference, which ended on Saturday afternoon, were much more, well, modest, to put it politely.The biggest accomplishment of the conference appeared to be an announcement that a commission would be established under the auspices of the cabinet. The commission would meet regularly to discuss issues of financial stability.But the leaders of the various financial regulatory agencies already meet regularly at the offices of the State Council, which is China\u2019s cabinet, although these meetings are not officially at the level of a commission.Some economists speculated in the final days before the two-day conference that at least the State Council meetings would be moved to the central bank. Allowing the central bank to serve tea and provide a conference room might give the central bank staff a little extra confidence by allowing them to negotiate as hosts. The central bank also has a history of advocating broader financial reforms than the other principal financial regulatory agencies: the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.But the leaders did not even move the meetings away from the State Council\u2019s offices to the central bank. And the result of the conference fell far short of predictions that the regulatory agencies might become clearly subservient to the central bank.The statement that accompanied the end of the conference did mention that the central bank had a role to play in preventing systemic financial risk. That is already the role of central banks in many countries. But Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group based in Shanghai, said that the specific mention of it in the statement might strengthen the central bank\u2019s hand somewhat.But he was skeptical of the new commission, noting that it would lack legal powers and have very few staff members. \u201cChina failed to achieve a real breakthrough in financial regulatory reform, and the rising conflicts between financial regulation and financial realities will continue to create troubles in the coming years,\u201d Mr. Liu said.State-controlled media carried a statement that described President Xi Jinping of China as having said at the conference, \u201cFinance is an important core competitiveness of the country, financial security is an important part of national security, and the financial system is an important economic and social development of the basic system.\u201dThe apparently meager results from the conference underline not just bureaucratic resistance to change, which Mr. Xi probably has the political muscle to overcome, but the very real and complex policy dilemmas facing China.One example lies in the vast, lightly regulated off-balance-sheet activities of Chinese banks, which Mizuho Securities calculated on Friday to be roughly equal to the entire assets on the balance sheets of the banking industry. Regulators in the West would probably force banks to move these activities as quickly as possible onto their balance sheets, which would probably have the effect of curtailing them.But many of these off-balance-sheet activities, like various kinds of loan guarantees, are crucial to providing financing for China\u2019s vigorous small and medium-size enterprises. These smaller businesses have had little luck competing with large, state-owned enterprises for conventional bank loans. But they account for the bulk of the job creation in China, at a time when the government is trying to slim down chronically loss-making industries like steel manufacturing and coal mining that are also big employers.Other financial regulatory disputes in China involve bureaucratic turf issues. One question lies in how to modernize China\u2019s antiquated securities law, which still applies only to stocks and bonds and lacks provisions to cover the more complex instruments issued these days by insurance companies, banks, online lenders and other types of financial institutions.The China Securities Regulatory Commission has pushed hard for the broadest possible definition of securities, which would give it much greater influence. The banking and insurance regulators have resisted this, contending that many of the new financial instruments are extensions of banking and insurance.One mystery left unresolved by the statement at the end of the conference lies in who will run the top financial regulatory agencies in the years ahead, particularly the central bank.Zhou Xiaochuan has been the governor of the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, since 2002, making him one of the world\u2019s longest-serving central bankers. Mr. Zhou is already more than two years past the usual retirement age for Chinese officials at his level. He received a special dispensation from the usual age limits by being allowed to join a senior government advisory body that is exempt from age limits.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

This was 10 years ago, when he was 59.Dr. Sinar explored the possibility of a sabbatical, but the university would have required him to do something related to his work during the break \u2014 which was just what he didn\u2019t want to do. Then he ran across a newspaper article on companies that arrange gap-year adventures, though most of them catered to high school and college students.\u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about anything for mature people,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I just picked up the phone and called one of them.\u201dIn short order, Dr. Sinar found himself with a summer apprenticeship to an expert on stonemasonry in Alaska. \u201cMy wife and I were renovating and selling houses at the time,\u201d he said, \u201cand I thought I might learn some things that would help me with those projects.\u201d In exchange for room and board, he studied how to create stone facings for houses; the work entailed learning how to collect appropriate rocks and then fit them into the available spaces. \u201cIt was like a big jigsaw puzzle,\u201d he said.For midcareer and older workers like Dr. Sinar who have the financial means and job flexibility to take time off, gap experiences can help answer questions about what they want to do in retirement \u2014 or simply recharge their batteries.\u201cWe mainly work with students,\u201d Ms. Bull said. \u201cBut we see an increasing number of older adults who aren\u2019t completely retired. They\u2019re looking for a new direction and asking themselves what they want to do for the rest of their lives.\u201dFew employers offer workers the opportunity to take breaks and return to their jobs, so sometimes the \u201cgap year\u201d is actually more of a gap between work and retirement. Unpaid sabbatical leave is offered by only 12 percent of employers, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, and only 4 percent of employers offered paid leave programs last year. As a result, most adult gap experiences require quitting a job.Dr. Sinar was one of the lucky few who could return to the same position. After he learned about stonemasonry, he traveled to Kathmandu in Nepal for back-to-back internships in Tibetan and ayurvedic medicine. \u201cAt the time, Western doctors were wary of this kind of homeopathic medicine,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was interested in bringing some of it home for my patients.\u201dThen he was off to Romania, where he worked with a team of archaeologists who were restoring a castle. The final stop was an apprenticeship to a master restorer of antique furniture in Pennsylvania. In all, he was away from his job for a year, and then retired five years later.His retirement, he said, has been shaped by the gap experiences. \u201cBefore this, I thought of myself as a left-brain person, but now I\u2019m much more right-brained,\u201d Dr. Sinar said. A hobby writing fiction has blossomed in retirement, and he has published two collections of short stories. \u201cI never would have thought of making that kind of stretch before,\u201d he said.Dr. Sinar says he spent roughly $10,000 on his gap experiences during his unpaid leave from the university \u2014 money he said was well spent: \u201cHow can you put a price on something that changes your life?\u201dKathleen Baskin was a 55-year-old empty nester when she left her job last summer as director of water policy for the state of Massachusetts to enroll in a one-year master\u2019s program for midcareer professionals at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.\u201cI knew my job too well \u2014 I wasn\u2019t learning anything new,\u201d said Ms. Baskin, who was trained as a civil engineer. \u201cI could have kicked back and cruised 10 or 15 years to retirement, but that didn\u2019t sound fun to me.\u201dHer classes at the Kennedy School, in areas like finance, international negotiation and diplomacy, were \u201cmind-benders,\u201d she said. And studying with students in their mid-to-late 30s was enlightening. \u201cIn addition to learning how to be a student again,\u201d Ms. Baskin said, \u201cI have had to keep up with technology, and make sure that I don\u2019t climb the stairs too slowly.\u201d She graduated in May and is looking for a leadership role at a nonprofit organization that works on environmental or climate change issues.The Harvard program represented a considerable investment: Ms. Baskin paid $50,000 in tuition, and left a position where she had earned $100,000 annually. She converted unused vacation time into pay that covered about a quarter of her expenses for the year, and funded the rest from savings and a loan and by reducing expenses.For Kathy Thomas, who is 63 and lives in suburban Philadelphia, paid or subsidized jobs have kept down the cost of gap experiences. She has had a succession of them \u2014 also arranged through Ms. Bull\u2019s firm \u2014 since retiring two years ago from Bank of America, where she was a senior vice president overseeing commercial banking in Pennsylvania and Delaware.\u201cYou\u2019ll always pay for your airfare \u2014 that is the biggest cost,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.So far, she has worked two weeks at an elephant sanctuary in Thailand (run by the nonprofit Save Elephant Foundation), volunteered for six weeks at a home for abused and neglected girls in South Africa, attended a weeklong writing retreat in North Carolina, and tended the fields for two weeks at an organic farm in Scotland.The elephant sanctuary provided room and board for $335 a week. \u201cIt was very basic accommodation with running water and flushing toilets,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cThere was no heat or air-conditioning, but they served three really wonderful vegetarian meals a day.\u201d And the organic farm in Scotland provided room and board in a castle.Ms. Thomas had not been eager to retire, but she also worried about early mortality because no one in her mother\u2019s family had lived past 69. \u201cI had so much I wanted to see and do, and I knew I couldn\u2019t wait another moment to retire and get to it,\u201d she said.One day at work, a light bulb went on. \u201cA colleague was telling me about his son\u2019s preparation for a gap year before starting college,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why couldn\u2019t I do that for my retirement?\u2019\u201dShe spent about six months planning her gap experiences, and then gave three months\u2019 notice of her intent to retire. Today, Ms. Thomas is still exploring and is not sure when the process will stop.\u201cAs long as I can continue learning and growing,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep going.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Inequality Erodes the Foundation of Modern Societies", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionThe greatest threat to Western liberal democracies in the future is more likely to come from extreme inequality than from Islamic extremism. This is because inequality erodes two foundation stones of modern society \u2014 openness to new ideas and opportunities, and a conviction that all citizens are morally equal.For the first three decades after World War II, openness and equality constituted a virtuous circle. Openness generated unprecedented levels of prosperity. That prosperity allowed America and the citizens of other modern nations to invest in excellent schools and universities, basic research, modern infrastructure and social insurance. These investments, in turn, made it easier for people to adapt to change, and fostered ever greater equalities of income and opportunity. The result was a high level of trust in the fairness of the political and economic system.But by the 1980s, the virtuous circle had stopped working. Economic and technological dynamism was upending jobs, convulsing communities and splintering families. At the same time, inequalities of earnings, wealth and job security were widening. After the financial crisis of 2008, many Americans, along with the citizens of other nations affected by the crisis, began to doubt the fairness of the system. Some came to feel neglected, disadvantaged, powerless or otherwise left behind. Within the decade they became easy fodder for demagogues who rejected openness and blamed \u201cothers\u201d \u2014 immigrants, foreign manufacturers, the news media, racial or ethnic or religious minorities \u2014 for what had happened to them.Enter Donald Trump, who promised to \u201cmake America great again\u201d by erecting walls, slowing immigration, withdrawing from free-trade agreements, cutting science budgets, attacking the free press and retreating from security alliances the United States has maintained since 1945. Meanwhile, Britain has pulled out of Europe. Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front, has been mounting a challenge to the French establishment. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and others of his ilk are emulating closed-society dictatorships. The result is likely to be less prosperity and widening inequality. The old virtuous circle is in danger of becoming a new vicious cycle.Two important new books offer useful and complementary explanations for what has occurred and, by implication, what must be done. In \u201cThe Fate of the West,\u201d Bill Emmott argues that the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath resulted from \u201ca devastating blend of complacency, negligence and corruption\u201d in the years leading up to it. The banks that created the calamity got bailed out and no top executive went to jail, but millions of people lost their jobs, savings and homes. Nearly a decade later, many citizens in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and elsewhere still feel trapped in dead-end jobs or don\u2019t have jobs at all. The result has been a profound loss of confidence in the system.Emmott, who was editor in chief of The Economist from 1993 to 2006, faults economic and political elites who chose to advance themselves at the expense of the larger society. He points to a paradox deep within modern capitalism: The same financial incentives that spur innovation and investment can also lead the captains of industry and finance to manipulate the rules of the game for their own benefit, and thereby harm those without power. These moneyed elites \u201care the true sources of the sense of inequality that is currently threatening the openness that has enabled us in the West to flourish,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey are the explanation for Trump, for Brexit, for Le Pen.\u201dEmmott argues that the financial interests of banks and big companies have distorted and disarmed public policy. Both of America\u2019s political parties are culpable. \u201cMost notorious, in the U.S. at least, was the successful lobbying in 1998 by Wall Street of the treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, and his deputy, Larry Summers, to block regulation of the trading of complex derivatives products which had been proposed by the then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brooksley Born.\u201d Emmott also criticizes big companies like Google, which have the lobbying and financial heft to get whatever they want in Washington. Campaign finance scandals have likewise revealed the political influence of money in Germany, Japan, France, Britain and elsewhere.The greatest source of unfairness stemming from the 2008 crash, according to Emmott, was the political and civic inequality it revealed. He believes that to preserve an open society we really do need, as Trump has said, to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Getting big money out of politics would enable us, for example, to combat the rigidities and high prices of monopolies through strong antitrust enforcement, and to remove the exorbitant privileges that allow big banks to make profits at the expense of the rest of society. But to do this we will need a new, or at least restored, vision of equality, based not on redistribution or socialism but on equality of voice and rights, so citizens can demand such reforms.Emmott sees political and civic equality as the means to an open society. But why shouldn\u2019t such equality be an end in itself? In \u201cOne Another\u2019s Equals: The Basis of Human Equality,\u201d Jeremy Waldron, a professor of philosophy at New York University School of Law, argues that Western thought has been rooted in the moral imperative that people be treated and respected as equals, whatever disparities may exist between them in wealth or talent. Waldron sees moral equality between human beings as what\u2019s left over when \u201cmerit\u201d is set aside. People deserve equal concern and respect because they are humans. Differences in wealth and power are consistent with this imperative if those differences serve the interests of all. Thus the answer to whose good is to be promoted in our social arrangements is \u2014 everyone\u2019s good.Waldron warns that wide inequalities of income and wealth can erode this moral imperative because they make it harder to make the mental leap it requires: The poor may come to seem so different from the privileged and prosperous that the well-off cannot understand a moral principle that assigns equal value to the living of a human life as such. \u201cWe might become so accustomed to economic inequality, so inured to the spectacle of it despite its being unjustified, that we cease to recognize those who are deprived as nevertheless our equals,\u201d he writes, clearly alluding to modern Western society. \u201cIt may even be morally embarrassing for us to recognize them as such,\u201d he argues, \u201csince we would then have to acknowledge the injustice. Better perhaps to turn away, or to try what it feels like to deny or suppress the proposition that poor people too are entitled to equal concern.\u201dWaldron urges the same sort of political equality as does Emmott, but he gets there from the opposite direction. For him, the purpose of political equality is not to preserve an open society. It is to honor basic human equality. \u201cIt is because we are one another\u2019s equals that we ought to have concern about high levels of economic inequality,\u201d he writes.Viewed from either Emmott\u2019s or Waldron\u2019s point of departure \u2014 the necessity of preserving an open society or of respecting the moral equality of human beings \u2014 the surge toward widening inequality is endangering the West. The culprit is not economic inequality per se. It is the political inequality that economic inequality can spawn. How will the vicious cycle we are now experiencing come to an end? These two insightful books suggest that if we don\u2019t recommit ourselves to political equality, we will become ever more closed, authoritarian societies. Economic elites should understand this. As Emmott notes, without openness, the West cannot thrive. But without equality, the West cannot last.Robert B. Reich is chancellor\u2019s professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. His most recent book is \u201cSaving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making the Most of a Hamptons Rental Home", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRentersAfter spending several summers making regular day trips to a beach club in Atlantic Beach on Long Island with their two young children, Jon and Michelle Wolk decided it was time to consider a vacation house in the Hamptons.They quickly found, however, that properties in their price range \u2014 $600,000 to $800,000 \u2014 looked more likely to cause headaches than provide relief from them.Instead, they opted for a summer rental.\u201cWe thought: \u2018Let\u2019s test the waters and get a better sense of what the expenses of owning a second home would be,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Wolk, a senior vice president of finance at a global investment firm. (The family owns a two-bedroom, two-bath co-op in the East 50s.) \u201cIf something breaks I can send the owner a text. I like the fixed-expense aspect.\u201dOf course, renting for the summer in the Hamptons isn\u2019t cheap either. Their three-bedroom, two-bath house, which lies on a quiet cul-de-sac in Westhampton, cost them $35,000 for the season between Memorial and Labor Days. Under the terms of their lease, they are also responsible for pool maintenance, weekly house cleaning, lawn care and garbage pick up, which comes to an additional $1,000 a month.Believe it or not, the house is \u201cactually on the lower end of the Hamptons rental market, it\u2019s not facing the ocean or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Wolk said. \u201cAnd we got something of a deal in the grand scheme of things because they had the listing price wrong \u2014 it was actually supposed to be $40,000 for the summer.\u201d (Their real estate agent, Elizabeth Capozzoli, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman, helped talk the owner into sticking with the lower price since the Wolks signed the lease before April.)All the rent was due up front, and they decided to pay the other costs up front as well. \u201cSo I\u2019m not reminded of the amount,\u201d Mr. Wolk said. \u201cThe point is to enjoy it and spend more time with family and friends.\u201d\u201cNow we have to go as much as possible,\u201d said Ms. Wolk, looking not especially perturbed by that outcome.Fortunately, the house is only about a 10-minute drive from the beach. They also liked that it wasn\u2019t on a main road and that the landlord replaced the air conditioner and pool heater right before they moved in. The pool heater was high priority, Ms. Wolk said, because they wanted to take full advantage of the rental during the entire season and were worried that their children, Holden, 6, and Harlow, 3, wouldn\u2019t swim in June if the water was too cold.There\u2019s another nice perk about having rented the house. \u201cI brought out Holden\u2019s iPad and Nintendo, but he never uses it,\u201d Ms. Wolk said. \u201cIn the city it\u2019s hard to get him off them.\u201dThe property was renovated by the owner to function as a gathering place for extended family and friends. The main part of the house has three bedrooms, but there are two extra bedrooms in the basement, and the garage is set up as a separate two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath.\u201cEvery weekend we have designated for family or friends,\u201d Mr. Wolk said.Ms. Wolk\u2019s younger cousins, for example, were happily availing themselves of the garage house over the Fourth of July weekend.Perhaps best of all, Westhampton is about a two-hour drive from New York and doesn\u2019t require taking Route 27, the quaint but often clogged road that funnels vacationers farther east.In part because of the comparatively easy trip, they have been able to come out every weekend except Father\u2019s Day. They made a firm decision not to be laissez-faire about using the house after calculating the per-weekend cost to be slightly under $3,000.To avoid having to skip a weekend in the Hamptons in July when Harlow turned three, they hosted a birthday party with her friends in the city in June and planned a family celebration out east on her actual birthday. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t miss out on her birthday\u201d with friends, Ms. Wolk said. \u201dBut we didn\u2019t want to miss out on a weekend,\u201d adding that Harlow thinks having a double birthday is the greatest thing in the world.Their commitment to using the house does not, however, extend to spending weekdays there. Ms. Wolk, a pediatric occupational therapist who\u2019s now a stay-at-home mom, explained that while schedules would allow her and the kids to spend some weeks there, she doesn\u2019t feel the same way as her husband about the seclusion of semirural life.\u201cI\u2019m chicken to stay alone here at night,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI like having a doorman and I find it comforting when I can hear the neighbors.

We have had mixed results. One big failure \u2014 created by Mike Pence, then our governor \u2014 was a complex public-private arrangement involving a Spanish contractor and a Canadian pension fund to upgrade some 21 miles of Interstate Highway along Route I-69, a relatively simple project.We must reject efforts to make infrastructure repairs a subject for ideological dispute. States with high credit ratings can borrow cheaply; it will be hard for any private enterprise to overcome that advantage. Ultimately, the risks of cost, delay and performance cannot be entirely shifted from the citizens. They will pay for the project one way or another, and they will suffer from the delays.ED DELANEY, INDIANAPOLISThe writer is a Democratic member of the Indiana House Committee on Ways and Means.To the Editor:Strictly speaking, what is public is what benefits the whole community; what is privatized is for the benefit of a few wealthy people.According to Mary E. Peters and Samara Barend, taxpayers will benefit from the greater efficiency of the partial privatization of the Trump-projected vast infrastructure expenditures. But like virtually all Republican efforts, from the budget to tax policy to health care, the major purpose of such public-private partnerships is to enrich the rich, and the devil take the rest.Full or semiprivatization is like \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d It purports to improve the economy but in fact improves only the pocketbooks of fat cats.ROGER CARASSO, SANTA FE, N.M.The writer is professor emeritus of political science at California State University, Northridge.To the Editor:Our examination of public-private partnerships that succeed and those that fail reveals that management \u2014 not money \u2014 is the deciding factor. And most state and local governments don\u2019t have the management capacity to oversee complex public-private infrastructure projects.They need to be able to design projects that appropriately allocate project risks to each partner, write solicitations so that bids maximize value for money, negotiate contract details that optimize public value, require and monitor key performance indicators to keep project performance on track, and provide an exit strategy that protects taxpayers if the partnership fails.The tremendous backlog of infrastructure needs in the United States suggests that there is an important role for both public and private finance. But public-private partnerships without strong public management are a recipe for disaster.Mr. Forrer is director, Institute for Corporate Responsibility, and Mr. Kee is professor emeritus of public policy and public administration, both at George Washington University.To the Editor:We are facing a crisis of infrastructure in this country, but we should not let crisis and fiscal desperation drive our policy decisions. Infrastructures are large, interconnected and difficult to change once they are in place.Let us take great pains to avoid getting stuck in partnerships that go bankrupt, limit public access or ruin our health. And let us hope that our politicians have the foresight to develop infrastructure policy that emphasizes public use over private gain.The writer is a Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Tech whose dissertation is on infrastructure issues.To the Editor:Mary E. Peters and Samara Barend are correct that properly structured public-private partnerships can play an important role in building the infrastructure our country desperately needs. The problem comes when projects are not properly structured.With so little money at risk, the private concessionaire can walk away with little lost if there are significant cost increases or delays.This shows why it is critical to look at the specifics. Just calling a project a private-public partnership does not mean that it is any good.FRANK LYSY, WASHINGTONThe writer, a retired World Bank economist, has a blog on economic issues, AnEconomicSense.org.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pearson Is Running Out of Assets to Sell", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsPearson\u2019s latest sale only papers over the cracks.Pearson, the embattled British education company, is raising about $1 billion by offloading almost half of its 47 percent stake in Penguin Random House. But its boss, John Fallon, is running out of assets to sell, and investors are doubtful he will put the proceeds to good use.The structure of the long-awaited disposal works well for Pearson. It is selling a 22 percent stake in Penguin Random House, the publisher of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d to the co-owner Bertelsmann, a German company, lifting Bertelsmann\u2019s stake in Penguin Random House to 75 percent. The two shareholders will then leverage up the almost debt-free business and extract a dividend that takes Pearson\u2019s total cash proceeds to more than $1 billion \u2014 well above the implied $781 million value of the stake it is selling.That means the company is maximizing cash proceeds while minimizing lost earnings. It previously expected operating profit for 2017 in a range with a midpoint of 600 million pounds. The latest sale will reduce that figure by 11 percent, it reckons, although a \u00a3300 million, or about $386 million, share buyback will mitigate the hit to earnings per share.What Pearson gains from clever structuring, however, it loses in valuation. The deal gives Penguin Random House an enterprise value of $3.55 billion, or 6.7 times last year\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. Bloomsbury, a smaller rival, trades on a multiple of nearly eight times.Pearson says it will use the roughly \u00a3500 million, or about $644 million, left after the buyback to pay off debt and finance investment in its core education businesses. The 6 percent-plus fall in the company\u2019s share price on Tuesday implies that investors have little faith that Mr. Fallon will put the money to good use.They\u2019re right to worry.In 2015 Pearson raised more than \u00a31 billion, or about $1.3 billion, from the sale of The Financial Times and its stake in the Economist, lowering its net debt to 0.8 times Ebitda. Twelve months later, net debt was back at 1.4 times Ebitda and the company issued a profit warning after a collapse in the American textbook market.Selling assets is no substitute for turning around the company\u2019s ailing core business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Kors to Buy Jimmy Choo in $1.2 Billion Deal", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Michael Kors has picked out some new shoes to go with its handbags.Many upscale brands like Michael Kors have faced plummeting sales and tepid profits. Mall traffic in North America has declined sharply, while shoppers who have traditionally been loyal to the so-called middle market have gravitated toward brands at extremes of the style and price spectrum.Jimmy Choo, which shot to prominence thanks to celebrity patrons like Princess Diana and the \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker, could give Michael Kors a new avenue for growth.\u201cAcquiring Jimmy Choo is the beginning of a strategy that we have for building a luxury group that really is focused on international fashion brands,\u201d John D. Idol, the chairman and chief executive of Michael Kors Holdings, said in an interview.Mr. Idol said he was targeting more acquisitions, focusing on luxury companies that \u201clead in style and trend\u201d but also \u201chave got some size and scale\u201d as well as \u201csome heritage.\u201dThough both Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo are red-carpet favorites, they appeal to different segments of the population.Michael Kors, known for fashion-forward designs and competitive prices, is heavily reliant on outlets and department stores, where deep discounting is common. Leather purses sell for as little as $70 and handbags are available for $95.Jimmy Choo occupies a higher price point: Open-toe slip-on sandals sell for $425, while crystal-encrusted shoes with the brand\u2019s signature sky-high stilettos go for nearly $3,000. The brand brings not only a different range of customers, but also hefty profit margins and an upmarket aura.Michael Kors is in need of an update.The brand became a household name thanks to its charismatic and eponymous founder, who appeared for 10 seasons as a judge on the fashion-based reality television show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d His approach to fashion focused on the idea that every woman wants to look \u201cpretty and rich.\u201d For years, Michael Kors enjoyed soaring revenues as customers embraced its glitterati-inspired accessories at affordable prices.Jonathan Buxton, the head of consumer and retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, an advisory firm, said that for Michael Kors, \u201cthis deal presents an opportunity to enter the high end of the luxury market, to increase sales and to diversify away from its own brand, especially at a time when it is experiencing declining same-store sales.\u201dThere was likely to be more consolidation, he said, as other \u201caffordable luxury\u201d brands looked to move upmarket.The deal would mark the first time Jimmy Choo has been owned by a company with expertise in fashion. The question now is whether it will expand into more accessible footwear, targeting new customers \u2014 perhaps ones more like those Michael Kors already has \u2014 or into new product categories. It has already made forays into fragrances and sunglasses and has tried to make inroads into the luggage market.Jimmy Choo was founded in 1996 by Tamara Mellon, then the accessories editor at British Vogue, with the Malaysian cobbler Jimmy Choo. Its vampish aesthetic quickly caught the attention of the rich and famous, and more recently, Michelle Obama was frequently seen wearing its shoes.After the sale to Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo would continue with its current management team, including the chief executive, Pierre Denis, and Sandra Choi, Mr. Choo\u2019s niece, who took over creative leadership at the brand after Ms. Mellon left. The shoemaker has more than 150 stores globally, as well as a presence in many of the world\u2019s top department stores.Michael Kors said it expected to open new Jimmy Choo retail stores and expand its fashion offerings. It also plans to develop Jimmy Choo\u2019s online presence, part of a broader push by brands to win over fickle consumers and fend off the threat posed by Amazon. Mr. Idol said Michael Kors wanted to increase Jimmy Choo\u2019s sales to $1 billion annually.Expansion at the top tier of the market suggests that Michael Kors sees its best chance of clawing back growth as lying with the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers.The company has ramped up its e-commerce business in recent months, and has long been considered a pioneer in the effective use of social media in the sector. It was the first fashion brand to sponsor an Instagram advertisement, and has 10.3 million followers on the image-sharing platform. While Jimmy Choo also promotes its offerings on social media (it has 6.8 million followers on Instagram), its efforts have been more recent.Under the terms of the transaction, Jimmy Choo investors would receive 230 pence, or about $3, for each share they own, representing a 36.5 percent premium to the share price in April, before the company announced it was putting itself up for sale. Shares of Jimmy Choo closed at 195 pence on Monday.Jimmy Choo said its board of directors intended to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. JAB Holding has agreed to support the takeover.Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan advised Michael Kors, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised Jimmy Choo.Vanessa Friedman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inquiry Into Bernie Sanders\u2019s Wife May Tarnish His Liberal Luster", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal investigation into a long-ago land deal by Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s wife is threatening to take some of the luster off the senator\u2019s populist appeal, attaching the phrase \u201cbank fraud\u201d to the biography of a politician practically sainted on the left for his stands against \u201cmillionaires and billionaires.\u201dMr. Sanders, a Vermont independent, is still riding high on popularity from his presidential campaign, delivering rousing speeches to cheering progressives in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.But he has been shadowed by talk of a deepening investigation into his wife\u2019s role in a 2010 land deal for a Vermont college that ultimately contributed to her ouster as its president. His wife, Jane Sanders, has hired a lawyer to represent her as federal authorities look into a $10 million sale of about 33 acres of lakefront property by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington to Burlington College. Ms. Sanders was hoping to relocate and expand the institution.The couple and many of their supporters maintain that the investigation is politically motivated and that it was set in motion by the Vermont state chairman for Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Brady Toensing, who filed a complaint with the local United States attorney\u2019s office in January 2016 on behalf of the diocese\u2019s parishioners.Sanders fans and Democratic strategists agree that the investigation, no matter its outcome, could be used by operatives in both parties to undermine the senator. Rival Democrats could use the case to try to wrest the progressive mantle from Mr. Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination yet refuses to join the Democratic Party.\u201cJust the fact that this is hanging over them could be used,\u201d said Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, a liberal organization formed by several people close to Mr. Sanders. \u201cI would hope that voters would dig deeper, but sometimes people don\u2019t. And they hear the word \u2018F.B.I.\u2019 and it sends a shiver up and down people\u2019s spines.\u201dMr. Sanders remains one of the most popular political figures in the country. Even Democrats who might want to push him aside understand that tarnishing the integrity of one of their biggest draws could make it harder for liberals to win elections in 2018 and 2020.However, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s experiences with her private email server and the 2012 attack in Benghazi show, prolonged investigations take a toll. And within the Sanders ranks, there is some talk of conspiracy.RoseAnn Demoro, executive director of National Nurses United and a leading Sanders supporter, said she believed some in both parties were hoping the investigation would hurt Mr. Sanders because he is challenging the entire political establishment. \u201cBernie is the only person out there with a populist base who could actually win the presidency right now, and they are trying to take him out,\u201d Ms. Demoro said.Not everyone is so enamored with Mr. Sanders\u2019s continuing power. Stu Loeser, who owns a media strategy firm and was a longtime spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said Mr. Sanders had missed his \u201conce in a lifetime chance\u201d to be president.\u201cHis people are worried that his best days may be behind him,\u201d Mr. Loeser said, \u201cand they may be right. But that\u2019s not going to be because of a paperwork snafu regarding his wife.\u201dA federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified because the matter was still under investigation, confirmed that the authorities have been looking into the land deal.To finance the land purchase, the college borrowed from a bank and obtained additional financing from the diocese, according to David V. Dunn, a Burlington College trustee at the time. The college needed to demonstrate that it had the financial resources to pay the bank loan, which it did with Ms. Sanders\u2019s assurances that it would receive $2.6 million in donations and increase its enrollment, Mr. Dunn said.\u201cNeither of those were true,\u201d he said in an interview Monday.Some of the pledges turned out to be overstated, and enrollment did not increase. Ms. Sanders was forced to resign in 2011. Financially strained, the college closed last year.In his letter of complaint to the federal prosecutor, Mr. Toensing, who was then vice chairman of the Vermont Republican Party, said he was requesting \u201can investigation into what appears to be federal loan fraud involving the sale of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington headquarters.\u201d\u201cThis apparent fraud resulted in as much as $2 million in losses to the Diocese and an unknown amount of loss to People\u2019s United Bank, a federally financed financial institution,\u201d the letter said.Many Sanders supporters and a spokesman for Ms. Sanders called the investigation a distraction.\u201cHe\u2019s widely popular among all demographic groups, and a lot of the polling shows if he were to run for the nomination in 2020 that he would be the front-runner,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign manager. \u201cThe Republicans, they are thinking long term here, and they are trying to do what they did with Benghazi and a bunch of other smear campaigns.\u201dBut Ms. Sanders is taking the investigation seriously and is worried that the Trump administration might not treat her fairly, Mr. Weaver said.Democrats like former Representative Steve Israel of New York, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut warned party members against trying to capitalize on the investigation.Robert M. Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist who now teaches at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cI hope it won\u2019t become some kind of an occasion to have a fight to excommunicate or exile or supplant Sanders. The last thing you want to do is form a circular firing squad.\u201dThat does not mean that the dozens of Democrats running on progressive platforms should not be prepared to gently push Mr. Sanders aside, Mr. Loeser said.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t able to give a good gold-watch speech \u2014 \u2018He\u2019s done great things and we are all grateful for him\u2019 \u2014 and imply he\u2019s ready for retirement, you\u2019re not going to be able to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s an old man from a predominantly white state with decades of politics on guns and other issues that are problematic for Democratic candidates.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bank loan obtained by Burlington College. It was $6.5 million, not $2.6 million.Anemona Hartocollis and Adam Goldman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Firing of Official Who Says He Resisted de Blasio Is Under Review", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. de Blasio also said he did not know how his top political aide, Emma Wolfe, came to participate in the Water\u2019s Edge negotiations. Ms. Wolfe, the city\u2019s director of intergovernmental affairs, took a central role after employees at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the agency responsible for the case, were removed from the talks after complaints by Mr. Singh and Mr. Kwatra over how the negotiations were proceeding.Mr. Singh, an early contributor to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral campaign, was disputing the city\u2019s contention that he owed the city millions of dollars for back rent and other issues related to the restaurant lease. Within months of taking office in 2014, Mr. de Blasio called the commissioner of the administrative services agency, known as DCAS, and asked her to help Mr. Singh.The talks with Mr. Singh were led for more than a year by Ricardo Morales, a deputy commissioner at the agency. But Mr. Morales and his team were removed from the talks in July 2015, after a contentious meeting with Mr. Singh and Mr. Kwatra.Mr. Morales was fired last February. The city said it was part of a reorganization at DCAS. Mr. Morales said he was fired in part for resisting City Hall\u2019s intervention in the Singh case.The Department of Investigation started a review of Mr. Morales\u2019s firing, according to an April 7 letter it sent Mr. Morales, which was obtained by The New York Times. The letter says the review was in response to a complaint Mr. Morales filed with the DCAS inspector general\u2019s office alleging that his firing violated whistle-blower protections.Mr. Morales was fired on Feb. 24, the day that Mr. de Blasio was questioned by F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors investigating his actions on behalf of Mr. Singh and other campaign donors.The city said then that the timing was coincidental and that Mr. Morales was fired as part of a restructuring of the agency.On Monday, in an appearance on NY1, Mr. de Blasio disputed Mr. Morales\u2019s claim that he was fired for not doing City Hall\u2019s bidding. \u201cIt had nothing to do with this particular situation, it had to do with overall performance,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. He refused to provide details, citing the possibility of a suit.Mr. Kraus, Mr. Morales\u2019s lawyer, who has filed a notice of claim that could lead the way to a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit, took issue with the mayor\u2019s response.\u201cThe shifting explanations of City Hall as to why they suddenly terminated Ricardo Morales after 20 years of exemplary service says to me that they have something to hide,\u201d Mr. Kraus said.At the news conference on Wednesday, called to discuss ferry service, Mr. de Blasio veered between expressing ignorance and refusing to answer pointed questions about his involvement with Mr. Singh and Mr. Kwatra. \u201cI have no clue about how those specific decisions were made or meetings happened,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said of Ms. Wolfe\u2019s involvement in the talks concerning Mr. Singh. \u201cThat was well after I paid any attention to this specific issue.\u201dThe mayor, a Democrat who is running for re-election this fall, also refused a request to have his spokesman Eric F. Phillips determine who made the decision to bring Ms. Wolfe into the talks. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to know,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThis is everyday life in government.\u201d On Wednesday night, Mr. Phillips said that the mayor had never discussed Water\u2019s Edge with Mr. Kwatra, the lobbyist.Ms. Wolfe\u2019s schedules, which were produced in response to a Freedom of Information Law request, show that she took part in a meeting at City Hall on July 30, 2015, to discuss Water\u2019s Edge. Then, her schedule for Aug. 12 contains a noon entry that reads, \u201cSettlement update call,\u201d and it includes Gabriel Schnake-Mahl, an aide of hers who was also involved in the Water\u2019s Edge talks. The other participants in the call are blacked out, and Mr. Phillips refused to identify them or say whether the call involved Water\u2019s Edge.The talks with Mr. Singh were nearing completion when he was arrested on Sept. 9, 2015, in an unrelated political-corruption case on Long Island. On that day, Ms. Wolfe\u2019s schedule shows an appointment shortly after noon at a Denny\u2019s restaurant (there is a Denny\u2019s a block from City Hall) with someone identified only as \u201cNeal.\u201dMr. Phillips refused to say whether that is a reference to Mr. Kwatra.On Wednesday outside City Hall, Ms. Wolfe also refused to answer questions. Asked who made the decision to involve her in the talks, she said, \u201cWow.\u201d She laughed, put a piece of gum in her mouth and drove away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Robert Mueller Learned From Enron", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIt seems safe to assume that nobody read Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s damning emails with a Kremlin-connected lawyer more closely than Robert Mueller.Mr. Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, will surely be looking into the now infamous meeting, including the president\u2019s son; the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his campaign chairman at the time, Paul Manafort.As he does, will Mr. Mueller be able to build a case that goes all the way to the top?That could depend on what lessons he learned from overseeing the task force that investigated one of the biggest fraud cases in American history: the collapse of the energy giant Enron.In December 2001, Enron filed what was then the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history. Just weeks later, Mr. Mueller, then the F.B.I. director; Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson; and the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, Michael Chertoff, formed the Enron Task Force, an elite team of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors assigned to investigate and prosecute crimes related to the Houston-based energy trader. Andrew Weissmann, who recently joined Mr. Mueller\u2019s Russia team, later led the task force.The Enron team was patient and learned from its investigative and trial mistakes. After its yearslong run, it set a high-water mark for complex, high-profile financial inquiries, successfully indicting and imprisoning almost all of the company\u2019s top executives.Early on, the Enron team also won a jury conviction of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, Enron\u2019s auditor, on an obstruction-of-justice charge. That experience could prove valuable as the Russia team investigates \u2014 among many possible routes \u2014 whether President Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director.Prosecuting the Enron executives went slowly. Not until 2006 did a jury find the former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and the former chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, guilty. (Mr. Lay died before sentencing.)The frauds Enron was accused of were audacious. The company had hidden debt in a complex web of off-the-books companies and had faked its profits. Yet prosecutorial success was not inevitable. Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay pleaded ignorance, blaming lower-level employees and arguing they had relied on the advice of their attorneys and auditors. The government did not have damning emails or wiretap evidence from either man. Prosecutors may face a similar challenge with Mr. Trump, who tweets but reportedly does not use email.The Enron team got off to an auspicious start, with the Department of Justice providing adequate prosecutorial resources. Mr. Mueller helped recruit talented prosecutors and investigators from around the country and then got out of their way.He and other top Justice Department officials then gave their team political cover. Enron and its executives were particularly close to the Bush family and top Republican officials. Early on, the team interviewed White House officials about their recollections. Republican political operatives voiced displeasure, but the team persisted.The task force conducted its investigations effectively, flipping lower-level employees to build cases against the top bad actors. The Enron team made aggressive and risky moves. For example, it shocked Houston high society by charging the wife of Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer, with tax evasion to put pressure on him. It worked. Mr. Fastow began to cooperate with the government. (His wife pleaded guilty.) Every prosecutor knows this strategy works, but for various reasons today, few put in the painstaking work needed to penetrate the sophisticated legal defenses of highly paid executives.As it proceeded, the task force weathered relentless attacks. First, critics charged it was moving too slowly. Later, white-collar defense lawyers accused the team of intimidating witnesses and overzealously charging executives. The legal establishment particularly criticized the prosecution of Arthur Andersen. The government won at trial in 2002, but the Supreme Court overturned the verdict three years later on a narrow issue involving jury instructions.Despite its successes, the Enron Task Force emerged with a mixed legacy thanks to its trial losses and reversals from higher courts. Among them, the Supreme Court reversed part of the Skilling verdict.Today, many Justice Department officials have learned the wrong lessons from the Enron experience, accepting the idea that the task force was overzealous. Even Democratic appointees like Mary Jo White, President Obama\u2019s chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Lanny Breuer, his assistant attorney general for the criminal division, came to believe the prosecution of Andersen had been a mistake.Drawing the wrong lessons has consequences. In subsequent years, the Justice Department did not assign prosecutors to work solely on financial crisis cases. While the Bush Justice Department had acted quickly to create the Enron Task Force, the Obama department allowed plans to create a similar task force, after the banking collapse of 2008, to die amid bureaucratic infighting.It was no surprise, then, that the Justice Department never put any top bankers from the biggest banks in prison after the financial crisis. Forgetting what went right with the Enron prosecutions has contributed to a problem that still plagues the Justice Department: It has lost the will and ability to prosecute top corporate executives from the largest corporations.Today Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is operating in an even hotter kitchen than the Enron Task Force did. The president has repeatedly called the investigation \u201ca witch hunt,\u201d and rumors abound that he could fire Mr. Mueller any day. A Trump ally, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has grumbled conspiratorially that the former F.B.I. director was the \u201ctip of the deep state spear\u201d aimed at the president.But the Enron Task Force may have given Mr. Mueller a hide thick enough to protect him from those attacks. More than that, Enron honed skills he\u2019ll need now in the Russia investigation, which may well touch on money laundering, secrecy havens, complex accounting maneuvers, campaign finance violations \u2014 and multiple lies.As I talked with Mr. Mueller\u2019s former Enron Task Force colleagues in recent weeks, it became clear to me that he believes the Enron team was successful \u2014 and understands why. That means his special counsel team will probably move more slowly than people anticipate. But it might also shock people with its aggressive investigative and prosecutorial tactics. If Mr. Trump and his advisers committed crimes, Mr. Mueller will find them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time for Republicans to Start From Scratch on Health Care", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf the halting, messy debate over legislation to overhaul health care has taught us anything so far, it\u2019s that when it comes to health care, Republicans don\u2019t know what they want, much less how to get it.After years of campaigning on the promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act, when it finally came time to act, Republicans put together a plan that looks like a stingier, skimpier version of Obamacare in the individual market, plus a rollback of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion (delayed until after the next presidential election \u2014 long enough that it might not happen).When asked about the status of the health care bill this week, Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Donald Trump to win, I think most of my colleagues didn\u2019t, so we didn\u2019t expect to be in this situation.\u201d In short, Republicans didn\u2019t plan on having to follow through on their promises.Democrats, on the other hand, share a distinct vision of robust universal coverage guaranteed by the government and paid for by a combination of delivery-system efficiencies and higher taxes.What Republicans need, then, is a set of guiding principles \u2014 a health care vision that should work from the ground up, that imagines a more affordable and more effective system, one that\u2019s fairer and more focused.For starters, it would mean giving up on comprehensive universal coverage. Otherwise, Republicans will just end up bargaining on the terms set by Democrats, as they are now.One might reasonably object that Republicans have already given up on that goal, based on their own plans, which would disrupt coverage for millions in the first year alone and result in far fewer people insured in the long run.The problem for Republicans is that they have not yet backed away from universal coverage rhetorically. Senior Republicans still criticize Obamacare for covering too few people. This disconnect between what Republicans say and what they are willing to do has kept the party from moving in more productive directions.Which brings us to a second principle: unification, not fragmentation.For decades, the health care system has been broken into several distinct layers: Medicare, Medicaid and employer-provided coverage. The first two are paid for directly by the government. The third is subsidized implicitly through the tax code, which does not tax health benefits provided by employers as income.This tax break is the original sin of the United States health care system. Worth more than $250 billion annually, it has enormously distorted the market, creating an incentive for employers to provide ever-more-generous insurance while insulating individuals from the true cost of care. It discourages job switching and entrepreneurship, and offers an unfair advantage to the comfortably employed.Medicare, meanwhile, offers a huge system of federal benefits to older Americans that typically run far beyond what most have paid in. Its introduction was associated with explosive growth in hospital-costs inflation during the 1970s.The result is an unequal system in which health insurance is understood more as a way of prepaying for medical care than as a protection from financial risk.That\u2019s where the third principle comes in: Health coverage is not the same as health care. Instead, it is a financial product, a backstop against financial ruin. Health care policy should treat it as one. There is some question about how much programs like Medicaid contribute to measurable physical health outcomes, but there is no arguing that it effectively insulates beneficiaries from financial shocks.Health care policy that treated insurance as a hedge against financial shock could relieve one of the most salient worries of the middle class \u2014 that chance might curse them with unaffordably high medical expenses.One way to do this is to encourage supply-side innovations in addition to demand-side reforms. The tangle of regulations governing health care can make it difficult for providers to respond to market signals and innovate. Doctor-owned hospitals are restricted by law, for example, and certificate-of-need requirements force medical providers to obtain licenses in a process that effectively requires them to ask permission from competitors to expand.Finally, Republicans should always focus government assistance on the poorest and sickest: This should be obvious, and yet it is not. Our system subsidizes workers with six-figure salaries and wealthy retirees while sidelining the poor and the sick in Medicaid, a system that many doctors won\u2019t participate in because of low reimbursement rates.No one starting from scratch would design a system that looks like this. And while starting from scratch is not possible, that is, in essence, what a Republican vision should seek to do.This might mean reforming Medicaid, or creating a program with a similar goal of aiding the poor and the sick, but also seeking to make it more effective for those it covers. It might mean widely expanding health savings accounts or a broader system of catastrophic health insurance. It might mean seeking to limit the price-distorting power of hospital monopolies. It would almost certainly mean substantial reforms to both Medicare and the tax treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance. Hopefully, it would mean pursuing ideas that no one has thought of yet.Republicans should have no illusions: Selling this vision would take a significant investment of time, creativity and study, policy entrepreneurship and some difficult political and legislative choices. It would require patience and political salesmanship. And it would not result in an immediately popular bill that could easily pass in the Senate with 51 Republican votes this summer. In the short term, it would mean retreat.But over time it would distinguish Republicans from their Democratic rivals and give them a positive, productive policy pitch to run on, while giving voters better choices for health care.It would also, not incidentally, have the advantage of improving the nation\u2019s health care system.Peter Suderman is the features editor at Reason magazine.Advertisement"}

And the younger generation may feel that the family patriarch and matriarch are set in their ways and turn a deaf ear to other input.There are a lot of dollars at stake. A 2014 report by the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College estimated that $59 trillion would be transferred to the next generation from 2007 to 2061. Lifetime giving to charity in that same period is pegged at $20.6 trillion.It used to be that the philanthropic baton would be passed to the next generation when the parents died. In the past, fewer generations actively worked together.But with longer life spans, \u201cthere are several generations in the philanthropic space at the same time and around the table at the same time,\u201d said Sharna Goldseker, the founder and managing director of 21/64, a consulting firm that focuses on next-generation philanthropy. There may well be agreement among the generations about the importance of giving, but also disagreement about who to give to and how to give it.\u201cThe expression of a different philanthropic interest is a balancing act for the next generation,\u201d Ms. Goldseker said. \u201cHow do they honor their legacy and deal with what they see as the needs of today?\u201dThat the younger generation might not share the older generation\u2019s ideas about giving, that they might want to focus on different causes makes perfect sense, said Michael Moody, who holds the Frey Foundation Chair for Family Philanthropy at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Mich. After all, they grew up at a different time in a different world. \u201cThe emergence of environmentalism in the \u201960s, civil rights and the women\u2019s movement meant that the younger generation was more interested in giving to them rather than to the Junior League,\u201d he said.Geography also plays a role. If, for example, the foundation is focused on the local community \u201cand the family is far-flung, it will be hard to get the next generation engaged,\u201d said Professor Moody, an author, with Ms. Goldseker, of the book \u201cGeneration Impact: How Next Gen Donors Are Revolutionizing Giving,\u201d expected in October.It could also come down to that most basic of explanations: different strokes for different folks.\u201cIndividuals have different interests, and individuals within families have different interests,\u201d said Tracy Mack Parker, chief executive of the Philanthropy Workshop. \u201cSometimes, the younger generation steps up early and wants to get involved and do research and put in the time. It can also be the case the younger generation is too busy raising families and building their own careers, and it\u2019s a challenge for the first generation to respectfully get the younger generation involved and participating.\u201d\u201cWhat we try to do,\u201d she said, \u201cis to encourage families to identify certain core values that could cut across all the philanthropic work they do and come up with a vision for a world they want to see.\u201dUnfortunately, in some instances, there\u2019s a dominant wealth creator \u201cwho is confident that he or she knows where the money should go and isn\u2019t questioning it very much,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cIf members of the next generation with different ideas feel they\u2019re butting up against a wall, they\u2019ll work on their own giving rather than participating in the family giving.\u201dIn a growing trend, those strong-minded wealth creators may decide to spend the foundation\u2019s resources in their lifetime so they can see the impact while they\u2019re alive.Discretionary funds are a useful option when consensus is hard to come by. \u201cThey allow individual family members to give to their pet organizations,\u201d Mr. Moody said.Sometimes the answer is multiple funds or foundations. In 2004, Roxanne Quimby, a founder of the personal care company Burt\u2019s Bees, created the Quimby Family Foundation, encouraging the involvement of her adult children Hannah Quimby and Lucas St. Clair.\u201cMy mother engaged with us in an open, flexible way, making sure from the get-go that the focus of the foundation was something we cared about,\u201d said Hannah Quimby, 38. Together, they settled on two broad areas for their philanthropy: arts and the environment.Subsequently, Mr. St. Clair became more involved in another of his mother\u2019s philanthropic endeavors \u2014 a foundation to create a national monument in Maine, the family\u2019s home \u2014 and Hannah Quimby became increasingly engaged with the family foundation.\u201cWhat happened with time is that I crafted our mission to be a little more focused,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom let me do that and then she said: \u2018You know what? I want to fund the arts and I want to run things the way I want to run them, and I don\u2019t want to read a ton of grant applications,\u2019 so she created a third foundation.\u201dFrequently, the differences in giving are more about style than substance. The next generation may be as dedicated as their parents about contributing to their alma mater. \u201cBut the older generation may write a check and have a building named after them,\u201d Professor Moody said.The younger generation, which tends to be more hands-on, \u201cwill want to write a check to create a scholarship for minority students and then become a mentor and engage with the student who is receiving the scholarship,\u201d he said.But even when the causes are different, there may be considerably more generational overlap than first meets the eye. Ms. Goldseker of 21/64 recalled a patriarch who was setting up a foundation to finance local scholarships as a way to give back to the community where he had earned his wealth. His grandchildren, to his frustration, were interested in making microcredit loans to people in developing countries.Ms. Goldseker handed the grandfather and grandchildren sets of 25 cards, each marked with words like \u201cintegrity,\u201d \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201copportunity,\u201d \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201cself-reliance,\u201d and asked them to prioritize the values that animated their philanthropic decision-making.\u201cWhen they showed their cards, all of them had \u2018opportunity\u2019 on the top, and I think the grandfather was very struck by how his values had been transmitted to the next generation,\u201d Ms. Goldseker said. \u201cThe grandchildren had internalized those values, but they were applying them in a different way because they\u2019d grown up in a different world in a different time.\u201cHe\u2019d wanted to create opportunities by creating scholarships in his community, and now he realized that offering microloans was creating opportunities for people in Africa.\u201dMs. Simons of the Heising-Simons Foundation found a similar link between her focus on early childhood education and her daughter\u2019s human rights advocacy. \u201cChildren who have this experience are less likely to go to jail and less likely to have the problems of those who didn\u2019t have the benefit of early learning.\u201dShe added: \u201cAs I\u2019ve thought about this, I\u2019ve seen the connection with Caitlin. Education is a human right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Constitutional Convention for New York? This May Be the Year", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Every 20 years, New Yorkers have the chance to vote whether they want to hold a constitutional convention to amend, tweak or otherwise improve the founding document of the state.For the past half-century, voters have demurred. This year, however, academics, good-government groups and others believe the outcome of the ballot question in November may be different. And \u2014 perhaps no surprise \u2014 it has something to do with the current occupant of the White House.But before voters confront the ballot question, they will no doubt be barraged by campaigns for and against a constitutional convention, affectionately called Con-Con.Nonprofit groups interested in issues including campaign finance reform, redistricting, term limits and the legalization of marijuana have come out in favor of a convention. They argue that the state Legislature is unlikely to take up these thorny, politically treacherous topics. At the same time, unions like the United Federation of Teachers and state legislative leaders have argued against a convention, saying it could repeal hallowed protections.There are some offbeat \u2014 some might say flaky \u2014 positions that advocates say could come about only during a constitutional convention. They include calls for a unicameral Legislature \u2014 doing away with the Assembly or Senate \u2014 and the division of the state into autonomous regions, with separate regional governors and legislatures.The last constitutional convention held in the state was called by the Legislature in 1967. That convention\u2019s recommendations, which voters had to approve in a subsequent ballot, were ultimately turned down. The last convention that voters actually requested themselves occurred nearly 80 years ago, in 1938, when a number of protections were added to the Constitution.Professor Benjamin believes that a constitutional convention could correct a number of problems endemic to the 50,000-word state Constitution, including the administration of elections, campaign finance and the structure of the judiciary. He also thinks the state Legislature would be more effective with one house, instead of an Assembly and Senate, also known as unicameralism.\u201cI don\u2019t like a three-way negotiation,\u201d the professor said, referring to talks between the leaders of the Assembly and Senate and the governor. \u201cTwo-way is simpler and it\u2019s easier to come to outcomes.\u201dIf voters approve a convention, delegates would be elected in 2018, with the convention held the next year.But just as some academics, advocates and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have asserted that a constitutional convention could spawn long-overdue changes, others fear that existing rights could be repealed. Both the leaders of the Assembly and Senate have gone on record against a convention.Mike Whyland, the spokesman for the Democratic-controlled Assembly, said that a convention could jeopardize hard-won labor protections. \u201cIt has the potential to roll back important worker protections and other rights, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019d be open to,\u201d he said.Similarly, Scott Reif, spokesman for the Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican, said a convention would be a waste of money.\u201cA constitutional convention will cost hardworking taxpayers millions of dollars that could be better invested in schools, road and bridge construction, and tax cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, the possibility exists that radical New York City interests could seize control of the process, spend huge sums of cash and cause irreparable damage to our state government.\u201dThe clash between upstate and downstate interests has resulted in one of the more peculiar issues to surface in advance of the convention ballot.John Bergener Jr., a retiree who lives outside Albany, would like to see the separation of New York City from the rest of the state. As chairman of Divide NYS Caucus, a political committee, he believes a constitutional convention is the best mechanism to achieve that.Upstate areas, he said, have suffered economically from excessive business regulations and unfunded mandates. His vision \u2014 and he claims thousands of supporters \u2014 calls for two or three autonomous regions, each with its own regional governor and legislature. (The upstate region, north of the lower Hudson Valley, would be called New Amsterdam.) A statewide governor would be titular, with the same \u201cpowers as the queen of England.\u201dHe asserts that upstate lawmakers have no place deciding on policies that affect New York City. \u201cWhy should upstate Republicans, or Democrats, be voting on a plastic bag ban or congestion pricing or mayoral control of schools?\u201d he asked rhetorically.The coalition brings together such odd bedfellows as anti-abortion and abortion-rights organizations, environmental groups and gun-rights advocates, as well as the state\u2019s Conservative Party and the left-leaning Working Families Party. \u201cEvery value that we hold is at risk here,\u201d said Jordan Marks, the coalition\u2019s campaign manager.But convention proponents say that any fear of lost rights is misplaced. Dr. Galie said no constitutional convention in state history had resulted in the loss of a major right or protection. Rather, the conventions have added new ones. The convention of 1938, he said, created a constitutional safety net for the poor, as well as a so-called labor bill of rights.He insists that the torpor in the state capital demanded that citizens make an end-run around lawmakers. \u201cThere are many issues the Legislature simply doesn\u2019t take up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt buries these things in the bowels of Albany.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the website for the coalition New Yorkers Against Corruption.

{"Headline": "My Grandmother\u2019s Shroud", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn PhotographyWhen my grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother, died in late June in Nigeria, I was in Italy, at a conference. I wasn\u2019t with her when she slipped into a coma or, three days later, when she died. When my brother told me the news, I called my mother and other members of my family to commiserate with them. She was buried the day of her death, in keeping with Muslim custom, and I couldn\u2019t attend her funeral. My mother, visiting friends in Houston, would also miss the funeral.I opened my computer and began to search my folders for pictures of my grandmother. On each yearly trip to Nigeria for the past several years, I went to see her in Sagamu, a town an hour northeast of Lagos, where she was born and where she lived for most of her life. On these visits, she would say: \u2018\u2018Sit next to me. I want to feel your hands in mine. Be close to me. I want your skin touching mine.\u2019\u2019 I was always happy to sit with her and to hold hands with her. Afterward, I took photos. I have photos now of her alone, in selfies with me, in the company of my mother and my aunts. In these photos, she has surprisingly smooth skin, hardly any gray hair and, in most of them, a trace of amusement. In one, especially touching photo, my wife, Karen, applies polish to her nails.To remain close to our dead, we cherish images of them. We\u2019ve done so for millenniums. Think of the Fayum portraits, which show us the faces of Egyptians during the Imperial Roman era with stunning immediacy. Images \u2014 paintings, sculptures, photographs \u2014 remind us how our loved ones looked in life. But in most places and at most times, portraiture was available only to society\u2019s elites. Photography changed that. Almost everyone is now captured in photographs \u2014 and outlived by them. Photographs are there when people pass away. They serve as reservoirs of memory and as talismans for mourning.My grandmother was born in 1928. Her given name was Abusatu, but we called her Mama. Mama\u2019s father, Yusuf, was a stern imam in Sagamu, and Yusuf\u2019s father, Salako, was said to have been even more severe. But Mama herself was serene and good-natured, kind and tolerant. She was deeply consoled by her religion but not doctrinaire. Of her five daughters, two (including her firstborn, my mother) married Christians and converted to Christianity. It made no difference to Mama. The family had Muslims, Christians and some, like myself, who drifted away from religion entirely. Mama loved us all. An example of her unobtrusive kindness: While I was a college student in the United States, she sent me a white hand-woven cotton blanket. I never knew why and didn\u2019t ask. But it is to this day the most precious piece of cloth I own.I was leaving Rome when I received the sad news of Mama\u2019s death. She was approaching 89. The end came swiftly, and she was surrounded by family. You could say it was a good death. But why couldn\u2019t she have lived to 99, or to 109, or forever? Death makes us protest the fact of death. It makes us wish for the impossible. I could objectively understand that it was unusual to have had a grandmother in my 40s, and that my 67-year-old mother was equally fortunate in having had a mother so long. My father was 5 when his mother died, and he has been mourning her for longer than my mother has been alive. But the grieving heart does not care for logic, and it refuses comparisons. I mourned Mama as I left Italy for New York.I mourned her but did not, or was not able to, weep. I arrived in New York in the late afternoon, perhaps at the very moment Mama was being interred. My mother had forwarded a couple of photos taken by my cousin Adedoyin to my wife\u2019s WhatsApp. Karen reached for her phone and showed me the pictures. They were a shock. One was of Mama, dead on her hospital bed, wearing a flowery nightdress and draped in a second flowery cloth, the oxygen tube still taped to her nostrils. Her right arm was limp at her side, and she was not quite like someone asleep but rather like someone passed out, open and vulnerable. The other photograph, which seemed to have been cropped, showed a figure wrapped in a shroud, tied up with white twine, set out on a bed in front of a framed portrait: a white bundle in vaguely human shape where my grandmother used to be. I burst into sudden hot tears.What did these photographs open? Imagination can be delicate, imposing a protective decorum. A photograph insists on raw fact and confronts us with what we were perhaps avoiding. There she is, my dear Mama, helpless on the hospital bed, and I cannot help her. Days later, I would find out from my mother that in this first photograph, Mama was still in a coma and not dead yet. But looking at the second photograph, the one in which she is incontrovertibly dead, my thoughts raced through a grim logic. I thought: Why have they wrapped her face up? Then I thought: It must be stifling under that thing, she won\u2019t be able to breathe! Then I thought: She\u2019s dead and will never breathe again. Then my tears flowed.Mama\u2019s life was hard. An itinerant trader of kola nut and later the owner of a small provisions shop, she was one of my late grandfather\u2019s five wives and by no means the best treated. She never went to school, and the only word she could write was her name, sometimes with the \u2018\u2018s\u2019\u2019 reversed. But when Baba died more than 20 years ago, Mama moved out of his house and lived in the two-story house that my mother built her. She was a women\u2019s leader, a kind of deaconess, at the local mosque. She went to parties, to market and to evening prayers. She lived in the security of her own house, in the company of her widowed second daughter, my aunt. In those later years, life became easier.\u2018\u2018She has a single obsession,\u2019\u2019 my mother used to say, \u2018\u2018and that\u2019s her burial rites.\u2019\u2019 Mama insisted that she be buried the same day she died. \u2018\u2018She\u2019ll say, \u2018And I must not be buried at the house,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 my mother said, \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Because what\u2019s rotten must be thrown out. And for seven days, food must be cooked and taken to the mosque and served to the poor.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 And most important, my mother said, Mama would reiterate that in a cupboard in the room next to the meeting room in her house was her robe, the one she must be buried in. It was of utmost importance to her to meet her maker wearing the robe with which she approached the Kaaba, the holiest shrine in Islam.The hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, which she undertook in 1996, when she was 68, transfigured my grandmother. Through that journey, through her accomplishment of one of the central tenets of Islam, she sloughed off her old life and took on a new one, one that put her into a precise relationship with eternity. The year of her journey, thousands of Nigerian pilgrims were turned back, because of meningitis and cholera outbreaks. My grandmother was one of a few hundred who got through. When she returned from Mecca, many of her townspeople took to calling her \u2018\u2018Alhaja Lucky.\u2019\u2019 And as though to fit the name, she wore the serene mien of someone who was under special protection.My mother, an Anglican Christian, financed the journey, knowing what it would mean to her mother to fulfill this final pillar of the faith. But possibly, she had no idea how much it would mean. She anticipated the social satisfaction Mama would get from it but had not counted on the serious existential confirmation it provided.In the last few years, I often thought of Mama\u2019s pilgrimage robe. I thought about how fortunate she was to have something in her possession so sacred to her, something of such surpassing worth, that she wished to have it on when she met God. And she had her wish: Beneath the plain white shroud in which she was sheathed after she died was that simple pilgrimage robe.I look at the various photographs from Alhaja Lucky\u2019s last years on my computer. None of them really satisfy me. Many are blurry, most are banal. I really like only the ones of her hands: They remind me of her wish to have her hands touched by mine. But the photograph I cannot stop thinking about is the one Adedoyin took, of Mama in her funeral shroud. The image reminds me of newspaper photos of funerals in troubled zones in the Middle East: an angry crowd, a shrouded body held aloft. But Mama was not a victim of violence. She died peacefully, well past the age of 88, surrounded by family.Nevertheless, the custom is connected. It is a reminder that the word \u2018\u2018Muslim\u2019\u2019 \u2014 so much a part of current American political argument, and so often meant as a slur \u2014 is not and has never been an abstraction, not for me, and certainly not for millions of Americans for whom it is a lived reality or a fact of family.

{"Headline": "A Conspiracy of Dunces", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere is a good rule of thumb for dealing with Donald Trump: Everyone who gives him the benefit of the doubt eventually regrets it.This was true of clients and contractors and creditors throughout his business career. It was true of the sycophants and opportunists before whom he dangled cabinet appointments during the campaign and then, oh, never mind. It has been true of his cabinet members and spokesmen, whose attempts to defend and explain their boss\u2019s conduct are gleefully undercut by the boss himself. And it should be true \u2014 for the sake of their souls, I sincerely hope it\u2019s true \u2014 of the Republican leaders whose reputations for probity and principle he has stomped all over since winning their party\u2019s nomination.And now it\u2019s true of me.The benefit of the doubt I extended to Trump was limited, but on a rather important subject: I thought that direct collusion between his inner circle and Russian officialdom during the 2016 campaign was relatively unlikely and the odds of ever finding proof of such a conspiracy vanishingly low. A lot of weirdness around Trump and Russia, I argued, had a more normal explanation \u2014 he had made business deals with Russians, he still harbors a 1980s-era vision of superpower cooperation, and as a foreign-policy neophyte he clutched the idea of d\u00e9tente like a security blanket even as the Russians separately made moves to help him win.The meeting\u2019s existence does not carry us all the way to the maximal collusion scenario, in which Trump himself was aware of Russia\u2019s role in the hack of the Democratic National Committee and ordered his aides to conspire with WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence to time the drip-drip-drip of hacked emails and maximize their impact.As the hapless Don Jr. \u2014 the Gob Bluth or Fredo Corleone of a family conspicuously short on Michaels \u2014 protested in his own defense, the Russian rendezvous we know about came before (though only slightly before) the WikiLeaks haul was announced. So the Trump team presumably assumed that it involved some other Hillary-related dirt \u2014 some of the missing Clinton server emails that Trump himself jokingly (\u201cjokingly\u201d?) urged Russian hackers to conjure and release, or direct evidence of Clinton Foundation corruption in its Russian relationships.But even if accepting oppo from a foreign government is technically legal \u2014 it probably is, but I leave that question to campaign finance lawyers to work out \u2014 this talking point takes you only so far. I am not a particularly fierce Russia hawk, but the Russians are still a more-hostile-than-not power these days, with stronger incentives to subvert American democracy than the average foreign government. So taking their oppo has a gravity that should have stopped a more upright and patriotic campaign short.But on the basis of the emails, the younger Trump went in not skeptically but eagerly (\u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it\u201d), ignoring or simply accepting the weird formulation about Russian support for Trump\u2019s campaign. And then of course everybody lied about or \u201cforgot\u201d about the meeting, repeatedly and consistently, right up until the emails themselves made their way to the press.So while this is not direct evidence that the president of the United States was complicit in a virtual burglary perpetrated against the other party during an election season, it\u2019s strong evidence that we should drop the presumption that such collusion is an extreme or implausible scenario.Then keep in mind, too, that all of this has come out (relatively) easily, thanks to digging by this newspaper\u2019s reporters and leaks from the various factions in and around the White House, without the subpoenas and immunity deals that the formal investigations have at their disposal. That means there is probably more and worse to come, and the more there is, the worse the president\u2019s dealings with James Comey look. Even if the president himself is innocent of Russian collusion, protecting your family from exposure is a pretty strong motive for obstruction.In the end, impeachment is political, not legal, and the House G.O.P. probably won\u2019t impeach for anything short of a transcript of a call between Trump and Putin in which the words \u201cyes, I want you to hack their servers big-league, Vladimir\u201d appear in black-and-white. And even then \u2026.But right now, the 2018 congressional elections promise to be a de facto referendum on impeachment. There are enough sparks in the smoke; there will probably be fire for some of Trump\u2019s intimates before another year is out.And as for the president himself \u2014 well, to conclude where I began, anyone presuming his innocence at this point should have all the confidence of Chris Christie awaiting his cabinet appointment, or Sean Spicer reading over the day\u2019s talking points. Keep an eye on that Trump-monogrammed rug under your feet; it may not be there for long.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Heartbreak of a Co-op Rejection", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by360 ViewBuying an apartment in a co-op is an exercise in financial exhibitionism. A board combs through your bank statements, tax returns and testimonials and then, if you pass muster, grants you access to its cloistered world.But sometimes it doesn\u2019t.And rejection, even by committee, hurts. Or, as Rowann Gilman, a semiretired food writer who was rejected from a Sutton Place South co-op in May, put it, \u201cI can feel the burn on my cheek from the slap on the face.\u201dHome sales fall apart for other reasons, too, like a seller\u2019s passing you over for a higher offer or financing falls through. But when a co-op smacks you down, the rebuff feels personal.The board package, a dossier of financial and personal details that can run hundreds of pages, offers a fairly complete picture of you. So if the board sifts through that material and decides you\u2019re not good enough, it\u2019s hard not to take the news personally. A board does not have to give you a reason for its decision \u2014 it can reject a candidate for any reason or no reason, so long as it does not legally discriminate. For a scorned buyer, the effect can be baffling.Even in a market that is relatively flat, some boards and sellers seem to be flexing their muscles, making demands that might seem unreasonable to potential buyers.Boards are not required to report how many co-op applications they review each year, or how many they reject. However, brokers and co-op lawyers estimate a rejection rate of about 3 to 5 percent. Last year, 16,015 sales were recorded for co-ops in the city, according to StreetEasy. \u201cIt\u2019s easy with percentages to make something sound small,\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cBut when you actually think of that as how many co-ops are sold in a year, that\u2019s a lot of people.\u201dWhen it happens to you, not only is it a blow to your ego, it can upend your vision of the future. Last spring, after living in London Terrace for nearly 40 years, Ms. Gilman, 70, started looking for a bigger apartment in a quieter neighborhood. She found a charming one-bedroom on Sutton Place South in a building designed by Rosario Candela. \u201cIt was like a little French gem,\u201d she said.Her offer of $922,000 was accepted and the contract was signed. She delivered a 10 percent deposit to the seller\u2019s lawyer and left for vacation in early May, alerting all parties that she would be unreachable for a few weeks.A week later, Ms. Gilman\u2019s attorney was told that the board wanted Ms. Gilman to put two years of maintenance payments, around $46,000, in an escrow account indefinitely. Her lawyer told the seller\u2019s attorney that Ms. Gilman would respond upon her return.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Ms. Gilman said, speculating that \u201cthey just wanted to keep it forever.\u201d Regardless, she never had a chance to turn down the offer. The board rejected her application before she returned home, saying that she did not respond in a timely manner. \u201cI just want to strangle them,\u201d she said.Then the seller would not return the deposit, claiming damages. \u201cWhat damages?\u201d she said. \u201cI was in their apartment two or three times.\u201d According to Mr. Luxemburg, sellers are increasingly holding on to deposits when deals fall apart, forcing the buyer to sue to get the money back or settle. \u201cIt\u2019s a more aggressive approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming more common.\u201dTo avoid litigation but still get the bulk of her deposit back, Ms. Gilman agreed to let the seller withhold two months\u2019 maintenance, about $4,000, and she received the balance of her deposit. \u201cThese people have treated me abysmally,\u201d she said.The co-op board and its property manager, Brown Harris Stevens, declined to comment.Boards generally reject buyers for financial reasons. But these decisions often do not come down to bank statements alone. Co-ops are vertical neighborhoods with unique personalities and cultures. A board that is looking for a certain type of person can glean information from financial documents about a candidate\u2019s political leanings, health problems and marital strife.\u201cThere are cases in which it\u2019s a total mystery,\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cThe people have plenty of money and the letters are lovely and you just have no way of knowing if they had a fight once with the board member\u2019s sister in the elevator of Saks.\u201dThe co-op was a middle-class building, with owners who had lived there for decades, Mr. Gross said. He suspected that the board\u2019s reservations went beyond tax returns. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want some rich kid coming in who is clearly very clever with his accounting,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere does a 30-year-old get $2 million?\u201dFor some buyers, the sting of rejection is lasting. After Mr. Gross\u2019s client lost out on his SoHo apartment, he moved to Hoboken. \u201cI know he\u2019ll never move back to the city,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cHe felt violated.\u201dMs. Gilman was so burned by her experience that she has decided to stay in her studio and remodel it. \u201cYou could not pay me to live in that apartment now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has such bad karma.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mayor and the Restaurateur: How de Blasio Sought Help for an Early Donor", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "Federal investigators, while declining to prosecute, still questioned City Hall\u2019s conduct. Was the administration doing favors for contributors?Supported byLess than six months after Bill de Blasio became mayor of New York City, a campaign donor buttonholed him at an event in Manhattan. The donor, Harendra Singh, one of the earliest contributors to his mayoral campaign, ran a restaurant on city property and was having problems with the lease. Could the mayor help him?That encounter, on June 3, 2014, set the wheels of government turning in an extraordinary way on behalf of Mr. Singh. City officials at the highest levels became involved, ultimately drawing the interest of federal investigators focused on what they saw as a pattern of trading favors for campaign contributions.At the mayor\u2019s direction, an aide sent a series of emails that night to Stacey Cumberbatch, the commissioner of the city agency that handles leases on city-owned real estate, saying that Mr. de Blasio wanted her to meet with Mr. Singh. The mayor, the aide wrote, asked that Ms. Cumberbatch brief him on the issue before she met with Mr. Singh, who operated Water\u2019s Edge, in Long Island City, Queens.The mayor then took it a step further \u2014 calling Ms. Cumberbatch, her lawyer said, while she was in a staff meeting at her agency, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, known as DCAS.Mr. de Blasio said that he wanted her to meet with Mr. Singh, asserting that the restaurateur did a lot of good for the public, according to the lawyer, Jim Walden. The mayor told her that he was not asking her to do anything specific, Mr. Walden said, but that he wanted her to help Mr. Singh if she could.Still, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts on behalf of Mr. Singh illustrated in stark terms the transactional form of governing that had largely been absent under Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire who eschewed campaign donations during his 12 years as mayor.Being a donor afforded Mr. Singh access to a mayor eager to put the city bureaucracy at his service. Emails, city documents and interviews with the participants show how Mr. Singh was attended to by members of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inner circle and other top officials. Over 15 months, meetings were arranged, and City Hall officials were given progress reports. And when the talks were not proceeding to Mr. Singh\u2019s liking, the city\u2019s team of negotiators was suddenly replaced.Henry Berger, the mayor\u2019s special counsel, who was assigned to monitor the city\u2019s handling of the Singh case, said the level of attention Mr. Singh received had nothing to do with his being a campaign contributor.\u201cDo you not help somebody because they\u2019re a donor?\u201d Mr. Berger said in an interview. \u201cIf there\u2019s a problem with the bureaucracy and you can make the bureaucracy work, you do it, whoever asks.\u201dBut others, including Ms. Cumberbatch, believed that Mr. de Blasio was seeking special treatment for a campaign donor.\u201cThe mayor and his staff put tremendous pressure on Stacey to give Harendra Singh a sweetheart deal, a process that started with a call directly from the mayor,\u201d her lawyer, Mr. Walden, said in a statement, calling her a \u201chero\u201d for pushing back against Mr. de Blasio\u2019s effort on behalf of Mr. Singh. \u201cShe resisted that pressure and, as a result, City Hall seized control of negotiations with Singh.\u201dMr. de Blasio\u2019s connection to Mr. Singh goes back at least as far as 2010, when Mr. de Blasio, who was then the public advocate, began raising money for what was considered a long-shot bid for mayor. Mr. Singh gave the de Blasio campaign $2,500 in December 2010 \u2014 becoming one of just 21 people who donated that much or more that year.The following March, Mr. Singh held a fund-raiser at Water\u2019s Edge and collected $5,750 in contributions from other people to Mr. de Blasio. By the time Mr. de Blasio was elected in November 2013, Mr. Singh, his wife, his parents, his employees and other associates had given the mayor a total of about $33,000.Mr. Singh ran a group of restaurant and catering companies in New York City and on Long Island, and he had operated Water\u2019s Edge since 2008. The restaurant, on a barge in the East River that was adjacent to a city-owned pier, leased the space from the city.But Mr. Singh had been fighting with the city over the lease\u2019s terms, including whether he was obligated to pay for the reconstruction of the pier. He also disputed the results of an audit that found that he had been underpaying rent, with arrears and late charges totaling about $1.2 million. And he was seeking a long-term renewal of the lease, which was to expire in 2017.Mr. de Blasio made his first effort to help Mr. Singh in November 2011, arranging a meeting between the restaurateur and Edna Wells Handy, the DCAS commissioner at the time. Mr. de Blasio sat in on the meeting, which appears on his schedule as public advocate.That night, an aide to the mayor, Javon Coney, sent an email to Ms. Cumberbatch. \u201cI wanted to give you a heads up that the mayor ran into Harendra Singh this evening,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mayor would like you to meet with Harendra asap since it is a time-sensitive issue that he has.\u201d He provided Mr. Singh\u2019s phone number and email address.Ms. Cumberbatch replied seven minutes later, promising to contact Mr. Singh.\u201cOne other note for this is the mayor wants a briefing from you on this before the meeting between you and Harendra takes place,\u201d Mr. Coney wrote back. \u201cThank you!\u201dThe next day, Mr. Singh sent Mr. Coney a packet of information. Mr. Coney forwarded it to Ms. Cumberbatch, and her staff called a meeting to discuss it the same day.Ms. Cumberbatch wrote to Mr. Coney to say that she would discuss Mr. Singh\u2019s case with the deputy mayor for economic development and the head of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, which was considering using a parcel of land adjacent to Water\u2019s Edge for a building project. An email sent the next week noted that the DCAS staff was in touch with Mr. Singh\u2019s office on \u201calmost a daily basis.\u201dIt was at about this time that Ms. Cumberbatch received a telephone call from the mayor. Sally Renfro, Ms. Cumberbatch\u2019s chief of staff, who has since retired, said that she remembered her boss taking the call, and returning to express surprise.Ms. Cumberbatch asked her staff about Mr. Singh, her lawyer, Mr. Walden, said. One staff member told her that Mr. Singh had served on the mayor\u2019s inaugural committee \u2014 an indication that he was an influential donor. Ms. Cumberbatch believed that the mayor\u2019s call had put her in a potentially compromising position, and Mr. Walden said that she told her staff that she was going to handle his case \u201cby the book.\u201dShe put Mr. Morales, who started working at DCAS in mid-June, in charge of the Singh negotiations. She also told him about the call from the mayor.\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m an important donor to the mayor,\u2019 and it would be very good if he could get a deal done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s keep him out of it and do what\u2019s best for the city.\u2019 He made it clear that he was a friend to the mayor and a contributor and that the mayor had done events at the restaurant.\u201dMr. Morales and his staff worked to seek a deal with Mr. Singh, but tensions grew. Mr. Singh agreed to a plan to pay a reduced rent over several months, but then fell behind on those payments, according to the emails and other documents. The city sued Mr. Singh over the unpaid rent. And Mr. Singh filed a lawsuit against the city claiming that he was not liable for the pier repairs.Mr. Singh complained to City Hall, and he accused Mr. Morales of using threatening language \u2014 a charge that Mr. Morales denied. Mr. Berger, the mayor\u2019s special counsel, passed the complaints on to Ms. Cumberbatch.\u201cI said, \u2018Negotiate, but be civil,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berger recalled.Apparently frustrated by the pace of negotiations, Mr. Singh hired Neal Kwatra, a lobbyist and political consultant with ties to Mr. de Blasio.Mr. Kwatra began talking and emailing directly with Mr. Berger. On March 24, 2015, Mr. Kwatra and Mr. Singh met with Mr. Morales and his team.\u201cLet me know how the meeting went today,\u201d Mr. Berger wrote in an email to Ms. Cumberbatch. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will get a version from Neal before the day is over.\u201dIn the following weeks, Mr. Berger and Ms. Cumberbatch exchanged a series of emails, some of which also included Dominic Williams, the chief of staff of the first deputy mayor, showing that the case was being watched by others at the highest levels of city government.Mr. Berger said that he did not recall speaking again with the mayor about Mr. Singh after the initial request to monitor the case. \u201cHe said, \u2018Take a look at this and make sure we\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berger said.The next meeting with Mr. Singh and Mr. Kwatra took place on July 17, when Mr. Morales\u2019s team was to offer the restaurateur new terms for the pier reconstruction.An email sent by Ms. Cumberbatch to Mr. Berger and Mr. Williams shows that the pier project was expected to cost $8.6 million, most of which would be paid by the city. Under the lease, Mr. Singh would be responsible for $3.1 million, but the city was offering to reduce his portion to $2 million in order to reach a settlement.Just before the meeting, at the DCAS offices in the Municipal Building, Mr. Morales received a call from Ms. Cumberbatch.\u201cShe said she got a call from City Hall and their desire was that the meeting go well,\u201d Mr. Morales said.At the meeting, in a wood-paneled conference room overlooking City Hall from the 20th floor, Mr. Morales described the new offer. Mr. Kwatra reacted in anger. \u201cKwatra looks at me, jumps up and says: \u2018This is not good. I guess you didn\u2019t get the memo from City Hall,\u2019\u201d Mr. Morales recalled.Mr. Kwatra and Mr. Singh walked out of the room. The meeting had lasted just minutes. \u201cEverybody in the room\u2019s jaws dropped,\u201d Mr. Morales said.Ms. Cumberbatch, who was not in the meeting, emailed Mr. Berger: \u201cSingh and reps walked out of mtg upset.\u201dSoon afterward, Mr. Morales and his staff were taken out of the negotiations, and the talks were moved from the DCAS office to City Hall, where they were put in the hands of the mayor\u2019s top political aide, Emma Wolfe, the director of intergovernmental affairs. Ms. Cumberbatch \u2014 who had not previously been directly involved in the negotiations \u2014 also took part, along with her agency\u2019s general counsel.The first negotiating session at City Hall occurred on July 30. A day earlier, Ms. Cumberbatch sent Ms. Wolfe an email summarizing the case. She included a note of caution: \u201cJust a reminder, we stand as the City\u2019s fiduciary and as such we have to pursue the City\u2019s best interest.\u201dBy mid-August, a proposed settlement had been drafted, including a further reduction of Mr. Singh\u2019s portion of the pier repairs, to $1.5 million.But Mr. Singh was having difficulty raising money, and in a Sept. 9 email, Ms. Cumberbatch worried about his \u201coverall financial health.\u201d She added: \u201cLooking forward to wrapping this up!\u201dShe did not know it but Mr. Singh had been arrested that morning in the Long Island corruption case.Ms. Wolfe wrote to Ms. Cumberbatch several days later. \u201cThank you for all your efforts with H. Singh,\u201d she said. \u201cCase closed, and again I\u2019m sorry!\u201dAfter federal prosecutors completed their investigation without filing charges, Mr. de Blasio defended his practice of asking city officials to respond to the concerns of campaign donors.\u201cI think it is normal for an elected official to receive concerns from people and pass them along for an agency to assess,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we have done things. That\u2019s how we will continue to do things.\u201dEric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s spokesman, refused to say whether the mayor had further contact with Mr. Singh about his problems with DCAS after the June 2014 encounter or whether he discussed the matter with Mr. Kwatra. Mr. Phillips also refused to say what Mr. de Blasio\u2019s role was in the decision to involve Ms. Wolfe in the negotiations.\u201cIt\u2019s the job of city employees to help constituents navigate problems they\u2019re having with agencies and city government,\u201d Mr. Phillips said in an email. \u201cWhether it\u2019s someone who calls 311 or someone who talks to a commissioner at a town hall, or to the mayor at an event or on the subway, we want to help people and businesses find solutions to their issues. New Yorkers who donate to political campaigns shouldn\u2019t be barred from receiving that assistance.\u201dMr. Berger, in an interview, said that City Hall had not sought preferential treatment for Mr. Singh.\u201cMy conversation with Stacey was explicit,\u201d Mr. Berger said, referring to Ms. Cumberbatch. \u201cThere are two concerns: get the money he owes us and make sure the place doesn\u2019t get empty.\u201d He said that it was in the city\u2019s interest to keep Water\u2019s Edge running, so that the city could continue to receive revenue.The restaurant closed after the arrest of Mr. Singh, who is still awaiting trial in the corruption case. Last month, a State Supreme Court judge in Queens rendered a judgment against Mr. Singh\u2019s company for $3.1 million in unpaid rent and $3.4 million for costs related to the pier renovation. It was not clear whether the city would be able to collect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar, High-Ranking FIFA Official, Is Arrested in Fraud Inquiry", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar, the president of the Spanish soccer federation and a FIFA vice president, was arrested on Tuesday as part of a fraud investigation relating to matches played by Spain\u2019s national team.Mr. Villar was detained by the Spanish police alongside his son, Gorka, and other soccer officials. The arrests were ordered by a judge from Spain\u2019s national court who has been investigating the finances of the national team. The police said in a statement that the detained officials were accused of crimes including embezzlement, fraud and the falsification of documents.Mr. Villar, 67, has run Spanish soccer for the past three decades and was re-elected unopposed in May as president of the national federation, despite being entangled in different corruption inquiries. Mr. Villar\u2019s longstanding influence has also stretched far beyond soccer-crazy Spain. He is a vice president of FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body, and last year he was also the interim president of UEFA, the European soccer authority, overseeing the European Championships.Mr. Villar was arrested in connection with an investigation started by a 2016 complaint over how the federation had organized and financed some matches played by the national team. The police said on Tuesday that Mr. Villar was accused of using the games to benefit Gorka Villar, a sports lawyer. Juan Padr\u00f3n, the vice president of the Spanish federation, was also arrested on Tuesday, accused of mismanagement and embezzlement, including from illegal contracts signed between the federation and third parties, according to the police statement.Over the past three years, Mr. Villar has denied wrongdoing in several continuing fraud investigations. His opponents portray him as an influence-peddling president whose friends and relatives have benefited since he took charge of the Spanish federation in 1988. Gorka Villar became one of the leading officials in South American soccer, as director general of Conmebol, the region\u2019s federation, until he resigned last year after being summoned by a judge in Uruguay investigating soccer corruption there.In May, \u00c1ngel Villar was re-elected as president of the national federation after two rivals withdrew their candidacies before the vote amid criticism of how the election was staged. The vote was initially scheduled for last year, but was postponed in a dispute over voting rules after Mr. Villar opposed the use of an electronic ballot, even though the idea was supported by the state sports agency as a means of guaranteeing the secrecy of each vote. Instead, Mr. Villar complained to FIFA about excessive interference by the Spanish government in the affairs of Spanish soccer.\u201cVillar is the last of his kind, kept in power thanks to a system of clientelism that must disappear,\u201d Miguel \u00c1ngel Gal\u00e1n, an owner of Spanish soccer schools who had considered running against Mr. Villar, said in an interview this year.The arrests in Spain come as soccer has been undergoing a changing of the guard since 2015 after an American investigation into corruption among FIFA officials.Neither FIFA nor UEFA offered any comment on Tuesday after the arrests in Spain.While managing to stay at the helm in Spain, Mr. Villar has suffered some setbacks to his standing in world soccer. In November 2015, Mr. Villar was fined 25,000 Swiss francs by FIFA\u2019s ethics committee for refusing to take part in an investigation into whether bribes were paid to secure the elections of Russia and Qatar as World Cup host nations.While Mr. Villar was not accused of any wrongdoing at the time, FIFA\u2019s ethics committee could still end up investigating his role in some international deals. Last year, Mr. Villar also lost out in his bid to turn his interim leadership of UEFA, which followed the suspension of Michel Platini, into a full-term appointment as president.The legal problems of Mr. Villar and his federation date to April 2014, when the superior council of sports, a Spanish state agency, began an investigation into alleged irregularities in the federation\u2019s disbursement of about 1.9 million euros ($2.2 million), which was earmarked for the upgrade of stadiums owned by some of Spain\u2019s nonprofessional clubs.Since then, several other payments by the federation have come under investigation, including 1.2 million euros that was meant to help Spain\u2019s bid to stage the 2018 World Cup, alongside Portugal. (Russia was eventually selected as the host nation.) To bolster the World Cup bid, the Spanish federation agreed at the time to finance some charitable projects, including a soccer academy in Haiti, which had been devastated by an earthquake. The academy, however, was never set up.Last year, the federation also came under court investigation for forgiving part of the debt of two smaller clubs that were breaching the federation\u2019s own financial rules for professional clubs. One of the two clubs, Recreativo de Huelva, is the oldest in Spain; the other, Marino Tenerife, is based in the hometown of Mr. Padr\u00f3n, the vice president of the Spanish federation who was arrested on Tuesday. The police said they raided the offices of the local soccer federation in Tenerife on Tuesday.On Tuesday, the president of Spain\u2019s council of sports, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Lete, told Spanish news media that the arrest of Mr. Villar showed that Spain was a functioning state of law, even if \u201cit isn\u2019t good for the image of the sport.\u201dEven as the fraud allegations mounted against him, Mr. Villar continued to benefit from the international success of Spanish soccer during his time in charge. In 2010, Spain\u2019s national team won the World Cup for the first time \u2014 as well as two consecutive European championships \u2014 under a coach, Vicente del Bosque, who was appointed by Mr. Villar. Spanish clubs have also dominated European soccer. Spain had two representatives in this year\u2019s semifinals of the Champions League, and Real Madrid won the title.In January, Mr. Villar appeared before a judge and said that he took no part in the decision to forgive the debt of the clubs, pinning the responsibility on his subordinates, including Jorge P\u00e9rez, the federation\u2019s former secretary general. After a fallout with Mr. Villar, Mr. P\u00e9rez said that he would run against Mr. Villar\u2019s re-election, but eventually withdrew his candidacy.Advertisement"}

He meant, of course, not conductor-resistant, but adaptable enough to carry out the interpretive wishes of Ms. Alsop or any other conductor when they differed from his own.By now, with some players returning from previous years, the American ensemble is a well-oiled machine, performing at what would be a respectable level for a professional orchestra. Next year, with Michael Tilson Thomas conducting, it will return to Asia, where it scored a resounding success in 2015.NYO2 will make its Carnegie Hall debut on Thursday evening, fortified by members of the Philadelphia Orchestra who have been working and performing with the group. This side-by-side aspect, with more experienced players mentoring their juniors at every level, has become an important element of the Carnegie program.Last Saturday, NYO-USA and NYO2 staged their own side-by-side performance at 583 Park Avenue, a converted Christian Science church, and added in 92 New York students in sessions for intermediate and advanced players, many of them members of the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra of New York. For a run-through of two movements of Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s Symphony No. 3, a monster orchestra of more than 250 competed on equal terms with the mighty organ that has outlived the building\u2019s churchly uses.On Sunday NYO-USA was back in Purchase, hosting NYO-China for a barbecue and a side-by-side rehearsal. Unfortunately, the movements of Dvorak\u2019s \u201cNew World\u201d Symphony in play, the third and the fourth, did not include the Largo, where Ms. Liu\u2019s English horn might have been heard again. But they and a suite from Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d drew lusty performances from an enlarged orchestra bursting with talent and vigor.What\u2019s more, while the American programs aim to spread the wealth among music-loving young players, and so do not admit students already enrolled in conservatories or college music schools, the Chinese orchestra relies heavily on them. To hear the faculty \u2014 notably including Frank Huang, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic \u2014 describe it, conservatory training in China now somewhat resembles the Juilliard School\u2019s a generation ago.The students, that is to say, are pointed toward virtuoso solo careers and do not have much opportunity to develop ensemble skills. \u201cIt\u2019s more like training athletes,\u201d Qing Li, the principal second violinist of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and an NYO-China teaching artist said. \u201cWe have to give them the idea to be creative, not just machines.\u201dMr. Huang concurred. \u201cFingerings and positions are what\u2019s easiest,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the kids don\u2019t react to color.\u201dWhat the faculty members of the three youth orchestras might all agree on is that working with these gifted and committed young musicians, collaborating at every level, is among the most inspiring and rewarding parts of their jobs.\u201cWhen I was young,\u201d Mr. Wang, the Philharmonic oboist, said, \u201cI wished to God for something like this.\u201d Now he is providing it on two continents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Foresaw Better Return in Seizing Fannie and Freddie Profits", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn August 2012, the federal government abruptly changed the terms of the bailout provided to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that had been devastated by the financial crisis. Instead of continuing to receive payments on the taxpayer assistance, Treasury officials decided to begin seizing all the profits both companies generated every quarter.It was an unusual move, given that the companies still had public shareholders. But it was necessary, the Treasury said, to protect taxpayers from likely future losses in their operations. Justice Department lawyers have reiterated this view in court, saying that the bailout terms were modified because the companies were in a death spiral.A December 2011 information memo to Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, is among the newly released documents. The 17-page memo from Mary John Miller, assistant secretary for financial markets, shows that the idea to extract all of Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s profits coincided with their anticipated turnaround.Ms. Miller outlined \u201crestructuring and transition options\u201d for Fannie and Freddie in the memo, saying the No. 1 option was changing the terms of the bailout to \u201creplace the current 10 percent fixed dividend with a permanent \u2018net worth sweep.\u2019\u201d The memo noted that Freddie Mac was \u201cexpected to be net income positive by the end of 2012 and Fannie by the end of 2013.\u201dAnother unsealed document, a draft memorandum circulated before the profit sweep, shows that federal officials recognized it would generate more money than the original bailout terms. Net income generated by Fannie and Freddie and paid to the government \u201cwill likely exceed the amount that would have been paid if the 10 percent was still in effect,\u201d it stated.Documents recently unsealed in a lawsuit against the federal government by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders shed light on a crucial 2012 policy change by the Treasury Department.Ms. Miller, who left Treasury in 2014 and sits on the board of the SVB Financial Group, the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, did not respond to an email seeking comment, nor did a Treasury spokeswoman.Instead, the Treasury and the housing finance agency depleted the companies\u2019 assets by instigating the profit sweep. Fannie and Freddie currently operate their multitrillion-dollar businesses on almost no capital.A calculation by plaintiffs in another case against the government involving the profit sweep states that Fannie and Freddie have paid $130 billion more to the government than they would have under the original rescue plan.From the outset, the government demanded unusual secrecy in the litigation, withholding more than 11,000 documents and asserting that they were protected by various privileges. In a rare move, the government asserted presidential privilege on 45 documents.The Obama administration argued that disclosure of the documents would roil the financial markets.But it has been almost nine years since the government took over Fannie and Freddie in the face of a growing mortgage mess. The companies remain in conservatorship and are essentially the last piece of unfinished business from the crisis.The document stating that the profit sweep would probably generate more money to the government than the previous arrangement also contradicts court testimony from another housing official, Mario Ugoletti, a former special adviser to the director of the housing finance agency.Mr. Ugoletti swore in a 2013 declaration that by mid-2012, the amounts owed by Fannie and Freddie under the original rescue had grown so large that \u201cit appeared unlikely that either of the enterprises would be able to meet that amount consistently without drawing additional funds from Treasury.\u201dThe intention of the change \u201cwas not to increase compensation to Treasury,\u201d he stated.Mr. Ugoletti could not be reached for comment for this article.Two years ago, The New York Times intervened in the case, arguing that unsealing some of the documents would \u201cenable the public to understand more fully the decisions the government has made in the public\u2019s name and to assess the wisdom and effect of those decisions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lawyer, the Addict", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "A high-powered Silicon Valley attorney dies. His ex-wife investigates, and finds a web of drug abuse in his profession.Supported byIn July 2015, something was very wrong with my ex-husband, Peter. His behavior over the preceding 18 months had been erratic and odd. He could be angry and threatening one minute, remorseful and generous the next. His voice mail messages and texts had become meandering soliloquies that didn\u2019t make sense, veering from his work travails, to car repairs, to his pet mouse, Snowball.I thought maybe the stress of his job as a lawyer had finally gotten to him, or that he was bipolar. He had been working more than 60 hours a week for 20 years, ever since he started law school and worked his way into a partnership in the intellectual property practice of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a prominent law firm based in Silicon Valley.Then, for two days, Peter couldn\u2019t be reached. So I drove the 20 minutes or so to his house, to look in on him. Although we were divorced, we had known each other by then for nearly 30 years. We were family.I parked in Peter\u2019s driveway, used my key to open the front door and walked up to the living room, a loftlike space with bamboo floors bathed in sunlight.\u201cPeter?\u201d I called out.Silence. A few candy wrappers littered a counter. Peter worked so much that he rarely cooked anymore, sustaining himself largely on fast food, snacks, coffee, ibuprofen and antacids. I headed toward the bedroom, calling his name.The door was ajar. A few crumpled and bloodied tissues were scattered on the bedsheets. And then I turned the corner and saw him, lying on the floor between the bathroom and the bedroom. His head rested on a flattened cardboard box.In my shock, I didn\u2019t see the half-filled syringes on the bathroom sink, or the spoon, lighter and crushed pills. I didn\u2019t see the bag of white powder, or the tourniquet, or the other lighter next to the bed. The police report from that day noted several safes around the bedroom, all of them open and spilling out translucent orange pill bottles.Peter, one of the most successful people I have ever known, died a drug addict, felled by a systemic bacterial infection common to intravenous users.Of all the heartbreaking details of his story, the one that continues to haunt me is this: The history on his cellphone shows the last call he ever made was for work. Peter, vomiting, unable to sit up, slipping in and out of consciousness, had managed, somehow, to dial into a conference call.None of this made sense. Not only was Peter one of the smartest people in my life, he had also been a chemist before becoming a lawyer and most likely understood how the drugs he was taking would affect his neurochemistry.In my attempt to fathom what happened to him and how I \u2014 and everyone else in his world \u2014 missed it, I set out to create a map of Peter\u2019s life the year before he died. (To protect the privacy of our children and Peter\u2019s extended family, I\u2019m not using his surname.)I studied his texts to drug dealers, and I compared the timing of those with dates and times of A.T.M. withdrawals he made. I needed to see the signs I hadn\u2019t known were signs. The nonsensical conversations. The crazy hours he kept. The nights he told our children he was running out to get a soda, only to disappear.Human beings are physically and emotionally complex, so there is no simple answer as to why Peter began abusing drugs. But as a picture of his struggle took shape before my eyes, so did another one: The further I probed, the more apparent it became that drug abuse among America\u2019s lawyers is on the rise and deeply hidden.One of the first things I learned is that there is little research on lawyers and drug abuse. Nor is there much data on drug use among lawyers compared with the general population or white-collar workers specifically.Over all, the results showed that about 21 percent of lawyers qualify as problem drinkers, while 28 percent struggle with mild or more serious depression and 19 percent struggle with anxiety. Only 3,419 lawyers answered questions about drug use, and that itself is telling, said Patrick Krill, the study\u2019s lead author and also a lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s left to speculation what motivated 75 percent of attorneys to skip over the section on drug use as if it wasn\u2019t there.\u201dIn Mr. Krill\u2019s opinion, they were afraid to answer.Nearly 21 percent of the lawyers that said they had used drugs in the previous year reported \u201cintermediate\u201d concern about their drug use. Three percent had \u201csevere\u201d concerns.\u201cAlcohol is legal,\u201d Mr. Krill said, not to mention socially acceptable. \u201cSo admitting you drink too much is not directly at odds with your role as a licensed attorney.\u201dIllicit drug use, however, is illegal. \u201cI think the incidence of drug use and abuse is significantly underreported,\u201d he said.In recent years, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a significant rate of increase specifically among attorneys using prescription medications that become a gateway to street drugs.\u201d It used to be mostly alcohol, he said, \u201cbut now almost every attorney that comes in for treatment, even if they drink, they are using drugs, too \u2014 Xanax, Adderall, opiates, cocaine and crack.\u201dOpioids and stimulants often go hand in hand with alcohol. In fact, drugs are sometimes used to combat the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.In addition to having a private practice at the time, Mr. Cuban was working for his well-known brother, the businessman Mark Cuban, who threatened to fire Brian if he didn\u2019t get sober. \u201cI kept thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not going to rehab. I\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t go to rehab, they aren\u2019t in 12-step programs,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, half the people I know in my 12-step program are lawyers.\u201dThat stress became particularly acute as the economy sank after the 2008 financial crisis. Jobs became more scarce. The pressure grew to not take time off from work.At Peter\u2019s memorial service in 2015 \u2014 held in a place he loved, with sweeping views of the Pacific \u2014 a young associate from his firm stood up to speak of their friendship and of the bands they sometimes went to see together, only to break down in tears. Quite a few of the lawyers attending the service were bent over their phones, reading and tapping out emails.Peter himself lived in a state of heavy stress. He obsessed about the competition, about his compensation, about the clients, their demands and his fear of losing them. He loved the intellectual challenge of his work but hated the combative nature of the profession, because it was at odds with his own nature.Long before law school, when Peter was still in his early 20s and wearing his hair in a long ponytail, his passions were science, philosophy and music. One of his idols was the astronomer Carl Sagan. Another was Jimi Hendrix. He gave me books like \u201cSiddhartha\u201d and \u201cLetters to a Young Poet\u201d and played bass guitar in bands from college onward, even while a lawyer.When he was a graduate student in chemistry, we spent whole weekends lying on the floor playing records for each other, talking about why we loved them and what memories a particular song snatched from the recesses of our minds.After graduation, Peter worked for two small pharmaceutical companies but found the profession tedious and low paying. Having grown up in a low-income family, he didn\u2019t want to worry about paying the bills again. So he decided to use his chemistry background to become a patent lawyer.When he graduated from law school, the starting salary of his first job in law was five times what he had earned as a chemist. But our lives were not suddenly easy. Although we had enough money, Peter\u2019s work schedule gave him little time to enjoy the fruits of his labor.One Christmas Day early in his career, Peter\u2019s boss phoned from a ski lift in Aspen, Colo., to make sure Peter was going to finish a brief by that evening. He did, skipping dinner.\u201cI can\u2019t do this forever,\u201d Peter often told me. \u201cI can\u2019t keep going like this for the next 20 years.\u201dPeter battled his own brand of melancholy, something I found attractive in a tragically poetic, still-waters-run-deep kind of way. He used to tell me he wasn\u2019t someone who ever really felt happy. He had moments of being \u201cnot unhappy,\u201d he said, but his emotional range was narrow.When something great happened, he didn\u2019t jump for joy. When something sad happened, he didn\u2019t break down and cry. The only times I ever saw tears in his eyes were in the hospital, right after each of our children was born.Yet for almost a decade as an associate at various law firms, Peter displayed no photos of his children or me in his office. When I asked him why \u2014 particularly when other lawyers seemed to have photos in theirs \u2014 Peter told me he didn\u2019t want the partners to see him as \u201cdistracted by my family.\u201dIn many ways, Peter\u2019s personality and abilities read like a wish list of qualities for a lawyer. Trained as a scientist, he approached problems in a deliberative, logical way. He was intelligent, ambitious and most of all hard-working, perhaps because his decision to go to law school was such an enormous commitment \u2014 financially, logistically and emotionally \u2014 that he could justify it only by being the very best.And he was. In law school he was editor of the law review and No. 1 in his class. He gave the speech at graduation.He also had a single-minded focus that could border on obsessive. I remember when he became consumed with Bach\u2019s harpsichord concertos, assembling a library of every one he could find. He read about them, listened to lectures about them and even found a mathematical representation of a particular piece on YouTube, which he had us all watch. That level of focus was well suited for deep dives into the new drug formulations, medical devices and technologies with which he had to constantly and quickly familiarize himself.In addition, he said, law students generally start school with their sense of self and their values intact. But, in his research, he said, he has found that the formal structure of law school starts to change that.Rather than hew to their internal self, students begin to focus on external values, he said, like status, comparative worth and competition. \u201cWe have seven very strong studies that show this twists people\u2019s psyches and they come out of law school significantly impaired, with depression, anxiety and hostility,\u201d he said.Academics often study law students because students are considered a bellwether for the profession. \u201cThey are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d Dr. Benjamin said.Wil Miller, the lawyer and former methamphetamine addict, said that in his experience, law school encouraged students to take emotion out of their decisions. \u201cWhen you start reinforcing that with grades and money, you aren\u2019t just suppressing your emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re fundamentally changing who you are.\u201dAfter students began law school they experienced \u201ca marked increase in depression, negative mood and physical symptoms, with corresponding decreases in positive affect and life satisfaction,\u201d the professors wrote.Students also shed some of their idealism. Within the first year of law school, students\u2019 motivation for studying law and becoming lawyers shifted from \u201chelping and community-oriented values to extrinsic, rewards-based values.\u201d\u201cThese aren\u2019t the majority of lawyers,\u201d she added. \u201cBut there are quite a number abusing drugs, and once they get to heroin, it\u2019s very hard to break it.\u201dFor the last two years of his life, every time Peter and I were together \u2014 whether it was back-to-school night, our son\u2019s cross country meets or our daughter\u2019s high school graduation \u2014 people would ask me if he was O.K. They asked if he had cancer, an eating disorder, a metabolic disorder, AIDS. But they never asked about drugs.Drugs didn\u2019t cross my mind, either. Not even the day I found his body, surrounded by drug paraphernalia, and called 911.That day in Peter\u2019s house, the emergency medical workers told me right away that it was probably a drug overdose. I remember saying, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d After all, I said, he was a partner at a law firm. He had an Ivy League education.\u201cHow could that be?\u201d I asked one of them. \u201cHe was so smart.\u201dID around her neck and clipboard on her lap, she nodded at me with a look of understanding. \u201cWe see a lot of this now,\u201d she said, meaning wealthy, accomplished men and women who start out with pain pills and graduate to amphetamines or heroin.As I cleared out Peter\u2019s house after he died, I found receipts from medical-supply companies that had delivered things like bandages and tourniquets to his office address. Yet I don\u2019t think addiction crossed the mind of anyone he worked with, either.It\u2019s difficult, though, to imagine that one class every three years would have prevented Peter \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 from becoming an addict. Real change, experts and recovering addicts say, needs to happen at the law-firm level, but that is complicated by an entrenched culture of privacy combined with an allegiance to billable hours.Ms. Smith, formerly of Pillsbury Winthrop, says she doesn\u2019t know what her previous firm knew or didn\u2019t know about her substance abuse. \u201cThey never said a thing to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd during that entire time I was an addict, I didn\u2019t get a single negative performance review.\u201dEdward Flanders, managing partner in Pillsbury\u2019s Manhattan office, said the firm was not aware of Ms. Smith\u2019s substance abuse issues when she was there. Ms. Smith spoke about her experience to the firm\u2019s New York City employees in March.\u201cHearing about her experience was pretty eye-opening for the firm, and it\u2019s not something we want anyone else to have to go through alone,\u201d Mr. Flanders said.I\u2019ve spent the past two years marinating in this mess, trying my best to navigate things like the byzantine probate process and my children\u2019s broken hearts. I firmly believe that law-firm culture, particularly at big firms, has to become more compassionate and more aware of the signs that one of their own is struggling.Looking back, I can see the signs I missed.There was the time our son broke his wrist playing soccer four years ago and was prescribed Vicodin; Peter rifled through my medicine cabinet looking for the leftovers. \u201cI use them for my back,\u201d he said.There was the holiday concert in which our son\u2019s band was performing where Peter showed up late and jittery, looking so thin that I noticed his head seemed too big for his neck. After the show I walked with him to his car, and he complained that he was getting pushback from his firm about working from home so much.\u201cI\u2019m more productive at home, but they have to see me, physically, in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think I\u2019m working if I\u2019m not there.\u201dThey were right.And there was the time in early 2015 when my son told me Peter had received a shipment from Amazon that he had opened at the dining room table, pulling out boxes of syringes, bandages, cotton balls and wound cleanser. Peter explained it away as simply stocking up on medical supplies.My son was puzzled by that. But by then his father\u2019s behavior had become so strange, this almost seemed normal. \u201cI just put my headphones on,\u201d my son told me, \u201cand said, \u2018I have to do homework.\u2019\u201dYears ago, when Peter was still a relatively new associate, he would joke that the perfect drug for him would be the combination of an antidepressant, a pain reliever and a stimulant. When I cleaned out his house, I found the ingredients for it: Vicodin, Tramadol, Adderall, cocaine, Xanax, crystal meth and a kaleidoscope of pills I couldn\u2019t identify, but not for lack of trying.Yet even as addiction was taking over his life, Peter continued working. In the notebooks he used to keep track of injection times and dosages, he also made cryptic notes about client calls and meetings, lists of things needed to prepare documents, filing deadlines.Being a patent lawyer is intellectually grueling work, and Peter was good at it \u2014 really good at it \u2014 for a long time. Perhaps the arrogance that grows from a profession in which your advice is worth $600 an hour is what allowed him to believe he didn\u2019t need to ask for help, that he could kick this on his own. Just another item on his lengthy to-do list.In fact, while cleaning out his house I found a list of New Year\u2019s resolutions Peter wrote in December 2014, tucked into the bottom of a dresser drawer. \u201cRun three races, spend more time with kids,\u201d his note to himself read.And in red marker, the word \u201cquit.\u201dAn article last Sunday about lawyers and drug addiction misstated the period during which Wil Miller, a former sex crimes prosecutor, was addicted to methamphetamines. It was the last six months of his tenure, not the entire 10 years he was in the job.

{"Headline": "De Blasio, With \u2018Cultural Plan,\u2019 Proposes Linking Money to Diversity", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnveiling the first \u201ccultural plan\u201d for New York\u2019s five boroughs on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city will link future funding for museums and arts groups to the diversity of their employees and board members.This unusual move by the city, which rarely dictates policy to its cultural leaders, puts pressure on the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History and other pre-eminent institutions that are led largely by white male executives and power brokers from Wall Street, real estate and other industries.Mr. de Blasio, who is seeking re-election this year with a message emphasizing inclusion and equity, said at a news conference in Queens that the city will collect data on the makeup of the staffs and boards and require these arts organizations to submit \u201cmeaningful goals\u201d for making their ranks more diverse.\u201cThis will be a factor in funding decisions by the city going forward,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cWe do this because we believe in fairness.\u201dAsked if he believed that certain cultural organizations were elitist, the mayor said, \u201cI think they were.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is still the assumption among many New Yorkers about where they belong and where they don\u2019t belong.\u201dAsked to explain the city\u2019s new, tougher stance on diversity, Mr. Finkelpearl said in an email on Wednesday: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement requiring diversity reporting from city-funded groups is the next step, building on everything we\u2019ve learned to date to work toward a cultural sector that is fairer, more equitable and looks like the city it serves.\u201dMr. de Blasio did not set any clear diversity targets for cultural institutions. Citing the statistic that about 26 percent of senior staff members at cultural organizations are people of color, Mr. de Blasio said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go. We\u2019ve got more work to do.\u201dArts groups are nevertheless likely to chafe at his budgetary conditions, particularly at a time when many depend on city dollars to help pay the bills.The Met is close to a deal with the city under which the museum would accept a reduced annual allocation in exchange for the city\u2019s approval of the Met\u2019s plan to make up that revenue by charging $25 admission for visitors from outside New York State, according to a cultural executive in New York museum circles with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized by the Met or the city to comment. (A Met spokesman would say only that the museum was still in discussions with the city about the proposed admission fee.)Moreover, Mr. de Blasio is suddenly brandishing a stick after years of rarely visiting or championing cultural institutions, in contrast with his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg. When asked directly at Wednesday\u2019s news conference whether he\u2019d ever been to MoMA/P.S. 1, a nearby museum, Mr. de Blasio answered simply, \u201cNo.\u201dSeveral board leaders of major museums did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Yet some city officials were quick to go on the offensive against any potential opposition.\u201cThere are people who will resist, who will resent, who will obstruct,\u201d said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker. \u201cAny moment for equality and inclusion doesn\u2019t come easily.\u201dFor now, the plan calls for maintaining city funding for New York\u2019s most popular museums, allaying concerns that some of their subsidies would be redirected to smaller arts organizations. Mr. de Blasio pledged on Wednesday to increase money for the less prominent groups, many in neighborhoods outside Manhattan.At the same time, Mr. Finkelpearl added, \u201cI would consider it a failure if we don\u2019t have a measurable increase in cultural resources in those parts of the city that aren\u2019t being reached right now in five years.\u201dCultural participation is 20 percent higher among New York City\u2019s highest-income earners than its lowest earners, according to the plan. Seventy-five percent of New Yorkers say that they wish they could attend arts and cultural activities more often, and 72 percent say they would participate more in cultural activities if the events were closer to home.The plan also describes geographical inequities.\u201cThere\u2019s a north-south division in Brooklyn and Staten Island, and a sense in Queens that the cultural resources cluster along the 7 train corridor,\u201d the document says. \u201cAs it becomes more difficult for moderate- and low-income New Yorkers to live near the center, transportation and geographic divides come to the surface.\u201dCity arts leaders have long questioned the city\u2019s century-old formula for financing cultural institutions, which lacks clear criteria or consistency, having been determined case by case over the years. Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, which funded the research for the cultural plan, said the report represented a positive step, provided that it eventually leads to a different formula by which arts organizations are financed.\u201cWe should be celebrating that Staten Island will get more money for the arts,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cSome part of this is going to be disruptive. That is a good thing, if it produces a fairer system.\u201dIn the city\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2018 \u2014 which was finalized in June, before the completion of the cultural plan \u2014 arts funding increased by $18.5 million, to a total of $188.1 million. Mr. Finkelpearl said he would use some of that to start making changes.\u201cThe least-white jobs are maintenance and security,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said, \u201cand the whitest are curators. That points to some problems.\u201dKaty Clark, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, one of the dozens of arts groups that receive city financing, said diversity had long been a high priority for her institution and added, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reason why we shouldn\u2019t be doing better.\u201d\u201cI actually welcome the mandate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to consider it in every hire. You have to work a little harder, but the talent is there.\u201dThe report also calls for increasing funds for individual artists, citing research showing that 75 percent of New York City artists support themselves with outside income, and that 40 percent can\u2019t afford supplies. New money and resources would also go to train more minority applicants for cultural jobs; improve interpretation services at arts organizations (about half of the city\u2019s residents speak a language other than English at home); and improve access to cultural institutions for New Yorkers with disabilities.The city also intends to create a position to help cultural organizations reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cTwenty-five percent of this agency budget pays for energy,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said, adding that environmental improvements to cultural buildings could result in substantial savings.For the plan to prove meaningful, some say, a funding supply needs to continue.\u201cThe report should be considered a clarion call to double down and reinvest in the arts and culture,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, majority leader of the City Council and chairman of its Cultural Affairs Committee, who helped spearhead legislation to create the plan.The 33 museums and arts groups operating in city-owned buildings or on city-owned land \u2014 known as members of the Cultural Institutions Group, or CIGs \u2014 had worried that the city would take away some of their funding and give it to smaller organizations. The group\u2019s members receive about 63 percent of the municipal arts budget; the remaining 37 percent is distributed through a competitive application process among nearly 1,000 organizations that are not in or on city property.Money for the Cultural Institutions Group will not be cut, Mr. Finkelpearl said; in fact, the appropriation for some members will increase.\u201cThere are CIGs that we fear are underfunded,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said. \u201cSome of those are in low-income communities, and that\u2019s something we want to address in the plan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it\u2019s not clear whether he will try to intervene again.With the European Central Bank preparing to take away stimulus, existential questions are being raised in parts of Europe that have benefited from its largess.This small city, northwest of Florence, was struggling economically a few years ago. The local factory, then owned by the Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, had produced trains for more than a century, but lacked orders. It laid off hundreds of workers, and some of the companies that supplied it went out of business.Then, in 2015, the European Central Bank announced it would begin buying bonds. It started with government bonds and then added debt issued by corporations. The central bank has spent about $2.3 trillion on bonds, in an effort to push down market interest rates and make borrowing cheaper and easier.The E.C.B. has been buying bonds broadly, but a lot have come from the infrastructure sector, effectively financing a public works program in Italy.Some of the bonds were issued by the government-owned company that manages the Italian rail network, which then used the money to order trains for regional services, making work for Pistoia.But at some point, Pistoia will have to stand on its own.One man is the founder of Guggenheim Partners and a co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The other is a respected investment manager who\u2019s a regular presence on business television (and a competitive bodybuilder to boot).The fighting between Mark Walter, who built up Guggenheim into a $240 billion asset manager and investment bank, and Scott Minerd, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer, is said to have taken place amid a drop in asset management fees and executive departures. Clients have reportedly become worried as well.Much of the tension, according to The FT, arises from the appointment of Alexandra Court as global head of institutional distribution. The move eventually made Ms. Court \u2014 an ally of Mr. Walter \u2014 and her office the sole official conduit through which Guggenheim money managers could reach out to clients.That has reportedly led Mr. Minerd and his supporters to regard Ms. Court\u2019s new organization as an impediment to the firm\u2019s raising money from and supporting clients.A spokesman for Guggenheim told The FT, \u201cIf people perceive the interaction between the two of them as a power struggle, we believe that is an inaccurate portrayal.\u201dMr. Musk is talking of a journey that takes only 29 minutes, from city center to city center.\u201cThese are smart, aggressive people who don\u2019t want to pay more than they have to, and writing a huge check can be quite demoralizing. ...

{"Headline": "Did Donald Jr. Break the Law?", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe revelation that Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted an offer to meet with an individual described as a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d bringing \u201cofficial documents and information\u201d to help the Trump campaign and injure the Clinton campaign is a bombshell.It raises a host of potential criminal and other legal violations for Donald Jr. and others involved, including his brother-in-law Jared Kushner; Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time; and perhaps the president himself. These new facts are a critical inflection point in the Trump-Russia matter. But they should not be exaggerated: The investigation has much further to go before Donald Jr.\u2019s liability, or that of others, can be finally assessed.The defense that this was a routine meeting to hear about opposition research is nonsense. As ethics lawyers, we have worked on political campaigns for decades and have never heard of an offer like this one. If we had, we would have insisted upon immediate notification of the F.B.I., and so would any normal campaign lawyer, official or even senior volunteer.That is because of the enormous potential legal liability, both individually and for the campaign. The potential offenses committed by Donald Jr., his colleagues and brother-in-law who attended the meeting, and the campaign itself, include criminal or civil violations of campaign finance laws. These laws prohibit accepting anything of value from a foreign government or a foreign national. The promised Russian \u201cdocuments and information\u201d would have been an illegal campaign contribution from a foreign government \u2014 and a priceless one.Then there is the question of whether the statements of enthusiasm in the emails about the meeting (\u201cI love it,\u201d Donald Jr. wrote) constituted assent on behalf of the Trump campaign to continuing Russian help. Welcoming the information and taking the meeting can reasonably be understood to signal a broader receptivity to Russian aid. This is even more serious than the campaign finance violation because it brings conspiracy law into play. That could make Donald Jr. and others liable for all of the Russian dirty tricks that followed, including any Russian cybercrimes or other crimes targeting the Clinton campaign.Although we do not yet have enough facts to judge, Donald Jr. and others may also be liable for conspiracy with respect to espionage, depending on how any illicit information was obtained and the level of their awareness of any spying. Because the Russian campaign that followed was nothing less than an assault on our democracy, we understand why some are raising issues of treason as well. Prosecution under the federal treason statute is ultimately unlikely because we are not at war with Russia. But during the Cold War, treasonous conduct was often prosecuted under other statutes. (Alger Hiss was sentenced to four years in prison for \u201cforgetting\u201d in sworn testimony that he had met with Whitaker Chambers, an American working for the Russians.)Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner, who attended the meeting on notice of what was contained in these documents, are also potentially culpable. Mr. Manafort is already reportedly under investigation in connection with Russian contacts; this will add fuel to that fire. Mr. Kushner is very likely being investigated as well for omitting Russian contacts from his security clearance forms. He could be charged with making false statements if it is determined that he intentionally withheld this or other Russia-related meetings from his government filings.What of Donald Trump himself? Because offers of this kind are the most crimson of red flags in any campaign, they would never normally be undertaken without the agreement of a lawyer, and perhaps the consent of the candidate. That raises the question of whether the president himself knew. There\u2019s a strong possibility he was in Trump Tower when the meeting took place; after all, his office was just one floor away. Would three of his closest confidants really have undertaken this meeting without telling him?Finally, it is important to remember that we are still midstream in the Trump-Russia investigation. Evidence is accumulating, but we do not definitively know yet what crimes, if any, have been committed, or by whom. For that reason, it is now more critical than ever that the investigations by the special prosecutor and Congress be allowed to complete their course without White House or other interference.Norman L. Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman and Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, is the vice chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.

{"Headline": "Family-Friendly Laws Are Being Passed, but Not by Trump\u2019s Team", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWork-Life BalancePresident Trump has promised help for families with jobs and young children. And recently, they have been getting it \u2014 but not from the federal government. Instead, state and local lawmakers have been passing policies to address their needs.Last week alone, state legislatures passed several major pieces of legislation that benefit families. Oregon became the first state to pass a bill guaranteeing workers predictable schedules, with two weeks\u2019 notice and 10 hours off between shifts. Washington passed a paid leave law that gives workers 16 weeks to care for babies, family members or themselves.New Jersey voted to double its paid family leave to 12 weeks, pay workers more while they\u2019re out and let them use it in more types of situations. Rhode Island\u2019s House and Senate passed separate paid sick leave bills, but not yet a compromise bill.Except for Rhode Island\u2019s, each bill is now going to the state\u2019s governor. The flurry of policy making at the state level is a response to the void at the federal one, advocates and policy makers say.\u201cAppetite for these policies only continues to grow, so as the federal government continues to drag its feet, more and more states and cities are stepping up,\u201d said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.The new policies have passed mostly in blue states. Republicans have traditionally opposed them as being onerous for business or expensive for government. But recently, there have been more bipartisan efforts. A Republican state senator, Joe Fain, was the primary sponsor of Washington\u2019s paid leave bill, with Democratic co-sponsors. On Saturday, a law went into effect in Georgia, a red state, allowing workers to use their personal sick days to care for immediate family members.The Trump administration included a paid leave plan in its budget proposal, the first from a Republican administration. But many advocates say it is insufficient because it would cover only new parents, for a maximum of six weeks and with an uncertain financing source.Washington State\u2019s paid leave bill does several novel things. It creates an insurance fund that employers and employees pay into, through a 0.4 percent payroll tax. There are exemptions and grants for small businesses. Benefits are paid on a progressive scale, so the lowest-income workers receive 90 percent of their pay, and the highest-income workers receive 10 percent. Benefits are also portable for people who change employers.Ultimately, advocates hope, state policies will pressure the federal government to take action.\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as an alternative to federal policy; we see this as a way to get a federal bill,\u201d said Ellen Bravo, executive director of Family Values @ Work, a network of state advocacy groups. \u201cIt creates an imbalance where a certain number of people have it and others say, \u2018We want it.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

How does it compare with its European counterparts?\u2022 Donald Trump\u2019s business dealings in Indonesia during his presidential campaign.Advocates of paid leave in cases of domestic violence received a mixed victory yesterday. Workers in Australia are legally entitled to unpaid leave in cases of domestic violence, the Fair Work Commission ruled on Monday after hearing arguments from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The commission heard from academics, researchers, statisticians and survivors of family violence.But the panel rejected the council\u2019s bid for paid domestic violence leave. \u201cTo be perfectly honest, we are disappointed,\u201d said Ged Kearney, the president of the council. \u201cWe really do think the time is right, and there was no reason not to get paid leave.\u201dWhat impact could this decision have?Domestic violence leave, even if unpaid, gives victims time to find safe housing as well as to seek support and legal services.Some large corporations already offer paid domestic violence leave, like PwC Australia, which confirmed that it had testified to the commission in support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.But paid domestic leave may not be one-size-fits-all, especially for small businesses, which could feel the strain of paid-leave policies more than bigger companies. Moo Baulch, the chief executive of Domestic Violence NSW, said that although the decision suggested a cultural shift and indicated a growing recognition of domestic violence as a concern for employers, smaller businesses might struggle to provide 10 days of paid leave.A more nuanced conversation is necessary, some suggested. \u201cJust putting it into place is not enough. You certainly need some structures and potentially some training and some conversations around that leave,\u201d Ms. Baulch said. That might include training for senior employees or having a point person in the human resources department whom domestic abuse victims can consult in confidence.\u201cYou actually create a culture in the workplace to understand the dynamics of domestic violence and recognizing it impacts almost every family in Australia in some shape or form,\u201d Ms. Baulch said.The production is sharp and modern. The narrator speaks fluent English with a South African twang.Last weekend, Dr. Kenneth Elliott, an Australian surgeon who was kidnapped, appeared in a video released by Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, a terrorist group in Mali that is affiliated with Al Qaeda.Mr. Elliott, 82, and his wife, Jocelyn Elliott, were kidnapped by the group in Burkina Faso in January 2016. Ms. Elliott was released in February after a mediation effort led by neighboring Niger. No ransom was paid.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said that the government preferred to say \u201cvery little\u201d about the episode and thanked the governments of Niger and Burkina Faso.Why doesn\u2019t the Australian government do more for its kidnapped citizens? Rukmini Callimachi, the Times correspondent who covers the Islamic State, explained that the group that abducted Dr. Elliott rebranded recently.\u201cThe group that took the couple is AQIM,\u201d she said, referring to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or the Qaeda branch active in parts of North and West Africa. \u201cThey renamed themselves last year but remain Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in the region, and they have long financed themselves through ransoms.\u201dBut this was a matter of business, not policy.What has emerged from the investigation?

Blankfein, leaves \u2014 as, of course, does the other co-president, Harvey M. Schwartz, Goldman\u2019s former chief financial officer.Still, Mr. Solomon\u2019s love of spinning music suggests a youthful, unguarded side that is rare in the wealthy, button-down world of high finance.In recent years, he has performed regularly as a D.J., according to associates, mixing and tweaking electronic dance music for a live audience. It is the sort of pursuit that could inspire guffaws among the executive\u2019s 50-something peers while appealing to a younger generation of Wall Street talent that rejects the industry\u2019s staid culture.Mr. Solomon\u2019s hobby has become a more or less monthly gig, with recent stops in New York, Miami and the Bahamas, all noted on the Instagram page. (Among the Manhattan venues where he has spun, according to the page, are Beautique in East Midtown and The Whales on Clinton Street.)\u201cDavid\u2019s always believed that having a wide range of outside interests leads to a balanced life and makes for a better career,\u201d said Jake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman. \u201cHe\u2019s preached that regularly to younger employees in the firm and tries to lead by example.\u201dMr. Solomon led a study about improving the quality of life for Goldman\u2019s junior bankers that resulted in new curbs on the hours they could work on weekends.Shortly after The New York Times called, the Instagram page was made private.But a roughly 30-second clip shot during the performance on July 4 depicts Mr. Solomon, wearing a baseball cap with headphones over it and a T-shirt bearing the name of Casamigos Tequila, adjusting the music as women in bikinis and shirtless men wearing board shorts dance on a deck below. Speakers blast music from the roof of the club, which was holding its weekly pig roast that day.Based on his social-media posts, Mr. Solomon wants to get more creative. In an April 11 post next to a picture of him in front of an elaborate indoor sound system, he writes: \u201cStarting to play around with vinyl. Old school and lots to learn but very cool...\u201d In the shot, he is dressed in black, except for a green wristwatch, and is surrounded by black-and-white photographs.The performance at Nipper\u2019s was not Mr. Solomon\u2019s first outing in the Bahamas. In May, he posted a picture of himself spinning at the Baker\u2019s Bay Ocean & Golf Club on Great Guana Cay with the caption \u201cRocking the Dune bar...\u201dMr. Solomon has joined forces with some big names in the electronic-music business too. Earlier in the year, he performed several shows with the D.J. Liquid Todd, a SiriusXM radio personality. And Mr. Solomon\u2019s Miami gig in March was part of the Paul Oakenfold Generations World Tour. Mr. Oakenfold, a Grammy-winning British D.J., helped popularize trance music in the 1990s.Whatever Mr. Solomon\u2019s Wall Street cohort thinks, his social-media followers seem to understand that spinning music means a lot to him.

{"Headline": "Huge Manafort Payment Reflects Murky Ukraine Politics", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCuriously, that was more than the party itself reported spending in the same period for its entire operation \u2014 the national political organization\u2019s expenses, salaries, printing outlays and other incidentals.The discrepancies show a lot about how Mr. Manafort\u2019s clients \u2014 former President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine and his Party of Regions \u2014 operated.And in a broader sense, they underscore the dangers that lurk for foreigners who, tempted by potentially rich payoffs, cast their lot with politicians in countries that at best have different laws about money in politics, and at worst are, like Ukraine in those years, irredeemably corrupt.Mr. Yanukovych was driven from office in the Maidan Revolution of 2014, after having stolen, according to the current Ukrainian government, at least $1 billion. In the years before his fall, Mr. Manafort took lavish payments to burnish the image of Mr. Yanukovych and the Party of Regions in Washington, even as the party acknowledged only very modest spending.Handwritten ledgers that surfaced last year indicated that the party had actually spent about $2 billion over the past decade or so, much or most of it illegally. Some outlays like payments to an election official possibly amounted to criminal bribery.Mr. Manafort has not been charged with breaking any laws regarding the reporting of income derived from his efforts on behalf of the party. The disclosures cap lengthy negotiations between Mr. Manafort and officials at the Justice Department, which monitors the activities of Americans who work on behalf of foreign political parties and governments.In a statement, Mr. Manafort\u2019s spokesman, Jason Maloni, suggested that the Party of Regions was accountable for the contradiction between the two disclosures.\u201cAny questions about the reporting obligations of the Party of Regions should be directed to those within the party responsible for such reporting,\u201d he said in a statement. Mr. Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine \u201cwas widely known and the firm was paid only for the work it performed. In fact, just last month Ukraine officials indicated that there is no proof of illicit payments.\u201dThough documents discovered after the 2014 revolution show the party\u2019s coffers were padded with donations from Ukraine\u2019s ultrawealthy steel and natural gas tycoons, it tried to keep up a populist image and declared only a modest, even minuscule, annual budget.\u201cIt means either Manafort is lying, or the Party of Regions was lying,\u201d Serhiy Leshchenko, an investigative journalist and a member of Parliament who has been critical of Mr. Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine, said in an interview.A Ukrainian investigation of this discrepancy is not likely. The Party of Regions is now disbanded, and prosecutors are looking into far more serious crimes than campaign finance filing errors.Moreover, at the time the party made its declarations, filing a false campaign finance report was considered an administrative offense akin to a parking ticket and punishable by no more than a fine of a few hundred dollars, said Ostap Kuchma, a party finance analyst at the anticorruption group Chesno.Anticorruption officials in Ukraine assert that the payments were part of an illegal off-the-books system. Mr. Manafort, who resigned from his campaign post shortly after the article appeared, has denied receiving any cash, and state prosecutors in Ukraine have not accused him of wrongdoing.Ukraine\u2019s chief anticorruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, reiterated that assessment last month, telling Ukrainian television that ledger entries provided no proof of Mr. Manafort\u2019s having receiving illegal payments.But the investigation into the accounting book, including the entries mentioning Mr. Manafort, is still open, and recently shifted from one branch of the prosecutor\u2019s office to another, Serhiy Gorbatyuk, the prosecutor in charge of the case, said in an interview.\u201cThe Party of Regions was spending a lot of cash, to bribe voters and for illegal advertising,\u201d Daria M. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, said in an interview. \u201cManafort took the money to whitewash its reputation in the West.\u201dIuliia Mendel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Queens High-Rises to Have Industrial Space Downstairs", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA developer is proposing a project in Long Island City, Queens, that will offer something that has long been a no-no in New York: factories and apartments on the same site.On June 27, after a selection process that stretched more than a year, New York officials chose a team led by TF Cornerstone to undertake the two-building complex, to rise on more than four acres of city-owned land that now has parking lots, a road-repair facility and a shuttered restaurant that played a role in a federal investigation.The 1.5-million-square-foot project, which will also add offices, stores, a public school and a park to an East River area called Anable Basin, still requires a zoning-change approval, a public process that could take two years.\u201cThis has something for everyone,\u201d said Jeremy Shell, a principal of TF Cornerstone, which has three development partners: BJH Advisors, a real estate finance firm, and two nonprofits, the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, an industrial landlord, and the Coalition for Queens, a developer focused on technology companies.\u201cThe types of commercial uses will be complementary,\u201d Mr. Shell added. \u201cThey won\u2019t create issues. They will create a very dynamic neighborhood.\u201dBut the new towers, which will taper as they rise, are intended to be more graceful than what\u2019s popped up along much of the river in the past decade, said Alicia Glen, New York\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development.For years, housing and factories were kept far apart, which was especially important when the factories were polluters. But as industries have cleaned up their acts, that kind of restrictive zoning no longer makes as much sense, she said.Also, if successful, the Anable Basin project could disprove the notion that luxury housing hurts industrial neighborhoods because it eats up land that could be used for factories, Ms. Glen added.\u201cAll of the battles over rezoning pitted jobs versus housing, which is something we need to get beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope this can change the conversation in a more positive way.\u201dMs. Glen added that of the nine development proposals received in May 2016 by the city\u2019s Economic Development corporation, which handled the selection process, TF Cornerstone\u2019s stood out for having so many nonresidential uses.While details about layouts and amenities are still being hashed out for a project that\u2019s not expected to open until 2022, the apartments will be studios to three-bedrooms. Twenty-five percent of the units will be below market rate.Currently, market-rate one-bedrooms in Long Island City rent for an average of $2,814 a month, according to a June market report from the brokerage MNS.As for industrial tenants, they will pay about $3,700 to $9,000 a month, said Brian T. Coleman, the chief executive of the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, which will own and manage 50,000 square feet of the manufacturing space. The rent is below average for the area, in keeping with Greenpoint\u2019s mission, Mr. Coleman added.Also at Anable Basin will be 400,000 square feet of offices, 19,000 square feet of stores, an 80,000-square-foot elementary school and a one-acre waterside park with an esplanade that wraps around and connects to an existing public pier.The two-story barge-supported restaurant, whose lease expired in May, will be razed and replaced with a similar business under TF Cornerstone\u2019s proposal. \u201cThe details of that are not fully resolved yet,\u201d Mr. Shell said, \u201cbut our intent is to reintroduce a waterfront restaurant, generally in that location.\u201dRecouping investments for projects with so much commercial space can be challenging, since industrial rents are usually far cheaper than residential ones, \u201cand over time, the differential just grows and grows and grows,\u201d said Adam Friedman, the executive director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a Brooklyn-based research group.This can pressure landlords to convert industrial space to higher-paying uses, Mr. Friedman added. But since the developers will lease the land from the city and not buy it outright \u2014 a lower-cost proposition \u2014 the deal may pencil out more favorably, he said. That the project will receive abated property taxes and other tax exemptions will also help, he said.Mr. Friedman said he liked the idea of a return to the old days, when craftsmen often lived where they worked. \u201cThis is the way cities were always built,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Tries to Make Hacking a Profit Center", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea\u2019s state-sponsored hackers are increasingly going after money rather than secrets, according to a report published on Thursday by a South Korean government-backed institute.That kind of attack is still occurring, but in the last few years, North Korean hackers seem to have become more interested in stealing cash, the Financial Security Institute said in its report on Thursday.North Korea is isolated, impoverished and desperately short of foreign currency to pay for imports. Even so, it has trained a large army of hackers, originally as an inexpensive means of espionage, sabotage and propaganda, but now also as a moneymaker.The Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has identified a hacking group called Bluenoroff that it says is to blame for attacks on foreign financial institutions, like those in Poland and Bangladesh. Bluenoroff is said to be an offshoot of Lazarus, the North Korea-linked hacking group implicated in earlier attacks.The new report identified another Lazarus spinoff, which it named Andariel, and said that group was responsible for at least seven hacking attacks on banks, defense contractors and other businesses in South Korea over the last two years. (The names Lazarus and Andariel apparently refer to characters in a video game called Diablo.)\u201dBluenoroff and Andariel share their common root,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Bluenoroff has attacked financial firms around the world, Andariel focuses on businesses and government agencies in South Korea using methods tailored for the country.\u201dThe report said the Andariel group had increasingly shifted from destructive attacks on computer networks to crimes like stealing bank-card data and using it to draw cash from bank customers\u2019 accounts or selling the data on the black market. The group also used malware to cheat at online poker and on other gambling websites.\u201cAndariel is believed to focus on earning hard currency,\u201d the report said.The Financial Security Institute, which is financed by the South Korean government, cautioned that the report was partly conjectural and did not represent an official view.North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy and allows only a tiny portion of its population to have access to the internet, has been building up its cyberattack capabilities since the early 1990s, selecting teenagers and teaching them to be hackers, according to South Korean officials and defectors from the North. South Korean cybersecurity officials began detecting attacks attributed to North Korean hackers around 2009.North Korea is now believed to have 1,700 state-sponsored hackers, aided by more than 5,000 supervisors, trainers and other support staff, South Korean officials estimate. The hackers typically do their work abroad, taking legitimate software programming or other jobs in China, Southeast Asia or Europe and waiting for instructions from Pyongyang to mount an assault, they said.Going abroad is a rare privilege for North Koreans, and those who are allowed to work outside the country are required to send the government a quota of foreign currency every year, according to North Korean defectors.North Korea has been accused of illicit moneymaking schemes to pay for its huge military, its nuclear weapons program and its leaders\u2019 luxurious lifestyle, including gunrunning, drug trafficking and counterfeiting. As the United Nations has tightened sanctions and made those avenues more difficult, cyberattacks have loomed larger as a source of cash. Some hacking experts suspect North Korean involvement in the recent wave of global ransomware attacks.North Korea has denied any involvement in hacking attacks, accusing South Korea and the United States of slander.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going to a New Jersey State Park or Beach? Not This Holiday Weekend", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAND BEACH STATE PARK, N.J. \u2014 This spot is usually a choke point for shore traffic, not a U-turn. Yet roughly every 10 minutes on Saturday morning, a new vehicle approached the entrance to the beach here \u2014 some packed with beach chairs, beach balls, fishing rods and anticipation \u2014 only to be met by two police cars and a barricade.A single yellow sign stapled to a makeshift but unyielding blockade read: \u201cThese facilities are closed until further notice.\u201dThat sunny anticipation quickly turned to frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Eric Cowling, 28, who had come from Philadelphia with his girlfriend to fish, lounge and possibly camp in their truck on the beach. He said he understood the wrangling over the state budget, but said that closing the beaches and waterways on a holiday weekend was infuriating \u201cfor the fisherman and everyone else who wants to get out there and do what they like to do.\u201dThe shutdown stems from a brinkmanship between Mr. Christie, who is a Republican, and Vincent Prieto, the speaker of the State Assembly and a Democrat. Mr. Christie is demanding that the $34.7 billion state budget include a provision requiring that Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield spend some of its reserve fund on public health initiatives \u2014 particularly the governor\u2019s drug treatment initiative. Absent that provision, Mr. Christie has threatened to veto any budget that lawmakers send him.\u201cThis Facility is CLOSED Because of This Man,\u201d the signs read, listing a telephone number for Mr. Prieto\u2019s office. Similar signs were spotted at other closed locales, including Island Beach State Park.The signs were authorized and made by Mr. Christie\u2019s office, which called them \u201cofficial government advice.\u201d\u201cThis is embarrassing, and it\u2019s pointless,\u201d Mr. Christie said of the government shutdown during a news conference on Saturday, accusing Mr. Prieto of a \u201ctemper tantrum.\u201dAs gridlock in Washington manifests itself daily, almost as a way of life, statehouses are locked in their own budget impasses. The tough talk and refusals to compromise could hamper government operations in states across the country.At least nine states failed to reach budget deals by late Friday before the start of their July 1 fiscal year, experts at the National Conference of State Legislatures said, though many states have provisions that allow operations to continue so the consequences will not be felt immediately by residents.Not so in New Jersey, where the state\u2019s Constitution requires the government to suspend spending aside from public safety and emergency services if a balanced budget is not in place by the start of the fiscal year.Illinois on Saturday entered an unprecedented third year with no full state budget, as lawmakers continued meeting in Springfield. Residents were no longer able to buy tickets for two multistate lotteries, and at least one credit rating agency warned that the state\u2019s rating could be lowered to junk, below any other state.In Maine, the state government shut down on Saturday after a budget impasse between Gov. Paul R. LePage, a Republican, and lawmakers from both major parties stretched beyond the midnight deadline.Mr. LePage said he would not sign a budget that included tax increases but did not lower the income tax, which has been a longtime goal of his. A compromise budget gained the support of Senate Republicans and House Democrats \u2014 who agreed to repeal a voter-approved tax on the state\u2019s highest earners to finance education \u2014 but it did not get enough support from House Republicans, many of whom are closely aligned with Mr. LePage.Mr. Christie is in the final months of his second term in office and was barred by term limits from running again for governor.At Island Beach State Park, some would-be visitors turned around and headed home, while others walked a few blocks and paid the $8 badge fee.But some were not even granted beach access, like a family from Philadelphia who had brought their dog \u2014 2-year-old Andy, a white-haired Maltese-Bichon mix \u2014 to the only beach in the area that allows dogs to romp around. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible that they can\u2019t just figure it out,\u201d said Boguslawa Rama, as her three children helped load up a beach wagon and leash Andy. \u201cThey should budget like everyone else.\u201dThe family has been coming here for years, and as they walked away to try an entrance at a public beach just up the road, Ms. Rama expressed her frustration.\u201cWe were just coming for the day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always come to Island Beach. It\u2019s our favorite spot on the shore. I hate this.\u201dAt least one person managed to penetrate the police blockade, though. Early Saturday morning, Henry Walker, a local fisherman who has been casting off the inlet at Island Beach for more than 50 years, said he had seen a vehicle approach the police officers at the barricade.\u201cI\u2019m talking to the park ranger; he\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cA car pulls up, a BMW. He walks up to it, I hear the girl say, \u2018I\u2019m the governor\u2019s daughter.\u2019 He steps back. \u2018O.K., go on in.\u2019\u201dThe governor\u2019s office has a residence in Island Beach State Park, and Mr. Christie confirmed that his family was spending the July Fourth holiday there.Mr. Walker was not pleased.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d he said, before unleashing a stream of unprintable invective.He headed back to linger just outside the police blockade and watch more vehicles pull up in anticipation, only to swing around and head back north.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Hooksett, N.H., and Monica Davey from Chicago.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hidden Subsidy That Helps Pay for Health Insurance", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Republican senators work to fix their troubled health care bill, there is one giant health insurance subsidy no one is talking about.It is bigger than any offered under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 subsidies some Republicans loathe as handouts \u2014 and costs the federal government $250 billion in lost tax revenue every year.The beneficiaries: everyone who gets health insurance through a job, including members of Congress.Much of the bitter debate over how to repeal and replace the law known as Obamacare has focused on cutting Medicaid and subsidies that help low-income people buy insurance.But economists on the left and the right argue that to really rein in health costs, Congress should scale back or eliminate the tax exclusion on what employers pay toward employees\u2019 health insurance premiums. Under current law, those premiums are not subject to the payroll or income taxes that are taken out of employees\u2019 wages, an arrangement that vastly benefits middle- and upper-income people.That one policy tweak could reduce health care spending, stabilize the health insurance market and, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, shrink the federal budget deficit by between $174 billion and $429 billion over a six-year period.Lawmakers briefly pondered the idea this year but quickly abandoned it, recognizing how politically explosive it would be. Still, as Congress seeks to push ahead with major changes to the health system and the tax code, there has been a growing awareness of how long-established tax subsidies \u2014 like the mortgage deduction for homeowners \u2014 have contributed to economic inequality in the United States.Republicans who have been fighting for seven years to repeal the Affordable Care Act argue that the Medicaid expansion has cost too much, that the subsidies for lower-income insurance customers are in some cases handouts. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, likened the expenditures recently to \u201cthe dole.\u201d\u201cThe public wants every dime they can be given,\u201d he told reporters in May as he left a health care meeting to explain the difficulty in cutting those programs. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, once you get them on the dole, they\u2019ll take every dime they can.\u201dThe tax exclusion, though, is also a subsidy, one that disproportionately helps the affluent, who are more likely to receive generous health benefits from an employer and who fall into higher tax brackets, making the tax break worth more.The Affordable Care Act required companies to start reporting the value of employer-sponsored health benefits on W-2 forms (Box 12; Code DD). But most people don\u2019t even realize they get a subsidy typically worth thousands of dollars a year.It costs five times as much as the subsidies the Affordable Care Act set up to help people buy health insurance, which are estimated to total $49 billion this year. And it is far more than the $70 billion the federal government is spending to expand Medicaid under Obamacare this year.But few lawmakers, Republican or Democrat, have ever argued to change the exclusion. The closest Congress came to making the system more progressive \u2014 that is, to make it scale up according to income \u2014 was the so-called Cadillac tax included in the Affordable Care Act.That was supposed to tax the most generous employer benefits to help pay the subsidies in the law, but its effective date got pushed back to 2020. Both the Republican House and Senate health bills shove it back further, so long \u2014 a decade in the Senate bill \u2014 that many analysts say it is unlikely to ever take effect.\u201cThis seems like a natural place to look for revenue to expand coverage,\u201d said Stephen Zuckerman, a senior fellow and co-director of the health policy center at the left-leaning Urban Institute. But, he said, \u201cIt becomes a political problem.\u201dBusiness groups, which tend to back Republicans, argue that a cut in the tax exclusion is a tax increase; labor unions, which tend to support Democrats, say it will lead them to lose benefits at the same time their wages have stagnated.\u201cWe don\u2019t think it does the things economists say it\u2019s going to do,\u201d said James Gelfand, senior vice president for health policy for the Erisa Industry Committee, which lobbies for large employers. \u201cUltimately these proposals are designed to end the employer-sponsored system,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not indexed to reality.\u201dThe benefit began with the wage controls of World War II. Employers got around those limits by offering more generous health benefits, and the Internal Revenue Service and later Congress said those benefits did not have to be taxed.Employer-based health insurance now covers more than half the non-elderly population in the United States. The average premium in 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, was $6,435 for an individual and $18,142 for a family, and the tax exclusion reduced the cost of insurance by about 30 percent.Even economists who dislike the exclusion recognize its benefit: It pools risk, the way some countries have done with national health insurance, and reduces adverse selection by encouraging the healthy to buy insurance.But economists also argue that the exclusion creates perverse incentives that drive up the cost of coverage. Studies have found it encourages workers to buy more expensive insurance and to use more medical services than they need.\u201cBecause we have invented a system where most people have extremely generous coverage, no one asks about the price, and no one tells them what the price is,\u201d said Joseph Antos, an economist and scholar in health care policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.Every year the Congressional Budget Office analyzes options for reducing the deficit, including reductions in the tax exclusions for employer-provided health insurance.It would also cause four million fewer people to have employer-based health insurance, the analysis found. Half of those people would go to health insurance exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act, fewer than 500,000 would enroll in Medicaid, and one million would remain uninsured.Subjecting premiums at the 75th percentile or higher to payroll and income taxes beginning in 2020 \u2014 premiums higher than $9,520 for an individual and $23,860 for a family \u2014 would reduce the deficit by $174 billion by 2026, the C.B.O. found.Economists bet that employers would pay less for health insurance and pass on that savings in the form of higher wages. But business groups and business owners say that is unlikely.Particularly in high-cost states, employers say offering a less attractive package of health benefits hurts their ability to hire.\u201cGood employees are the most important resource companies have, and this is part of the landscape that folks expect,\u201d said William McDevitt, a shareholder with Wilkin & Guttenplan, an accounting and consulting firm in New York and New Jersey. \u201cMessing with that matrix to generate revenue, I just see it as anarchy, politically.\u201dEven if companies did increase wages, employees would have to pay higher taxes, leaving them with less money to buy health insurance.\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell every employee they\u2019re going to pay 20 percent more in federal taxes? Is that going to change what they need and their behavior?\u201d asked Bill Grant, the chief financial officer of Cummings Properties in Massachusetts, a real estate firm that spends about $2 million a year to pay about 70 percent of the health insurance premiums for its 350 full-time employees. \u201cAnd if part of that premise is that they are using more than they need, is paying more to Uncle Sam going to change that lifestyle? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kennedy summed up the argument more than half a century ago: \u201cA more prosperous world would also be a more secure world.\u201dPresident Trump isn\u2019t buying.This is bad news from the perspective of poverty reduction and economic development around the globe. The shift in policy also opens another question: To what extent could it destabilize the world and come back to bite the United States?\u201cThe factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency,\u201d Professors Fearon and Laitin wrote. \u201cThese include poverty \u2014 which marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors rebel recruitment \u2014 political instability, rough terrain, and large populations.\u201dThe Trump administration has proposed cutting one-fifth of the funds used for buying antiretroviral drugs for people infected with H.I.V., a program that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives on the continent. It has pulled out of an agreement to help finance efforts by poor nations in Africa and elsewhere to deal with radical climate change.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s \u2018Great National Infrastructure Program\u2019? Stalled", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a candidate, President Trump billed himself as a new breed of think-big Republican, pitching a $1 trillion campaign pledge to reconstruct the nation\u2019s roadways, waterworks and bridges \u2014 along with a promise to revive the lost art of the bipartisan deal.In the White House, Mr. Trump has continued to dangle the possibility of \u201ca great national infrastructure program\u201d that would create \u201cmillions\u201d of new jobs as part of a public-private partnership to rival the public works achievements of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He chastises anyone who forgets to include it near the top of his to-do list, telling one recent visitor to the Oval Office, \u201cDon\u2019t forget about infrastructure!\u201dBut an ambitious public works plan, arguably his best chance of rising above the partisan rancor of his first six months in office, is fast becoming an afterthought \u2014 at precisely the moment Mr. Trump needs a big, unifying issue to rewrite the narrative of his chaotic administration.Infrastructure remains stuck near the rear of the legislative line, according to two dozen administration officials, legislators and labor leaders involved in coming up with a concrete proposal. It awaits the resolution of tough negotiations over the budget, the debt ceiling, a tax overhaul, a new push to toughen immigration laws \u2014 and the enervating slog to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Trump\u2019s team has yet to produce the detailed plan he has promised to deliver \u201cvery soon,\u201d and the president has yet to even name any members to a new board he claimed would green-light big projects.The collapse of his health care overhaul effort seemed to clear one item out of the way. But it also raised serious doubts about the ability of Republicans to pass anything other than regulatory rollbacks or routine spending bills.\u201cThe president would have been better off beginning his agenda with a major infrastructure package,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has been working with the White House on the issue.\u201cIt would give him a win on an important agenda item for him,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cIt would have been better received by Democrats, Congress and, frankly, citizens across the country.\u201dSenator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican leading infrastructure efforts in the Senate, said consideration of a proposal could slip into 2018. \u201cThey\u2019re supposedly going to submit some sort of plan in the fall, so we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Thune told reporters this month. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of waiting on the administration to tell us what it is exactly they want to do.\u201dUnlike the transformative 20th-century efforts the president likes to cite at his rallies, any plan that eventually emerges will not rely exclusively on federal funds. Instead, it will try to use $200 billion in federal spending to attract an additional $800 billion in investment from private investors and local governments over the next 10 years.Its hybrid nature is its greatest virtue. It\u2019s also a drawback. Democrats and centrist Republicans remain skeptical of its limited scope. House conservatives remain hostile toward any big, new federal funding program. As a result, Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers and Republicans on the Hill are uncertain on how to proceed and unsure what is even possible given the party divisions exposed by the Obamacare repeal effort.Gary D. Cohn, chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, along with the president\u2019s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, banked on one possible political workaround: linking the plan to the administration\u2019s push for a tax overhaul. The approach appealed to Mr. Trump.\u201cInfrastructure is in my opinion very popular,\u201d the president said in April. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be bipartisan. And I\u2019m going to use it in another bill. That\u2019s an important bill.\u201dTo get it done, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohn, a lifelong Democrat and a political novice, are open to increasing the federal share well beyond $200 billion, according to officials.Despite his public swagger, Mr. Cohn tends to tread gingerly on sensitive political matters and is reluctant to release details of the administration\u2019s infrastructure proposal, or even a legislative strategy, for fear of having it shot down.\u201cRight now, it doesn\u2019t appear that they have a plan,\u201d said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who is pushing for more federal spending. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t know what his own party wants, and he\u2019s not sure what he wants. He can\u2019t get his own party to pony up the money for infrastructure.\u201dA White House spokeswoman, Natalie Strom, said the timetable for releasing a proposal was the same as it had always been: late summer or early fall. Mr. Cohn\u2019s team is carefully weighing options and seeking advice from dozens of financial experts, construction executives, legislators and local officials, she said.\u201cOur work on infrastructure is continuing to move as planned,\u201d Ms. Strom wrote in an email this past week. \u201cRebuilding our nation\u2019s infrastructure has always been a major priority for the president and his team remains on track to do that.\u201dMr. Trump plans to name members of the infrastructure panel in the coming weeks. But contrary to what he told The Wall Street Journal this year, the committee won\u2019t have the authority to approve or reject projects, according to an administration official. Instead it will serve in a broader advisory capacity.\u201cWe are working with local governments, federal agencies and our partners on the Hill to finalize a common-sense plan that will receive overwhelming public support and bipartisan majorities in Congress,\u201d Mr. Short said when asked about the status of the plan.But time may be running out, and Mr. Short has privately expressed frustration that the president\u2019s team hasn\u2019t made infrastructure more of a priority, according to a Senate staff member who has spoken with him.Senate Democrats are increasingly unwilling to work with Mr. Trump on anything. Nor is there consensus among Republicans on how to proceed.Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is skeptical of wedding a tax overhaul and infrastructure \u2014 or of any deal that would require him to compromise with Democrats. He has suggested a more modest Republicans-only package. He has also discussed tacking something smaller onto a budget reconciliation bill that requires only 51 Republican votes, according to a person close to the talks.The idea of an all-in-one bill combining tax reform and infrastructure also has internal skeptics. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin shot it down at a meeting with House members recently, arguing that a combined tax and infrastructure bill was \u201ctoo big to pass,\u201d according to notes taken by an attendee.One senior administration aide said Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s position had prompted Mr. Cohn to consider scrapping the idea of melding the two initiatives altogether.There are other impediments.Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, has told associates he opposes any significant expansion of funding in the plan, according to people close to him. Mr. Mulvaney, who led efforts to shut down the government as a congressman from South Carolina, included a 13 percent cut to the Department of Transportation and reductions to other infrastructure-related programs in his draft budget for the coming fiscal year.Mr. Cohn, according to two people who have spoken with him recently, has dismissed Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s budget as a \u201ctotal nonstarter\u201d that no one should take seriously. And while Mr. Mulvaney remains influential with Hill conservatives, Mr. Cohn has the president\u2019s trust. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao recently called him \u201cthe big dog\u201d on taxes and infrastructure.So far he hasn\u2019t growled. A White House official directly involved in the process said Mr. Cohn\u2019s team was hashing out a \u201cdeclaration of legislative principles\u201d but would most likely leave much of the bill drafting to House and Senate Republicans.Still, the broad outlines are slowly coming into focus. The plan would include \u201cmassive permit reform\u201d to cut approval times on major projects to two years or less, from 10; loans and grants to improve rural infrastructure; and funding for \u201ctransformative projects,\u201d like broadband and power grid improvements. In addition, the effort would include bolstering existing programs funded through the Finance and Innovation Act and new \u201cincentives\u201d to encourage states and localities to bankroll their own projects, officials said.For his part, Mr. Trump is most concerned about being able to tell voters his plan hit the $1 trillion mark \u2014 raising concerns that the administration will simply include previously scheduled local projects in its overall tally to claim victory.The president \u2014 echoing his ill-received remarks about repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has told people around him that he did not expect the process to be this difficult, according to one longtime adviser.The one thing that is not in dispute is the monumental need to do something. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $4.6 trillion is needed to fix crumbling highways, bridges, transit systems and waterworks, and to build out the nation\u2019s power grid and broadband networks.Tom Naratil, the Americas president for UBS and an advocate of public-private partnerships, said: \u201cFrom our investor surveys, and in other places, you can see that infrastructure is a unifying, not a dividing, issue. The demand is there.\u201dBut lawmakers from states with rural populations are concerned that local governments will have to collect tolls or raise fees to bankroll projects that are not profitable enough to attract big investors. \u201cMy concern is, that works very well for large urban states, but it\u2019s not really feasible for rural states like Maine, where you simply can\u2019t generate the same kind of revenue,\u201d Senator Collins said.Many members of Mr. McConnell\u2019s conference, including conservative stalwarts like Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, have privately pushed for more federal money.Sean McGarvey, president of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, said he thought the administration needed to make \u201ca very, very sizable public investment\u201d for the plan to succeed. Mr. McGarvey, one of the few labor leaders close to the White House, said his union would like to see \u201ca detailed proposal that can make it through committee, and be voted on through regular order by the end of the year.\u201dIn the absence of a concrete proposal to sell, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff has focused on what it can control \u2014 cutting regulations and harvesting \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d to show some progress, in the words of one administration official.But even that hasn\u2019t gone according to plan. A big-splash proposal to privatize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, borrowed from House Republicans, has faced tougher-than-expected opposition.During a White House \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d in June that was overshadowed by the testimony of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, on Capitol Hill, aides raided the Republican policy cupboard for news-release-ready projects. Mr. Trump ended the week with what seemed like a genuinely new, if modest, proposal: a plan to create a council to streamline federal permitting coupled with an online \u201cdashboard\u201d to track federal projects.One problem. A similar law was passed in 2015. The two senators who introduced the legislation \u2014 Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, and Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican \u2014 felt blindsided.\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you work in a bipartisan way to accomplish something meaningful and then the president announces it as if it was new, like it was something he was creating,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said.But Mr. Trump needed something substantive to prove he was making progress, according to White House aides.Someone simply forgot to give the two senators a heads-up \u2014 and the president veered off script to make the project seem as if it were his idea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Searching for Amelia Earhart", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEighty years ago this month, the American aviator Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared while trying to find tiny Howland Island, a dot in the Pacific Ocean. They had radioed that their twin-engine Lockheed Electra was running short on fuel.Generations of Americans have been trying to find her ever since. It is hard to overstate her celebrity when she vanished. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the first pilot to cross on her own from Hawaii to San Francisco. In her latest adventure, she was trying to become the first woman to circumnavigate the planet at the Equator.In the early years of commercial aviation, with many frontiers still to be conquered, her exploits pointed the way to the future. And not just in aviation. She was a woman making her considerable mark in a man\u2019s world. Now she is in the news again.This theory has popped up from time to time over the years. The idea was originally proposed and investigated by Fred Goerner, a CBS radio journalist, who headed several expeditions to the island of Saipan in the 1960s to track down the truth. He was sure Earhart and Noonan had been captured by the Japanese and taken to Saipan. He uncovered no concrete evidence to support his theory but remained convinced that he was right.There are other reasons to discount his theory, principally, that in 1937 the United States and Japan were not at war and Japan had not yet begun to fortify the islands. It had nothing to hide.The claim was again thoroughly investigated in 1981 by the journalist Fukiko Aoki, who concluded it was baseless. She interviewed a crew member of the Koshu Maru, one of two Japanese ships in the area where Earhart is thought to have crashed. The ship had received orders to search for the plane but found nothing. Aoki also read the ship\u2019s log, which made no mention of Earhart.Based on my research as an Earhart biographer, I believe the best guess about what happened is that her plane ran out of gas, lost altitude, hit the water in a way that Earhart and Noonan could not survive and sank in an area where the Pacific is 16,000 feet deep.In 2009, Ted Waitt, a wealthy co-founder of a computer company, financed a search of the ocean floor on the west side of Howland Island using autonomous underwater roving vehicles. The vehicles picked out pieces of metal resting on the ocean floor, including a 55-gallon steel drum. Other expeditions have continued to search the surrounding ocean, without success.Eighty years after she vanished, why does Earhart continue to have such a hold on our imaginations? Because she died at the height of her fame, unsullied. At the dawn of the air age, she and her fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh were the faces of American exceptionalism.Walter Trumbull, a newspaper columnist at the time, put it well: \u201cSo now Charles Lindbergh and you are the only two who have ever flown the ocean alone and the championship, as John L. Sullivan would say, remains in America.\u201d In Britain, The Sunday Express said, \u201cHer glory sheds luster on all womanhood.\u201dEarhart\u2019s last flight was front-page news at the time. She sent chronicles of her circumnavigation to The New York Herald Tribune. By July 2, 1937, Earhart had completed nearly two-thirds of the journey when she and Noonan disappeared.If they were captured by the Japanese, it would mean that her piloting skills had saved them in a crash landing and reaffirm her image as the Wonder Woman of the day. The same could be said of a landing on Nikumaroro.Of course, mysteries are alluring and perhaps none more so than those of explorers who seem to simply vanish, without explanation. But whatever happened 80 years ago will do nothing to diminish Earhart\u2019s legacy as a pioneering aviator and woman unafraid to breach the constraints of her time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Escaping Big Pharma\u2019s Pricing With Patent-Free Drugs", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesSanofi will be free to charge the United States American health care providers and patients any price it wishes. Although American tax dollars funded the vaccine, and the United States took the economic risks, history suggests that many Americans would not be able to afford it.But there\u2019s one drug company that behaves differently.When Bernard P\u00e9coul was a young physician working for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res/Doctors Without Borders in the 1980s and 1990s, the only available treatment for Human African Trypanosomiasis, better known as sleeping sickness, horrified him.The protocol called for multiple, extremely painful, injections of melarsoprol, an arsenic-based compound. People in the Democratic Republic of Congo called it \u201cfire in the veins.\u201d Children who received it had to first be forcibly restrained. The treatment was so toxic that it caused fatal brain swelling in 5 percent of the patients, and it didn\u2019t work for a third of those who survived it. But sleeping sickness is fatal if not treated, so there was no choice.What outraged P\u00e9coul, who is French, was that melarsoprol had been around since 1949, and nothing better had been developed since. To the physicians at Doctors Without Borders, it was just one example of the lack of effective remedies for the diseases of the poor. \u201cWe were well aware of the difference between the quality of treatment we were providing and the care that was available to patients in high-income countries,\u201d P\u00e9coul said.P\u00e9coul and Doctors Without Borders decided to tackle the diseases that were killing the global poor. Doctors Without Borders dedicated its 1999 Nobel Peace Prize award money to providing seed funding for the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative, known as D.N.D.I. The aim was to see what could be accomplished when research priorities ignore questions of profitability, and the price of medicines is \u201cdelinked\u201d from research costs, which are instead shouldered by public financing or philanthropy.An immediate challenge was that D.N.D.I. possessed none of the required hardware for the expensive drug research and development process: It had no labs, no manufacturing facilities, and no distribution process. It fell to P\u00e9coul to recruit partners, including private pharmaceutical companies he persuaded to share drug compounds that had been uncovered but abandoned because of lack of profitability. Government and grant funding allowed D.N.D.I. to pay existing labs to test promising drug candidates and facilities to manufacture the end results. D.N.D.I. itself took on the difficult task of conducting clinical trials in the rugged, remote areas where neglected disease are most deadly. P\u00e9coul says the multi-partner approach is akin to being the \u201cconductor of a virtual orchestra.\u201dD.N.D.I. has already delivered seven new patent-free, low-cost treatments for neglected diseases. A partnership with Sanofi (yes, the same company) led to the distribution of a fast-release oral antimalarial treatment to nearly 500 million adults and children, at a cost of less than a dollar per patient. Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Bompart, vice president for access to medicines at Sanofi, said that P\u00e9coul was not shy about insisting that the company had a moral obligation to make its products widely available. \u201cBernard is able to combine the role of a sometimes aggressive challenger with a personal style that is likable,\u201d Bompart says. \u201cHe is offended by situations that are unfair, but he has established D.N.D.I. as a credible partner with the private sector.\u201dAnd it develops new drugs; the more than 30 projects in its current pipeline include 15 entirely new chemical entities.Another way D.N.D.I. is different is that it makes its research available for follow-up studies, adhering to an open-source philosophy that is unusual in patent-focused biomedical circles. It uses the term \u201cpublic goods\u201d to describe its products, harkening back to an era when medicines were widely considered to be off-limits to patenting and the resulting monopoly price markups. As Jonas Salk famously said when asked why he did not seek to patent the polio vaccine, \u201cCould you patent the sun?\u201dP\u00e9coul and his D.N.D.I. colleagues say their biggest challenge now is securing sustainable funding for research \u2014 another illustration of the limits of a model with no profits to invest in research. But the government funds research all the time \u2014 it\u2019s just often turned over to for-profit companies. The Zika vaccine is one example. The prostate cancer drug pacilataxel, the leukemia medicine imatinib and many mental health and H.I.V. medicines and vaccines can all trace their origins to government-funded research \u2014 only to be handed over to industry to charge what they want.\u201cFor-profit pharma has depended upon the National Institutes of Health and other government programs to fund all steps of research and development,\u201d said James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, which is helping to lead the opposition to the Zika vaccine deal. \u201cGovernments should provide more resources and more opportunities for nonprofit companies to bring drugs and vaccines to market.\u201d That way their products would be available and affordable to all.\u201cI would not say we are the only solution, but we do show a different way that can work,\u201d P\u00e9coul said. \u201cWe cannot depend on a for-profit model to address the needs of all patients \u2014 that has been well-demonstrated.\u201dFran Quigley directs the Health and Human Rights Clinic at Indiana University McKinney School of Law.

Mr. Lew\u2019s successor, Steven Mnuchin, has already directed the agencies to start reviewing the measure. A recent Treasury report suggested several amendments, such as excluding venture capital and other investments that promote growth from covered funds that need to be divested. Another proposed change is to impose enhanced compliance on a smaller group of banks that have at least $10 billion in trading assets.The five agencies, though, have yet to agree on the details. Furthermore, approval requires votes by members of the boards or commissions of most of the watchdogs. That means the involvement of about 20 principals when they are at full capacity. That will slow the process.

{"Headline": "A Vietnamese Architect\u2019s Easy-to-Erect Homes for the Poor", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBa Vi JournalBA VI, Vietnam \u2014 Just below a hilltop pagoda, steel frames the size of two-car garages were popping up on a bluff that overlooked a valley of electric-green rice paddies.\u201cLooks like Legos, and it\u2019s easy to install,\u201d said Nguyen Duc Trung, a project supervisor.\u201cMuch easier than building a normal house,\u201d one of the workers, Le Van Dung, said between drags of a cigarette. Far cheaper, too: a small fraction of the $35,000 that he said it would cost to build a home in his northern Vietnamese village.Known as \u201cS Houses,\u201d these prefab structures going up here in Ba Vi, about 30 miles from Vietnam\u2019s capital, Hanoi, are iterations of a prototype that Mr. Nghia has been honing since about 2013. They will serve as the living quarters for a new Buddhist meditation center.But Mr. Nghia says that his plan is to mass-manufacture this portable, easy-to-assemble design for people in slums, remote areas or refugee camps around the world, beginning later this year, all for the starting price \u2014 $1,500 \u2014 of about two iPhones.Mr. Nghia, 40, said that the S House was designed to last at least 30 years and to withstand severe tropical storms like the ones his \u201csuper poor\u201d family once experienced in their central Vietnamese farming village. \u201cThat\u2019s really important,\u201d he said. Otherwise, villagers will \u201cspend their lives building houses over and over and over.\u201dMr. Nghia is the latest high-profile architect to design an inexpensive, prefabricated home as an antidote to urban sprawl, mass displacement or natural disasters. Experts say the S House is one of several \u201chumanitarian\u201d or \u201csocial\u201d architecture projects worldwide that highlight a rising social consciousness in the profession at a moment when the estimated number of displaced people worldwide \u2014 65.6 million last year \u2014 is the highest since the aftermath of World War II.Other designs are known for their high-profile sponsors. The Sweden-based Better Shelter project, for instance, partnered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the furniture giant Ikea to mass-produce an emergency shelter with a solar panel, UV-protective roofing and siding, and parts that can be individually replaced.Some critics say, however, that high-profile humanitarian architecture often ignores the complexities of housing policy and finance, as well as local variations in climate, building materials and aesthetic tastes.Chang Jiat Hwee, an assistant professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore and the author of \u201cA Genealogy of Tropical Architecture: Colonial Networks, Nature and Technoscience,\u201d said the notion of using prefabricated dwellings to solve housing problems in the global South was pioneered by Europeans in the 19th century and became especially prevalent in the 1950s. But the projects have tended to fail, then and now, he added, because they took a universalist approach that ignored local particulars.Professor Chang said he wondered if the S House project could avoid the same pitfalls. \u201cVo Trong Nghia is a very good architect and his firm has designed some really nice single-family houses,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think designing a prototype for mass housing presents an entirely different set of challenges.\u201dPham Thuy Loan, the vice president of the Vietnam National Institute of Architecture, said it might not be practical to sell S Houses across much of northern Vietnam because people there would see a steel-frame design as too radical a departure from a traditional concrete one. They could perhaps imagine Mr. Nghia\u2019s creation as \u201csomeone else\u2019s house,\u201d she said, but not their own.But people in rural areas of southern Vietnam might be amenable because some there are less committed to traditional aesthetics, Ms. Loan added. The S House could also potentially serve as temporary housing, she said, for rural migrants who work in industrial zones near Hanoi.Mr. Nghia said the S House would fit many different environments, in part because its $1,500 frame can be purchased alone and clad in whatever local materials are available. A full package would cost between $2,000 and $3,000 and include steel-lattice walls and a corrugated roof.The S House is suitable for remote areas because no single component weighs more than 110 pounds, he said, and its design could also be modified to suit local conditions \u2014 higher ceilings for hotter climates, for example, or bigger units for communities with larger families.Mr. Nghia said that he planned to scale up production to meet whatever demand materializes, either from individuals or institutions, and that he would offer to sell S Houses to the United Nations, at cost, as refugee shelters.

It pledges to combat the poisonous ideology of radical Islam, but also to fight those who would seek to divide French citizens into \u201ccategories of populations and territories that are hostile to each other.\u201dDespite Mr. Macron\u2019s national victory, and the strong showing in Seine-Saint-Denis of the far-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and his France Unbowed party in the legislative elections that followed the presidential vote, the biggest winner of all was voter abstention \u2014 as high as 70 percent in some towns \u2014 testimony to the political indifference of citizens who have seen too many governments, on the right and on the left, make promises to improve their lives, only to break them.For many of those that I spoke with in Seine-Saint-Denis, even those willing to give the new president a chance, Mr. Macron is tainted by having participated as finance minister in the government of former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Mr. Hollande\u2019s election in 2012 owed much to a strong vote from the banlieues, but his failure to fulfill campaign promises to rein in police abuse and extend the franchise to noncitizen residents (not to mention the rising poverty in some banlieues) tarnished his presidency, and, with it, Mr. Macron.The head of Bondy Blog, Nassira El Moaddem, said that what she hears in the banlieues is that \u201csalvation will not come from politicians, it will come from us,\u201d adding that the \u201csocial links\u201d created by the festival would have a positive outcome. Laetitia Nonone, the daughter of a policeman who founded the group Zonzon 93 to combat youth delinquency in 2008 after her brother was incarcerated, and who participated in the discussion on preventing police violence, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about incriminating the police, it\u2019s about finding solutions. When a young victim of incest is afraid to go to the police, that\u2019s a problem we all must solve.

Whether or not he delivers, the festival demonstrated that a movement is underway to empower citizens to do for themselves what the French state has for too long failed to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Birth of the Modern Middle East", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the closing months of the 18th century a young Egyptian, Hassan al-Attar, plucked up the courage to visit the Institute of Egypt, staffed by a battery of eminent French specialists in various branches of science and linguistics. The institute had been recently established by Napoleon, following his victory over the Egyptian Army in a battle lasting less than an hour, and although it stood in a salubrious garden district of Cairo, Attar was nervous because he had heard of drunken fights in the area, where the French were billeted.No doubt his mentor, a sheikh who had been invited to the institute along with other Egyptian bigwigs the previous year, had sought to put the young man off. As Christopher de Ballaigue relates in \u201cThe Islamic Enlightenment,\u201d his fascinating and elegantly written account of the impact of modernity on the Islamic world, Abdulrahman al-Jabarti had come away from his encounter with the savants struggling even to formulate a response to ideas like majority voting, judicial process and scientific experimentation or indeed to a copy of the Quran translated into French. In the end, he had condemned much of it, ignored some of it and admired very little. In Jabarti\u2019s world, the purpose of schooling was to learn the Quran by heart, restating the orthodox Muslim position that God alone was the cause of all earthly phenomena, knowledge was finite and revelation, not reason, was the surest guide to living.Hassan al-Attar, though, was disarmed by the enthusiasm of the French savants. Introduced to a young scholar who discussed literature with him in faultless Arabic, he left dazzled and inspired by the Frenchman\u2019s love of learning, his breadth of reference, his knowledge of the literature and traditions of another culture \u2014 and, on subsequent visits, by the scientific, astronomical and engineering apparatus he was shown. Attar\u2019s admiration would lead to one of the first of many attempts to reconcile Islamic teaching with Western enlightenment values.Napoleon\u2019s short-lived occupation opened the way to a new Egyptian ruler, an Albanian adventurer, to begin a radical reform of the Egyptian state. It was abundantly clear to Muhammad Ali that Western know-how, trade and finance were the keys to power in the modern world, and like Henry VIII he confiscated lands set aside in pious foundations. He also introduced commercial tribunals, a public health office, telegraph offices, canals and cotton factories. Alexandria became a great port where a Russian observed every day \u201csome fresh innovation in the European style destined for the improvement of the city or for public utility.\u201d Yet perhaps 20,000 men, women and children died in the digging of one canal in 1819. Not for the first time, Western advances did not bestow equal benefits.De Bellaigue, a journalist and author, focuses on three Islamic cities in the first half of the book \u2014 Cairo, Istanbul and Tehran. In each, the rulers attempted to adopt elements of Western modernity. Egypt\u2019s nominal suzerains, the Ottoman sultans, had in fact begun reforms before the period covered by this book, but progress was slower in a sprawling multifaith empire in which there were many more interest groups to reconcile than in Egypt alone. In Istanbul, the sultan succeeded in using French military advisers to reform the army and destroy the reactionary Janissaries. The introduction in 1836 of quarantine and other preventive measures against plague, which had hitherto been treated with fatalism, changed people\u2019s life expectancy, and saw plague eradicated by the 1850s.\u201cThe Islamic Enlightenment\u201d introduces us to a fascinating gallery of individuals who would grapple with reform and modernization in theory and practice over the next two centuries. Efficient guns, training in modern drill, factories, machines and bank loans were tools for the entry of Muslim states into the modern world, but they were not value-free. Rising levels of literacy, with the introduction of printing, allowed a press to flourish, in the European mold \u2014 but rulers in Istanbul found the means to control them could also be imported. The first censorship law was based on similar edicts issued by Napoleon III.The growing complexity and interdependence of society and economies changed the way government was viewed, and the development of a literate bourgeoisie created people who thought about such things, focusing attention on the need for constitutions. That they often fared badly was hardly a surprise \u2014 by the time the Ottoman sultan agreed to grant a constitution in 1876, France had already run through 12 of its own.Reactions were further complicated by the persistent pressure of the West on the resources of the Islamic world. Autocrats saddled their countries with profligate loans. The shah of Iran actually sold the resources of his country to Baron Reuter in 1872, an act of such egregious self-interest that it was undone by popular demand and international outcry, while the Ottomans were humiliated by the imposition of a foreign-staffed debt administration and the British occupied Egypt, effectively on behalf of European bondholders, in 1882. There were plenty of people in the Islamic East who could read Darwin and conclude, like the Egyptian feminist Qasim Amin, that natural selection impelled Europeans \u201cpowered by steam and electricity, to seize the wealth of any country weaker than them.\u201d And while many others felt that their values \u2014 Islamic values \u2014 were threatened by the soullessness of the machine age, a multifaceted and slippery Sunni cleric, Jamal al-Din Afghani, was able to articulate some Muslim responses to modernity in ways that were distinctly modern, involving wreaths of cigar smoke, opera seats, international travel and a bulletin for the doctrine of Pan-Islamism called Firmest Bond, which was sent out, like an email newsletter, free of charge to every influential ruler or opinion maker in the Middle East. Islam, Jamal said, required its Luther.One candidate for the role might have been the Egyptian Muhammad Abduh, who proposed a return to attitudes from the time of the salaf, the ancestors \u2014 not, as the term is used today to describe salafism, a fundamentalist religious outlook that denies the importance of reason, but as a creative moment in which, in Abduh\u2019s view, any educated Muslim with the Quran could think out his position for himself. Abduh, like Attar a century before, was swept aside by a concert of vilification.Inherent contradictions and weaknesses, allied with competing international developments, persistently favored modernization imposed from above. Both Turkey and Iran, after World War I, cleaved to narratives of militant nationalism, with varying degrees of success. It became increasingly possible to ignore Islam entirely, following, as de Bellaigue puts it, \u201ca worldview that had formed around Max Weber\u2019s idea of humankind moving away from the \u2018great enchanted garden\u2019 of traditional belief and culture.\u201d As he says, the two ideologies competing for support in the postwar Muslim world, capitalism and Communism, were agreed on one thing: the utter obsolescence of religion in public life.A book like this can only point to the sheer complexity of Muslim identities, loyalties and accommodations in the modern world, both among the hundreds of millions who lead lives of varying degrees of quiet and the troubled few. Far from spurning or avoiding modernity, Muslims are \u201cdrenched in it,\u201d as de Bellaigue points out, and in tracking the sinews of enlightenment through the last two centuries of Islamic thinking, this brilliant and lively history deserves nothing but praise.Jason Goodwin is the author of the Yashim Ottoman detective series and \u201cLords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama\u2019s Special Senate Election Is All About Wooing Trump", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The special election for a Senate seat in Alabama is, at first glance, a complex affair, with 10 Republican candidates in the party\u2019s primary, at least three of whom could plausibly win, and a possible runoff this fall if nobody can garner a majority when ballots are cast Aug. 15.But under closer examination, the contest may boil down to a single question: How will President Trump respond to the candidate who denounced him for \u201cserial adultery\u201d?The campaign for the Senate seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions is ostensibly playing out between Muscle Shoals and Mobile Bay. But the battle is being waged just as fiercely inside the White House, where Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement could determine who will serve as the state\u2019s junior senator for the next three years.The Republican race has pitted the current, appointed senator, Luther Strange, against Representative Mo Brooks, a conservative firebrand whose brash, anti-immigrant, pro-gun politics are distinctly Trumpian \u2014 save that \u201cserial adultery\u201d jab.That has created tensions between Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who strongly backs Mr. Strange, and the West Wing, where some sympathies lie with Mr. Brooks. What Mr. Trump does will beam a message to his supporters well beyond Alabama about which Republican faction he favors: the pragmatic establishment or uncompromising hard-liners.And in Alabama, Mr. Trump\u2019s preference matters. He may be saddled with national disapproval ratings that no modern president has seen this early in an administration, but among Alabama conservatives, the president ranks up there with college football, air-conditioning and pork shoulder.\u201cInside a Republican primary, the only person who may potentially be more popular is Nick Saban,\u201d said Clay Ryan, the chief lobbyist for the University of Alabama system, referring to the all-but-deified head football coach of the Crimson Tide.Allies of Mr. Strange are aggressively lobbying Mr. Trump to intercede, circulating Mr. Brooks\u2019s harsh campaign comments about the president\u2019s bouts of alleged marital infidelity. The president is generally aware of Mr. Brooks\u2019s criticism, lobbed during the 2016 primary when Mr. Brooks backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, according to multiple Republicans inside and beyond the administration. But he has kept his counsel.Mr. Brooks said he had no regrets about his tart criticism.\u201cWhen I endorse a candidate, as I endorsed Ted Cruz, I\u2019m a fighter and I\u2019m all in,\u201d Mr. Brooks said.Where Mr. Trump ends up is anybody\u2019s guess. He has sent positive signals to Mr. Strange, who has spoken to the president directly and accepted every opportunity to go on Fox News and sing Mr. Trump\u2019s praises. But so far the president has declined to offer an endorsement.Mr. Strange\u2019s appointment was made under \u201can ethical cloud,\u201d Mr. Brooks said.The White House\u2019s reluctance stems not so much from the circumstances of Mr. Strange\u2019s ascent but from the forces that are lining up behind Mr. Brooks. The Huntsville-area congressman has collected endorsements from ardent Trump allies in conservative news media circles like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, as well as from fellow members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, who have urged the White House to give Mr. Brooks a clear berth in the race, according to Republicans briefed on the conversations.Mr. Brooks was dismissive of Mr. McConnell\u2019s efforts to shape the race, and said that if he won the Senate seat, he might not support Mr. McConnell as majority leader.The race also has the potential to grow even messier than a head-to-head between Mr. Brooks and Mr. Strange. A third contender, Roy S. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who made his name by refusing to remove the Ten Commandments from the court\u2019s grounds, could upset the contest with the passionate support of religious conservatives.Mr. Trump\u2019s ardent neutrality has spilled over to the Republican National Committee, which is still effectively run by its former chairman, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Mr. McConnell \u2014 who views Mr. Strange as a reliable party-line vote and has led the push for his new colleague \u2014 has repeatedly met resistance from the White House in his effort to shore up Mr. Strange.The Republican National Committee initially did not respond to a request from the Senate Republican campaign arm for funding to back Mr. Strange. That prompted Mr. McConnell\u2019s top political lieutenant, Josh Holmes, and then Mr. McConnell himself to contact the White House.But the committee still did not authorize the funding. Stunned by the rebuff, Mr. McConnell contacted Mr. Trump directly last month, insisting that the White House had to be on the same page as the Senate leadership, people briefed on the conversation said. Mr. Trump responded by calling Mr. Strange to smooth things over, assuring the new senator that he had a friend in the White House.Even then, the Republican National Committee did not sign off on the funding until Mr. McConnell\u2019s intervention with Mr. Priebus was publicly reported by The New York Times last month. But while the party money has finally been addressed, aides to Mr. Trump \u2014 including Mr. Priebus \u2014 believe that it would be a needless risk for Mr. Trump to take sides in a contest where all the candidates describe themselves as strongly pro-Trump.\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a turf war because McConnell thinks he\u2019s head of the party and Trump thinks he\u2019s head of the party,\u201d said David Ferguson, an Alabama Republican strategist. \u201cBut if Trump really wants to take more than a figurehead role in the party, he\u2019s got to flex his muscles in a Republican primary somewhere, somehow.\u201dMr. Strange could use the muscle. Mr. Brooks received a surge of publicity after surviving the shooting on members of Congress last month at a Virginia baseball field, and his profile has grown beyond his congressional district. His rise is alarming Mr. Strange.On Mr. McConnell\u2019s instructions, the Republican Senate campaign committee also has threatened to deny business to any consultants who work against Mr. Strange.That has effectively frozen out other candidates from hiring advisers and fund-raising, said Randy Brinson, an evangelical activist in Alabama who is also running for Senate. Mr. Brinson said he had secured a nationally known pollster, Whit Ayres, to steer his bid, only to get an apologetic email from Mr. Ayres after he backed out.Still, it is Mr. Brooks whose candidacy is seen by the party establishment as the most significant threat. Mr. Strange\u2019s goal is to weaken Mr. Brooks so that if the race goes to a September runoff election, it is more likely to be between Mr. Strange and Mr. Moore. Mr. Strange\u2019s allies believe Mr. Moore would be far easier for Mr. Strange to defeat in a head-to-head race.But before then, the 6-foot-9 lawmaker known as \u201cBig Luther\u201d may ultimately not get the Air Force One visit to Birmingham or the presidential Twitter post that he covets. Quin Hillyer, a conservative commentator based in Alabama, saw no upside for Mr. Trump to back Mr. Strange.\u201cHe would tick off a rather prominent member of the Freedom Caucus in Mo Brooks, and Mo Brooks\u2019s supporters,\u201d Mr. Hillyer said. \u201cHe would tick off all the Roy Moore supporters, who also tend to be strong Trump supporters. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in it for Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind a Chinese Powerhouse, a Web of Family Financial Ties", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Hainan Airlines wanted to expand in the 1990s, its top executives turned to a little-known businessman in his early 30s, who helped the Chinese upstart develop golf courses, resorts and seaside villas.It was the beginning of a lucrative partnership for the businessman, Wang Wei, one that would put him on the path to becoming a billionaire. Over the next two decades, Mr. Wang set up companies that managed properties, as well as supplied computers, software services, seafood and Cuban cigars to Hainan Airlines and its parent company, the HNA Group.What HNA rarely publicly revealed, if ever, is that Mr. Wang is the younger brother of its co-founder and co-chairman, Wang Jian. In the past 25 years, HNA has regularly funneled business to a small group of relatives and associates of the company\u2019s senior executives, dealings with limited disclosure to investors in its listed companies or its overseas bonds, according to a review of thousands of corporate records by The New York Times.HNA is part of a new breed of aggressive Chinese deal makers that have risen, seemingly out of nowhere, into the ranks of the global corporate elite. But the ambitions of these giants have been fueled by debt and masked by opaque ownership structures, creating uncertainty over their corporate governance, strategic motivations and financial health.The situation makes it hard for governments and businesses around the world to understand the forces behind the spending sprees. Companies and regulators could be making decisions without a complete picture of how the conglomerates work, while investors may not know what they are buying.HNA and other big Chinese players like Anbang Insurance Group and Dalian Wanda Group are under pressure at home and abroad, as the authorities and investors worry about the risk these highly indebted companies pose to the broader economy.Untangling the operations of HNA, already complicated by its murky ownership and a complex array of affiliates, is made more difficult by a web of interconnected deals with friends and family members of top executives. The documents reviewed by The Times \u2014 which include annual reports, court filings and corporate registration records in the United States and China \u2014 reveal a systematic pattern of these so-called related-party transactions with friends and family.Wang Wei is tied to more than a dozen companies that do business with HNA. Other relatives and associates of the company\u2019s top executives have scores of ventures that work with HNA.\u201cHNA Group and its portfolio companies work closely with global, independent accounting, financial and legal advisors to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements in relevant jurisdictions, including disclosures with respect to related party transactions,\u201d the conglomerate said in a statement. \u201cRelated party transactions are conducted, reviewed and documented on commercial terms consistent with appropriate standards.\u201dThe lack of transparency among HNA and other conglomerates could amplify concerns in the United States and elsewhere. HNA\u2019s ownership of nearly 10 percent of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, has recently drawn scrutiny from European regulators.The European Central Bank, which supervises commercial banks in the eurozone, is considering opening an inquiry into whether HNA meets the criteria for large bank shareholders, according to two people with knowledge of discussions who were not authorized to speak on the record. If regulators were to determine that HNA is not qualified \u2014 for example, because it is poorly financed \u2014 the company could be forced to sell its stake or be stripped of its voting rights.Regulators around the world closely watch transactions with family and friends to ensure that companies put the interests of investors first. The deals can present potential conflicts if contracts are awarded without a competitive bidding process or if associates profit at the expense of the company and its shareholders.Should HNA have failed to properly report such transactions to banks or investors, it could run afoul of regulators in multiple locales, including China, Europe and the United States. Any regulatory scrutiny over HNA\u2019s business dealings could hamper the conglomerate\u2019s ability to raise new money.\u201cThere are red flags around this type of thing,\u201d said Geoff Peck, a risk management expert at FTI Consulting, a global advisory firm. \u201cI think regulators would take a dim view if it wasn\u2019t disclosed.\u201dHNA\u2019s spectacular growth has catapulted it to the forefront of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands. It promotes itself as a modern enterprise \u2014 transparent, socially responsible and run by executives trained at Harvard.JPMorgan, UBS and PwC declined to comment. A spokesman for the United States Treasury Department, which led the review, said the agency does not comment on the process.HNA\u2019s dealings with family and friends trace back to the company\u2019s founding as Hainan Airlines in 1993.At the time, China was in the midst of an economic overhaul, seeking to transition from a planned economy to one where market forces and private entrepreneurship were encouraged. After Hainan island was designated a special economic zone, local leaders tapped Chen Feng, a government official who had worked with the World Bank, and Wang Jian, who worked at the country\u2019s civil aviation authority, to help start a regional airline.The two men persuaded the local government to establish Hainan Airlines as a joint stock company. A new phenomenon in China, the structure allowed private investors, including the founders and top executives, to own a piece of the state-backed airline. They also persuaded the government to let foreign investors, for the first time, take stakes in a Chinese airline. During a trip to Wall Street, Mr. Chen pitched the carrier to the billionaire George Soros and won a $25 million commitment, a huge credibility boost.\u201cWithin China, it was the only airline allowed to operate like that,\u201d said Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Technology in Sydney. \u201cChen Feng was able to get huge loans from the state banks. So people know there was something special about his deals.\u201dAs the company took off, family and friends of the company\u2019s senior executives began setting up private businesses, positioning themselves to profit from the airline, according to The Times\u2019s review of documents.A woman named Huang Weirong owned a stake in Beijing Business Culture Diffusion Company, which has handled tens of millions of dollars in advertising for Hainan Airlines. A man named Zhang Zhijun controlled Xiangjian Information Technology, which invested alongside HNA and its affiliates in technology and airline information systems.Both individuals had separate ties to HNA executives. The two had each created numerous other companies with the family of Wang Jian, the co-founder and co-chairman.Mr. Wang\u2019s younger brother, Wang Wei, was one of the biggest beneficiaries of HNA\u2019s business.His companies sold equipment and services to Hainan Airlines and helped develop the company\u2019s properties, including West Coast Golf Club in Haikou. He was also a key partner in a large oceanfront property on Hainan island, which today houses high-end villas and a luxurious resort.In the mid-1990s, O\u2019Brien McGarey, president of the Dye Design Group, a prominent golf course design firm in Colorado, said he was hired by Hainan Airlines to assess a large plot near Haikou, with plans to build a golf course and villas. \u201cWe signed a contract with Hainan Airlines and we met with Wang Jian and Wang Wei, his younger brother,\u201d Mr. McGarey said. \u201cWang Wei was titular head and he was running the golf course.\u201dIt is unclear how Wang Wei raised the initial money for his businesses. But along the way, he landed on the list of China\u2019s billionaires.The family of Mr. Chen, HNA\u2019s co-founder and co-chairman, also forged business alliances with the company.When Hainan Airlines first sought to establish a presence in the United States in the 1990s, Mr. Chen\u2019s younger brother, Chen Guoqing, set up Pacific American Corporation in New York. The company purchased aircraft engines and spare parts for the airline\u2019s fleet, which included Airbus 320s, Boeing 737s and Gulfstream jets. Pacific American also helped HNA buy a collection of European hotels and co-invested with HNA in Yangtze River International Leasing Company.Pacific American\u2019s ownership is fuzzy.For years, it has billed itself as a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines or the HNA Group. Chen Guoqing called it a subsidiary in his biography for Asia Society, a nonprofit in New York. Court documents, filed in the United States as part of a 2007 bankruptcy dispute involving Dornier Aviation North America, listed Pacific American as an affiliate of Hainan Airlines.Public filings in Asia do not describe Pacific American the same way. A 2015 bond prospectus, which HNA filed in Singapore, described it as a \u201crelated party\u201d while annual reports filed by Hainan Airlines over 18 years stated that Pacific American was a major supplier. Those filings did not disclose that Pacific American was run by the younger brother of Chen Feng, and more recently, by Chen Feng\u2019s son, Daniel Chen.A spokesman for the HNA Group confirmed that Pacific American is an independent company and is not owned by HNA or any of its affiliates.At least one major investor was in the dark about such deals: Mr. Soros.Hedge funds controlled by Mr. Soros ultimately invested a total of $50 million in Hainan Airlines and an affiliate, Grand China Airways. Early on, an executive on Mr. Soros\u2019s team usually served as a director of Hainan Airlines.But the family ties to suppliers and service providers were never discussed, according to three people with knowledge of the investments. Mr. Soros, who declined to comment, sold his stake in 2011.The close connections also extended to HNA\u2019s acquisition strategy. The company has created hundreds of affiliates, public and private entities that regularly do business with one another \u2014 swapping assets, merging and then restructuring.Over the past seven years, more than 30 acquisitions have involved deals between two companies under the HNA umbrella, deals worth an estimated $20 billion, according to Dealogic. In 2015, Xian Minsheng, an affiliate of HNA, paid $8.6 billion to buy Hainan Supply Sales and Daji, also an affiliate of HNA.This sort of serial deal making has been a driving force behind the rapid growth of HNA, a strategy backed by ever increasing amounts of debt. HNA has more than $100 billion in debt, much of it owed to state-run banks.As HNA and other conglomerates make ever bigger bets, Chinese policy makers, economists and investors are wondering if the debt is sustainable. Shares in several HNA public companies have slumped in recent weeks over debt concerns.HNA\u2019s Mr. Chen has seemed unfazed in the past. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve accumulated so much lice, you no longer feel the itching,\u201d he said in an interview some years ago. \u201cWhen you borrow a lot of money, you have no problem sleeping.\u201dJack Ewing and Michael Forsythe contributed reporting.

But if China truly wants to be a climate leader it needs to address its global climate footprint, not just pollution within its borders.China\u2019s lending in Latin American and Caribbean countries provides a telling example of how the country has outsourced its emissions.In the Brazilian Amazon, China has committed significant funding, through development financing and direct investment by state-run companies, for the Brazilian government\u2019s efforts to construct a new commodities corridor through the Amazon basin, facilitating the expansion of industrial agribusiness into remote, pristine rain forest.This kind of investment in Brazil also empowers the country\u2019s powerful agribusiness lobby, known as the ruralistas. President Michel Temer\u2019s administration has advanced the ruralistas\u2019 goal of dismantling environmental safeguards by essentially providing a rubber stamp for even more dirty energy projects in places like the Amazon.Such concern is well placed. In Nicaragua, Ecuador and Peru, community protests against Chinese operations have led to the killings of local residents, imposition of states of emergency and legal actions against Chinese companies.China should approach its international projects with the same concern for the environment that its starting to show at home. Beijing should refrain from supporting extraction in areas of global ecological importance, and instead heavily invest in clean, renewable energy projects. Civil society groups should keep the pressure on, and developing-country governments should incorporate such guidelines into bilateral agreements and project contracts.Continuing to pursue fossil fuel development is a losing proposition in the face of low oil prices, growing competition from renewables, and the scientific imperative to leave 80 percent of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground to avoid a catastrophic two-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures.A true climate leader would invest in the preservation of areas of global ecological importance rather than destroy them.Paulina Garz\u00f3n is the director of the China Latin-America Sustainable Investments Initiative.

Of the top talent hired or promoted in the past three years, he said, more than 60 percent were women.Mr. Hall said the BBC had set a \u201crough target\u201d that called for 15 percent of its highest paid stars to be of minority backgrounds by 2020; of those hired or promoted in the last few years, nearly 20 percent belong to minorities.Critics were not satisfied.

{"Headline": "U.K.\u2019s New \u00a310 Note Gets a Fresh Face: Jane Austen", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II is the only woman now pictured on currency in England and Wales. That is about to change.The Bank of England on Tuesday unveiled the final design for a 10-pound bank note bearing the likeness of the novelist Jane Austen, timed to mark the 200th anniversary of her death.\u201cThis added strength means notes will remain in good condition for longer, with a life span at least two and a half times that of paper notes,\u201d Mr. Carney said of the \u00a310 note on Tuesday, in a speech at Winchester Cathedral in southern England, where Austen is buried.The roots of the pound date from well before the founding of the Bank of England, or even of the Kingdom of England itself.Historians generally attribute the beginnings of the pound to silver pennies used by the Anglo-Saxons in the eighth century. About 240 of those coins were supposed to be equivalent to a pound of silver, though the weight varied.The first pound coin, however, was introduced only seven centuries later, by Henry VII in 1489, and it bore his likeness.At the time, there was probably no practical need for a currency of such high value. But it served to bolster the image of the Tudor dynasty across Europe, according to the Royal Mint.The first paper notes emerged in Europe in the 16th century: Goldsmiths began accepting deposits of gold coins, and issued receipts redeemable for cash.The Bank of England was established in 1694 to help finance William III\u2019s war with France. The central bank soon began issuing handwritten deposit receipts for specific amounts in pounds, shillings and pence, all signed by the chief cashier. The notes promised then \u2014 as they do now \u2014 to pay the bearer the sum of the note on demand.The first \u00a310 note, an ancestor to the Austen bill, came in 1759 as the country grappled with a shortage of gold resulting from the Seven Years\u2019 War. During the late 18th century, \u00a310 would have been the equivalent of \u00a31,000 today, and it was the amount she was paid for her first book, Mr. Carney said.It was not until 1833, however, that notes issued by the Bank of England became legal tender.As counterfeiters have become more sophisticated, the Bank of England and other authorities have had to continually update their currency by adding holograms, watermarks and using special paper to print notes.The biggest shift in recent years has involved switching from a special cotton-based paper to a polymer bill.Polymer allows the bank to add more sophisticated security features.The \u00a35 bill includes a see-through security window featuring an image of the queen that changes color when the bill is tilted, a hologram that changes from \u201cfive\u201d to \u201cpounds\u201d when moved, and the numeral 5 when the bill is placed under ultraviolet light.Similar features will be found in the new \u00a310 note, but it will be the first in Britain to have a tactile feature to help the blind and partially sighted.The bills used a tallow, or hard, fatty substance usually made from rendered meat, as part of their base. That angered vegetarians and vegans.That tallow was also used in the new \u00a310 notes already printed.The bank has decided not to withdraw the bills in which the tallow was used. But it is considering using palm oil as the base for its next \u00a320 note, which will feature the British painter J. M. W. Turner and is to enter circulation by 2020, as well as for any reprints of its \u00a35 and \u00a310 bills.There was an angry reaction when the Bank of England announced that Churchill would be featured on the \u00a35 note, replacing the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry and leaving England and Wales without a woman on its currency. (Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland print their own pound notes, with several featuring women.)Shortly after becoming the Bank of England governor in 2013, Mr. Carney announced that Austen would replace Charles Darwin on the \u00a310 note. She becomes the fourth woman, including the queen, to be featured on notes issued by the Bank of England, compared with 14 men.Sacagawea, a Shoshone guide who assisted the Lewis and Clark expedition, the suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony and Helen Keller, the activist for the disabled, have all appeared on American coins. The former first lady Martha Washington had previously featured on a $1 silver certificate.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year a \u00a32 note was issued by the Bank of England. It was 1811, not 1911.An earlier version of this article misstated the king of England who introduced the first pound coin. It was Henry VII, not Henry VIII.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Moore Says He Wants to Change Minds. So Why Is He on Broadway?", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "His one-man show, \u201cThe Terms of My Surrender,\u201d is opening at the Belasco Theater. But theater audiences in New York may already be part of his choir.Supported by\u201cI am not going to take up people\u2019s time or this valuable space to lecture people,\u201d Mr. Moore said, sitting in the orchestra level of the Belasco Theater. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to this stage every night to conduct a political rally.\u201dInstead, he said, he wants to tell stories that will make audiences feel better about this fractured nation, in a show from which they will emerge rejuvenated after a monthslong period of feeling beaten down.\u201cThis is not a kumbaya piece of theater,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for everyone to hold hands. I want people to leave with a sense that they\u2019ve been moved in a profound way.\u201dIn some ways, his timing couldn\u2019t be better. His show arrives amid a period of liberal soul searching, when any vaguely oppositional voice, whether a left-leaning columnist or late-night host, has gotten a second wind in the Trump era. Perhaps Mr. Moore, with his rumpled baseball hat and Midwestern bona fides, can offer some answers.But why take his act to Broadway? If it\u2019s true that he preaches to the choir \u2014 as his detractors on the right and the left say \u2014 speaking to a self-selected group of New York theatergoers seems to restrict his message to a rarefied bubble. What does Mr. Moore, who is known for a biting, sarcastic politics of outrage, think he can do differently, talking to about 1,000 people who have paid as much as $149 a seat?He has made big promises, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to determine if he knows what he wants to do and just won\u2019t reveal it in advance, or if he\u2019s still figuring it out as he goes along.On a recent Monday afternoon, Mr. Moore was admiring the set for his show, in previews here beginning Friday, July 28, and opening Thursday, Aug. 10.In 2002, he brought a cantankerous, post-9/11 monologue to London\u2019s Roundhouse Theater. In October, he gave a more urgent performance at theaters in Ohio counties that were strongly pro-Trump.Despite the fact that he ended that show with a vow to hold Mrs. Clinton accountable if she did not fulfill her promises in the White House, Mr. Moore (who supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary) said he always expected Mr. Trump to win the general election.The \u201cTrumpLand\u201d film and show, he said, was his best effort at staving off what he believed was inevitable. \u201cIf you were in a leaking lifeboat and all you had was a Dixie cup, would you just sit there, or would you at least start bailing?\u201d he asked.Mr. Mayer, a Tony Award-winner known for musicals like \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d and \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch,\u201d said he and Mr. Moore had been discussing a collaboration for about three years but were unable to align their schedules.Over the summer, the two have been shaping Mr. Moore\u2019s material and anecdotes, trying to determine what belongs in the show and how to segue from segment to segment.\u201cVery little of it is written where it won\u2019t change night to night,\u201d said Mr. Mayer, who called Mr. Moore \u201ca natural raconteur.\u201d\u201cWhat he wants to say and the things he has witnessed are so familiar that he has 30 different ways of telling the chain of events and drawing conclusions from them,\u201d Mr. Mayer said.If Mr. Moore decides one morning that he wants to respond to news developments in his show that night, Mr. Mayer said, \u201cWe will do everything we can, with the handful of tools we have at our disposal, to be as responsive as possible.\u201dMr. Mayer added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to gauge how much of Mr. Moore\u2019s show will be on-the-nose Trump critique or address broader ideas. On a recent visit to his rehearsal space at the New 42nd Street Studios, he was sitting in a recliner in the center of the room. In a corner was a bulletin board with index cards bearing the brief, tantalizing titles of potential segments: \u201cDead Peasants\u201d; \u201cSoccer vs. Football\u201d; \u201cWhat I Got Past the T.S.A.\u201dLater, Mr. Moore practiced a bit in which he will invite a conservative theatergoer from each show onto the stage to talk with him, with Mr. Mayer standing in for the audience member. Speaking to Mr. Mayer in this capacity, Mr. Moore told him not to be afraid of liberals: \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even know how to hit you, if they could throw a punch.\u201dAt the Belasco, Mr. Moore described his lifelong appreciation for the theater, going back to his upbringing in Flint, Mich., and his brief time as a student at its University of Michigan campus.On summer trips to New York, Mr. Moore said he and his family often attended Broadway shows, including the original 1964 production of \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d and that he got mugged outside \u201cNo, No, Nanette\u201d in the early 1970s.In the same way he hopes viewers approach his films, Mr. Moore said that when he goes to the theater, \u201cI want to go and be challenged. I want to leave better, smarter, angrier, happier than when I came in.\u201dBut political conservatives have long argued that in his films and other media, Mr. Moore seems less interested in getting to the truth of a matter than inserting himself into the middle of it.\u201cHis role is to scold and discipline,\u201d said S. E. Cupp, the conservative commentator and HLN host. \u201cIf you were truly interested in any of the causes he supports, you could find truer heroes who are less self-absorbed and self-aggrandizing.\u201dMatt K. Lewis, a conservative columnist for The Daily Beast, said that while Mr. Moore was once a prominent lightning rod for hostility directed at the left, he has been eclipsed by figures like Mr. Sanders and Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, who wield actual political power.\u201cI think the truth is, the right doesn\u2019t think of him,\u201d Mr. Lewis said of Mr. Moore. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard worker and an entrepreneur. I just don\u2019t think persuasion is his game.\u201dChris Lehmann, the editor in chief of The Baffler, a left-leaning publication, said that Mr. Moore had provided \u201ca necessary voice\u201d and credited him for being an early, prominent critic of the Iraq war.Mr. Lehmann, who has known Mr. Moore since they worked together at Mother Jones in 1986, described him as \u201ca person who, almost by virtue of his temperament, is a true outsider and can hold up a mirror to the powers that govern our world.\u201d\u201cThe problem with being an outsider,\u201d Mr. Lehmann added, \u201cis you can sometimes confuse truth-telling with self-indulgence.\u201dMr. Moore made no apologies for his subjective documentary style \u2014 \u201cas a filmmaker, my first job is to make a great film,\u201d he said \u2014 or for frustrating his opponents on either side of the aisle. \u201cI don\u2019t come from the Church of the Left,\u201d he said. \u201cI come from the Midwest.\u201dThough he splits his time between homes in New York and Traverse City, Mich., Mr. Moore said he still shared the values of the people he believes are his audience, and could be their avatar.\u201cI\u2019ve been given a peek behind the curtain that I wasn\u2019t supposed to have, whether that\u2019s in Hollywood or in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the average Joe and Jane to know I\u2019m really just their stand-in and we\u2019re all in this together.\u201dMr. Moore would not disclose how much he is being compensated for \u201cThe Terms of My Surrender,\u201d except to say, \u201cI thought of taping off the 12 seats each night that are my pay.\u201dAsked whether he ran an ongoing risk of having his celebrity overshadow his message, Mr. Moore did not exactly plead humility.\u201cThat\u2019s a question you should ask Hamilton or Washington or Jefferson,\u201d he answered. \u201cAs great and as smart as they were, they could only convince 25 percent of the colonists to support the revolution.\u201d (Some sources put the number of pro-revolution colonists much higher, while others say the figure is essentially unmeasurable.)So what is the aim of his show? If Mr. Moore believes he is calling for radical action in his own time, what does he want his audience members to do when they leave his show that they can\u2019t do already?\u201cThey will, I think, realize that they can do it and feel empowered to do it, and I will help create some pathways to that,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just with rhetoric.\u201dMr. Mayer said there was a unifying theme to the segments in the show, \u201cwhich is that one person can make a very big difference, by doing something that isn\u2019t necessarily tremendous \u2014 small, individual actions can have very large reactions.\u201dFor all the opportunities that the new Trump era seems to have created for him, Mr. Moore said he would have much preferred an alternate scenario.\u201cIf I could just sit in my La-Z-Boy and watch ESPN and not have to do any of this?\u201d he said, incredulously. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both have pushed to rein in the bureau as part of broader efforts to lighten regulation on the financial industry. Critics also say the rule would be nothing more than a gift to class-action lawyers.But it may be tricky politically for Republicans to kill a rule that has wide populist appeal. Across the country, judges, prosecutors and regulators have criticized arbitration clauses for allowing corporations to circumvent the courts and for taking away tools to fight abusive business practices.Mr. Quarles would be the first vice chairman for supervision, a role that Congress created after the financial crisis to sharpen the Fed\u2019s focus on regulatory issues.

It needs proud clarity on its historical agenda that advances a vision of America where all are entitled to equal treatment under the law.

Congress passed laws protecting the drug industry\u2019s monopoly pricing \u2014 with the support of many Democrats. The program that Mr. Schumer articulates sounds like a fine one. Can he carry out anything like it, without first getting campaign finance reform and weaning his members off their dependence on lobbyists?How much support does he really have in his conference for reforms like this \u2014 when even avowed liberals like Senator Cory Booker vote to prohibit Americans from buying drugs from Canada?At a minimum, I would like to see Mr. Schumer acknowledge that Democrats bear some responsibility for the ills he is now campaigning against.DICK ARONSON, WESTFIELD, N.J.To the Editor:Given President Trump\u2019s low approval ratings and chaotic presidency, Democrats have an excellent chance to gain control of Congress in 2018.

{"Headline": "Utility Helps Wean Vermonters From the Electric Grid", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "Green Mountain Power is trying to turn homes, neighborhoods and towns into virtual power plants, driven by economics as well as environmental goals.Supported byWALTHAM, Vt. \u2014 In a new low-income development that replaced a trailer park here, rooftop solar panels sparkle in the sun while backup batteries quietly hum away in utility closets.About an hour away, in Rutland, homes and businesses along a once-distressed corridor are installing the latest in energy-saving equipment, including special insulation and heat pumps.And throughout Vermont, customers are signing up for a new program that will allow them to power their homes while entirely disconnected from the grid.The projects are part of a bold experiment aimed at turning homes, neighborhoods and towns into virtual power plants, able to reduce the amount of energy they draw from the central electric system. But behind them are not green energy advocates or proponents of living off the land. Instead, it\u2019s the local electric company, Green Mountain Power.Green Mountain\u2019s chief executive, Mary Powell, sees the program here as the best way to please customers while making the system more environmentally and physically sustainable.\u201cCustomers, especially in Vermont with the energy-independence values that people have, want to move more toward self-generation,\u201d she said, seated in a bright orange modernist chair in a meeting area in the company\u2019s open-plan headquarters near Burlington.\u201cThe opportunity for us,\u201d she added, is to lead the transformation of an electric system that depends on power sent along big transmission lines \u201cto a community-, home- and business-based energy system.\u201dAs a practical matter, the less electricity the utility pulls from the regional transmission system, especially at times of peak demand, the less it has to pay in fees, producing savings it can pass on to customers. One way it does this is by remotely controlling the batteries installed through its programs, drawing upon the stored energy as needed.Recently, Ms. Powell said, Green Mountain used this method to take the low-income development here off the grid\u2019s electricity supply for two hours, saving an estimated $275 in transmission costs while the homes were powered by solar panels or battery storage. The amount saved was small, but such savings could add up over a year if they were realized in enough locations.The utility, owned by Gaz M\u00e9tro, a leading natural gas distributor in Quebec, is also working to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions as part of the effort to slow global warming. In 2014, it became a B Corporation. That is a voluntary designation, requiring executives to take into account not just how decisions will affect profit and shareholders, but also how they will affect the public, generally defined as society or the environment.The idea is that customers, especially when they have solar panels, heat pumps and electric vehicles, will be better able to monitor and manage their energy use. The utility, using Tesla\u2019s software, will be able to call upon the stored energy in the combined batteries to help meet surges in demand, or to sell it on the wholesale market to help balance or smooth out fluctuations within the region.The efforts have won plaudits from national green-energy advocates who see the utility as a leader in helping redesign the electric system, which is undergoing enormous changes as renewable sources of energy become more popular and other technologies give customers more control. Many utilities see such moves as an existential threat because their profits come mainly from getting a set rate of return that is factored into customer rates.But Green Mountain Power has \u201cfigured out a way to do well and do good in the utility business and keep its regulators, investors and customers all happy at the same time,\u201d said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford and a customer of the utility through a family home in Vermont. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal these days when the rest of the industry is talking about a death spiral.\u201dMs. Powell, 56, grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and attended a public high school focused on the arts. She came to the company in 1998 after turning down the job three times. She just couldn\u2019t see herself working for a utility, she said, especially one whose traditional corporate culture was visible in the imposing stone lobby and slate steps that led to the chief executive\u2019s office, hidden behind two private secretaries and outfitted with its own bathroom and shower.The family on her father\u2019s side \u2014 he was an actor and a model for the fisherman on Gorton\u2019s seafood packages \u2014 had roots in the state, so she had grown up spending summers there. (Her brother, Michael Powell, is a sports columnist at The New York Times.) After college, she became a technical writer for a money-market fund in New York, working her way up to associate director of operations over the next seven years.She grew disenchanted with working in finance, so when a house-sitting opportunity in Vermont came up, she and her fianc\u00e9 quit their jobs and headed north. She figured she would work as a waitress, she said, but ended up taking jobs at a couple of banks and starting a few businesses \u2014 including one selling reflective gear for dogs that her husband now runs \u2014 that ultimately led to her joining the utility.First, she tackled the company culture, moving executives from the boxy glass headquarters to the 1980s brick service center, where she works at a stand-up desk in a cluster including other executives as well as the linemen. The office, decorated with reclaimed wood, bright colors and relics of past electric systems, looks more suited to a Silicon Valley start-up than to a typical corporate utility, complete with a treadmill and table-tennis setup in one section and a cluster of fledgling entrepreneurs, winners of an incubator competition, in another.Then she began trying to make the generating system greener, which led to the move toward a more decentralized system, something few other utilities have tried with such enthusiasm. But in an industry known for caution, Green Mountain can be nimble, in part because it is so small \u2014 just 265,000 customers \u2014 and has a relatively receptive customer base.A program that helps provide energy-efficiency upgrades in Rutland, for instance, got its start with a single call. At a weekly leadership team meeting, Ms. Powell asked executives to find a way to bring several technologies together in one dwelling.One executive asked Rutland\u2019s mayor if he knew of a family that would be willing to serve as a guinea pig. He suggested Mark and Sara Borkowski, whose century-old house became the first of 161 homes and businesses to take part. Under the program, the utility provides financing for energy upgrades, which participants can pay back over time through their monthly bills.Green Mountain has still invested in large-scale renewable-power plants, like the Stafford Hill Solar Farm \u2014 11 acres of solar panels and battery banks spread over a landfill behind a town dump \u2014 and two wind farms. Those developments have come in for criticism from some residents and officials who object to living near noisy industrial machines and worry about marring the natural beauty that draws residents and visitors to the state. The critics include Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who opposes putting wind turbines along mountain ridges.But many customers say they are happy to be part of greening the area\u2019s energy supply, whether for the financial savings, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming, or just to make sure the lights stay on in a power failure.\u201cIt\u2019s not really any different than being anywhere else,\u201d said Alexis LaBerge, 27, who was one of the first to move into the low-income development in Waltham from an old house that guzzled fuel to keep the house and hot water heated.Now, when the power from the grid goes out, as it did one night this spring, she does not have to worry about food spoiling in the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely nice being brand-new and having the backup,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Then there was the president\u2019s pledge to lower income tax rates, coupled with concerns that he might eliminate the tax-exempt status of muni income.And finally, President Trump has promised to increase infrastructure spending by possibly $1 trillion \u2014 which, if it happens, could flood the muni market with additional supply, weighing on the price of existing muni securities.But it hasn\u2019t turned out that way so far.Meanwhile, concerns about a slow-growing economy have resurfaced, pushing the yield on 10-year Treasury notes back down to 2.3 percent at the end of June, from as high as 2.62 percent in March. And the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, recently told the Senate Finance Committee that the Trump administration supported preserving the muni bond tax exemption.The result of all of these developments is that muni bond mutual and exchange-traded funds have enjoyed a surprisingly good run this year.For instance, the SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF, whose biggest holdings include revenue bonds issued by the California State University system as well as the University of California, has generated total returns of 3.6 percent this year and 2.2 percent in the recently ended quarter.Even before investors factor in the tax break (muni income is exempt from federal taxes and, in some cases, state taxes as well), that performance compares favorably with the 2.3 percent returns for the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF this year and the 1.6 percent gains in the last quarter.Going forward, though, navigating the muni bond landscape will get a whole lot trickier, money managers say.Even if Mr. Trump cannot produce annual growth of greater than 3 percent, which has eluded the economy lately \u2014 or the 4 percent rate that the White House promised earlier this year \u2014 the administration is still planning to move forward on its efforts to cut taxes.Ultimately, how much income tax rates eventually come down, if at all, will help determine the direction of muni bond prices. But the tax cut debate itself is likely to create short-term volatility for these investments.What\u2019s more, muni investors are largely following a conservative strategy.\u201cYou can see where investors are hiding out,\u201d says Mark R. Freeman, co-manager of the Westwood Income Opportunity Fund. \u201cEverybody is bunched up at the short end of the curve,\u201d he said, referring to muni debt with a maturity of no more than five years.That demand for shorter-term munis has made it harder to find great values. In fact, it has compressed the so-called yield spread \u2014 the gap between what short-term muni bonds are paying and what similarly dated Treasuries yield.For example, the average high-quality two-year municipal bond is paying 1.06 percent, according to Bloomberg, while two-year Treasuries are paying considerably more: 1.36 percent.By comparison, 30-year munis are paying virtually the same as Treasuries before the tax benefit is factored in: 2.87 percent before the tax break, versus 2.92 percent for equivalent Treasuries. And for someone in the 25 percent tax bracket, that 2.87 percent is actually the equivalent of a 3.83 percent taxable yield.To be sure, long-dated bonds are susceptible to larger drops in price should interest rates rise. And with the Federal Reserve lifting short-term rates, taking on that much so-called duration risk by buying extremely long-dated bonds does not seem to make sense, money managers say.Gregg S. Fisher, founder of the investment management firm Gerstein Fisher, says investors should remember a big reason for buying muni and other core bonds in the first place: \u201cFor the certainty that they present,\u201d he said.That\u2019s why he suggests investors play it relatively safe for the foundation of a muni portfolio, by sticking with bonds that are from high-quality issuers with investment-grade ratings (reducing the risk of a default) and that mature in less than five years.\u201cOur preference for any client, no matter what state they live in, would not be to buy 100 percent of their bonds issued in any one state,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should diversify across the country,\u201d he added, even if doing so forgoes some state tax breaks.Ajay Thomas, head of municipal securities at William Blair, agrees that investors should mostly be considering investment-grade municipal bonds. But he points out that as investors venture out to the lower end of the high-quality bond universe and the higher end of the low-quality world, they may start to see better opportunities.\u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily seeing a big difference in yields if you go from a AAA-rated bond to a AA bond,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you go below A, there\u2019s clearly some spread.\u201d He noted that there were some decent opportunities among munis related to health care and higher education in this category.Ms. Spath of Sierra Investment Management also said that higher-yielding munis are worth a look.Sierra sold all its muni holdings shortly after the presidential election last year, amid mounting pressures weighing on these investments, Ms. Spath said.But in early January, as some of the reaction to the Trump victory subsided, the firm moved back into muni bonds.Today, Sierra\u2019s municipal bond exposure is entirely in high-yield muni funds, she said.\u201cHigh-yielding municipals are currently yielding roughly the same as high-yield corporate bonds, and that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said, noting that many investors are totally overlooking the tax benefit these securities provide.She said the firm preferred investing in munis through a fund, in part because of the diversification advantage but also because institutional buyers can often obtain better prices.Among Sierra\u2019s top muni holdings is Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund, with an average credit quality of BB, which is at the upper end of noninvestment grade bonds.Nearly one third of that fund\u2019s holdings are in debt tied to health care or education and civic organizations. Among its top holdings recently were B-rated debt issued by the Chicago Board of Education at a coupon of 7 percent and AA-rated debt issued by the University of Kansas Hospital Authority with a coupon of 5 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Qatar Criticizes \u2018Face-Saving\u2019 Move by Arab Antagonists in Gulf Crisis", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe seemingly eased demands on Qatar made by the four Arab countries that have severed relations with it are an insincere \u201cface-saving approach\u201d to resolving the Persian Gulf crisis, Qatar\u2019s United Nations ambassador said on Wednesday.The ambassador, Alya Ahmed al-Thani, also said there could be no direct negotiations until her country\u2019s antagonists ended their economic boycott of Qatar, which she described as an illegal \u201csiege\u201d causing deep harm.The remarks by the ambassador in a telephone interview appeared to signal no hint of progress in the dispute, which erupted on June 5 and has bared bitter fractures among gulf Arab neighbors that share strong alliances with the United States.The 13 demands, which the Qataris leaked upon receiving them last month, were widely regarded as sweeping and unrealistic, even by countries far removed from the dispute.They amounted to an ultimatum that Qatar close the popular Qatari-owned news network Al Jazeera, drastically downgrade relations with Iran, close a Turkish military base, sever contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood and other groups deemed to incite extremism and terrorism, and undergo monthly monitoring to ensure compliance.Qatar, which has denied accusations that it encourages terrorism and instability, described the demands as a cynical guise by the Saudi-led group of adversaries to subvert Qatari sovereignty.The more generic set of six principles that have since been articulated by the four countries would commit all parties in the dispute to stopping terrorism, extremism and incitement; denying financing and shelter to terrorist groups; and refraining from interference in the internal affairs of others.Ms. Thani described the revised position of the other countries as \u201ca response to the heat they have already received\u201d on the 13 demands.\u201cThey have received a lot of criticism for their approach, the take-it-or-leave-it approach,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s just a face-saving approach by the four countries,\u201d she added. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s unfortunately not a sign of good faith or flexibility.\u201dMuch of the dispute revolves around Al Jazeera, particularly its Arab-language broadcasts, which Qatar\u2019s adversaries have described as incendiary and beyond the bounds of free speech.The letter listed examples of Al Jazeera broadcasts that Mr. Gargash said had favorably portrayed figures like Osama bin Laden of Al Qaeda, Khaled Meshal of Hamas and Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah. \u201cAl Jazeera has presented opportunities for terrorist groups to threaten, recruit and incite, without challenge or restraint,\u201d Mr. Gargash said.Qatar has rejected the criticism over Al Jazeera, one of the most widely watched channels in the Middle East. \u201cWe are proud of hosting Al Jazeera,\u201d Ms. Thani said.The ambassador also shared documents that Qatar\u2019s foreign minister had submitted to the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, accusing Qatar\u2019s four antagonists of having trampled on the United Nations Charter and international human rights law in the severance of diplomatic and economic ties.The documents included a July 7 report by Qatar\u2019s human rights committee detailing hundreds of complaints about the effects. They included the arbitrary separation of families, the inability of Qatari students to complete the school year and enormous losses by Qatari owners of businesses in the other countries.The committee\u2019s report also accused the other countries of having threatened severe punishment to any citizen deemed friendly to Qatar. \u201cJust wearing a Barcelona or Paris St.-Germain T-shirt out of sympathy is enough for a person to receive severe punishment,\u201d it said, referring to soccer teams with major financial connections to Qatar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bathroom Bill Tests Clout of Rare Moderate in Increasingly Conservative Texas", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut something else will be on the line, too: whether moderate Republicans have a role to play in a state party increasingly dominated by far-right Christian conservatives, and whether the last powerful moderate Republican in Texas can keep his job and his influence.State Representative Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas House, has long employed a mild-mannered, commerce-focused brand of Republican politics in the mold of former Gov. George W. Bush.Since 2009, when legislators first elected him speaker, he has been effectively minding the store of Texas. He has kept a relatively low profile and focused on issues like public education while his fellow Republican leaders, including former Gov. Rick Perry, now the energy secretary, and Ted Cruz, the former state solicitor general and now a United States senator, set their sights on higher office and seized the spotlight.Mr. Straus, 57, has put himself publicly at odds with the two most powerful Republicans in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both of whom support the bathroom restrictions. And on the eve of the special session, his ability to hold onto power is under fierce attack.\u201cHis days are numbered as speaker,\u201d said Jared Woodfill, the president of Conservative Republicans of Texas, which has spent a small fortune in recent years to defeat Mr. Straus and his lieutenants in the House. \u201cThis is one man who has a liberal agenda for the state of Texas, and who has done everything he can to stop the good work that\u2019s being done by the lieutenant governor and our State Senate and the governor.\u201dPro-business, Bush-style, country-club Republicans no longer set the agenda in Texas. What happens in the session \u2014 and particularly what form the bathroom bill takes and whether it passes or fails \u2014 will provide the clearest signal of whether there is any effective brake left on social-conservative Republicans in Texas.Mr. Straus shows no outward signs of feeling the pressure. In a recent interview in his office on the second floor of the Capitol behind the empty House chamber, Mr. Straus sat on a sofa with a tall glass of ice water and calmly paused for several seconds when asked whether Texas had shifted further to the far right since 2009.\u201cWell, a lot of the politicians have,\u201d Mr. Straus replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think Texas has. And as the Republican Party continues to dominate all the statewide offices, the competition has been focused, really, on the small-turnout primaries.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed to say that I know how to govern without being an extremist.\u201dThe marquee item on the special-session agenda is the bathroom bill. But it is one of 20 pieces of legislation that will be debated, including property-tax reform, teacher pay raises and a ban on abortion coverage by private insurance plans.The intraparty intrigue heated up a notch on Monday when Mr. Abbott told a conservative policy forum that he planned to publicize a list of lawmakers who support his 20-item agenda and those who oppose it, a list likely to have more political ramifications for Republicans than for Democrats.Mr. Patrick, the lieutenant governor, effectively forced Mr. Abbott to call a special session, by holding a mundane piece of legislation hostage that must pass to keep a handful of state agencies operating, including the Texas Medical Board, which licenses the state\u2019s doctors. Because the bathroom bill failed to pass during the regular session, Mr. Patrick used that legislation, known as a sunset bill, as leverage to get Mr. Abbott to order the 30-day session.Opponents of the bathroom bill in Texas predict similar fallout, and those concerns drive much of the moderate-Republican opposition to it.Few symbolize the disunity among Texas Republicans better than Mr. Straus and Mr. Patrick, whose inability to compromise on the bathroom bill set the stage for a special session that will cost Texas taxpayers at least $1 million.Mr. Patrick, a former talk-radio host, was the Texas chairman of President Trump\u2019s campaign. Perhaps more than any other Republican, he has come to define post-Perry Texas politics.The elder Mr. Bush as well as John Tower, the first Republican United States senator from Texas since the Reconstruction era, were two of Mr. Straus\u2019s early political mentors.\u201cI had the great privilege as a very young man to spend time with both of them, so when I think about some of the more ambitious, kind of out-there Republicans today, I always do go back to those, if you want to call them, old-school pioneers and founders,\u201d Mr. Straus said.Mr. Straus has taken a more subtle tack but has grown bolder in publicly criticizing Mr. Patrick, including on the bathroom bill.\u201cPutting aside some of his invectives, I\u2019m always happy to meet with the lieutenant governor, and with the governor for that matter,\u201d Mr. Straus said, adding, \u201cI also believe that too many of our state leaders spend too much of their focus and attention on divisive social issues, so if that\u2019s what the meetings are going to be about, you can count me out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is in flagrant contradiction with the official reports published by the department he now leads. The reality is that Catalonia pays in taxes (19 percent) what it contributes to G.D.P. (19 percent) and receives an amount (15.08 percent) close to its share of the population (16 percent). This fiscal balance has been considered fair by politicians of all political parties.What strikes me the most is that you do not mention that the Spanish government is legally bound by its constitutional doctrine to prohibit a referendum of independence. Such a referendum on secession in Catalonia that you endorse goes squarely against Article 1 of the Spanish Constitution: \u201cNational sovereignty belongs to the Spanish people.\u201d Sovereignty pertains to all Spaniards and it is the whole of the nation that has the \u201cright to decide.\u201dSuch provisions appear in every written constitution in the world, with the exceptions of St. Kitts and Nevis, and Ethiopia.

{"Headline": "Robert Farmer, Resourceful Fund-Raiser for Democrats, Dies at 78", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert Farmer, a prodigious fund-raiser who contrived a formula to circumvent federal campaign spending limits with so-called soft money, and who was credited with raising $800 million for four presidential candidates and the Democratic Party, died on July 22 in Miami. He was 78.The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, his brother, Brent, said.While three of the four candidates whose fund-raising Mr. Farmer masterminded captured the Democratic nomination, only Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency. But Mr. Farmer\u2019s legacy to campaign financing was more enduring.As the father of soft money, he figured out in 1988 that in addition to the $8.3 million the national party could contribute to its presidential nominee, he could funnel $42 million more to state Democratic organizations.Since early in the 20th century, corporations and unions had legally been barred from contributing to federal elections. But they, and wealthy individuals, circumvented that prohibition and other contribution limits for individual candidates by giving vast sums to political parties. The parties, theoretically, would spend it on operating and other expenses and not on winning elections.\u201cI refuse to apologize for trying to create a level playing field with the Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why Democrats year in and year out should operate at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dIn 1988, Mr. Dukakis raised more money than his Republican rival, George H. W. Bush, but lost the election.In 2010, in a lawsuit filed by Citizens United, a conservative group, the United States Supreme Court ruled that government restrictions on independent political spending by corporations and unions violated constitutional free speech guarantees.A retired self-made millionaire publisher of legal and technical manuals, Mr. Farmer was an enrolled Republican until 1980, when he contributed $1,000 to the presidential campaign of Representative John B. Anderson, an Illinois Republican. After Mr. Anderson abandoned the party to become an independent, Mr. Farmer followed suit. When Mr. Anderson lost, Mr. Farmer became a Democrat.He was an indefatigable fund-raiser whose efforts in the 1988 primaries gave Mr. Dukakis an insurmountable organizational advantage and an intimidating war chest to buy television advertising.Instead of focusing on the legal maximum $1,000 in contributions that individuals were allowed to give, Mr. Farmer created a nationwide network of 900 of Mr. Dukakis\u2019s supporters who agreed to raise $10,000 or more from friends, family and business associates.\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve set up a bunch of franchises around the country and I\u2019m the home office,\u201d he said. \u201cI provide backup and support. The secret is giving people responsibility and holding them accountable.\u201dHe was a consummate schmoozer; Mr. Clinton once said that Mr. Farmer \u201ccould talk an owl out of a tree.\u201dMr. Farmer concurred. \u201cYou can\u2019t be bashful in this business,\u201d he said.His rivals were envious. In 1988, David Garth, the media adviser to Al Gore\u2019s campaign for the Democratic nomination, suggested that Mr. Dukakis was leading in the primaries largely because of Mr. Farmer\u2019s fund-raising prowess. He predicted, however, that Mr. Dukakis would be a mediocre candidate in the general election. His solution: Nominate Senator Gore and appoint Mr. Farmer as his secretary of the Treasury.\u201cFarmer might be able to solve the deficit problem in an afternoon,\u201d Mr. Garth said.Robert Allen Farmer was born on Sept. 20, 1938, in Bay Village, Ohio, on Lake Erie west of Cleveland. His father, Sterling, was vice president of a company that dredged sand from the Great Lakes for foundries. His mother was the former Eleanor Sandberg.He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1960 from Dartmouth College, graduated from Harvard Law School and briefly attended Harvard Business School before leaving to establish a publishing house.In the 1984 presidential primary campaign, Mr. Farmer was Senator John Glenn\u2019s campaign treasurer. After the Dukakis campaign, he was elected treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. He helped raise money for the 1989 campaign of David N. Dinkins, whose victory made him the first black mayor of New York City.Between campaigns, Mr. Farmer was also treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association.He resigned from the national committee job to work for Mr. Clinton in 1992. (He was named consul general to Bermuda during the Clinton administration.) He also worked for Senator John Kerry in his unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2004. In 2007, Mr. Farmer quit Senator Barack Obama\u2019s finance committee to work for Senator Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.In addition to his brother, he is survived by his husband, Thomas Winston; a son, Thieu Nguyen, one of two Vietnamese refugee brothers he sponsored; and three grandchildren.Mr. Farmer publicly disclosed that he was gay in 2000 in an interview with The Advocate, a publication devoted to gay, lesbian and transgender issues.\u201cI told Kitty about my being gay,\u201d Mr. Farmer said, referring to Mr. Dukakis\u2019s wife, \u201cand she said that was fine with her, \u2018but don\u2019t tell Michael.\u2019 The three of us laugh about it now, but at the time I just saw it as Michael\u2019s macho Greek thing.\u201dMr. Farmer said he had agreed to the interview \u201cto help young gay people somewhere feel more comfortable about who they are.\u201d He added, \u201cIt would be great if I could make it a little easier to be gay and participate openly in politics.\u201dMr. Farmer retired from his publishing business in the early 1980s to focus on fund-raising. He considered running for the Boston congressional seat held by Joseph P. Kennedy II, but found sufficient fame in fund-raising.\u201cThe other day, after seeing my name in the newspaper and hearing it on television, my secretary told me The New York Times was on the telephone,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1989. \u201cI stopped a meeting to take the call and the voice at the other end said, \u2018Mr. Farmer, would you consider taking a 60-day subscription?\u2019 \u201dDespite his success, Mr. Famer often said that there was no secret to political fund-raising, that it was \u201ca very personal business,\u201d which was why he donated to causes only when someone asked him directly to contribute.\u201cNo one will write a check for $1,000 unless asked,\u201d he said in 1992. \u201cThe reason people give is because they don\u2019t want to say no to people who ask them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yanis Varoufakis: A New Deal for the 21st Century", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorATHENS \u2014 The recent elections in France and Britain have confirmed the political establishment\u2019s simultaneous vulnerability and vigor in the face of a nationalist insurgency. This contradiction is the motif of the moment \u2014 personified by the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 made him a darling of the elites but who rode a wave of anti-establishment enthusiasm to power.A similar paradox is visible in Britain in the surprising electoral success of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in depriving Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives of an outright governing majority \u2014 not least because the resulting hung Parliament seemingly gives the establishment some hope of a change in approach from Mrs. May\u2019s initial recalcitrant stance toward the European Union on the Brexit negotiations that have just begun.Outsiders are having a field day almost everywhere in the West \u2014 not necessarily in a manner that weakens the insiders, but neither also in a way that helps consolidate the insiders\u2019 position. The result is a situation in which the political establishment\u2019s once unassailable authority has died, but before any credible replacement has been born. The cloud of uncertainty and volatility that envelops us today is the product of this gap.For too long, the political establishment in the West saw no threat on the horizon to its political monopoly. Just as with asset markets, in which price stability begets instability by encouraging excessive risk-taking, so, too, in Western politics the insiders took absurd risks, convinced that outsiders were never a real threat.One example of the establishment\u2019s recklessness was releasing the financial sector from the restrictions that the New Deal and the postwar Bretton Woods agreement had imposed upon financiers to prevent them from repeating the damage seen with the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Another was building a system of world trade and credit that depended on the booming United States trade deficit to stabilize global aggregate demand. It is a measure of the sheer hubris of the Western establishment that it portrayed these steps as \u201criskless.\u201dWhen the ensuing financialization of Western economies led to the great financial crisis of 2007-8, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic showed no compunction about practicing welfare socialism for bankers. Meanwhile, more vulnerable citizens were abandoned to the mercy of unfettered markets, which saw them as too expensive to hire at a decent wage and too indebted to court otherwise.As more and more voters became mad as hell, governing parties lost elections between 2008 and 2012 in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and elsewhere. The problem was that the incoming administrations were as much part of the establishment as the outgoing ones. And so they made bipartisan the very approach that had caused the wave of anger that carried them into office.Unsurprisingly, though, these central bank money-creation schemes and the Chinese credit bubble proved unable to prevent severe regional depressions, which struck from Detroit to Athens. Nor could they prevent sharp global deflation from 2012 to 2015.By 2014, voters had begun to give up on the new administrations they had voted for after 2008 in the false hope that the establishment\u2019s loyal opposition could provide new solutions. Thus, 2015 saw the first challenges to the insiders\u2019 authority start to surface.In Greece \u2014 a small country, yet one that has proved to be a bellwether thanks to its gargantuan and systemically significant debt \u2014 protests against the debt bondage imposed on the population evolved into a progressive, internationalist coalition led by the Syriza party that came from nowhere to win government. In Spain, a similar movement, Podemos, began to rise in the polls, threatening to do the same.In Britain, a left-wing internationalist tendency that had been marginal in the Labour Party coalesced around the leadership campaign of Jeremy Corbyn \u2014 and surprised itself by winning. Soon after, the independent socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, carried the same spirit into the Democratic Party primaries.Everywhere, the political establishment treated these left-of-center, progressive internationalists with a mixture of contempt, ridicule, character assassination and brute force \u2014 the worst case, of course, being the treatment of the Greek government in which I served during the first half of 2015. Historians may mark that year as when the establishment turned truly illiberal.By 2016, the establishment\u2019s arrogance met its first, frightful nemesis: Brexit. The shock waves from the insiders\u2019 unheralded defeat in that referendum rippled across the West. They brought new energy to Donald Trump\u2019s outsider campaign in the American presidential election, and they invigorated Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France.From the West to the East, a new Nationalist International \u2014 an allied front of right-wing chauvinist parties and movements \u2014 arose.The clash between the Nationalist International and the establishment was both real and illusory. The venom between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was genuine, as was the loathing in Britain between the Remain camp and the Leavers. But these combatants are accomplices, as much as foes, creating a feedback loop of mutual reinforcement that defines them and mobilizes their supporters.The trick is to get outside the closed system of that loop. The progressive internationalism of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party, Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters and the Greek anti-austerity movement came to offer an alternative to the deceptive binaries of establishment insiders and nationalist outsiders. An interesting dynamic ensued: As the insiders defeated or sidelined the progressive internationalist outsiders, it was the nationalist outsiders who benefited. But once Mr. Trump, the Brexiteers and Ms. Le Pen were strengthened, a remarkable new alignment took place, with a series of unstable mergers between outsider forces and the establishment.In Britain, we saw the Conservative Party, a standard-bearer of the establishment, adopt the pro-Brexit program of the tiny, extreme nationalist U.K. Independence Party. In the United States, the outsider in chief, Mr. Trump, formed an administration made up of Wall Street executives, oil company oligarchs and Washington lobbyists. As for France, the anti-establishment new president, Mr. Macron, is about to embark on an austerity agenda straight out of the insiders\u2019 manual. This will, most probably, end by fueling the current of isolationist nationalism in France.Where does this prey-predator game between the globalist establishment and the isolationist blood-and-soil nationalists leave us?The recent elections in Britain and France confirm that both strands are alive and kicking, reinforcing each other, as they tussle, to the detriment of a vast majority of their populations. Both Mrs. May\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s negotiating teams in Brussels are investing their efforts in an inevitable impasse, which each believes will bolster their political authority, even though it will disadvantage the populations on both sides of the English Channel that must live with the consequences.In the United States, Mr. Trump is pursuing an economic policy that, if it has any effect, will set off a run on Treasury bonds at a time when the Fed is tightening monetary policy. A result will be a panicked administration whose reflex will be to impose austerity measures before the midterm elections. Those policies will further disadvantage precisely the regions and social groups that carried Mr. Trump into the White House.So, what will it take to end this destructive dynamic of mutual reinforcement by the largely liberal establishment insiders and the regressive nationalist outsiders?The answer lies in ditching both globalism and isolationism in favor of an authentic internationalism. It lies neither in more deregulation nor in greater Keynesian stimulus, but in finding ways to put to useful purpose the global glut of savings.This would amount to an International New Deal, borrowing from Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s plan the basic idea of mobilizing idle private money for public purposes. But rather than through tax-and-spend programs at the level of national economies, this new New Deal should be administered by a partnership of central banks (like the Fed, the European Central Bank and others) and public investment banks (like the World Bank, Germany\u2019s KfW Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and so on). Under the auspices and direction of the Group of 20, the investment banks could issue bonds in a coordinated fashion, which these central banks would be ready to purchase, if necessary.Today\u2019s false feud between globalization and nationalism is undermining the future of humanity, and spreading dread and loathing. It must end. A new internationalist spirit that would build institutions to serve the interests of the many is as pertinent today across the world as Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was for America in the 1930s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trial, Witness Says He Didn\u2019t Lead Queens Councilman\u2019s Charity", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2011, a New York State agency mailed a letter to Shawn Garrick, the executive director of the charity New York 4 Life, demanding an accounting of $33,000 that the charity, founded by Councilman Ruben W. Wills of Queens, had received from the state.But Mr. Garrick had no idea that he had been listed as the executive director of the charity, he testified on Tuesday at Mr. Wills\u2019s trial on charges of stealing more than $30,000 in city and state funds. Mr. Garrick said he had never received the letter \u2014 the address under his name was not his \u2014 and had never attended any board meetings of New York 4 Life.The reason, according to prosecutors from the office of the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, is that the charity was part of a plot by Mr. Wills, a Democrat, to steal public funds. Prosecutors said that Mr. Wills never hosted a luncheon for single fathers, or an \u201cadopt a commercial strip\u201d event, as he had promised the state agency, the Office of Children and Family Services, that he would do with its grant. He also never actually paid for the translation and distribution of campaign materials, as he told the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board when receiving matching funds for his election campaign, prosecutors have said.Instead, prosecutors said, Mr. Wills used taxpayer money to buy a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Wii console and a three-pack of underwear, among other purchases.If convicted, Mr. Wills faces up to seven years in prison.His trial in State Supreme Court in Queens is the latest in a series of legal entanglements that have dogged Mr. Wills since he was first elected to the City Council in 2010. In 2011, he acknowledged that he had ignored an outstanding arrest warrant stemming from a 1996 dispute; a separate warrant was issued in 2000 after he was accused of skipping court appearances.Mr. Garrick\u2019s testimony formed a climax of the prosecution\u2019s case, which otherwise had revolved around a somewhat technical examination of bank documents and receipts, with witnesses from stores like Century 21 and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. In a brief but dramatic interrogation, Travis Hill, an assistant attorney general, asked Mr. Garrick about his association with Mr. Wills\u2019s nonprofit.\u201cDid you ever agree to be the executive director of New York 4 Life?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWere you aware that New York 4 Life applied for a $33,000 grant?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dMr. Garrick\u2019s testimony was preceded by a similar exchange with Michelle Davis, Mr. Wills\u2019s goddaughter, who had received two checks from a New York 4 Life bank account in 2010, including one for doing data entry for the charity\u2019s obesity campaign. Asked by Mr. Hill if she had ever done any work for New York 4 Life, Ms. Davis said no. Asked if she had done any work for an obesity campaign, she again said no.\u201cWhen did you first hear of New York 4 Life?\u201d Mr. Hill asked.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of New York 4 Life,\u201d she replied.The $33,000 state grant was earmarked by former State Senator Shirley Huntley, a Queens Democrat who was sentenced to prison in 2013 for stealing from her own nonprofit organization. When prosecutors highlighted Mr. Wills\u2019s association with Ms. Huntley, for whom he once worked as chief of staff, Mr. Wills\u2019s lawyer, Kevin O\u2019Donnell, leapt up to ask for a mistrial; Justice Ira H. Margulis denied the request.Mr. Wills\u2019s lawyer is expected to call witnesses on Wednesday. In his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, Mr. O\u2019Donnell has sought to cast Mr. Wills as a rookie politician tripped up by arcane campaign finance laws and shoddy record-keeping. He plans to argue that the charity\u2019s planned events, such as the single fathers\u2019 luncheon, did indeed take place, although there may not be a paper trail.\u201cPoor bookkeeping doesn\u2019t equate to criminal activity,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell said after court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Please Prove You\u2019re Not a Robot", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen science fiction writers first imagined robot invasions, the idea was that bots would become smart and powerful enough to take over the world by force, whether on their own or as directed by some evildoer. In reality, something only slightly less scary is happening. Robots are getting better, every day, at impersonating humans. When directed by opportunists, malefactors and sometimes even nation-states, they pose a particular threat to democratic societies, which are premised on being open to the people.Robots posing as people have become a menace. For popular Broadway shows (need we say \u201cHamilton\u201d?), it is actually bots, not humans, who do much and maybe most of the ticket buying. Shows sell out immediately, and the middlemen (quite literally, evil robot masters) reap millions in ill-gotten gains.Philip Howard, who runs the Computational Propaganda Research Project at Oxford, studied the deployment of propaganda bots during voting on Brexit, and the recent American and French presidential elections. Twitter is particularly distorted by its millions of robot accounts; during the French election, it was principally Twitter robots who were trying to make #MacronLeaks into a scandal. Facebook has admitted it was essentially hacked during the American election in November. In Michigan, Mr. Howard notes, \u201cjunk news was shared just as widely as professional news in the days leading up to the election.\u201dRobots are also being used to attack the democratic features of the administrative state. This spring, the Federal Communications Commission put its proposed revocation of net neutrality up for public comment. In previous years such proceedings attracted millions of (human) commentators. This time, someone with an agenda but no actual public support unleashed robots who impersonated (via stolen identities) hundreds of thousands of people, flooding the system with fake comments against federal net neutrality rules.To be sure, today\u2019s impersonation-bots are different from the robots imagined in science fiction: They aren\u2019t sentient, don\u2019t carry weapons and don\u2019t have physical bodies. Instead, fake humans just have whatever is necessary to make them seem human enough to \u201cpass\u201d: a name, perhaps a virtual appearance, a credit-card number and, if necessary, a profession, birthday and home address. They are brought to life by programs or scripts that give one person the power to imitate thousands.The problem is almost certain to get worse, spreading to even more areas of life as bots are trained to become better at mimicking humans. Given the degree to which product reviews have been swamped by robots (which tend to hand out five stars with abandon), commercial sabotage in the form of negative bot reviews is not hard to predict. In coming years, campaign finance limits will be (and maybe already are) evaded by robot armies posing as \u201csmall\u201d donors. And actual voting is another obvious target \u2014 perhaps the ultimate target.So far, we\u2019ve been content to leave the problem to the tech industry, where the focus has been on building defenses, usually in the form of Captchas (\u201ccompletely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart\u201d), those annoying \u201ctype this\u201d tests to prove you are not a robot. But leaving it all to industry is not a long-term solution. For one thing, the defenses don\u2019t actually deter impersonation bots, but perversely reward whoever can beat them. And perhaps the greatest problem for a democracy is that companies like Facebook and Twitter lack a serious financial incentive to do anything about matters of public concern, like the millions of fake users who are corrupting the democratic process. Twitter estimates at least 27 million probably fake accounts; researchers suggest the real number is closer to 48 million, yet the company does little about the problem.The ideal anti-robot campaign would employ a mixed technological and legal approach. Improved robot detection might help us find the robot masters or potentially help national security unleash counterattacks, which can be necessary when attacks come from overseas. There may be room for deputizing private parties to hunt down bad robots. A simple legal remedy would be a \u201c Blade Runner\u201d law that makes it illegal to deploy any program that hides its real identity to pose as a human. Automated processes should be required to state, \u201cI am a robot.\u201d When dealing with a fake human, it would be nice to know.Using robots to fake support, steal tickets or crash democracy really is the kind of evil that science fiction writers were warning about. The use of robots takes advantage of the fact that political campaigns, elections and even open markets make humanistic assumptions, trusting that there is wisdom or at least legitimacy in crowds and value in public debate. But when support and opinion can be manufactured, bad or unpopular arguments can win not by logic but by a novel, dangerous form of force \u2014 the ultimate threat to every democracy.Tim Wu, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d is a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Runde at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who previously worked at the United States Agency for International Development.\u201cThe U.S. is not the strong, solitary economic power that it was in the past. It was so overwhelming in its economic power that it could almost unilaterally determine what was going to happen,\u201d said Tom Bernes, a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation who was previously a Canadian representative at international financial institutions. \u201cBut the world is changing.\u201dBoth institutions have worked to ingratiate themselves with the administration.Last week, Mr. Trump proclaimed his support for Mr. Kim, whose legitimacy came into question after his presidency was extended hurriedly ahead of the November election.The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative unveiled at the Group of 20 meeting came out of Ms. Trump\u2019s conversations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and then Mr. Kim. According to the World Bank, the idea was formally brought to the organization during a March meeting by a German official, who said the proposal came from the White House.The facility was set up with a speed unusual at the World Bank and will use the $325 million raised through donors to draw commercial finance. Its goal is to help women in developing countries gain access to the funding, technical assistance and networks needed to start businesses.While there are obvious governance concerns around Ms. Trump\u2019s role, the new project is viewed by some as a pragmatic exercise in courting the bank\u2019s largest shareholder: the United States government.\u201cThat\u2019s the job in some sense of the leadership of the banks, whether you like it or not, to keep their shareholders on board,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who previously served as assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to say the leadership of international organizations should ignore the politics of their nation members. It would be suicidal.\u201dDouglas Rediker, who represented the United States on the executive board of the I.M.F. under President Obama, pointed to the country\u2019s interests \u201cbeing openly prioritized by the I.M.F. in a way that you didn\u2019t see in 2016.\u201d\u201cThat is not either good or bad \u2014 it\u2019s a reflection of the institution\u2019s largest shareholder requesting a deeper dive on issues that are within the I.M.F. mandate and are meaningful to the U.S., and I don\u2019t think there is anything more shocking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIronically, you could argue the U.S. is asserting more of an affirmative agenda.\u201dHis appointment as deputy under secretary of the Treasury for international finance awaits Senate confirmation. And many other senior positions are yet to be filled with consequences for the pace of decision-making.\u201cBy failing to appoint officials to senior positions \u2014 to the Treasury, State Department \u2014 there is nobody for other governments to talk to on these issues,\u201d Mr. Bernes said.\u201cThis is the first G-20 where the United States has not been at the forefront of helping to shape the debate,\u201d he said.Republican administrations have historically questioned multilateral institutions. The I.M.F. is viewed as a lumbering relic bailing out reckless nations. The purpose of the World Bank, providing loans and technical assistance to low-income countries, comes into question as emerging markets more easily gain access to capital in global markets.Pointing to President George W.

{"Headline": "Manafort Was in Debt to Pro-Russia Interests, Cyprus Records Show", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial records filed last year in the secretive tax haven of Cyprus, where Paul J. Manafort kept bank accounts during his years working in Ukraine and investing with a Russian oligarch, indicate that he had been in debt to pro-Russia interests by as much as $17 million before he joined Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in March 2016.The money appears to have been owed by shell companies connected to Mr. Manafort\u2019s business activities in Ukraine when he worked as a consultant to the pro-Russia Party of Regions. The Cyprus documents obtained by The New York Times include audited financial statements for the companies, which were part of a complex web of more than a dozen entities that transferred millions of dollars among them in the form of loans, payments and fees.After The Times shared some of the documents with representatives of Mr. Manafort, a spokesman, Jason Maloni, did not address whether the debts might have existed at one time. But he maintained that the Cyprus records were \u201cstale and do not purport to reflect any current financial arrangements.\u201d\u201cManafort is not indebted to Mr. Deripaska or the Party of Regions, nor was he at the time he began working for the Trump campaign,\u201d Mr. Maloni said. \u201cThe broader point, which Mr. Manafort has maintained from the beginning, is that he did not collude with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.\u201d (Mr. Manafort resigned as campaign manager last August amid questions about his past work in Ukraine.)Still, the Cyprus documents offer the most detailed view yet into the murky financial world inhabited by Mr. Manafort in the years before he joined the Trump campaign.Mr. Manafort\u2019s Cyprus-related business activities are under scrutiny by investigators looking into his finances during and after his years as a consultant to the Party of Regions in Ukraine. He recently filed a long-overdue report with the Justice Department disclosing his lobbying efforts in Ukraine through early 2014, when his main client, President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine, was ousted in a popular uprising and fled to Russia.The byzantine nature of the transactions reflected in the Cyprus records obscures the reasons that money flowed among the various parties, and it is possible they were characterized as loans for another purpose, like avoiding taxes that would otherwise be owed on income or equity investments.One of the Manafort-related debts listed in the Cyprus records, totaling $7.8 million, was owed to Oguster Management Limited, a company in the British Virgin Islands connected to Mr. Deripaska. The debtor was a Cyprus company, LOAV Advisers, that the Deripaska court complaint says was set up by Mr. Manafort to make investments with Mr. Deripaska, a billionaire close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The loan is unsecured, bears 2 percent interest and has \u201cno specified repayment date,\u201d according to a financial statement for LOAV.The other debt, for $9.9 million, was owed to Lucicle Consultants, a Cyprus company that appears to have ties to a Party of Regions member of Parliament, Ivan Fursin. Lucicle, whose precise ownership is unclear, is linked to Mr. Fursin through another offshore entity, Mistaro Ventures, which is registered in St. Kitts and Nevis and listed on a government financial disclosure form that Mr. Fursin filed in Ukraine. Mistaro transferred millions to Lucicle in February 2012 shortly before Lucicle made the $9.9 million loan to Jesand L.L.C., a Delaware company that Mr. Manafort previously used to buy real estate in New York. The loan to Jesand was unsecured, with a 3.5 percent interest rate, and payable on demand.There is no indication from the financial statements that the loans had been repaid as of the time they were filed in December 2015. The statements contain a note saying that as of January 2014, the debts and assets for Lucicle and LOAV had been assigned to \u201ca related party,\u201d which is not identified. The records define related parties as entities that are under common control, suggesting that the assignment did not affect the ultimate debtors and creditors. The statements also said there had been no other changes after the financial reporting period covered by them, which was for the 2013 calendar year.A spokeswoman for Mr. Deripaska declined to comment. Mr. Deripaska appears to have stopped pursuing his court action against Mr. Manafort and his former investment partners, Rick Gates and Rick Davis, in late 2015. In addition to the $19 million he said he had invested with Mr. Manafort, Mr. Deripaska claimed he paid Mr. Manafort an additional $7.3 million in management fees.Mr. Manafort has previously said any payments he received for his Ukraine activities were aboveboard and made via wire transfers to an American bank. The Cyprus records suggest that at least some transactions originated with shell companies in tax havens like the Seychelles and the British Virgin Islands, and passed through financial institutions on Cyprus, including Hellenic Bank and Cyprus Popular Bank.Mr. Manafort\u2019s name does not show up in the Cyprus records. However, hints of his dealings in Ukraine appear throughout.A 23-page financial statement for a Cyprus shell, Black Sea View Limited, lists transactions that include one with Pericles Capital Partners. Both Black Sea View and Pericles Capital are identified in court papers filed by Mr. Deripaska in the Cayman Islands as part of the corporate structure that Mr. Manafort put together to invest in a Ukrainian telecommunications business, Black Sea Cable. The same statement also reports what are described as $9.2 million in loans received in 2012 from four other entities, including one controlled by two Seychelles companies, Intrahold A.G. and Monohold A.G., which Ukrainian authorities have asserted were involved in the looting of public assets by allies of the Yanukovych government. The Black Sea Cable business was controlled at one point by Monohold and Intrahold.Similarly, Manafort-connected entities appear in the financial records for Lucicle Consultants, the Cyprus shell that received financing from a company associated with Mr. Fursin, the Party of Regions politician in Ukraine. Mr. Fursin did not respond to a request for comment. Lucicle received money from Black Sea View and PEM Advisers Limited, another firm identified in court papers as controlled by Mr. Manafort. It also made the $9.9 million loan to Jesand L.L.C.Jesand appears to be a conflation of Jessica and Andrea, the names of Mr. Manafort\u2019s two daughters. In hacked text messages belonging to Andrea Manafort that were posted last year on a website used by Ukrainian hackers, Jesand is mentioned in the context of financial dealings involving the Manaforts. Jesand was used by Mr. Manafort and his daughter Andrea in 2007 to buy a Manhattan condominium for $2.5 million.Last year, while trying to salvage his investments with Mr. Yohai, Mr. Manafort embarked on a borrowing spree in the United States, obtaining mortgages totaling more than $20 million on properties controlled by him and his wife. The F.B.I. and the New York attorney general\u2019s office are investigating some of Mr. Manafort\u2019s real estate dealings, including the loans he obtained last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New G.O.P. Battle Begins as Republicans Look to Pass a Budget", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Reeling from the collapse of their plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Republican lawmakers are now trying to move on quickly to the next big thing: tax legislation.On Tuesday, they took the first step with a budget proposal that calls for reducing tax rates for businesses and individuals.But the failure of the health care plan complicates Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code. It also adds to the urgency Republicans face to secure a signature achievement in President Trump\u2019s first year in office. For months, Republican leaders in Congress have said that it was crucial to cut the taxes imposed by President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law so that they could introduce even deeper income tax cuts later on.Now those Affordable Care Act taxes will remain, and the ability of the party to coalesce around ambitious tax legislation is in doubt.The plan released on Tuesday as part of the House Budget Committee\u2019s 2018 budget resolution blueprint calls for consolidating tax brackets and cutting rates, repealing the alternative minimum tax and switching the United States from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, which would tax only the domestic income of corporations.It also calls for a $621.5 billion national defense budget for 2018 and $511 billon for nondefense spending. The most contentious part is at least $203 billion in cuts over a decade in \u201cmandatory\u201d spending on programs such as Medicare and Social Security. And it recommends repealing parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that ushered in financial regulations after the last recession. If enacted, it would result in a $6.5 trillion reduction in the federal deficit over a decade.The resolution is of particular importance this year because Republicans must pass it to unlock a procedural tool that would allow them to overhaul the tax code without the support of any Democrats. But it will not be easy to pass.The fact that the budget blueprint dictates that the rewrite of the tax code cannot add to the deficit could set up a clash between Republicans in Congress and the White House, which has been more open to temporary tax cuts that add to the deficit. Mr. Trump has promised the biggest tax cut in history.\u201cThat\u2019s a long way from talk about a large deficit-increasing tax cut,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group committed to educating the public on fiscal issues. \u201cI\u2019m very curious to see how the White House and conservatives who have been advocating for a tax cut react to this.\u201dThe cuts to entitlement programs in the proposal also represented a direct rebuke of Mr. Trump, who promised not to touch those plans.House Republicans were optimistic on Tuesday that their road map could become reality. \u201cIn past years, our proposals had little chance of becoming a reality because we faced a Democratic White House,\u201d said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee. \u201cBut now with a Republican Congress and a Republican administration, now is the time to put forward a governing document with real solutions to address our biggest challenges.\u201dMick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, praised the outline even though it differed from his fiscal vision. \u201cThe administration urges the House Budget Committee, the full House and the Senate to move forward on a pro-growth budget resolution that supports the administration\u2019s goals of a strong national defense, fiscal responsibility and sustained economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.However, the significant challenges awaiting the House budget effort were already evident this week. On Monday, Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he did not think the proposed budget could win full House approval. He said he first wanted it to include deeper spending cuts. He also wants more details and to be assured that the border-adjustment tax is not included.The House Budget Committee is scheduled to debate the plan on Wednesday, and any bill will have to be reconciled with the budget that the Senate eventually passes.The Senate also turned its attention to overhauling the tax code on Tuesday, when the Senate Finance Committee held its first tax hearing and questioned a bipartisan panel of former Treasury officials. It also held a separate nomination hearing for David J. Kautter, the nominee for assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.The challenges that Republicans face in getting tax reform done were again on display. Senators debated changes to provisions in the tax code, such as the deductibility of interest expenses for corporations and of state and local taxes for individuals, that many of their constituents hold dear. Some Democrats pushed for the creation of a new consumption tax \u2014 a tax potentially akin to national sales tax that is a nonstarter for most Republicans. Mr. Kautter said that as far as he was concerned, all options remained on the table.For their part, Democrats remain steadfast that the wealthiest Americans should not see their tax bills shrink. Predictably, they assailed the House Republican budget.\u201cHouse Republicans have devised a toxic budget whose sole purpose is to hand tax breaks to billionaires on the backs of seniors and hardworking Americans,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader. \u201cInstead of investing in good-paying jobs, the Republican budget would stack the deck even further against working families.\u201dDemocrats also urged Republicans to learn the lessons of the health care legislation experience and work together. It is not clear if the rancor over the health bill will make this more or less likely.At the hearing on Tuesday, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, implored Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, to commit to holding open hearings on tax legislation.Mr. Hatch smiled but was noncommital. \u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as temperatures here hovered around 120 degrees, the chances that anything might cool down appeared dim.\u201cI applaud the leadership of his highness, the emir of Qatar, for being the first to respond to President Trump\u2019s challenge at the Riyadh summit to stop the funding of terrorism,\u201d Mr. Tillerson at the news conference, adding, \u201cQatar, I think, has taken the initiative to move out on things that had been discussed but had not been brought to a conclusion, and to put in place a very, very strong agreement.\u201dFew in the region believe Qatar\u2019s government will accede to most of the demands. So far, one result of the embargo, which has squeezed the Qatari economy and put at risk a host of American priorities in the region, has been to push Qatar closer to Iran, which has stepped in with planeloads of fresh vegetables and other support.Before beginning this week\u2019s effort, Mr. Tillerson stopped by the World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul on Sunday to accept a lifetime achievement award for his 41-year tenure at Exxon Mobil. He retired as chief executive at the company to take the job as the nation\u2019s top diplomat.\u201cI miss all of you,\u201d he told the gathered oil executives. \u201cI miss you as colleagues, I miss you as partners, I miss you as competitors.\u201dHe may have also missed the way his trips here often concluded. For oilmen, the Middle East is a land of fortune and opportunity, and Mr. Tillerson struck some of the most important and lucrative deals of his career here. For secretaries of state, however, it is a place of frustration and failure, where tribal, religious and political differences have stymied some of the most persistent and patient diplomatic campaigns in American history.With Mr. Trump squarely on their side, Saudi Arabia and its allies have done little to resolve the dispute.But many crucial American policy priorities depend on Arab unity, including the defeat of the Islamic State and the rebuilding of devastated portions of Iraq and Syria. Qatar is home to the largest United States military base in the Middle East, while Bahrain hosts the Fifth Fleet, American installations caught in opposite sides of the dispute.Last week, after the State Department warned that the dispute could drag on for months and possibly intensify, Mr. Tillerson announced that he would travel to the region for talks.\u201cThe purpose of the trip is to explore the art of the possible of where a resolution can be found,\u201d said R. C. Hammond, a spokesman for Mr. Tillerson.But with failure all too likely, Mr. Hammond said that Mr. Tillerson was maintaining his distance and not trying to act as a mediator.\u201cNo, a mediator says this is what the final resolution is going to be, we\u2019ll decide it for you, that\u2019s a mediation,\u201d Mr. Hammond said, and then added: \u201cThe emir of Kuwait is leading these efforts. Our job is to make sure everybody continues to talk to each other.\u201dMr. Tillerson has largely sided with Qatar since the beginning.Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim that Qatar has an unusually bad record of funding terrorism has been met with skepticism among American diplomats, since the Saudis have long been the principal financier of mosques around the world that teach a stark form of Islam associated with extremism.The memorandum signed Tuesday with Qatar might make Saudi Arabia\u2019s claims that the dispute is all about terrorism funding more difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d Mr. Hammond said. \u201cThere are no clean hands here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Dominates in Iraq After U.S. \u2018Handed the Country Over\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTehran's TurnBAGHDAD \u2014 Walk into almost any market in Iraq and the shelves are filled with goods from Iran \u2014 milk, yogurt, chicken. Turn on the television and channel after channel broadcasts programs sympathetic to Iran.A new building goes up? It is likely that the cement and bricks came from Iran. And when bored young Iraqi men take pills to get high, the illicit drugs are likely to have been smuggled across the porous Iranian border.And that\u2019s not even the half of it.Across the country, Iranian-sponsored militias are hard at work establishing a corridor to move men and guns to proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon. And in the halls of power in Baghdad, even the most senior Iraqi cabinet officials have been blessed, or bounced out, by Iran\u2019s leadership.When the United States invaded Iraq 14 years ago to topple Saddam Hussein, it saw Iraq as a potential cornerstone of a democratic and Western-facing Middle East, and vast amounts of blood and treasure \u2014 about 4,500 American lives lost, more than $1 trillion spent \u2014 were poured into the cause.From Day 1, Iran saw something else: a chance to make a client state of Iraq, a former enemy against which it fought a war in the 1980s so brutal, with chemical weapons and trench warfare, that historians look to World War I for analogies. If it succeeded, Iraq would never again pose a threat, and it could serve as a jumping-off point to spread Iranian influence around the region.In that contest, Iran won, and the United States lost.Over the past three years, Americans have focused on the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq, returning more than 5,000 troops to the country and helping to force the militants out of Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul.But Iran never lost sight of its mission: to dominate its neighbor so thoroughly that Iraq could never again endanger it militarily, and to use the country to effectively control a corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean.\u201cIranian influence is dominant,\u201d said Hoshyar Zebari, who was ousted last year as finance minister because, he said, Iran distrusted his links to the United States. \u201cIt is paramount.\u201dThe country\u2019s dominance over Iraq has heightened sectarian tensions around the region, with Sunni states, and American allies, like Saudi Arabia mobilizing to oppose Iranian expansionism. But Iraq is only part of Iran\u2019s expansion project; it has also used soft and hard power to extend its influence in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, and throughout the region.Iran is a Shiite state, and Iraq, a Shiite majority country, was ruled by an elite Sunni minority before the American invasion. The roots of the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, going back almost 1,400 years, lie in differences over the rightful leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. But these days, it is about geopolitics as much as religion, with the divide expressed by different states that are adversaries, led by Saudi Arabia on one side and Iran on the other.Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq is not just ascendant, but diverse, projecting into military, political, economic and cultural affairs.At some border posts in the south, Iraqi sovereignty is an afterthought. Busloads of young militia recruits cross into Iran without so much as a document check. They receive military training and are then flown to Syria, where they fight under the command of Iranian officers in defense of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Passing in the other direction, truck drivers pump Iranian products \u2014 food, household goods, illicit drugs \u2014 into what has become a vital and captive market.Iran tips the scales to its favor in every area of commerce. In the city of Najaf, it even picks up the trash, after the provincial council there awarded a municipal contract to a private Iranian company. One member of the council, Zuhair al-Jibouri, resorted to a now-common Iraqi aphorism: \u201cWe import apples from Iran so we can give them away to Iranian pilgrims.\u201dPolitically, Iran has a large number of allies in Iraq\u2019s Parliament who can help secure its goals. And its influence over the choice of interior minister, through a militia and political group the Iranians built up in the 1980s to oppose Mr. Hussein, has given it substantial control over that ministry and the federal police.Perhaps most crucial, Parliament passed a law last year that effectively made the constellation of Shiite militias a permanent fixture of Iraq\u2019s security forces. This ensures Iraqi funding for the groups while effectively maintaining Iran\u2019s control over some of the most powerful units.Now, with new parliamentary elections on the horizon, Shiite militias have begun organizing themselves politically for a contest that could secure even more dominance for Iran over Iraq\u2019s political system.To gain advantage on the airwaves, new television channels set up with Iranian money and linked to Shiite militias broadcast news coverage portraying Iran as Iraq\u2019s protector and the United States as a devious interloper.Partly in an effort to contain Iran, the United States has indicated that it will keep troops behind in Iraq after the battle against the Islamic State. American diplomats have worked to emphasize the government security forces\u2019 role in the fighting, and to shore up a prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, who has seemed more open to the United States than to Iran.But after the United States\u2019 abrupt withdrawal of troops in 2011, American constancy is still in question here \u2014 a broad failure of American foreign policy, with responsibility shared across three administrations.Iran has been playing a deeper game, parlaying extensive religious ties with Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority and a much wider network of local allies, as it makes the case that it is Iraq\u2019s only reliable defender.Iran\u2019s great project in eastern Iraq may not look like much: a 15-mile stretch of dusty road, mostly gravel, through desert and scrub near the border in Diyala Province.But it is an important new leg of Iran\u2019s path through Iraq to Syria, and what it carries \u2014 Shiite militiamen, Iranian delegations, trade goods and military supplies \u2014 is its most valuable feature.It is a piece of what analysts and Iranian officials say is Iran\u2019s most pressing ambition: to exploit the chaos of the region to project influence across Iraq and beyond. Eventually, analysts say, Iran could use the corridor, established on the ground through militias under its control, to ship weapons and supplies to proxies in Syria, where Iran is an important backer of Mr. Assad, and to Lebanon and its ally Hezbollah.At the border to the east is a new crossing built and secured by Iran. Like the relationship between the two countries, it is lopsided.The checkpoint\u2019s daily traffic includes up to 200 Iranian trucks, carrying fruit and yogurt, concrete and bricks, into Iraq. In the offices of Iraqi border guards, the candies and soda offered to guests come from Iran.No loaded trucks go the other way.\u201cIraq doesn\u2019t have anything to offer Iran,\u201d Vahid Gachi, the Iranian official in charge of the crossing, said in an interview in his office, as lines of tractor-trailers poured into Iraq. \u201cExcept for oil, Iraq relies on Iran for everything.\u201dThe border post is also a critical transit point for Iran\u2019s military leaders to send weapons and other supplies to proxies fighting the Islamic State in Iraq.After the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, swept across Diyala and neighboring areas in 2014, Iran made clearing the province, a diverse area of Sunnis and Shiites, a priority.It marshaled a huge force of Shiite militias, many trained in Iran and advised on the ground by Iranian officials. After a quick victory, Iranians and their militia allies set about securing their next interests here: marginalizing the province\u2019s Sunni minority and securing a path to Syria. Iran has fought aggressively to keep its ally Mr. Assad in power in order to retain land access to its most important spinoff in the region, Hezbollah, the military and political force that dominates Lebanon and threatens Israel.Uday al-Khadran, the Shiite mayor of Khalis District in Diyala, is a member of the Badr Organization, an Iraqi political party and militia established by Tehran in the 1980s to fight against Mr. Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war.On an afternoon earlier this year, he spread a map across his desk and proudly discussed how he helped build the road, which he said was ordered by General Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the branch of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps responsible for foreign operations. General Suleimani secretly directed Iran\u2019s policy in Iraq after the American invasion in 2003, and was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in attacks carried out by militias under his control.\u201cI love Qassim Suleimani more than my children,\u201d he said.Mr. Khadran said the general\u2019s new road would eventually be a shortcut for religious pilgrims from Iran to reach Samarra, Iraq, the location of an important shrine.But he also acknowledged the route\u2019s greater strategic significance as part of a corridor secured by Iranian proxies that extends across central and northern Iraq. The connecting series of roads skirts the western city of Mosul and stretches on to Tal Afar, an Islamic State-controlled city where Iranian-backed militias and Iranian advisers have set up a base at an airstrip on the outskirts.\u201cDiyala is the passage to Syria and Lebanon, and this is very important to Iran,\u201d said Ali al-Daini, the Sunni chairman of the provincial council there.Closer to Syria, Iranian-allied militias moved west of Mosul as the battle against the Islamic State unfolded there in recent months. The militias captured the town of Baaj, and then proceeded to the Syrian border, putting Iran on the cusp of completing its corridor.Back east, in Diyala, Mr. Daini said he had been powerless to halt what he described as Iran\u2019s dominance in the province.When Mr. Daini goes to work, he said, he has to walk by posters of Iran\u2019s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, outside the council building.Now, Diyala has become a showcase for how Iran views Shiite ascendancy as critical to its geopolitical goals.\u201cIran is smarter than America,\u201d said Nijat al-Taie, a Sunni member of the provincial council and an outspoken critic of Iran, which she calls the instigator of several assassination attempts against her. \u201cThey achieved their goals on the ground. America didn\u2019t protect Iraq. They just toppled the regime and handed the country over to Iran.\u201dThe lives of General Suleimani and other senior leaders in Tehran were shaped by the prolonged war with Iraq in the 1980s. The conflict left hundreds of thousands dead on both sides, and General Suleimani spent much of the war at the front, swiftly rising in rank as so many officers were killed.\u201cThe Iran-Iraq war was the formative experience for all of Iran\u2019s leaders,\u201d said Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization. \u201cFrom Suleimani all the way down. It was their \u2018never again\u2019 moment.\u201dA border dispute over the Shatt al Arab waterway that was a factor in the hostilities has still not been resolved, and the legacy of the war\u2019s brutality has influenced the Iranian government ever since, from its pursuit of nuclear weapons to its policy in Iraq.\u201cThis is a permanent scar in their mind,\u201d said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a lawmaker and former national security adviser. \u201cThey are obsessed with Baathism, Saddam and the Iran-Iraq war.\u201dMore than anything else, analysts say, it is the scarring legacy of that war that has driven Iranian ambitions to dominate Iraq.Particularly in southern Iraq, where the population is mostly Shiite, signs of Iranian influence are everywhere.Iranian-backed militias are the defenders of the Shiite shrines in the cities of Najaf and Karbala that drive trade and tourism. In local councils, Iranian-backed political parties have solid majorities, and campaign materials stress relationships with Shiite saints and Iranian clerics.If the Iraqi government were stronger, said Mustaq al-Abady, a businessman from just outside Najaf, \u201cthen maybe we could open our factories instead of going to Iran.\u201d He said his warehouse was crowded with Iranian imports because his government had done nothing to promote a private sector, police its borders or enforce customs duties.Raad Fadhil al-Alwani, a merchant in Hilla, another southern city, imports cleaning supplies and floor tiles from Iran. He slaps \u201cMade in Iraq\u201d labels in Arabic on bottles of detergent, but the reality is that he owns a factory in Iran because labor is cheaper there.\u201cI feel like I am destroying the economy of Iraq,\u201d he said. But he insists that Iraqi politicians, by deferring to Iranian pressure and refusing to support local industry, have made it hard to do anything else.Najaf attracts millions of Iranian pilgrims each year visiting the golden-domed shrine of Imam Ali, the first Shiite imam. Iranian construction workers \u2014 many of whom are viewed as Iranian spies by Iraqi officials \u2014 have also flocked to the city to renovate the shrine and build hotels.In Babil Province, according to local officials, militia leaders have taken over a government project to set up security cameras along strategic roads. The project had been granted to a Chinese company before the militias intervened, and now the army and the local police have been sidelined from it, said Muqdad Omran, an Iraqi Army captain in the area.Iran\u2019s pre-eminence in the Iraqi south has not come without resentment. Iraqi Shiites share a faith with Iran, but they also hold close their other identities as Iraqis and Arabs.\u201cIraq belongs to the Arab League, not to Iran,\u201d said Sheikh Fadhil al-Bidayri, a cleric at the religious seminary in Najaf. \u201cShiites are a majority in Iraq, but a minority in the world. As long as the Iranian government is controlling the Iraqi government, we don\u2019t have a chance.\u201dIn this region where the Islamic State\u2019s military threat has never encroached, Iran\u2019s security concerns are mostly being addressed by economic manipulation, Iraqi officials say. Trade in the south is often financed by Iran with credit, and incentives are offered to Iraqi traders to keep their cash in Iranian banks.\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the Iranians to maintain corruption in Iraq,\u201d he said.For decades, Iran smuggled guns and bomb-making supplies through the vast swamps of southern Iraq. And young men were brought back and forth across the border, from one safe house to another \u2014 recruits going to Iran for training, and then back to Iraq to fight. At first the enemy was Mr. Hussein; later, it was the Americans.Today, agents of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards openly recruit fighters in the Shiite-majority cities of southern Iraq. Buses filled with recruits easily pass border posts that officials say are essentially controlled by Iran \u2014 through its proxies on the Iraqi side, and its own border guards on the other.While Iran has built up militias to fight against the Islamic State in Iraq, it has also mobilized an army of disaffected young Shiite Iraqi men to fight on its behalf in Syria.Mohammad Kadhim, 31, is one of those foot soldiers for Iran, having served three tours in Syria. The recruiting pitch, he said, is mostly based in faith, to defend Shiite shrines in Syria. But Mr. Kadhim said he and his friends signed up more out of a need for jobs.\u201cI was just looking for money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the youth I met fighting in Syria do it for the money.\u201dHe signed up with a Revolutionary Guards recruiter in Najaf, and then was bused through southern Iraq and into Iran, where he underwent military training near Tehran.There, he said, Iranian officers delivered speeches invoking the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the revered seventh-century Shiite figure whose death at the hands of a powerful Sunni army became the event around which Shiite spirituality would revolve. The same enemies of the Shiites who killed the imam are now in Syria and Iraq, the officers told the men.After traveling to Iran, Mr. Kadhim came home for a break and then was shipped to Syria, where Hezbollah operatives trained him in sniper tactics.Iran\u2019s emphasis on defending the Shiite faith has led some here to conclude that its ultimate goal is to bring about an Iranian-style theocracy in Iraq. But there is a persistent sense that it just would not work in Iraq, which has a much larger native Sunni population and tradition, and Iraq\u2019s clerics in Najaf, including Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the world\u2019s pre-eminent Shiite spiritual leader, oppose the Iranian system.But Iran is taking steps to translate militia power into political power, much as it did with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and militia leaders have begun political organizing before next year\u2019s parliamentary elections.In April, Qais al-Khazali, a Shiite militia leader, delivered a speech to an audience of Iraqi college students, railing against the United States and the nefarious plotting of Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Then, a poet who was part of Mr. Khazali\u2019s entourage stood up and began praising General Suleimani.For the students, that was the last straw. Chants of \u201cIran out! Iran out!\u201d began. Scuffles broke out between students and Mr. Khazali\u2019s bodyguards, who fired their rifles into the air just outside the building.\u201cThe thing that really provoked us was the poet,\u201d said Mustafa Kamal, a student at the University of al-Qadisiya in Diwaniya, in southern Iraq, who participated in the protest.Mr. Kamal and his fellow students quickly learned how dangerous it could be to stand up to Iran these days.First, militiamen began threatening to haul them off. Then media outlets linked to the militias went after them, posting their pictures and calling them Baathists and enemies of Shiites. When a mysterious car appeared near Mr. Kamal\u2019s house, his mother panicked that militiamen were coming for her son.Then, finally, Mr. Kamal, a law student, and three of his friends received notices from the school saying they had been suspended for a year.\u201cWe thought we had only one hope, the university,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then Iran also interfered there.\u201dMr. Khazali, whose political and militia organization, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, is deeply connected with Iran, has been on a speaking tour on campuses across Iraq as part of an effort to organize political support for next year\u2019s national election. This has raised fears that Iran is trying not only to deepen its influence within Iraqi education, but also to transform militias into outright political and social organizations, much as it did with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201cIt\u2019s another type of Iranian infiltration and the expansion of Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d said Beriwan Khailany, a lawmaker and member of Parliament\u2019s higher-education committee. \u201cIran wants to control the youth, and to teach them the Iranian beliefs, through Iraqis who are loyal to Iran.\u201dWhen a group of Qatari falcon hunters, \u201cincluding members of the royal family, were kidnapped in 2015 while on safari in the southern deserts of Iraq, Qatar called Iran and its militia allies \u2014 not the central government in Baghdad.For Mr. Abadi, the prime minister, the episode was an embarrassing demonstration of his government\u2019s weakness at the hands of Iran, whose proxy militia Kataibb Hezbollah was believed to be behind the kidnapping.So when the hostage negotiations were about to end, Mr. Abadi pushed back.Around noon on a day in April, a government jet from Qatar landed in Baghdad, carrying a delegation of diplomats and 500 million euros stuffed into 23 black boxes.The hunters were soon on their way home, but the ransom did not go to the Iranian-backed militiamen who had abducted the Qataris; the cash ended up in a central bank vault in Baghdad.The seizure of the money had been ordered by Mr. Abadi, who was furious at the prospect of militias, and their Iranian and Hezbollah benefactors, being paid so richly right under the Iraqi government\u2019s nose.\u201cHundreds of millions to armed groups?\u201d Mr. Abadi said in a public rant. \u201cIs this acceptable?\u201dIn Iraq, the kidnapping episode was seen as a violation of the country\u2019s sovereignty and emblematic of Iran\u2019s suffocating power over the Iraqi state.In a post on Twitter, Mr. Zebari, the former finance minister, who was previously foreign minister, called the episode a \u201ctravesty.\u201dMr. Zebari knows firsthand the power of Iran over the Iraqi state.Last year, he said, he was ousted as finance minister because Iran perceived him as being too close to the United States. The account was verified by a member of Parliament who was involved in the removal of Mr. Zebari, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Iran.Mr. Zebari, who recounted the events in an interview from his mountainside mansion in northern Iraq, said that when President Barack Obama met with Mr. Abadi last September at the United Nations, the American leader personally lobbied to save Mr. Zebari\u2019s job. Even that was not enough.Mr. Abadi now finds himself in a difficult position. If he makes any move that can be seen as confrontational toward Iran, or as positioning himself closer to the United States, it could place a cloud over his political future.\u201cHe had two options: to be with the Americans or with the Iranians,\u201d said Izzat Shahbander, a prominent Iraqi Shiite leader who once lived in exile in Iran while Mr. Hussein was in power. \u201cAnd he chose to be with the Americans.\u201dMr. Abadi, who took office in 2014 with the support of both the United States and Iran, has seemed more emboldened to push back against Iranian pressure since President Trump took office.Some are seeing an American troop commitment as a chance to revisit the 2011 withdrawal of United States forces that seemingly opened a door for Iran.When American officials in Iraq began the slow wind-down of the military mission there, in 2009, some diplomats in Baghdad were cautiously celebrating one achievement: Iran seemed to be on its heels, its influence in the country waning.\u201cOver the last year, Iran has lost the strategic initiative in Iraq,\u201d one diplomat wrote in a cable, later released by WikiLeaks.But other cables sent warnings back to Washington that were frequently voiced by Iraqi officials they spoke to: that if the Americans left, then Iran would fill the vacuum.Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, said that if the United States left again after the Islamic State was defeated, \u201cit would be effectively just giving the Iranians a free rein.\u201dBut many Iraqis say the Iranians already have free rein. And while the Trump administration has indicated that it will pay closer attention to Iraq as a means to counter Iran, the question is whether it is too late.\u201cIran is not going to sit silent and do nothing,\u201d said Sami al-Askari, a senior Shiite politician who has good relationships with both the Iranians and Americans. \u201cThey have many means. Frankly, the Americans can\u2019t do anything.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted Ali Vaez, an analyst at the International Crisis Group. He described the Iran-Iraq war as \u201cthe formative experience for all of Iran\u2019s leaders,\u201d not \u201cthe formidable experience.\u201dFalih Hassan and Omar al-Jawoshy contributed reporting from Baghdad, and employees of The New York Times from Diyala Province, Hilla and Najaf.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raymond Sackler, Psychopharmacology Pioneer and Philanthropist, Dies at 97", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Raymond Sackler, a pioneer in psychopharmacology, a medicinal products entrepreneur and a leading philanthropist whose family made a fortune from the opioid painkiller OxyContin, died on Monday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 97.His death was confirmed by his wife, Beverly.Dr. Sackler was the last survivor among three brothers \u2014 all psychiatrist sons of Brooklyn grocers \u2014 whose scientific and marketing skills transformed a tiny Greenwich Village company founded in the 19th century into a global pharmaceutical giant known as Purdue Pharma, now headquartered in Stamford, Conn.Last year, the Sacklers were ranked 19th among \u201cAmerica\u2019s richest families\u201d by Forbes magazine, with assets estimated at $18 billion.They were major benefactors who helped finance the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (home to the Temple of Dendur), the Freer and Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, British cultural institutions, schools in Israel and scores of scientific, academic and cultural programs.In 1971, one of thousands of minor planets discovered by the Palomar-Leiden Survey, an American and Dutch joint effort, was named for Beverly and Raymond Sackler to celebrate their commitment to astronomical research. Dr. Sackler was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1995 for his contributions to science and the arts.\u201cRaymond was a tremendous supporter of basic science and of young people doing research in basic science,\u201d Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, a Nobel Prize-winning professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. \u201cHis main interest was the intersection of mathematical, engineering and physical sciences with biomedical science\u201d \u2014 an emerging field known as convergence science.OxyContin, introduced in 1995, was Purdue Pharma\u2019s breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that Arthur Sackler had pioneered decades earlier, the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.By 2001, prescriptions for OxyContin were generating more than $1.5 billion a year \u2014 surpassing sales of Viagra \u2014 and accounted for some 80 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.OxyContin, made with a synthetic version of morphine, was said to be nonaddictive because in the form of long-acting tablets, it released its active ingredient slowly.But the time-release effect could be defeated by crushing the tablets and snorting the powder, or by smoking it, or by adding water and injecting it \u2014 all for an immediate, sometimes heroinlike, high.Federal regulators accused Purdue Pharma of misleading consumers when it asserted that OxyContin was less likely than traditional narcotics to be abused.In 2007, the company agreed to pay $600 million to resolve the federal charges, although its executives insisted that they had adequately informed doctors and consumers about the potential for drug abuse and had responded quickly to reports of overdose deaths.They also said they had contributed to independent research on pain to guard against rampant overprescribing.\u201cDuring the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again,\u201d the company said at the time of the settlement.Several company officials pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of misbranding and were fined more than $34 million. The Sacklers personally were never formally accused of wrongdoing.Raymond Raphael Sackler was born on Feb. 16, 1920, in Brooklyn to Isaac Sackler and the former Sophie Ziesel, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who ran a grocery store.After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he earned a bachelor of science degree from New York University in 1938.At a time when medical schools in New York imposed quotas on the number of Jewish students they would admit, Raymond Sackler pursued his medical degree at Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, where he also joined the British Home Guard and served as a plane spotter during World War II. He graduated from Middlesex University Medical School in Waltham, Mass. (It closed later in the 1940s.)In 1944, Dr. Sackler married the former Beverly Feldman, who survives him. Survivors also include their two sons, Richard and Jonathan.The brothers founded the Creedmoor Institute of Psychobiological Studies at the state hospital in Queens Village, N.Y. (Raymond and Mortimer, who were studying skin burns for the Atomic Energy Commission there, were dismissed in 1953 when they refused to sign an Army loyalty oath requiring them to report participants who engaged in conversations deemed subversive.)Early on, the three brothers \u201chelped pioneer research of the biology of psychiatric illnesses,\u201d BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) wrote in 2011, \u201cresearch that helped open the door decades later toward drug treatments.\u201dIt was Arthur Sackler, a trailblazer in medical advertising, who financed the purchase of a small Greenwich Village drug manufacturer, the Purdue Frederick Company, in 1952, according to the book \u201cPain Killer: A \u2018Wonder\u2019 Drug\u2019s Trail of Addiction and Death\u201d (2003), by Barry Meier, a reporter for The New York Times. Raymond and Mortimer became co-chairmen.The company\u2019s products included an ear wax remover, a laxative, a \u201cmetabolic cerebral tonic\u201d called Gray\u2019s Glycerine (its formula was 11 percent alcohol) and the antiseptic Betadine, the familiar orange disinfectant smeared on patients\u2019 skin before surgery. (In 1969, the astronaut Neil Armstrong decontaminated the Apollo landing module with Betadine after his moon walk.)The company began experimenting with generic oxycodone, which was invented in Germany during World War I, to create a time-release formula that would spread the analgesic narcotic\u2019s effects over 12 hours and, among other things, allow pain sufferers to sleep through the night.Before developing OxyContin, the company, in 1984, created MS Contin, an extended-release, morphine-based drug to relieve cancer pain.The Sacklers were benefactors of, among other institutions, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University, the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Tel Aviv, the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Gallery for Assyrian Art at the Metropolitan Museum, Leiden University in the Netherlands, Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, the British Museum, and the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Medical Research Center at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Oneonta\u2019s Aging Downtown, a $10 Million Face-Lift", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byONEONTA, N.Y. \u2014 Amid a handful of whimsical businesses like Green Toad Bookstore and the Yellow Deli, this city\u2019s downtown still emits a listless feel, with signage that, in some cases, is so old that it seems intentionally retro.The landmark Bresee\u2019s department store, an Oneonta anchor that opened in 1899, closed more than two decades ago, leaving a retail void on Main Street. And more than one-fifth of the city\u2019s approximately 14,000 residents live in poverty, according to city officials.The challenges facing Oneonta, in the northern foothills of the Catskill Mountains, mirror those confronting a lot of urban centers across New York in the decades since manufacturing and related businesses started their long decline.But now, Oneonta is poised to make some strategic changes to its downtown in the hope of attracting new residents and businesses. To that end, it was one of 10 cities, from every region of the state, selected to each receive $10 million in state funding last year from a program called the Downtown Revitalization Initiative. A new roster of 10 cities will soon be chosen for the next round of funding.Howard Zemsky, the president and chief executive of Empire State Development, the state economic development agency, said that by targeting downtowns, the state was seeking to reverse the steady brain drain of young people to places like Brooklyn and Boston.\u201cIf you think about upstate for a moment, the cities have lost a disproportionate share of young people over many decades,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said. Business leaders, he said, cite the challenge of luring employees to work and live upstate as a main obstacle to recruiting talent.\u201cYou might think they are going to talk about taxes or something else, but they often talk about support for downtown revitalization,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployees want to see cool downtowns with loft apartments and historic buildings that have been rehabbed. So we are making a very purposeful effort to help revitalize downtowns of cities across upstate.\u201dThe mayor of Oneonta, Gary Herzig, a Democrat and a native of Queens, is all too familiar with the trend. His daughter, who grew up in Oneonta, made a beeline for Brooklyn after graduating from law school. Mr. Herzig has also heard from the major employers in Oneonta \u2014 namely the State University of New York College at Oneonta and Hartwick College \u2014 that the lack of attractive apartments downtown was a deterrent in hiring.And Mr. Herzig and other city officials have searched for four months to find a place for the new city manager, who is coming from Michigan, to live downtown, his one requirement.\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky in that our downtown is beautiful and historic and it\u2019s mostly still intact,\u201d Mr. Herzig said. \u201cWe are the largest city in a 50- to 60-mile radius. Really what we need are more people to live in our downtown, to be visiting our downtown and to work downtown.\u201dAfter applying for the state grant, Oneonta commissioned a study that identified the need for 100 units of new housing in the second and third floors of the century-old brick buildings lining Main Street. Some of those floors are occupied by students, but many sit empty, and landlords said the cost of renovating them would be too high given the relatively low rents in Oneonta.Of the $10 million in state aid, Oneonta plans to use $2.6 million to provide so-called gap funding to defray some of the cost for landlords undertaking renovations. That money will also help pay for improvements to storefronts and signage.Mr. Herzig is confident that if property owners renovate their buildings, renters will come. He pointed to the rehabilitation of the Bresee\u2019s building; a few years ago, smart-looking apartments were carved out of the old space.\u201cThe Bresee\u2019s building was our first attempt at bringing market-rate housing downtown, and there were many skeptics,\u201d Mr. Herzig said. \u201cThey said families and working adults would not want to live downtown. But now there\u2019s a waiting list.\u201dOneonta also plans to use some of the grant to expand the downtown through a new food and beverage innovation center on nearby Market Street, which will feature a commercial kitchen, classrooms and a small brewery.The center would be a resource for the many organic food producers and craft breweries that have sprung up in the region. Plans call for the demolition of a long-abandoned Ford dealership, where a new structure would rise in its place. Oneonta had previously received $4.5 million from the state toward the acquisition and construction costs of the food and beverage project.Other projects that will tap the state funds include the renovation of an unsightly parking garage off Main Street with a more handsome facade that could accommodate new retailers. And Oneonta plans to open a passageway between Main and Market Streets to ease pedestrian access.\u201cThis initiative jump-starts our downtowns so they can be the economic engines we know they can be,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement.Some urban planning experts question the initiative. Donald H. Dutkowsky, a professor of economics in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, said some of the winning cities were not the most distressed in the state. Moreover, he said, the $10 million award would go only so far.\u201cI always regarded Glens Falls as a healthy small city and Westbury \u2014 I have stayed there, and I don\u2019t remember seeing much of any empty storefronts,\u201d Dr. Dutkowsky said.\u201cThe thing to understand is this is window dressing,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is kind of like touch-up paint for the downtown. But these are all cities that are O.K. economically relative to New York State standards, and so they don\u2019t need a major heart transplant.\u201dMayor Herzig agreed that $10 million would not transform Oneonta on its own, but his hope is to leverage private investment with the state money. As to the question of need, the Downtown Revitalization Initiative\u2019s criteria for applicants specified recent or impending job growth \u2014 in other words, cities that already had some momentum.\u201cWhen the government announced the competition, we were already going full speed ahead,\u201d Mr. Herzig said. \u201cOne of the reasons we were successful was we didn\u2019t have to come up with ideas. We had done considerable studying, research and planning toward the creation of a revitalized downtown.\u201dHe said the projects to be financed with the state money could, in time, persuade more graduates of Oneonta\u2019s two colleges to put down roots.\u201cI do believe that millennials are looking for the perfect neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Carrington, 47, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make sacrifices when it comes to a coffee or a bookstore or a place to buy clothing. I would love to see more reasons for young graduating students to make Oneonta their home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Avoid Civil War in Venezuela", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSince the plebiscite, Venezuela\u2019s opposition has taken steps toward establishing a parallel government. This might remain a symbolic initiative. But if the opposition continues down this road, itwill soon be looking for international recognition and funding, and will at least implicitly be asserting the parallel government\u2019s claim to the legitimate monopoly on the use of force. After that itwill seek what every government wants: weapons to defend itself. If it succeeds, Venezuela could plunge into a civil war that will make the current conflict seem like high school fisticuffs.The response of the Trump administration has been to suggest that it is looking to add names to the existing program of United States sanctions, and is considering broader economic sanctions. But such unilateral sanctions will almost certainly make Venezuela\u2019s already dire situation worse.One of the people apparently next to be added is Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez. He has long been considered a potential weak link within the regime and has been treated with some suspicion by Mr. Maduro. If Mr. Padrino is put on the list, the president will be able to count on his loyalty to the very end.Punishing Venezuela\u2019s oil industry would be much worse. It would impose significant suffering on Venezuelan citizens, many of whom are now hanging on only by a thread, and potentially cause a refugee crisis. Mr. Maduro and his inner circle will continue to eat well and will use United States sanctions to fortify the main trope they use to explain their governance disaster: The United States and other imperial powers are engaging in an economic war against Venezuela. Such a measure would also encourage its neighbors to rally around Venezuela in solidarity and could potentially make the country into a Russian client state. United States economic sanctions would likely bolster Chavismo in Venezuela for the next 55 years, just as they did for the Castros in Cuba.So what can be done? The Organization of American States discussion helped focus attention on Venezuela but has run its course. At this point, any proposals that the O.A.S. puts forward will simply be rejected by the Maduro government. What must happen is much simpler than an O.A.S. vote. A group of friends needs to emerge from an initiative by four to six Latin American countries.There are no perfect partners; all relevant countries are either too close to the Maduro government or too close to the opposition.But nations such as Uruguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador could work together on a package that appeals to both sides. Perhaps a European country with a known trajectory for mediation and conflict resolution could provide some external input. Special representatives from the Vatican, the United Nations or the European Union could also be important participants in a negotiation, especially in monitoring fulfillment of any agreements that are reached.Negotiations should take place outside Venezuela, perhaps through shuttle diplomacy. They have to include an exit plan for Chavista leaders and assurances that the still considerable support for Chavismo in Venezuela will receive representation.The United States must stay at the margins. The Trump administration can certainly do a lot to facilitate logistics and diplomacy around the negotiations. However, it must refrain from trying to lead and must resist adopting distracting unilateral actions.Such an effort should be backed by a threat of consequences. Countries in the region need to coordinate and speak with one voice, saying they will not recognize as legitimate Mr. Maduro\u2019s Constituent Assembly, the Constitution it writes, nor the government it creates. This will make it difficult for Venezuela to get financing and make clear to the Maduro government\u2019s leaders that they are better off negotiating. Any sanctions to be considered must be collective, if not from within a multilateral agency then from a significant group of countries in the region.In the end, this problem has to be resolved by Venezuelans themselves. But if major players in the region can make clear that Mr. Maduro\u2019s crass power grab is unacceptable at the same time that they are proposing a way forward, it could lead to a breakthrough.David Smilde is professor of sociology at Tulane University and a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The North Fork Has a New Name: NoFo", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith entry-level homes priced at about $500,000, the North Fork continues to be a more affordable alternative for buyers looking for a second home on the East End of Long Island.While the 30-mile peninsula doesn\u2019t offer the oceanfront access that the Hamptons do, its array of waterfront possibilities includes creeks, canals, rivers and bays, not to mention Long Island Sound. Many buyers here are looking for a less expensive and more low-key alternative to the South Fork. While the area once attracted mainly older homeowners from \u201cup the island,\u201d the term locals use in reference to Nassau and western Suffolk Counties, it now draws younger buyers, many from Manhattan and Brooklyn.The North Fork\u2019s casual, recreation-friendly lifestyle is often a selling point for these buyers, said Nicholas Planamento, a broker with Town & Country Real Estate who uses the acronym NoFo to convey the region\u2019s urban-chic-meets-country-casual vibe. Newcomers often seek both New York convenience and rural comfort. Case in point: Richard Kasnia and Leah Zara, an Upper West Side couple who closed on a 3,000-square-foot contemporary house in Southold for about $1.2 million last month.Ms. Zara is currently overseeing a clutch of contractors working on electrical upgrades, plumbing and bathroom improvements, along with the installation of new flooring, wireless security and smart appliances. Mr. Kasnia meanwhile has been out shopping for a boat he plans to dock in the canal that laps at their backyard and flows into Peconic Bay.\u201cLeah spent a lot of time on the Jersey Shore growing up, and feels right at home here,\u201d Mr. Kasnia said. \u201cShe still has many friends from there. I\u2019m sure quite a few of them will be visiting. They\u2019ll probably want to live on the boat.\u201dOther lifestyle attractions are the local food sourcing, the dock-to-table dining choices, the proximity of vineyards and the pervasive sense of living history. \u201cThe descendants of the original settlers of the North Fork are still living here and farming here,\u201d said Mr. Planamento, a local history buff. \u201cAt the farmstand down the road, you buy tomatoes from someone whose family has farmed that land since the 1600s. When you can touch and taste your heritage, that\u2019s the essence of NoFo.\u201d\u201cPeople are coming to the North Fork at earlier stages in their lives,\u201d said Sheri Winter Clarry, a broker with the Corcoran Group. \u201cPrices are generally lower here, so the lifestyle you want for yourself and your family is likely within reach.\u201d\u201cThe North Fork is not the Hamptons,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not about glitz.\u201dThe median home price on the North Fork is $487,500, with some waterfront properties going for under $1 million, said Judi Desiderio, the chief executive of Town & Country Real Estate. Over all, she said, median prices on the North Fork are about half what they are on the South Fork.Surging demand reflects regional promotional efforts. \u201cPeople come from across the tristate area to visit the vineyards and go pumpkin picking with their families,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople spend these bucolic days here in the summer and fall, then return to look at real estate.\u201dSherry Thomas, a landscape designer, and her partner, Lynn Witt, a New York City employee, came to Orient \u2014 at the peninsula\u2019s eastern tip \u2014 some 10 years ago, after selling their Victorian house in San Francisco to finance a move to Manhattan and eventually a second home here. Having once raised sheep on the Mendocino coastline, Ms. Thomas found echoes of Northern California in Orient.She and Ms. Witt have established close friendships in the community. She recalled that at a July 4 celebration last year, Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court justice, was renting a house nearby and was invited to read the Declaration of Independence aloud. Another neighbor put on a private fireworks display.Despite the region\u2019s expanding appeal, brokers describe a lack of available inventory as a brake on growth. \u201cDemand is way up; inventory is way down. When the right property hits the market, there\u2019s a feeding frenzy,\u201d said Tom Scalia, who owns Century 21 Albertson Realty in Southold. Closings were up 19 percent in the first quarter of this year over last year, according to Corcoran. Market report numbers range widely between brokerages, but Corcoran shows sales in Mattituck and nearby Laurel currently leading the pace, with housing prices up 26 percent since January. Mattituck traditionally attracts buyers seeking relative proximity to the city, as well as easier access to the South Fork and its shopping and entertainment options.New housing starts, as measured by permits, are up, especially in the town of Southold, which issued 38 permits for single-family dwellings from January through May, up from 24 for the same period last year. The town of Riverhead issued about 50 permits in the first six months of this year, similar to last year\u2019s pace.Mitchell Cashwell and his brothers have been coming out to Southold since the early 1990s, when their parents bought a home in the hamlet. Last year, he and a younger brother bought a property adjacent to their older brother\u2019s and commissioned Anne Surchin, a local architect, to design a contemporary beach house.Ms. Surchin first had to demolish the century-old house on the property, which she described as moldy and structurally deficient. \u201cBoth Mitchell and I wanted the new bungalow to maintain the scale, massing and charm of the neighborhood,\u201d Ms. Surchin said. She added a bedroom and bath without expanding the footprint.Mr. Cashwell, a Manhattanite, said he was delighted with the results. \u201cI\u2019m going to have friends visiting soon from L.A.,\u201d he said.When sales open this August, Ellen Coster and her husband, Morris Isaac, of Cutchogue, expect to be among the first to place deposits on a two-bedroom unit. They plan to close in October or November on the sale of their two-acre property nearby, which includes a farmhouse, barn, cabana and cottage, and scale down to a two-bedroom condo. They\u2019ll spend late fall and winter in Florida, and hope to move into their new Harvest Pointe home next summer.\u201cWe needed to scale down because we couldn\u2019t continue maintaining it all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re thrilled about Harvest Pointe. The area really needs living opportunities like this. People do not want to move to Riverhead.\u201dAnd why would that be? \u201cThere\u2019s too much congestion,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Berkshire Hathaway Makes a $9 Billion Bid for Energy Future Holdings", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fate of a giant Texas power company that has spent nearly a decade in financial distress lies in a potential battle between two billionaires.A fight between the two would serve as the latest source of tumult for a company mired in financial and legal problems. And though Mr. Buffett is perhaps the most celebrated dealmaker in the world, Mr. Singer\u2019s hedge fund, and perhaps Texas power regulators, threaten to stymie his latest takeover bid.At the center of the brewing conflict is Energy Future, whose Oncor subsidiary is the biggest utility in Texas, with 10 million customers.Yet it is best known as a sinkhole for investor money, with the three firms that bought it having written off their entire stakes in the enterprise and creditors still squabbling over how to reorganize its finances.But what was essentially a debt-heavy bet on high natural gas prices began to falter quickly amid the onset of the crisis and the collapse of natural gas prices. Energy Future soon became an ominous reminder of private equity\u2019s excess, and the company\u2019s troubles eventually evaporated billions of investor dollars in value.Yet four years later, Berkshire Hathaway seeks to buy Energy Future outright in a bid to expand its growing energy holdings.Oncor is meant to augment Berkshire Hathaway Energy, whose collection of utilities delivers power to 11.6 million customers across the West and Midwest, as well as in Britain and Canada. Berkshire first bought control of what was then MidAmerican Energy in 2000.It has since become an assembly of utilities, gas pipelines and renewable energy assets like solar and wind generators. Its profits accounted for roughly 10 percent of Berkshire\u2019s $24 billion in net income last year.Mr. Buffett has pointed to the energy division as a business that generates steady, though not blockbuster, returns on capital. Utilities tend to perform well even in recessions, he wrote in his February letter to investors, and can draw earnings from a variety of sources that reduce the power of any single regulator.Under the terms of the transaction announced on Friday, Oncor\u2019s chief executive, Robert S. Shapard, would become the business\u2019s executive chairman. The utility\u2019s general counsel, Allen Nye, would become its chief executive.The deal would value the equity of Oncor, in which Energy Future owns an 80 percent stake, at $11.25 billion.Mr. Buffett may be betting that he will succeed because of two factors: Berkshire\u2019s sterling reputation and investors\u2019 sheer exhaustion from the yearslong Chapter 11 case.While the Public Utility Commission of Texas had blocked previous bids for Oncor \u2014 from NextEra and from the Hunt family, a prominent player in the state\u2019s energy industry \u2014 analysts said that Berkshire stood a good chance of swaying regulators to allow Friday\u2019s proposal.Potentially standing in the way is Mr. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, a hard-nosed hedge fund with experience battling for control of bankrupt companies.Since last fall, Elliott has acquired much of Energy Future\u2019s debt: as of May, the hedge fund claimed to hold nearly $2.9 billion of it.Elliott has complained for some time about Energy Future\u2019s efforts to reorganize its finances, and in May it sued the utility company to pressure it into seeking alternative ways to restructure its debts. One possibility that Elliott favors: letting the hedge fund convert its debt holdings into equity, giving the investment firm a path to taking control.While some of the debt that the hedge fund and other creditors own would be paid back in full through the Berkshire deal, certain bonds that Elliott also owns would not be.In its lawsuit filed in May, Elliott argued that Energy Future was wasting time and money on reorganization plans that were unlikely to succeed.\u201cNow in their fourth year (six years considering their pre-bankruptcy efforts), the debtors have already explored and exhausted numerous options for exit, including a sale, and face further protracted proceedings with creditor recoveries rapidly diminishing daily,\u201d Elliott wrote in its lawsuit.Elliott had opposed the NextEra bid that was blocked last week \u2014 which was worth more than Berkshire\u2019s current offer.Now the hedge fund is considering ways to counter Mr. Buffett\u2019s proposal, according to a person briefed on the matter. Elliott has begun preliminary consultations with prospective partners and sources of financing.Elliott is also counting on the fact that the Berkshire proposal must be approved by the bankruptcy court judge overseeing Energy Future\u2019s reorganization.Still, it is not clear whether the hedge fund would ultimately proceed with its own bid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Will Electric Cars Go Mainstream? It May Be Sooner Than You Think", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the world\u2019s automakers place larger bets on electric vehicle technology, many industry analysts are debating a key question: How quickly can plug-in cars become mainstream?The conventional view holds that electric cars will remain a niche product for many years, plagued by high sticker prices and heavily dependent on government subsidies.Between 2025 and 2030, the group predicts, plug-in vehicles will become cost competitive with traditional petroleum-powered cars, even without subsidies and even before taking fuel savings into account. Once that happens, mass adoption should quickly follow.\u201cOur forecast doesn\u2019t hinge on countries adopting stringent new fuel standards or climate policies,\u201d said Colin McKerracher, the head of advanced transport analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic analysis, looking at what happens when the upfront cost of electric vehicles reaches parity. That\u2019s when the real shift occurs.\u201dIf that prediction pans out, it will have enormous consequences for the auto industry, oil markets and the world\u2019s efforts to slow global warming.The Bloomberg forecast is far more aggressive, projecting that plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles will make up 54 percent of new light-duty sales globally by 2040, outselling their combustion engine counterparts.The reason? Batteries. Since 2010, the average cost of lithium-ion battery packs has plunged by two-thirds, to around $300 per kilowatt-hour. The Bloomberg report sees that falling to $73 by 2030, without any significant technological breakthroughs, as companies like Tesla increase battery production in massive factories, optimize the design of battery packs and improve chemistries.For the next decade, the report notes, electric cars will remain reliant on government incentives and sales mandates in places like Europe, China and California. But as automakers introduce a greater variety of models and lower costs, electric cars will reach a point where they can stand on their own.\u201cBut we tried to be fairly conservative in our estimate of where battery prices are going,\u201d Mr. McKerracher said, \u201cand we don\u2019t see barriers to electric vehicles\u2019 becoming cost competitive very soon.\u201dOther experts caution that falling battery costs are not the only factor in determining whether electric cars become widespread. Sam Ori, the executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, noted, \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy cars based solely on the price tag.\u201dMany owners charge their cars overnight in their garages, but that is much harder for people living in cities who park their cars on the street.As a result, the Bloomberg report warns that plug-in vehicles may have a difficult time making inroads in dense urban areas and that infrastructure bottlenecks may slow the growth of electric vehicles after 2040.Another potential hurdle may be the automakers themselves. While most manufacturers are introducing plug-in models in the United States to comply with stricter fuel-economy standards, they do not always market them aggressively, said Chelsea Sexton, an auto industry consultant who worked on General Motors\u2019 electric vehicle program in the 1990s.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of announcements about electric vehicles, but that doesn\u2019t matter much if automakers are just building these cars for compliance and are unenthusiastic about actually marketing them,\u201d Ms. Sexton said.Yet the Bloomberg report also shows how much further countries would need to go to cut transportation emissions.Even with a sharp rise in electric vehicles, the world would still have more traditional petroleum-powered passenger vehicles on the road in 2040 than it does today, and it will take many years to retire existing fleets. And other modes of transportation, like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, will remain stubbornly difficult to electrify without drastic advances in battery technology.Which means it is still too soon to write an obituary for the internal combustion engine.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Iran, Qatar Crisis Is a Welcome Distraction", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s leaders have been noticeably restrained in their response to the Qatar crisis, and for good reason, analysts say. Not only have they welcomed it, they would be happy to see it quietly drag on.Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar last month for what they said was its financing of terrorism and working too closely with Iran.For Tehran\u2019s clerical leaders, the confrontation between putative Persian Gulf allies came at a particularly auspicious time \u2014 when the entire Sunni Arab world seemed lined up against them after President Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia in May.\u201cThey wanted to weaken us,\u201d Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, an Iranian journalist, said with a chuckle, \u201cbut now they are losing themselves.\u201dWhile Iran and Qatar share one of the largest gas fields in the world and have diplomatic relations, Qatar is of little or no strategic value to Iran.About the most that Tehran has had to say about the situation was a mild remark from President Hassan Rouhani, who told the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, that \u201cIran\u2019s airspace, sea and ground transport links will always be open to Qatar, our brotherly and neighbor country.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, however, Tehran was preparing to face a united bloc of wealthy, militarily well-equipped Persian Gulf nations ready to isolate Iran with the enthusiastic backing of the United States. Saudi Arabia had bought $100 billion worth of American weapons and had formed a close partnership against Tehran with Mr. Trump.The United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel were painting Iran as the primary source of instability in the region, a nation supporting terrorist groups in Yemen, Lebanon and Gaza and fighting on behalf of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The road to ratcheting up the pressure on Iran \u2014 a sectarian rival hated by the Saudi kingdom for its version of political Islam \u2014 seemed open.Then they started fighting among themselves.A Qatari news report, subsequently dismissed by the Qatari government as fake, was said to have quoted the emir as saying he wanted to ease tensions with Iran. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reacted furiously, starting a diplomatic and trade blockade against the gas-rich nation, handing over the list of 13 demands \u2014 \u201cdemand 13: agree to all our demands\u201d\u2014 and even forbidding their citizens to wear Barcelona soccer jerseys because they bear the name of their sponsor, Qatar Airways.One of those demands is that Qatar close a Turkish military base, which would alienate Turkey, a NATO member and an ally of Saudi Arabia in Syria. \u201cInstead of making an Arab NATO, they are only making more enemies,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst in Iran. \u201cIn the end, only America is benefiting, selling all those weapons to those countries.\u201dBut even there, the Persian Gulf confrontation is creating some nervous moments for the Pentagon, which is running the Syria air campaign out of a major base in Qatar.It was a familiar turn of events for the clerics in Tehran, whose regional competition with Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries sometimes means just waiting for the Saudis to shoot themselves in the foot, analysts here say.That strategy seems even more appropriate with the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, 31, the recently named Saudi crown prince, who is developing a reputation for impulsive foreign policy moves that do not work out as planned. He is the architect of the Saudi war in neighboring Yemen, which was supposed to be a blitzkrieg that would end in two days but is dragging into its third year and has caused a horrific humanitarian crisis.Now, the crown prince is seen as the driving force behind the effort to isolate Qatar.Meanwhile, Iranian news outlets have gleefully reported how the country is reaping fees for the increased use of its airspace by Qatar Airways.Over the years, Iran has usually preferred to play the long game, lying low and working with local proxies rather than going for quick victories.When, for instance, Mr. Assad was threatened by forces backed by Saudi Arabia, Tehran quietly drip fed first hundreds and now thousands of troops into the conflict. It drew on numerous sources, especially the battle-hardened soldiers of the Lebanese Shiite militia, Hezbollah; Shiite militias from Iraq; and Afghans conscripted into the Iranian armed forces.Qatar cannot expect support beyond the planeloads of food it has already been sent, analysts say. It is cherry season in Iran, so most probably the Qataris are now chewing on those, some people suggest here.\u201cOur interests are best served if there is no war, conflict or any further tensions in our region,\u201d said Hossein Sheikholeslam, an adviser to Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. \u201cWe try to act rationally, because the opponents in the region are young and unripe and irrational in their approach with Qatar.\u201dWatching from the sidelines, while enemies fight, can have benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s like Kuwait, when Saddam Hussein invaded it in 1990 \u2014 our enemy makes a move and weakens himself,\u201d Mr. Taraghi, the hard-line analyst, said.The only thing Iran did in that case was to open its airspace when Mr. Hussein needed a safe haven for his fighter jets when the United States invaded. He sent over 100 warplanes. The Iranians said, \u2018Thank you\u2019 \u2014 and never returned them.\u201cWe just remained neutral and won,\u201d Mr. Taraghi said.Advertisement"}

But another flouter of film industry norms, the surreal, independently financed space adventure \u201cValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,\u201d was dead on arrival.\u201cDunkirk\u201d cost about $100 million to make, not including marketing.Releasing \u201cDunkirk\u201d in late July was a risk. Serious films aimed at older audiences tend to arrive in the fall or late winter; summer is usually reserved for comic-book adaptations and science-fiction epics.

Mr. Goldstein cited \u201cthe Nolan pedigree\u201d for stronger-than-expected turnout, along with \u201cour marketing team, which did a phenomenal job.\u201dAbout 60 percent of the \u201cDunkirk\u201d audience was male.

{"Headline": "A Drug Maker Spends Big in Washington to Make Itself Heard", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo federal investigations \u2014 one examining opioid sales, another about a multiple sclerosis drug whose price had soared to $34,000 a vial \u2014 were only part of the troubles Mallinckrodt faced as the year began.The stock of the drug maker, whose United States headquarters are in St. Louis, was tanking. Wall Street worried that Medicare might reduce the half-billion dollars it was spending yearly on a Mallinckrodt drug with limited evidence of effectiveness.This year, the company left the industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, after the group threatened to kick out companies that did not spend enough on research.Mallinckrodt, however, has been increasing its spending in another area: It has been writing checks to politicians.After making meager donations in 2015, the company\u2019s political action committee began raising its contributions for congressional campaigns last year. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate collected $44,000 from Mallinckrodt in 2017\u2019s first quarter, nearly nine times what they got from the company in the same period two years ago.Mallinckrodt is far from unique. This year, a critical and risky one for drug companies, the industry as a whole is ratcheting up campaign donations and its presence on Capitol Hill, a new database compiled by Kaiser Health News shows.\u201cThe stakes are really high right now,\u201d said David Maris, who follows pharmaceutical stocks for Wells Fargo, given that President Trump has joined Democrats to demand action on drug costs.Mallinckrodt acknowledges that it has increased its political spending to help its particular causes. \u201cWe actively participate in the political process on issues that matter to us and our patients,\u201d Rhonda Sciarra, a Mallinckrodt spokeswoman, said by email. \u201cOur PAC\u2019s absolute spend remains small in relation to other companies in our industry.\u201dCongressional donations from pharmaceutical PACs rose 11 percent in this year\u2019s first quarter, compared with the first three months of 2015 (the comparable point in the previous election cycle), according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. The increase accompanied a spike in pharma lobbying for the period.Contributions to powerful committee members who handle health policy matters also increased in the face of public anger over the opioid crisis as well as anticipated renewal of legislation that determines the \u201cuser fees\u201d companies pay for regulatory drug approval.A dozen Republican committee heads and ranking Democrats on health-related panels collected $281,600 from pharma-related PACs in the first quarter, up 80 percent from what people in the same positions collected in the first quarter of 2015, the data shows. Such initial donations often set the pace for a two-year election cycle, and suggest whom corporate interests are trying to cultivate in a new Congress, with implied promises of more to come, analysts say.For pharma companies, \u201cnow would be the time to give out the money, ahead of a piece of legislation that may come down the road,\u201d said Kent Cooper, a former Federal Election Commission official who has tracked political money for decades.\u201cYou want to get your name out there and make a connection with these members\u2019 legislative assistants \u2014 so you are known to them and you can get in their door,\u201d Mr. Cooper said.Other drug makers increasing their congressional donations include AbbVie \u2014 whose blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis injection, Humira, faces threats from competition \u2014 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals. A six-figure price tag for Soliris, Alexion\u2019s treatment for a rare blood disorder, makes it one of the world\u2019s most expensive drugs.The totals do not include contributions from individual executives and lobbyists, or donations to leadership PACs. Leadership PACs associated with a particular member of Congress often spend money on other members\u2019 campaigns, as well as on things that a campaign committee cannot finance. Details on contributions to leadership PACs take longer to become available.At the same time, drug companies anticipated Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which finances billions in drug sales. That process has stalled in the Senate. All of this gives drug makers the most powerful incentives in years to cultivate policy makers, analysts say.Tense politics may also be prompting members of Congress to be energetic about soliciting donations.\u201cMy sense is that Republicans are nervous in the House \u2014 especially given the long-term record of the presidential party losing seats in the midterm,\u201d said David Magleby, a political scientist at Brigham Young University who studies campaign finance. \u201cI would be surprised if Republican incumbents across the board aren\u2019t more aggressive in raising money in the first and second quarters.\u201dMallinckrodt\u2019s biggest donations on Capitol Hill, of $5,000 each, went to Ann Wagner, a House member from its home state, Missouri, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. That amount is the maximum a PAC can give to a campaign committee for each primary and general election.Ever since it was spun off as an independent company in 2013, Mallinckrodt has made its legal home in Ireland, which allows it to take advantage of lower income tax rates. Mr. Hatch favors cutting United States corporate taxes to eliminate incentives to make such moves.Mallinckrodt gave lesser amounts to 16 other congressional campaigns, including that of Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Mr. Ryan, who has played down Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the pharmaceutical industry, was the top recipient of industry money in the first quarter, with $82,750 collected, the data shows.Drug companies are hedging their bets, writing checks to individual Democrats and Republicans. With Mr. Trump breaking ranks with Republicans to favor reform, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell who\u2019s your friend and who\u2019s not,\u201d said Mr. Maris, the Wells Fargo analyst. \u201cSo you have to go to a ground game \u2014 a more one-on-one legislator basis.\u201dAn article on Saturday about political spending by the drugmaker Mallinckrodt misstated the global sales of the drug H.P. Acthar in the 2014 fiscal year. It was $951 million, not $123 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Beckham Closes In on M.L.S. Franchise. Will Miami Care?", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 The midday sun was beating down on a forlorn, nine-acre section of the Overtown neighborhood last month, and there wasn\u2019t a soul in the streets. Boarded-up shops faced the lots on one side, and public housing on two others. High-rise apartments and office towers in downtown Miami, markers of the city\u2019s rapid resurgence, glistened not far off.Beckham\u2019s bid for a franchise, once thought to be foundering, now faces little opposition. If it is approved this year, Miami Beckham United \u2014 the team\u2019s working title \u2014 will become the league\u2019s 24th club as M.L.S. rushes to expand to 28 teams by 2020, and shovels and excavators will soon begin digging on the site in Overtown, a former county truck depot.It has been a long time in coming. As part of the initial M.L.S. contract that lured him from Europe to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007, Beckham was promised the opportunity to buy a team in Miami in return for a $25 million expansion fee if he played at least five years in the league. (He wound up staying six.) The fee, once viewed as a potential windfall for M.L.S., now looks to be a savvy bargain for Beckham; the other cities vying for expansion approval this year will pay $150 million.That nine-figure discount has led some owners to grumble that the league should find a way to get out of the commitment, but others believe that just as Beckham\u2019s arrival helped bolster the credibility of M.L.S. with American fans and foreign players, his return as an owner would raise its global profile again.The question none of them can answer is whether even Beckham \u2014 who has at last assembled a credible group of investors and acquired the land for a privately financed stadium near downtown \u2014 can make a dent in the South Florida market. M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber folded the league\u2019s previous team in South Florida, an experiment undone by brutal summer weather and fans who seemed to prefer baseball, football and frolicking by the ocean to professional soccer.\u201cMiami is no longer just a beach town,\u201d Garber said. \u201cWe would not have gotten into Miami if we could not be in the urban core. We want to be part of something bigger than we are, urban development.\u201dAfter failed attempts to acquire land for a stadium at three other locations, Beckham\u2019s current plan has cleared nearly every financial, political and legal hurdle. Still, there is no guarantee that the group \u2014 which now includes Todd Boehly, a part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers; Marcelo Claure, the chief executive of Sprint; the media entrepreneur Simon Fuller; and Tim Leiweke, a veteran M.L.S. executive well versed in stadium projects \u2014 can succeed where others have not.Despite a large Latino population with links to Caribbean, Central American and South American countries where soccer is king, South Florida has had a checkered history with pro soccer, in part because the tug of international teams is so strong. Over the weekend, more than 60,000 fans paid dearly for tickets to see F.C. Barcelona play Real Madrid in an exhibition match in the Miami Dolphins\u2019 stadium.Support at the gate is one concern, but there are also questions about the 25,000-seat stadium that Beckham\u2019s group has planned for a run-down corner of a historically black neighborhood. Beckham, who was not made available for an interview, settled on the tight spot after failing to acquire land at two locations near Biscayne Bay and on a third plot next to the Miami Marlins\u2019 stadium in Little Havana, less than two miles away.To crowbar a stadium into the land in Overtown, a few blocks from I-95 and the Miami River, the Beckham group would not build any parking. Instead, fans would have to walk from lots as much as 15 minutes away, or from one of the three nearby commuter rail stations.That may be an urban planner\u2019s dream, and it fits Garber\u2019s vision of soccer teams in downtown locations, but it appears to be a na\u00efve assumption to residents of Miami, where the heat can be oppressive, rain storms can strike at any time and driving is a way of life.\u201cI want Beckham to be in the league, and he\u2019s the guy who can make Miami work,\u201d said one M.L.S. owner who asked not to be named because the vote on the team had not taken place. \u201cBut when we sit in the room, that\u2019s what we talk about.\u201dResidents of the adjacent Spring Garden neighborhood also worry about traffic and noise spilling into their quiet residential enclave, and fear that concerts and other events will fill the stadium on nights when the team isn\u2019t playing.\u201cThe soccer people will tell you there will only be 15 games a year, but we think this is a ruse for concerts, and we don\u2019t want it in our backyard,\u201d said Ernest Martin, a former president of the Spring Garden Civic Association. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of dumping undesirable urban projects into Overtown.\u201dLeiweke, who is steering the stadium project for the Beckham group, is undeterred. No tax dollars are being spent on the stadium, he said, and he suggested that fans, particularly the younger ones the team and the league want to attract, would be comfortable ditching their cars and marching to games from nearby bars and restaurants.And while Overtown remains rough around the edges, Leiweke pointed to the new 25,500-seat stadium that was built in a similar neighborhood in Orlando, and noted that the M.L.S. team that calls it home, Orlando City S.C., has played to capacity crowds.\u201cYou have to find a balance between what the stadium will look like in 10 years and building in a neighborhood where you don\u2019t have to charge $500 a ticket,\u201d Leiweke said. Of Orlando, he added, \u201cThe day-of-game experience has been positive, and the value of the property around the stadium has increased dramatically.\u201dLocal officials pronounced themselves pleased with the plan\u2019s economic potential. But in Miami, where a bloated deal for the Marlins stadium has turned public financing for sports stadiums into a toxic issue, the financing plan is what ultimately persuaded lawmakers to get behind the deal.The Beckham group \u201casked for public assistance initially, but I said we weren\u2019t going to give them any tax deals,\u201d said Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, the mayor of Miami-Dade County. \u201cThe stadium by itself will not bring development. But more people will be walking through the area, so you\u2019re seeing development in Overtown because of growth in downtown. It\u2019s just geography.\u201dGeography is critical for Luis Garcia, whose family has owned a fish restaurant on the Miami River just a few minutes by foot from the stadium site. In recent years, upscale restaurants have opened nearby, part of the spillover from downtown. Garcia, whose father first bought property in the area decades ago, said young soccer fans would help revitalize an area with a less than desirable reputation.\u201cDavid Beckham has validated my father\u2019s vision,\u201d Garcia said over a lunch of fish sandwiches. The stadium \u201cwill be an economic engine.\u201dBefore that engine can start, Beckham will have to get zoning and other approvals, likely to come next year. Then, assuming that M.L.S. owners give Beckham the green light, he will have to assemble a roster, sign a few foreign stars and start the hard work of selling tickets to skeptical fans.\u201cThe history of soccer and pro sports teams in Miami has been spotty at best,\u201d said David Downs, a former commissioner of the N.A.S.L., who has lived in the city. \u201cGetting over the political hurdles is a start. But that\u2019s only the beginning of the challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tate Modern and the Battle for London\u2019s Soul", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "Cultured TravelerAs luxury condos proliferate across London, the evolving Tate Modern provides a model for the city\u2019s public spaces.Supported byI recently found myself staring into a stranger\u2019s living room, waiting for something beautiful to happen.Was the view of abandoned luxury also part of the museum? Did my strange mixture of emotions \u2014 the simultaneous curiosity and self-reproach of the voyeur \u2014 have a number on the audio tour? Guiltily, I leaned out over the terrace, staring at those slippers. I waited for some kind of performance to begin. I wanted to witness a murder, an affair, a revelation.This visual standoff offered a perfect distillation of the current battle for London\u2019s soul. As more of these luxury towers spring up across the city, transforming neighborhoods into affluent ghost towns, Londoners are facing difficult questions: What kind of city do we want to live in? What do we want our streets to look like? What kind of public spaces are valuable to us? Part of the answer to these questions may lie in the entangled story of the Tate Modern and the Bankside neighborhood it helped spawn.The museum may be the among the best-known examples of the now fashionable transformation of derelict factories into dynamic cultural space. Since its inception, the Tate Modern has never rested on its laurels, continuing to redefine itself as an institution of outreach, self-reflection and learning. The museum\u2019s evolution over time provides a potential blueprint for how London, and indeed any city, can provide spaces that encourage its inhabitants to be collectively present. You cannot experience the Tate Modern through Facebook or a tweet; you must show up, with an open mind, surrounded by your fellow visitors.London is perhaps the most international city in the world, but at its heart it has always been a local city, a series of low-slung villages. The expanded Tate Modern embraces this human scale even if its aspirations are more global than ever.Given the real estate mania that has engulfed Bankside and the surrounding Borough of Southwark, it\u2019s easy to forget what a bold decision it was to shift the center of London\u2019s contemporary art world 17 years ago to a hulking abandoned power station south of the river. Ask any Londoner about wandering amid the postindustrial squalor of Southwark in the late 1980s and you will be regaled by stories of taking life into your own hands.During the Industrial Revolution, Southwark became a nucleus of manufacturing because of its ample water, cheap land and cheap labor. Textile plants, breweries, a gasworks and coal and timber yards all led to astonishing levels of pollution. The Bankside Power Station, a giant brick sarcophagus bisected by an ominous chimney-spire, was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and began operations in 1952. The power station, across the Thames from St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral like a shadow basilica of industrial consumption, chugged away, converting the oil in its great underground tanks into London\u2019s electricity until 1981.Perhaps even more unusual than the Tate Modern\u2019s choice of an abandoned power station for a home was its approach to the building itself. In an architectural competition filled with overwrought interventions, Herzog & de Meuron\u2019s winning design was most notable for its restraint: The plan left Scott\u2019s brick shell largely untouched and drew out its industrial features rather than mask them. The architects have said that the smartest move of their careers was to make the great void of Turbine Hall, the former engine house, even bigger by dropping its floor to the basement level and allowing the visitor to enter down a long ramp.My first encounter with Turbine Hall came in 2002, when I was living in London for the year, suffering from that very specific condition that often afflicts Americans if they spend any extended length of time in Britain, whereby everything feels both too familiar and too foreign. I remember the feeling of opening the door to the museum and drifting down that slope, confronted with the yawning mouth of a 10-story-high, red-rubber-Venus-fly-trap-cum-Victrola-horn. This maroon colossus, by the sculptor Anish Kapoor, dwarfed visitors and yet also managed to bring us together in mutual and gleeful bewilderment.Confronted with the unusual size and shape of Turbine Hall \u2014 it is taller than it is wide \u2014 I suddenly became aware of the possibilities of space. Space in all directions. People, unsure of how to react to such aesthetic sublimity, simply lay on the floor. I was witnessing firsthand how the monumental scale of Turbine Hall disrupted the quiet triangulation between the viewer\u2019s body, the artwork and the gallery. It soon became clear that the normal rules of decorum for how one should act in a museum should not, could not, apply here.Achim Borchardt-Hume, the director of exhibitions at the Tate Modern, describes Turbine Hall as a cross between \u201ca covered street and a public park.\u201d The \u201cpublic\u201d part of this equation is vital, for the museum is largely financed by the government and \u2014 crucially \u2014 does not charge admission. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s collection,\u201d Mr. Borchardt-Hume said.I had a strange emotional reaction to the exhibition: I began to weep. I remember being embarrassed about it, but looking over and seeing the person beside me weeping as well. Maybe it was just allergies. To describe the work is wholly inadequate as the materials themselves were unimpressive, some lights, some mirrors, some mist.Yet to experience the transformation of that space alongside another human, to witness our shared wonder, was profound. Here was our entire experience rendered inside a box. A moment frozen in time and yet a moment that was deeply ephemeral. Visitors knew they could not take the experience with them and so they stayed, they picnicked beneath a fake sun, they fell asleep, they dreamed, they wrote, cried, laughed, sang, danced. In short, they were present. Together.In retrospect, perhaps the reason we all felt so alive in there was because the iPhone had not yet been invented. The Turbine Hall experience has developed and morphed over the years alongside our increasingly reiterative culture where, for many young people, an experience can no longer be processed \u2014 it must be captured, commented on and retweeted by a virtual chorus to gain any sort of existential traction. Solitude no longer exists.At first glance, the agora of Turbine Hall cuts against the grain of such digital collectivism. It is inherently local, temporary and not easily reduced to an Instagram post or 140 characters. The Turbine Hall commission is not an object \u2014 it is a feeling, an experience, an encounter. You have to be there. And yet such ephemeral, circumscribed cultural events represent, in some ways, the epitome of our FOMO (fear of missing out) times: \u201cDid you see the new Turbine Hall? #lifechanging\u201d A show across an ocean that resists all descriptors becomes the ultimate get.Back out in the hall I noticed that even though the exhibition was down, people were still using the space, lounging on the carpets, pondering the ceiling, tweeting, sleeping. Nearby, a French school group collapsed into a scrum on the floor and began ululating nursery rhymes. Experience cannot be canceled.\u201cIt\u2019s funny to say, but one of the most important parts of \u2018Anywhen\u2019 is the carpet,\u201d said Andrea Lissoni, a senior curator who worked on the show. \u201cThis thin little material offers a certain kind of permission.\u201dI think Jacobs would be worried but perhaps also mildly optimistic about the current state of Bankside. Like much of London, the neighborhood seems poised on a knife edge, balanced precariously between hyper-development and thoughtful urban planning. Indeed, the Tate Modern was forced to accelerate its expansion plans when the neighborhood it helped jump-start threatened to overwhelm its footprint. The area surrounding the museum is occupied by a ring of new commercial buildings; their ground floors feature the potpourri of corporate-cool restaurants common throughout London. There are the homemade ramen chain, the cold-pressed juice chain, the authentic Californian burrito chain. This kind of cloned proliferation represents a new form of urban blight of which Jacobs would not approve.Here, tourists and locals rub shoulders as they settle down to a smorgasbord of pop-up street food including Ethiopian Flavours\u2019s vegetable misir and injera crepes, or Kappacasein\u2019s local Ogleshield cheese raclette. The market, in existence for over 1,000 years, has only recently become an everyday phenomenon, and its popularity has had a profound effect on this part of the city. I listened as a butcher described the history of meatpacking in the area to two Italian tourists. A resident walking his dog chimed in. The world expanded.The plan is to create vibrant pedestrian zones that use the arched spaces beneath the rail lines, said Donald Hyslop, the chairman of Better Bankside and the director of Regeneration and Community Partnerships at the Tate Modern, as he walked with me along the proposed Low Line route. \u201cDisused, dirty and derelict spaces,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be transformed into an urban park where independent business can thrive and local communities can explore.\u201d\u201cWhere can I sit?\u201d I asked. The waiter sheepishly pointed to a lone chair in the corner. \u201cThere, I think, is O.K.,\u201d he said. Next to me, I could feel the ghost of Jane Jacobs cringing.I returned to London a month later, in March, the day after a terrorist attack in which a man had run down pedestrians with a car before fatally stabbing a police officer outside of Parliament. The mood of the city was defiant; business had not stopped. Regular life became both a form of resistance and mourning. When another attack occurred in June, this time in Southwark itself, at Borough Market, citizens were again unyielding in their adherence to life: Even fleeing from the scene, at least one Londoner insisted on carrying his overpriced pint with him.Most of the performances took place in the stunning underground Tanks beneath the Tate Modern\u2019s new wing, formerly the Switch House and now christened the Blavatnik Building, after Sir Leonard Blavatnik, the recently knighted Ukrainian-born, Anglo-American billionaire. The museum smartly rehired Herzog & de Meuron to also design the expansion. Though constructing a tower was much different from the original renovation, the architects again used a light hand when it came to the Tanks, leaving the concrete caverns largely untouched from their original form, when they were filled with the oil that once powered the city.\u201cThese plants are a little too oversized,\u201d Ms. Lewis later told me. \u201cMaybe aggressive.

{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 the Bahamas", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate10 PhotosA THREE-STORY VILLA NEAR THE BEACHThis three-story villa with sprawling verandas and plantation-style shutters is in the Old Fort Bay gated development, on the northwest coast of New Providence, the most populous island in the Bahamas. It is near the capital city of Nassau. Lush tropical foliage surrounds the home, which is close to the community\u2019s private club on the site of a fortress erected by the British in the 1700s.The 4,450-square-foot concrete and wood house was built in 2012 and has been used as a vacation home for the owners, who are from California. It has four bedrooms, four full and two half baths; furnishings are available for sale separately.At the main entrance is a wooden gate, which opens to a veranda. There is one on the second level, too. Both have ipe wood decking. Inside is a large, open living room that flows into a formal dining area. Ceiling fans supplement the central air-conditioning, and floors of hand-scraped engineered wood provide a rustic aesthetic. A white marble chef\u2019s kitchen with stainless-steel Viking and Bosch appliances off the dining area can be closed with sliding doors. Each of these main-level rooms has French doors that open to the veranda; at the back of the 0.16-acre lot is a paved patio with a barbecue.A hallway off the dining space has stairs leading to the second floor, where there are three en-suite bedrooms, also with veranda access. On the third level is another en-suite bedroom and a large multipurpose room with a small kitchenette that is currently being used as a gym, Mr. Sawyer said, but \u201ccould serve as an office/media room or second living room.\u201dThe Old Fort Bay waterfront community has a private club with amenities that include a beach, pool, gym and restaurant. Nearby are numerous other beaches, along with shops and restaurants. The Lynden Pindling International Airport is about six miles away, while Nassau, with a population of around 275,000, is about 13 miles away.MARKET OVERVIEWThe luxury market \u2014 which saw a 20 percent correction, on average, from its peak, following the financial crisis \u2014 has been especially strong within the gated communities, agents said. In Old Fort Bay, where luxury homes typically start at around $2 million, both sales volume and prices have risen 10 to 15 percent from a year ago, Mr. Sawyer said.WHO BUYS IN THE BAHAMASMany of the luxury properties in the island nation are bought by foreigners, most from the United States, agents said. There is also strong interest from Canadians, Europeans and South Americans.Buyers are drawn to the pristine beaches and private isles, along with the country\u2019s favorable tax laws. Significant tax breaks are available for certain homeowners who obtain permanent residency.BUYING BASICSForeign buyers face no restrictions on real estate purchases. Local financing is available, though at terms that might be less attractive than those in the United States, said Adrian R. White, a real estate lawyer based in Nassau, who added that most luxury properties are bought with cash.Agents recommend that buyers hire a qualified real estate lawyer to guide them through the process, which takes about 30 days. \u201cThe attorney,\u201d Mr. White said, \u201cwill typically conduct an investigation of the property \u2014 including title to the property \u2014 to ensure that no outstanding charges or liens are present.\u201dBuyers are not required to be present at the closing, he said, noting that they can finalize documents via courier or grant power-of-attorney rights to their lawyers.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish; Bahamian dollar (1 Bahamian dollar = $1)TAXES AND FEESThe seller typically pays the sales commission, which averages 6 percent. The buyer and seller split the stamp duty and the value added tax charged by the Bahamian government when property changes hands; the tax on this house is 10 percent.The annual property taxes on this home are around $24,000, and the homeowners\u2019 association fee is $10,000 a year, Mr. Sawyer said. Membership in the Old Fort Bay Club is optional; the cost is $5,000 a year, with an initiation fee of $45,000, he said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

Sweeney, had gone along with Mr. Christie, but the Assembly speaker, Vincent Prieto, also a Democrat, balked, saying among other reasons that raiding the reserves would lead to increased costs for Horizon policyholders.Although the final deal was described as a compromise, Mr. Christie got little of what he wanted. Instead of having to hand over some of its reserves, Horizon accepted some new, relatively minor requirements, including submitting to annual independent audits. The deal also imposed a cap on Horizon\u2019s reserves, after which Horizon would have to return money to policyholders, but the cap was above the current level of the reserves.\u201cThat Horizon bill was a face-saver,\u201d said Hetty Rosenstein, the state director for the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents 35,000 state workers who were affected by the shutdown.It was clear on Tuesday that what was likely to linger in people\u2019s minds was not the details of the budget debate, but the image of the governor and his family enjoying a perfect day at a beach, while the public was barred. (Most of the state\u2019s beaches are managed by municipalities and therefore remained open through the budget standoff.)Henry Walker, a building contractor whose Jeep bumper was covered in layers of season passes, said on Tuesday that he had been turned away from Island Beach State Park when he went there to fish over the weekend, only to see the governor\u2019s daughter ushered through the blockade.\u201cHe should have gone to the public beach and hung out with the blue-collar workers,\u201d Mr. Walker said, referring to the municipal beach, which had been open over the weekend and packed. \u201cHe should have paid the seven bucks.\u201dIsland Beach State Park was not as crowded on Tuesday as on typical holiday weekends, some beachgoers said. But some people said they had actually been drawn there by the whiff of political controversy.\u201cWe decided to come and see what all the fuss was about, and if we\u2019d see Christie out here,\u201d Miguel Cervantes of Mount Laurel said with a laugh, as he played a game of paddle ball with his son, George, near the dunes. \u201cIt\u2019s the beach of the week.\u201dOff the sand, political analysts chewed over the larger implications of the deal.Modia Butler, a former chief of staff for United States Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, said the outcome reflected Mr. Christie\u2019s diminished power in the wake of the George Washington Bridge scandal and his unsuccessful presidential campaign; by law, Mr. Christie could not run for re-election this year.\u201cFour years ago, he would have gotten everything he wanted,\u201d Mr. Butler said.Ms. Rosenstein viewed Mr. Prieto, who had said he was willing to lose his position as speaker over the Horizon fight, as a winner in the fight.Mr. Christie had tried to blame the speaker for the shutdown, decorating government buildings around the state with posters featuring Mr. Prieto, saying, \u201cThis Facility Is CLOSED Because of This Man.\u201d\u201cI think they would have lost anyway, but I think that the governor-sitting-on-the-closed-beach thing made it so apparent whose fault this was,\u201d Ms. Rosenstein said. \u201cIt was the guy on the beach.\u201dRuth Bashinsky, Elizabeth Tarbell and Vivian Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Even now, it\u2019s hard to be sure, especially given Republican moderates\u2019 long track record of caving in to extremists at crucial moments.

So it\u2019s important to say clearly, in advance, why this is about to happen. It won\u2019t be because the Affordable Care Act is failing; it will be the result of Trump administration sabotage.Some background here: Even the A.C.A.\u2019s supporters have always acknowledged that it\u2019s a bit of a Rube Goldberg device. The simplest way to ensure that people have access to essential health care is for the government to pay their bills directly, the way Medicare does for older Americans. But in 2010, when the A.C.A. was enacted, Medicare for all was politically out of reach.Notably, people aren\u2019t automatically signed up for coverage, so it matters a lot whether the officials running the system try to make it work, reaching out to potential beneficiaries to ensure that they know what\u2019s available, while reminding currently healthy Americans that they are still legally required to sign up for coverage.So this isn\u2019t about policy, or even politics in the normal sense.

{"Headline": "California Today: A Plan to Cool Down L.A.", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.On sweltering summer days, dark asphalt soaks up the sun and acts like a secondary heater under our feet.That\u2019s why Los Angeles is pushing a novel plan to cool down the city: Turn the streets a different color.The idea of \u201ccool pavements\u201d has been kicking around City Hall for years, but only recently has it resulted in action on the ground.Matt Peterson, Los Angeles\u2019s chief sustainability officer, said test applications of a light gray coating known as CoolSeal had shown a 10-degree reduction in heat gain.\u201cIt was pretty significant, particularly when you\u2019re talking about asphalt that gets up to 130, 140 degrees,\u201d he said.Climate models suggest that parts of Los Angeles could see roughly three times as many extreme heat days \u2014 defined as more than 95 degrees \u2014 by midcentury.Mayor Eric Garcetti has predicted that the city could reduce its so-called urban heat island effect \u2014 caused by dark surfaces, lack of vegetation and discharges from traffic and industry \u2014 by three degrees over the next 20 years.Proponents of cool pavements say that aside from providing greater physical comfort, even a small drop in temperatures would reduce energy use and mitigate the health risks associated with extreme heat.Still, some environmental experts warn that more research is needed. What if, for example, the greenhouse gas emissions involved in the manufacture and deployment of cool pavements only worsen matters?But he added, \u201cThe science is less settled on whether the benefits outweigh the penalties.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Last year, a new bus service offering $48 overnight trips between Los Angeles and San Francisco created so much buzz that a wait-list grew into the thousands.Why the huge demand?Beds.The company, called SleepBus, came equipped with bunks that let passengers sleep through the journey and wake up early the next morning at their destination.Overwhelmed by the public response, the company went on hiatus to figure out how to scale up the operation.The buses have two levels, one for a bar and lounge area, and the other for the sleeping pods.For potential riders, it also prompts all sorts of questions.\u2022 Is there Wi-Fi? Yes.\u2022 A bathroom? Yes, with a flushable toilet and sink.\u2022 What about privacy? The pods have curtains, and a crew member rides along to ensure that everything is copacetic.\u2022 Can you share your pod with someone? No.\u2022 Is it clean?Think of it as a moving hotel, Tom Currier, a founder of Cabin, said in an email: \u201cThis includes professionally cleaning the entire vehicle and providing fresh bedding for every single trip.\u201d\u2022 Most pressingly for Mr. Currier and his team, will enough people be willing to pay $115 a ride when you can commonly fly the same route for less?That question will start being tested next week.

{"Headline": "Tim Raines Is Enshrined as an Expo, and He\u2019s Happy About It", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOOPERSTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 Over the weekend here, it was as if the 1994 baseball season had never ended abruptly with a players\u2019 strike that began Aug. 12, when the Montreal Expos owned the best record in the game. Or as if a new, privately financed stadium had magically been built in Montreal, allowing the Expos to remain in Canada instead of relocating to Washington after the 2004 season and becoming the Nationals.Expos fans, in full regalia, flocked to Cooperstown and relived old dreams during the Baseball Hall of Fame\u2019s induction weekend, turning Main Street into a flashback from the Boulevard St.-Laurent. They were here to toast Tim Raines, the third player to enter the Hall as an Expo \u2014 and the first one who did not balk at being depicted in a Montreal cap on his plaque.\u201cI saw a lot of Expo caps and uniforms out there, even though I\u2019m probably seeing some people who don\u2019t remember who the Expos are,\u201d Raines said before his induction on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ll put the cap on, get them some recognition.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where it started for me,\u201d Raines, 57, said. \u201cIt\u2019s only fitting.\u201dDuring his induction speech, Raines drew laughs when he said, \u201cBonjour,\u201d and graciously apologized to fans from Quebec for his limited facility with French.Any such quest is likely to be complicated by the lackluster history of the Expos. The team routinely drew small crowds and, over its last seven seasons, averaged fewer than a million fans at Olympic Stadium, which was ill suited to baseball.The Expos made the playoffs just once in their 36 seasons, losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1981 National League Championship Series. In 1994, before the strike ruined a potential championship season, the team\u2019s home attendance was only 70 percent of the National League average.\u201cI tried everything for them,\u201d Bud Selig, the former commissioner who was part of Raines\u2019s induction class, said here on Saturday. \u201cI kept them there a couple of extra years. I talked to a lot of people about buying the team. It\u2019s a complicated relationship. They need a stadium; they need owners. If you could put a team there now, you\u2019d make me very happy.\u201dThat is a matter for the 10th commissioner, Rob Manfred. But many Montreal fans in Cooperstown, resentful of Selig\u2019s part in their team\u2019s exit, booed him during the ceremony.Kaufman added: \u201cThere was a lot of discussion among the groups from Montreal coming here about how Selig would be greeted here. It\u2019s the Hall of Fame induction, and we want to be respectful. But it just sounds like they\u2019re trying to soften us all up by telling everyone it\u2019s his 83rd birthday. Next, they\u2019ll be saying he saved a bunch of puppies.\u201dAt one time or another, Gary Carter and Andre Dawson, who are also enshrined as Expos, have expressed a desire to have the cap of another club on their plaques \u2014 the Mets for Carter, the Cubs for Dawson.That was not the case with Raines, who has been lobbying for Montreal to get a new team.\u201cWe don\u2019t have one yet,\u201d he said, \u201cbut here\u2019s hoping.\u201dA picture credit on Monday with an article about the National Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies misidentified the photographer who took the picture of the former Montreal Expos Andre Dawson and Tim Raines, an inductee. It was by Jean Fruth of the National Baseball Hall of Fame \u2014 not by Vladimir Guerrero, another former Expo. The error was repeated in the picture caption, which noted that Dawson was posing for a former teammate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cardinal Pell Rose to Power, Trailed by a Cloud of Scandal", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY \u2014 When more than a dozen sexual abuse victims from Cardinal George Pell\u2019s hometown in Australia, Ballarat, flew to Rome to meet with him last year, they carried crushing stories of pain caused by local priests, and varied demands for Vatican action.As they spoke, the victims said, Cardinal Pell remained stiff, eyes downcast. Then Andrew Collins, whose family had been close to Cardinal Pell for years, gave him a hug. The cardinal seemed to soften and later delivered an emotional statement promising to help.\u201cBut that never happened,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cI\u2019ve had four survivors that I\u2019ve known personally take their own lives this year.\u201d\u201cThat was part of what we were trying to get through to people in Rome,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need help and assistance.\u201dThe charges this week that the cardinal himself was involved in sexual offenses followed years of criticism that he had at best overlooked, and at worst covered up, the widespread abuse of children by clergymen in Australia.The commission faulted Cardinal Pell\u2019s handling of cases as the archbishop who, starting in 1996, first led the archdiocese of Melbourne and then Sydney. Five priests in one of his parishes were convicted, and some testified that he had had knowledge of their activity.Cardinal Pell was pilloried for accompanying a priest to trial rather than the victims, who were so broken by the abuse they had suffered that many of them committed suicide.On Thursday, Cardinal Pell said he would return to Australia \u201cto clear my name,\u201d thanking Pope Francis for giving him leave from his job as Vatican finance chief.Yet his long preservation in the church hierarchy under three different popes was not always surprising for many in Australia, where Pell fought dissent like a prizefighter, where religious schools receive billions of dollars from the government and where the interests of church and state are often fused.\u201cWe have a long history of very gentle dealings with religions,\u201d said David Marr, an author and columnist who has written frequently about Cardinal Pell and the church.That is so despite the country\u2019s relatively small Catholic population; 22 percent of Australians identify as Catholic.\u201cYou can\u2019t really put your finger in any part of Australian culture without there being a significant Catholic thread,\u201d said Gary Bouma, a professor of sociology at Monash University in Melbourne who has been studying religion in Australia for 40 years.\u201cThe Catholics are the most significant religious players in Australia,\u201d he said.Still, Cardinal Pell\u2019s conservative and combative personality, described by his nicknames \u2014 \u201cthe ambitious Australian bulldog,\u201d \u201cThe Prince of Ballarat,\u201d \u201cBig George\u201d \u2014 cleared a path for advancement that seemed to only further insulate him from scrutiny.Even as a boy, the son of a Catholic mother and powerfully built Anglican father who had been a gold miner, he was an overachiever. He was a captain of sports teams and a star in academics.He helped out at his family-run pub in Ballarat, the Cattleyards, and after high school, he signed a contract with a professional Australian Rules Football club before leaving to join the priesthood.He went to Rome in 1963 to continue his studies, and then to Oxford for a doctorate in Church history. He said later that it was a \u201cturbulent time,\u201d and many of the conservative positions he later championed \u2014 his strong opposition to birth control and homosexuality, for example \u2014 seemed to stem from his own response to that era.But when he came back and served as a priest in Ballarat, from 1971 to 1984, there was a more immediate issue at hand: priests were preying on the children of the diocese.Mr. Collins, 48, one of the men who met with Cardinal Pell in Rome, said he was abused in Ballarat in the 1970s and \u201980s by four different men, three of them Catholic clergy.In a city with a population of less than 80,000 at the time, dozens of children were abused by priests. It was hell. It was hidden.\u201cBallarat was one of the worst affected towns with regard to church abuse,\u201d said Professor Bouma.\u201cIt\u2019s not just men, it\u2019s women as well,\u201d said Peter Blenkiron, 54, another Ballarat victim who met with Cardinal Pell in Rome. \u201cThey were damaged as children and didn\u2019t make it.\u201dCardinal Pell later said that he had been too busy as a priest and educator to notice all that was happening. \u201cThe crimes committed against them by priests and brothers are profoundly evil and completely repugnant to me,\u201d he said in 2015.Cardinal Pell\u2019s lawyers \u2014 in response to the Royal Commission, which launched its investigation into sexual abuse at a range of Australian institutions in 2013 \u2014 said there was no evidence to show he had acted inappropriately during his time in the Ballarat Diocese.And he continued to rise.In 1996, he became Archbishop of Melbourne. There, he quickly became known as a sharp manager of church finances, and a proactive leader.In October of that year, Cardinal Pell unveiled what became known as the \u201cMelbourne Response\u201d to the sexual abuse problem, which included a pamphlet with an apology and contact details for those seeking to file complaints.It pledged modest payouts to victims of pedophile priests, capped at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), and warned that the church would \u201cstrenuously defend\u201d its claims against those who decided to sue.During his time in Melbourne, he forced more than a dozen priests who were accused of abuse to step down.Soon after that, in 2002, a man came forward and said that Cardinal Pell, newly installed as Sydney\u2019s archbishop, had molested him at a Catholic summer camp in 1961, when the man was 12 years old and Cardinal Pell was a seminarian.It was the first and only public direct accusation against him, and he denied it.A judge hired by the church investigated. The accuser had had several run-ins with the police, many involving driving under the influence of alcohol. The judge ruled that there was not enough certainty to move forward.Cardinal Pell\u2019s supporters said the ruling proved his innocence; others disagreed.\u201cHe just couldn\u2019t declare it proven,\u201d said Mr. Marr, referring to the judge. \u201cIt was a really equivocal result. Anyone in Rome reading that document would surely have hesitated before making him a Cardinal.\u201dIf Cardinal Pell seemed worried, it did not show. He continued to play a vocal role in public life, frequently appearing in the news media as an outspoken critic of liberal ideas like gay marriage.This conservatism served him well both under Pope John Paul II, who made him a cardinal in 2003, and Pope Benedict, who worked with him in the Vatican\u2019s powerful doctrinal office.The New York Times is expanding its coverage of Australia and the region and we\u2019re inviting subscribers to help us shape the project with questions and discussion.In Australia, Cardinal Pell\u2019s Vatican status and conservative profile continued to insulate him. In 2004, Tony Abbott, a Catholic lawmaker who would go on to become Australia\u2019s prime minister, said: \u201cCardinal Pell is one of the greatest churchmen that Australia has seen.\u201dThis week, he echoed that sentiment with slightly more caution, declaring, \u201cThe George Pell I have known is a very fine man, indeed.\u201dIt was only a few years ago when Cardinal Pell\u2019s momentum seemed to shift, after victims and advocates accused the church of obstructing justice.As reporters told their stories with regularity, the Australian government established the commission to look broadly at institutional responses to child sex abuse.The investigators found abuses in a variety of faiths and organizations, but the conclusions about the Catholic Church were numerous and widespread. There were accusations against priests, brothers and other church workers at more than 1,000 church institutions from more than 4,400 alleged victims.In Ballarat, the commission triggered a series of revived traumas, and new opportunities. Mr. Blenkiron, a former electrician, said he and other victims have spent much of the past few years trying to turn their experiences around.Speaking at schools and elsewhere, they have tried to break down what Mr. Blenkiron described as a culture of secrecy and shame that helped keep the abuse hidden for so long.He, Mr. Collins and many of the other victims who went to Rome last year said they still believed at the time that Cardinal Pell could help them. Pope Francis seemed to have faith in him.\u201cGeorge Pell was a bit of an icon in Ballarat,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cHe\u2019s a local boy made good, so there\u2019s a tinge of sadness behind all of this.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the period in which one victim, Andrew Collins, says he was sexually abused. It was the 1970s and \u201980s, not the 1960s and \u201970s.Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Sydney; Lucie Morris-Marr contributed reporting from Melbourne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "R.B.S. to Pay $5.5 Billion to Settle Toxic Mortgage Claims in U.S.", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Wednesday that it had agreed to pay $5.5 billion to American authorities to resolve claims related to its underwriting and sale of toxic mortgage securities.The lender, based in Edinburgh, is restructuring as it sells businesses and dismantles its global investment bank to focus on retail and corporate banking in Britain and Ireland. But it is still 72 percent owned by the British government after a bailout during the financial crisis.R.B.S. said it continued to cooperate with investigations by the United States Justice Department and other American regulators into the sale of mortgage-backed securities, which could lead to further settlements or penalties. Ewen Stevenson, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call on Wednesday that he could not provide an update on talks with the Justice Department, but that he remained hopeful that the inquiry could be resolved this year.The latest settlement relates to $32 billion in so-called residential mortgage-backed securities.The Federal Housing Finance Agency sued R.B.S. and 17 other financial institutions in 2011, accusing them of violating federal and state securities laws in the sale and underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities that were purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from 2005 to 2007.R.B.S. said it would be reimbursed $754 million of the settlement amount under indemnification agreements with third parties. The housing agency would then drop its litigation against the bank, the lender said. The bank said that the settlement was largely covered by its existing litigation provisions, but that it would take an additional charge of $196 million in the second quarter.R.B.S. said it still had unresolved residential mortgage-backed securities litigation matters related to issuance of less than $1 billion of the securities from 2005 to 2007.That amount does not include a separate case by the Federal Housing Finance Agency involving securities issued by Nomura, for which R.B.S. said it intended to pursue indemnification.Advertisement"}

Tax Negotiators Move Closer to a Unified Plan", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans seeking to get some momentum for their efforts to overhaul the tax code before the August recess are expected to share some results of their months of deliberations this week, aides said on Wednesday.Talks between the top tax negotiators in the House, Senate, White House and Treasury Department have been taking place feverishly as Republican leaders work to develop a unified plan they can introduce in September.The principles that they agree upon, which could be announced Thursday or Friday, are not expected to offer much clarity on many of the most contentious debates that have been weighing on congressional leaders and the White House economic team as they try to bridge their differences. But the release will signal that important progress is being made on President Trump\u2019s top legislative priority.The so-called \u201cbig six\u201d\u2014 Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the speaker of the House; Kevin Brady of Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader; Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Senate Finance Committee chairman; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the National Economic Council director \u2014 huddled again on Wednesday evening.Tax lobbyists will be watching closely for a number of important points: the top corporate and individual tax rates, taxation of small \u201cpass through\u201d businesses, deductibility of interest expenses and the controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports and let exports go untaxed.Business groups have already been scrambling around Washington fighting for their prized deductions and trying to \u201ceducate\u201d lawmakers about how best to reshape the tax system. Americans for Prosperity, the political network funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is planning to hold an event on taxes in Washington next week. The group has been marshaling its vast financial resources to kill the border tax concept and push for deep tax cuts.But Republicans will face big procedural obstacles as they try to move forward on rewriting the country\u2019s tax laws by the end of the year. The party needs to put the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act behind it, one way or another. It must also agree on a budget resolution that will unlock the tool needed to pass a tax bill without the support of any Democrats. Because of deep divisions within the party, this will not be easy.\u201cTax reform is like a Rubik\u2019s Cube,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery turn you make here has big impacts around it.\u201dMr. Mnuchin was vague, in testimony on Wednesday to the Senate about the Treasury Department\u2019s budget, on where he stood on proposals to allow businesses to immediately expense their capital investments. He said he was \u201clooking very closely\u201d at a national online sales tax that could help states fund infrastructure projects. But he offered little detail on how Mr. Trump would fulfill his promise to clamp down on the practice of corporate \u201cinversions\u201d that allow companies to pay lower taxes by merging with foreign businesses.\u201cI can assure you we are going to make sure that American companies stay here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.As Republicans move forward with their tax plans, Mr. Trump added more confusion this week.\u201cThe truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s upward revision, it\u2019s going to be on high-income people.\u201dMr. Trump went on to recount a recent conversation with his friend Robert Kraft, a billionaire businessman, who advised the president to raise taxes on the wealthy and reduce them for the middle class.\u201cIt was a very interesting statement,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201dIf Republicans were to reverse course and increase taxes on the rich, it would come as a big disappointment to the party\u2019s base.Grover Norquist, the founder of the anti-tax organization Americans for Tax Reform, said he was certain that Mr. Trump understood that raising taxes on the rich would be bad for economic growth. He thinks Mr. Trump did not mean what he said.\u201cWhat you are hearing from the administration is that they are sensitive to the Democrats\u2019 critique of any tax cut for rich people,\u201d Mr. Norquist said. \u201cI think he\u2019s just being defensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also cited allegations of political connections. As a result, the bank decided to remove itself from any transactions, a senior executive wrote.\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and are not prepared to take the risk,\u201d Matthew M. Koder, Bank of America\u2019s president for Asia Pacific, wrote in the email, dated June 28.\u201cGiven the importance of maintaining rigorous client selection standards, we have decided not to be involved with transactions with the HNA Group at this point in time,\u201d Mr. Koder added.Bank of America declined to comment.HNA declined to comment.Bank of America had been in discussions with HNA to enter new lending partnerships in future transactions, according to a person with direct knowledge but who was not authorized to speak publicly because the discussions were private. It has also been among several other banks helping HNA to take at least one of its myriad private companies public.The cold shoulder from one of the biggest banks in the United States is the latest in a series of road bumps for HNA, an aggressive conglomerate whose holdings include an airline, Hilton Hotels and a technology wholesaler.Anbang Insurance Group was the first big Chinese company to make a splash overseas when it bought the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan three years ago, drawing attention to Chinese companies with global ambitions and huge war chests. And Dalian Wanda quickly became a heavyweight in Hollywood \u2014 spending more than $8 billion on entertainment companies like AMC Theaters and Legendary Entertainment.This year, however, those companies appeared to hit the brakes on their drive to acquire Western companies.HNA\u2019s deal-making machine, on the other hand, has seemed relentless.In recent years, HNA has acquired the California technology companies Ingram Micro and Swissport and bought large stakes in Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank. Its 9.99 percent stake in Deutsche Bank has now drawn scrutiny from the European Central Bank, which is said to be looking at whether HNA meets the criteria for large bank shareholders.Questions about its ownership structure have long dogged HNA.HNA has denied those ties, saying that Mr. Guo\u2019s allegations are \u201ccompletely unfounded and false.\u201dNevertheless, one of Bank of America\u2019s concerns highlighted \u201ctoo many irregularities in the historical and current shareholding and corporate structure,\u201d as well as the \u201copaque nature of some of the existing shareholders\u201d among its concerns.HNA has said that it relied on American and European banks to help fuel its acquisitions, borrowing billions of dollars for its transactions. Those banks, as well as lawyers and auditors, have examined HNA.Yet, questions persist as to whether the banks have the proper due diligence and risk control processes for dealing with Chinese companies.For most of the big banks, doing business with HNA has been lucrative. On one side of business, banks have helped HNA buy companies by arranging what is called collateralized financing. That has entailed allowing HNA to borrow money against the shares of the company that it is acquiring.Big banks have also received large paydays for advising on HNA\u2019s acquisitions. HNA and its affiliates overseas have paid an estimated $100 million in fees to banks advising on mergers and acquisitions since 2016, according to estimates by Dealogic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Foot Soldier Sidelined Under Glare of Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust over a decade ago, Donald J. Trump was locked in conflict with a group of apartment owners who had taken control of the condominium board at his new glass tower across from the United Nations. Faced with accusations of financial impropriety and an affront to his authority, Mr. Trump turned to Michael D. Cohen, a former personal injury lawyer who helped run a taxi fleet.Mr. Cohen did not seem to have extensive expertise in the arcana of New York City condo rules. But he had something Mr. Trump seemed to value more: devotion to the Trump brand. He had already purchased a number of Trump properties and had persuaded his parents, in-laws and a business partner to buy apartments in Mr. Trump\u2019s flashy new development, Trump World Tower.Plus, he had read Mr. Trump\u2019s book \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d Twice.With Mr. Cohen\u2019s help, Mr. Trump regained control of the board, orchestrating a coup that culminated in a standoff between his security detail and private guards hired by the disgruntled owners, according to people who were there. Details of the dispute\u2019s resolution are secret because of a confidentiality agreement, but Mr. Cohen said that his task was \u201cmasterfully accomplished.\u201dHe went on to serve as a key confidant for Mr. Trump, with an office near the boss at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Officially, his title was special counsel, but he appears to have served more as a kind of personal arm-twister. If anyone crossed Mr. Trump or stood in his way, Mr. Cohen, who was known to sometimes carry a licensed pistol in an ankle holster, would cajole, bully or threaten a lawsuit, according to a half-dozen people who dealt with him over the years.Since Mr. Trump became president, his need for loyal foot soldiers like Mr. Cohen has never been greater. But instead of helping his longtime employer navigate F.B.I. and congressional investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, Mr. Cohen now appears to be outside the Trump inner circle, a man on the defensive.He has also attracted attention for playing a role in a failed effort to open a back channel for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, where his wife\u2019s family is from.After years of loyal service to Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen, 50, expected to be offered a senior administration post, according to four people who know him, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared angering Mr. Cohen.He was given no such job.\u201cClearly my life has changed since Trump became POTUS and I accepted the role as personal attorney to the president,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote in a text message in response to a question from a New York Times reporter last week. \u201cThis change has come with both many pros and cons.\u201dAnd so Mr. Cohen has found himself increasingly relegated to the role of second-string defender. He has chastised critics, including Snoop Dogg (\u201cThere\u2019s so much more that Snoop can do for this country\u201d) and Johnny Depp (\u201cWay to use your notoriety for good, Captain Jack-Ass!\u201d).Mr. Cohen was already a wealthy man with his own small real estate empire by the time he joined Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Even so, his ascent from a lawyer handling personal injury cases out of an office shared with his taxi company \u2014 first in Manhattan, then in Queens \u2014 to the 26th floor of Trump Tower is a remarkable New York story.Mr. Cohen comes from a long line of doctors and lawyers. His father survived the Holocaust in Poland and went on to become a physician on Long Island. An uncle close to the Cohen family, Morton W. Levine, is a doctor and businessman. He ran summer weight-loss and fitness camps for children decades ago and has long owned a Brooklyn catering hall, El Caribe, a popular site for weddings and retirement parties that was a meeting spot in the 1980s and 1990s for Italian and Russian mobsters. (Dr. Levine was never charged with any wrongdoing.)In an interview, Mr. Cohen said he became a lawyer to appease one of his grandmothers, who threatened to leave him out of her will if he did not. \u201cYou don\u2019t really have any money,\u201d he said he replied, \u201cto which she slapped me across my face.\u201dHe saw himself as an entrepreneurial risk taker from an early age.While a student at American University in Washington, he said he imported luxury cars into the United States. He also invested in a casino boat that went bust and helped his family organize an ethanol business in Ukraine that failed.He also once had his own political ambitions. He ran for the New York City Council as a Republican in 2003 and lost, and later flirted briefly with running for the New York State Senate, but dropped out after a month.Several of the men he associated with in business dealings over the years faced legal problems of one sort or another. His boss at his first law firm, a personal injury practice, pleaded guilty to bribery in an insurance scheme. His father-in-law, who once also owned taxi medallions, pleaded guilty to tax-related charges more than two decades ago. Two of his partners in the taxi business have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and settlements for various violations. Mr. Cohen, though, has avoided legal troubles.From 2011 to 2014, he purchased four small apartment buildings in Manhattan and sold them for a total of $32 million. In 2015, he paid $58 million for a seven-story apartment building on the Upper East Side.Those who have known him for years said Mr. Cohen had a penchant for luxury, like Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen was married at the Pierre, a legacy luxury hotel overlooking Central Park, drove a Porsche in college and at one point owned a Bentley.It was his purchase of blocks of apartments in Trump buildings starting around 2001 that seems to have caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye. At the time of the 2006 board dispute, Mr. Cohen was overseeing the finishing touches on his new apartment at Trump Park Avenue. Not long after the dispute was resolved, Mr. Cohen said, he was summoned to Trump Tower and offered a job.At the time, he was a partner at the Phillips Nizer LLP law firm. He said that he immediately accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s offer and never returned to his old office, where he had worked for about a year. Instead, he moved into an office previously used by Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump.Explaining his relationship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said in an interview last month with The Times, \u201cWhen he finds someone who he considers capable, does a great job and accomplishes the task, he tends to go back to that person again and again and again.\u201d He added, \u201cHe\u2019s comfortable with people who he deems worthy.\u201dThe scope of Mr. Cohen\u2019s job with Mr. Trump is not clear. After a decade of working for the Trump Organization, he has left little public record of his accomplishments. An effort to develop Trump-branded golf communities in New Jersey and in Fresno, Calif., floundered, along with a mixed martial arts venture with a Russian fighter as the headliner. Mr. Cohen did some scouting and groundwork for possible Trump condominium towers in the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Kazakhstan, but those deals never materialized.He has declined to discuss the details of what he did at the company, and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Some people who worked with him also declined to describe Mr. Cohen\u2019s tenure, with several of them saying they feared being sued.Mr. Cohen\u2019s younger brother, Bryan Cohen, said he was a different person than his public appearances might suggest, describing him more as a father figure growing up in the Five Towns section of Long Island.The man he became, Bryan Cohen surmised, would have made a good contestant on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\u201cI believe that my brother represents the type of person that the show depicted that Trump liked and appreciated,\u201d Bryan Cohen said. \u201cHe had a combination of smarts, street smarts, and those things are not mutually exclusive. He\u2019s successful, aggressive. That seemingly was a winning combination on the early seasons of \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\u201dThroughout it all, Michael Cohen has clearly idolized his boss.He has described Mr. Trump as \u201cour patriarch\u201d and \u201cthe greatest deal maker of this century.\u201d He has said that he patterned his life after \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d and he shares Mr. Trump\u2019s taste for boxy suits and long silk ties. He even sounds a bit like Mr. Trump, with a punchy edge to his New York accent.Mr. Cohen said in January that he planned to leave his job with the Trump Organization to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers.He has recently been spending time in Washington. The Republican National Committee named him to its finance leadership team this year, and in April, the international law firm and Washington lobbying powerhouse Squire Patton Boggs formed a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d with Mr. Cohen\u2019s law practice.Several people with knowledge of Mr. Cohen\u2019s involvement with Squire Patton Boggs said he had been brought on as a sort of rainmaker because of his business contacts in the United States and abroad. He will operate out of the firm\u2019s New York office and will be able to take advantage of its global reach to help his own clients.He is also conferring with his lawyer, Stephen M. Ryan, of the firm McDermott, Will & Emery, to prepare for his appearance before the House committee. Its Senate counterpart is conducting its own Russia inquiry, with which Mr. Cohen is cooperating, the lawyer said, but that panel has not called Mr. Cohen for questioning.Mr. Cohen is still working hard for Mr. Trump. In recent weeks, he was soliciting donations for the president\u2019s victory fund, a joint fund-raising effort between Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee. \u201cProud to say I raised over $500K today,\u201d he said in a recent text message. He later said preliminary figures indicated that he had brought in about $2 million.At a $35,000-a-plate fund-raiser last week at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump acknowledged the efforts of his former employee, whom he said he had not seen in a month.Susanne Craig contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "In Health Care, Republicans Could Learn From Rwanda", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAs you regroup after the collapse of your bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, hoping to figure out some new approach to dismember it, you might want to think not about Denmark, but about Rwanda.Rwanda\u2019s economy adds up to some $700 per person, less than one-eightieth of the average economic output of an American. A little more than two decades ago it was shaken by genocidal interethnic conflict that killed hundreds of thousands. Still today, a newborn Rwandan can expect to live to 64, 15 years less than an American baby.Republicans, I know Rwanda \u2014 with its poverty, illiteracy and autocratic government \u2014 is not in the same peer group as the United States. But in some dimensions of health care, it gives the United States a run for its money.A comparison of the Senate health care with the Affordable Care Act.Every country has followed its own path and run into its own walls. Yet collectively, these nations offer a few basic lessons that might help you understand how health care in the United States could be improved.One is that it is hard to finance a universal system with voluntary payments. The young and the healthy will be reluctant to pay, leaving only the sick in the insurance pool, which would push the cost of premiums to unaffordable heights and ultimately cause the system to collapse. \u201cNo country has attained universal population coverage based on a system organized around voluntary prepayment,\u201d the World Bank researchers wrote.In fact, they said, in 2012 there were only five countries with more than 600,000 people where voluntary payments accounted for more than one-fifth of total health spending. (The United States was one.) Several developing countries that initially leaned on voluntary premiums to finance their push toward universal health care have turned increasingly to direct government funding, either from earmarked taxes or general budget revenues.Another rule of thumb is that it is best to consolidate the health care system into one big risk pool for the entire population, as Ghana, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam are aiming to do.Having several different pools \u2014 one for the poor, another for the aged, another for employees of this or that company \u2014 blocks the cross-subsidization from the rich to the poor, the young to the old and the healthy to the sick upon which insurance relies. It makes it tougher to control costs, as doctors and hospitals facing a cost-control squeeze in one pool might simply charge more to patients or insurers in the other.A critical third point is that it will be prohibitively expensive to provide universal health care access without cost controls and mechanisms to pare back unnecessary care. Rwanda, for instance, introduced a results-based financing approach that pays providers based on performance.Try proposing the use of effectiveness metrics to pare back the 17 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product sucked into the maw of the health care industry. You won\u2019t have to wait long to hear about \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Want to propose a single-payer health care system financed with higher taxes, maybe one that pays doctors a wage instead of a fee for service? It probably won\u2019t take long for the American Medical Association to call you a communist.But Republicans, the imperfections of the Affordable Care Act in dealing with an unwieldy, expensive health care system do not add up to a reason to throw its achievements away. Prosperity lies in the opposite direction. Just take a look around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Strongman Economics", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India has strong views on economics. Speaking to a big crowd of tycoons, investors and journalists in New Delhi, Mr. Modi once admitted that he is \u201cnot a big economist.\u201d Yet he promptly set out an economic vision for India to be a global manufacturing power. Investors should rush to \u201cmake in India,\u201d he said. He claimed that his strong leadership would usher in economic revival and 100 million new manufacturing jobs by 2022.During the prime ministerial campaign in the 2014 national elections, Mr. Modi mocked the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, for supposedly presiding over economic failure. He jeered that Mr. Singh \u2014 who has a doctorate in economics from Oxford University and was the architect of the liberalization of the Indian economy in the early 1990s \u2014 could not stop onion prices rising and that economic growth was jobless, both popular concerns.Later, as prime minister, Mr. Modi told me that India\u2019s economic performance had been embarrassing under Mr. Singh. (In fact, Mr. Singh\u2019s record was pretty good: In his full decade as prime minister, economic growth was on average 7.8 percent a year.) The world, Mr. Modi told me, saw that \u201cthe \u2018I\u2019 in the BRICS had become a burden,\u201d meaning India had fallen behind Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa. He bragged he was restoring India\u2019s image.Parts of India\u2019s $2.3 trillion-strong economy are in better shape today than they were three years ago. Onion prices are down. Deficits are lower. Businesses face somewhat less red tape. Foreign investment has come \u2014 over $160 billion in the first three years, compared with just $38 billion in the first three years of Mr. Singh \u2014 even if Indian firms are reluctant to spend.Local business leaders quietly grumble there is no dynamism on the ground, little consumer demand. Much infrastructure, such as wobbly roads and slow freight trains, needs improving. Indebted banks \u2014 state-run and vulnerable to political meddling \u2014 won\u2019t lend without reform.Almost no new jobs have been created under Mr. Modi. In the late Singh years, economists say, at least 400,000 extra jobs were added yearly. In the last three years of Mr. Singh\u2019s government, from 2011 to 2014, on average 579,000 extra jobs were added yearly in India.That was far too few, considering roughly one million people join the labor force every month. But under Mr. Modi the job-creation rate has fallen, in effect, to zero. Data for 2015, the latest year for which they are available, suggest that little more than 100,000 jobs were added to India\u2019s economy.In public, some business leaders have gushed that the \u201calmighty\u201d sent Mr. Modi, blessing his \u201cwisdom.\u201d That encourages Mr. Modi to think his personal role is immensely important. He recalls his 13 years running Gujarat, the western Indian state, where he corralled investors, offering land and attractive terms to set up factories. He is tempted to think a country of 1.3 billion might be run in the same way.Mr. Modi\u2019s approach could be called \u201cstrongman economics\u201d \u2014 the idea that a dominant leader\u2019s sweeping promise is more powerful than deep-set, complicated, economic problems.Experts who dare to disagree are dismissed as out of touch. When Mr. Modi chose to withdraw most bank notes from the economy last November to fight corruption, economists gave plenty of warning that a nasty shock would follow. \u201cDemonetization\u201d was a big reason growth slowed this year, as many workers went unpaid and consumers delayed spending.Official gross domestic product statistics show first-quarter growth in the economy, at an annual rate, was just 6.1 percent \u2014 unimpressive for a big, poor country with much catching up to do. It is also slower than when Mr. Singh, supposedly such an embarrassment, left office.Global economic conditions are remarkably benign right now. Oil prices are less than half what they were in 2014, when Mr. Modi came to power. They are crucial for India, which is a huge oil importer. Monsoon rains have been relatively kind. Else, India\u2019s recent story would be much harsher.Mr. Modi remains popular, partly because India\u2019s opposition is hopeless and because many Indians like his bombast. Nationalists talk of their country \u2014 which will soon be more populous than China \u2014 as an emerging superpower. Just as railway officials call dawdling trains \u201csuperfast,\u201d or as fawning broadcasters call Mr. Modi the \u201cfirst 24x7 prime time prime minister,\u201d such claims are overdone.Mr. Modi\u2019s economic promises are so extraordinary they must be taken with a deep slurp of salty lime juice. He vowed India would train apprentices by the hundreds of millions to service that manufacturing boom. He said internet networks would get to all of the country\u2019s 600,000 villages shortly. He promised to clean the polluted Ganges River and build 100 million extra toilets by 2019. And, he said, India will have 100 new \u201csmart cities\u201d and a network of high-speed trains, and the World Bank will rank it as one of the 50 countries friendliest to businesses \u2014 up from 130th now.Such promises are bold, but few are plausible, given the strongman economist\u2019s limited efforts to deliver. It is good to see, at long last, the start of a national Goods and Service Tax. It is supposed to create a single market, replacing lots of local taxes with national ones. But the system, with six tax rates for different goods, looks overly complicated and some in business complain it has been implemented poorly. A welcome new law on bankruptcy should help the financial system. It has grown a bit easier for foreigners to invest in some sectors.Much else is no nearer to happening under Mr. Modi than under Mr. Singh. Few formal jobs have been created, as labor laws remain painfully restrictive. Nobody dares talk about creating freer markets in agriculture, lest that upset villagers. It is still hard, without political help, to buy land to build a factory. And in too many sectors \u2014 such as makers of steel, fighter jets and even sex toys \u2014 state-owned firms crowd out private ones. Mr. Modi has not done much to fix such problems, beyond telling state governments to try.Especially worrying are the consequences of Mr. Modi\u2019s political character. For all his strongman economist posturing, he never repudiates his longstanding Hindu nationalist views. Members of religious minorities fear growing intolerance. Mob violence has increased. Mr. Modi, a lively Twitter commentator, remains quiet for too long and does little to stop the violence.Sectarian strife and instability, a worry in itself, also matters for the economy. Who wants to invest if arbitrary political decisions can threaten whole industries? Crackdowns on alcohol sales in much of India badly hurt the tourism industry. Attacks on the trade in cow and buffalo meat threaten an industry that creates jobs for many and that last year earned India much-needed exports worth $4 billion.India\u2019s tolerant, secular character forms the bedrock on which a strong economy can be built. You need not be a big economist to grasp that it would be crazy to weaken that foundation.Adam Roberts, the European Business and Finance correspondent and former South Asia correspondent for The Economist, is the author of \u201cSuperfast Primetime Ultimate Nation: The Relentless Invention of Modern India.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Fees Are Great, if You Actually Get Them", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith investment costs, less is more. Many investors are getting the message that paying less for mutual funds (or for any investment, really) will put more money in their pockets in the long run.But investment costs are full of unpleasant surprises, and academic studies have found that many people aren\u2019t taking advantage of better-priced alternatives.\u201cIn one part of the market there is enormous cost competition, and investors there have never had it better: They can buy funds almost for free,\u201d said Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel with the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.\u201cBut outside of that space, there isn\u2019t as much competition,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors need better information about what they\u2019re paying and what they\u2019re getting.\u201dBy now, many people understand that fund fees take a toll on returns.Now, many cost-conscious investors are voting with their wallets.Last year, there were $326 billion in outflows from the highest-cost actively managed funds, and a record $429 billion in inflows to the lowest-cost index funds, according to Morningstar\u2019s analysis of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the United States.As a result, the market share of low-cost passive funds swelled to 32 percent in 2016, from 23 percent in 2012.On the face of it, there is a benevolent domino effect happening: As more investors choose cheaper funds, the assets in those funds grow \u2014 and the corresponding costs further decline. Or they should.But positive as this trend may be, it masks some glaring, persistent differences in fund costs throughout the industry, said Michael J. Cooper, a professor of finance at the University of Utah. \u201cExpense ratios are dropping, which is wonderful,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the disparity between high-cost funds and low-cost funds hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dEven controlling for characteristics like a fund\u2019s style, size and risk level, the study revealed a constant disparity in fund pricing over time \u2014 and the risk of lower returns for those who buy pricier funds, because of the compounding effect of fees.\u201cThe costs for getting it wrong \u2014 investing in high-expense funds when close-to-identical low-expense funds are available \u2014 are large,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe show that a low-expense fund investor could have earned 70 percent to 145 percent more\u201d than someone who chose comparable funds at a higher price.The authors looked at the effect of fees over a 48-year horizon, which helped to show the potentially dramatic toll of investment costs over decades.The analysis built on work by other researchers who had found that Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index funds, which merely track the S.&.P. 500, show a surprisingly wide price gap, \u201cdespite being basically the same peanut butter,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. He found that, for the period of 2000 to 2014, an investor in the lowest-cost S.&.P. 500 index funds would have ended up with a balance 22 percent higher than someone who invested in the highest-cost funds.\u201cIt\u2019s baffling,\u201d said Mr. Hauptman of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cYou have nearly identical funds, yet one can cost 1 percent more than the other. In a competitive environment, why do these products exist?\u201dYet they do. Even confining one\u2019s view to the landscape of S.&.P. 500 index funds \u2014 often referred to as plain vanilla funds because they simply mirror the performance of big companies \u2014 the range of choices is dizzying. There are about 50 different S.&.P. 500 funds, with over 150 different share classes, according to Morningstar, and fees vary widely.What can account for such stark differences? One reason Vanguard maintains such low fees is the economy of scale of its equity index funds, which are among the biggest and cheapest in the industry.Rydex funds, by contrast, have fewer assets under management, which can drive up costs. And the Rydex S.&.P. 500 fund \u201cis more expensive than some other index funds because it is priced twice a day and designed for tactical fund traders,\u201d said Ivy McLemore, a spokesman for Guggenheim Investments, which offers the Rydex funds.Advertisement"}

LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:On Monday, President Trump asked Congress to pass a repeal-only bill. Really? How could we possibly have confidence in a plan to take away health care entirely, with a dubious promissory note to come up with a better (maybe) plan after we\u2019ve witnessed years of Republican finagling and failure?I shudder to think how many people would have to die, just waiting.LOIS BLOOM, WILLIAMSBURG, VA.To the Editor:Finally, President Trump has got it right. He blames \u201cDemocrats and a few Republicans\u201d for refusing to destroy health care for millions.Democrats should be pleased to take the blame (\u201ccredit\u201d would be a more accurate word) for protecting the Affordable Care Act. Not only is this morally the right thing to do; it is politically right, too, since a majority of Americans now support it.GAIL GOLDEY, HARRISON, N.Y.To the Editor:Since both parties have acknowledged certain flaws in the Affordable Care Act, bipartisan legislation to amend and improve the law, not repeal and replace it, should be the focus.The Republicans would get a much-needed victory, and the Democrats would also benefit, since the law would include at least some of their ideas. And those of us who are covered by the law would benefit as well.To the Editor:The collapse of the health care process demonstrates that Republicans cannot make a deal with themselves.Now President Trump will relive the darkest arts of the deal and try to force his opponents to come to the table by threat.

{"Headline": "Total Signs Deal With Iran, Exposing It to Big Risks and Rewards", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, the chairman and chief executive of the French energy giant Total, worried for months that a breakthrough deal to invest in Iran might not be finalized.On Monday, though, Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 was comfortable enough with the risks to sign an agreement in Tehran committing his company to lead a natural gas project in the Persian Gulf that could open Iran\u2019s huge petroleum reserves to international players.The decision has far-reaching implications, not least setting a path that other Western energy companies could soon follow, and possibly giving Total an inside track for future contracts in Iran. But it also exposes the company to risk if Mr. Trump reneges on the Iran nuclear deal, or if the United States imposes further sanctions against Tehran.Under the terms of the deal, Total will invest $1 billion in the first phase of development of part of the South Pars gas field. It will form a partnership with the China National Petroleum Corporation and the Iranian company Petropars.\u201cThis is the one that everyone has been waiting for,\u201d Homayoun Falakshahi, an analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said of the announcement. \u201cThis deal very much sets the example.\u201dTotal is extremely familiar with the slice of South Pars that it will work on, having scoped it out before sanctions made work in Iran impossible for big international companies.Iranian oil officials are known as tough negotiators, but Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 argues that by being the first of the big international oil companies to sign a major deal with a post-sanctions Iran, he was able to shape much better terms than had been offered in the past.Being in the lead could also position Total to reap other rewards, possibly including access to the Azadegan oil field, which could become one of the industry\u2019s largest projects in the next decade.\u201cWhat the Middle East can offer us is having giant resources at a low cost,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have a profitable business.\u201dIran, long on oil and gas, but short on capital and technology, could be the next great energy frontier if global and domestic politics permit. A wide range of international oil companies are circling around it, looking for the right opportunity.Total\u2019s deal is not without risks, however. In particular, the Trump administration, which is reviewing its approach to Iran, could take a harder line against Tehran, discouraging even international companies from investing there.From Total\u2019s point of view, the advantages seem to outweigh the drawbacks.\u201cIt is a fairly reasonable risk to take, given what they have been seeing and what they have been hearing,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a former sanctions coordinator at the State Department who is now a researcher at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Total can count on the backing of the French government, and it has additional protection from the investment of China National Petroleum Corporation, a state-owned company.And with an annual investment budget of around $17 billion, the $1 billion Total has committed to spend over several years in Iran \u201cis relatively small in the grand scheme of things,\u201d said Oswald Clint, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research in London.Iran can also be a difficult and opaque place to do business, one where corruption is widespread and where political opposition to foreign investment in Iran\u2019s natural resources can raise obstacles.Companies also say they need to take extreme care because of sanctions. Some oil executives said that when traveling to Iran to meet with officials there, for instance, they take only laptops stripped of sophisticated software like encryption programs, and older models of mobile phones, to avoid accidentally violating export controls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Part of Hudson Yards Tunnels Is Nearly Done. Now It Sits, Unused.", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s an active construction site, hard hat and harness required, but the two tubes under the rising towers of the sprawling Hudson Yards development on the Far West Side of Manhattan are relatively peaceful. The nine-foot thick concrete walls, floors and ceilings are all smoothed over, humming with the whir of ventilation ducts and the low buzz of battery-powered LED lighting.Echoes from shouts reverberate for seconds.For two blocks, the box tunnels stretch, curving slightly as they cut a clean concrete cavern 90 feet below 10th and 11th Avenues, plugged on both ends by stark concrete walls that abruptly halt their march.For now, the tubes sit empty and unused. But someday, they might be key pieces to providing the relief that many rail travelers have long yearned for \u2014 the tubes would help link a new tunnel under the Hudson River to tracks leading to Pennsylvania Station.\u201cWhat you see here is the concrete casing, complete here in the first two sections,\u201d Craig Schulz, a spokesman for Amtrak, explained to Representative Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, as he toured the project on a recent weekday. Construction has yet to begin on one remaining section that would connect the box tunnels to the Hudson tunnel.The building of the river tunnel hasn\u2019t begun either. Both projects lack funding.In this era of failing infrastructure and political gridlock, the two-block long caverns, known as the Hudson Yards right of way project, are a rarity for the region: largely completed and funded rail infrastructure work.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to punt any longer,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said repeatedly as he toured the area. \u201cThat\u2019s frankly why I\u2019m here. You see what\u2019s going on in the \u2018summer of hell.\u2019 People are experiencing what\u2019s going to go on when you have 100-year-old tunnels and equipment breaking.\u201dThe box tunnels are the first completed phase of the Gateway project, an ambitious multibillion-dollar project to bring new rail tunnels under the Hudson River, rebuild key bridges and expand the track capacity at Penn Station. It is considered one of the most vital infrastructure projects in the country.Construction of the Hudson Yard tunnels began over four years ago when Amtrak sought to preserve a right of way under the Hudson Yards project to ensure that the railroad would be able to connect the proposed new rail tunnels under the river with the existing track infrastructure at Penn Station.The only remaining viable path was under the Hudson Yards project.Through Mr. Schumer\u2019s office, funding was quickly secured from money that had been set aside for recovery after Hurricane Sandy and work began in August 2013.\u201cThe fact that everybody pulled together, public sector, private sector, Amtrak, federal government, state government, to make sure that the box tunnel was built so that we could do Gateway is a good metaphor,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cWhen they understand how important Gateway is, they\u2019re willing to work together for the common good. So the box tunnel hopefully is a metaphor for the rest of Gateway, because when it started it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201dNow, four years and $250 million later, the first and second sections of the casing are complete and are ready for the Hudson tunnels. A third is fully designed but needs funding to advance to construction.It could be a long wait.Amtrak insists that it is moving forward with as much of the Gateway project as it can.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Schulz said, referring to environmental reports and engineering tests. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of dirt flying, there\u2019s not a lot of construction happening, but we\u2019re getting closer and closer every day.\u201dWhile the Trump administration has not committed funding to the Gateway project, some New Jersey lawmakers have been able to steer financing toward the work.The scene at Hudson Yards, with the tunnels underground and seemingly endless construction happening above ground, was enough to frustrate Mr. Gottheimer, a freshman congressman from northern New Jersey. He looked at the booming Hudson Yards project with envy.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in Jersey is just the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the congestion, because of people\u2019s complete frustration of not being able to get home to see their kids and their family, because they sit on stuck trains,\u201d the state is losing its competitive edge.Indeed, it may be the one issue uniting New Jersey politicians. The day after Mr. Gottheimer toured the project, Mr. Christie, during an hourlong interview on MSNBC, urged President Trump to shift his priorities away from health care.\u201cI\u2019d advise him to move on and move on to other priorities,\u201d said Mr. Christie, who talks to Mr. Trump frequently, \u201clike tax reform and infrastructure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How German Condoms Funded the Russian Revolution", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyThe name Vladimir Ilyich Lenin is not often linked with wartime profiteering and black-market smuggling gangs. A noted prude, he lacked the gene for swashbuckling. Yet crime and speculation helped finance his activities in 1917. A good deal of the cash he needed to prepare the Great October Socialist Revolution was channeled through an import-export company that specialized in contraband pharmaceuticals, lead pencils and German condoms.The trail begins in Switzerland, where Lenin, exiled from Russia, had been living since the outbreak of World War I. In March 1917, the news of revolution in Petrograd reached him in Zurich. As the leader of the Bolsheviks, Russia\u2019s most radical socialist party, it was his duty to go back at once. The problem was that there was no safe route: Lenin\u2019s call to turn the European war into revolution against the bourgeoisie had not endeared him to the French and British, so going west was likely to result in his detention without trial. But heading north through Germany meant crossing land belonging to his country\u2019s enemy. He could expect arrest on charges of treason if he ever made it home.It took more than a week of talks to find an answer. The German government agreed to offer Lenin safe-conduct to the Baltic Sea, escorting him inside a special train car with locked trackside doors. In legal terms, Lenin later explained, the carriage was an \u201cextraterritorial entity,\u201d a capsule shooting over German soil without contact with German citizens, potential enemies and spies. But as it trundled slowly up toward the coast, the vehicle was quickly called \u201cthe sealed train.\u201dThere was nothing clandestine about the journey. Lenin was eager to solicit the approval of any public figure he could find. At the last minute, in pursuit of international support, he even called the American Legation in Bern, Switzerland. It was a Sunday, and the young man at the desk was leaving for a tennis match. \u201cCall back tomorrow,\u201d he told the future master of the Kremlin. In years to come, when that young man, Allen Dulles, became head of the C.I.A., he dined out on the story of that call.Lenin did not need the kaiser\u2019s gold to get himself home. He made a point of paying for his (second-class) ticket. But questions started soon after he arrived in Petrograd. Seizing the reins of party leadership at once, Lenin insisted on a program that repudiated all imperialist war. His opposition to the provisional government, the temporary cabinet of liberals and businessmen that was trying to run exactly such a war on Russia\u2019s part, fueled suspicion that he was a German stooge.The French suggested that they might have proof. Encouraged by that hope, a Russian colonel named Boris Nikitin was put in charge of the investigation. He dispatched a spy to monitor the Bolsheviks\u2019 use of the telegraph and paid informers for all gossip, true or false. Nikitin\u2019s was a full-time job, but the only office space available was in a building partly occupied by yet more suspect Bolsheviks. Not only did the colonel feel like the one being watched, but all his windows opened onto fluttering red flags.Meanwhile, the provisional government continued to prosecute the war. In late June, it launched an offensive on the Galician front. Though vaunted as a campaign by the crack troops of a free new state, it collapsed within three days. Large-scale disturbances ensued in Petrograd, complete with street battles between right- and left-wing gangs, black flags and socialist banners, panic, shooting and civilian deaths. There were new rumors of a coup.In desperation, Pavel Pereverzev, the justice minister, tried scapegoating the Bolsheviks for Russia\u2019s dismal plight. His evidence was flimsy (he was promptly ordered to resign), but the idea that Lenin had been working for the Germans prompted a manhunt. As Petrograd descended into chaos, government thugs ransacked the office that produced the Bolshevik newspaper, Pravda. Several leading revolutionaries were imprisoned, among them Leon Trotsky. Beardless and disguised beneath a wig, Lenin fled the Russian capital in fear for his life. In August, after collecting more testimony, the provisional government condemned him in absentia.The case against Lenin was always thin. Pereverzev\u2019s evidence, which involved a contract Lenin was alleged to have signed in Berlin at some time in the previous year, turned out to be the raving of a fugitive prisoner of war. The press proffered more fairy tales \u2014 Lenin\u2019s sister was a spy based in Salonica, Lenin had been murdered, Lenin\u2019s real name was Mytenbladm or Zederbluhm. Years later, Trotsky remembered July 1917 as \u201cthe month of the most gigantic slander in world history.\u201dIn fact, Lenin was far from dead. He used the months in Finland to lay new, ambitious plans. By mid-September, he felt bold enough to slip back into Russia and take up the fight again, this time preparing his lieutenants for a Bolshevik seizure of power. The operation took place on Nov. 7, and that same day the streets of Petrograd were littered with leaflets announcing the triumph of Lenin\u2019s new Soviet regime.But questions about finance have a way of haunting history\u2019s great men. Lenin relied on secrecy; the Germans let him down. At the end of 1917, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Richard von K\u00fchlmann, gloated about his country\u2019s role in November\u2019s Bolshevik coup. Berlin, he said, had long schemed to subvert Russia. The challenge had been to find a person who could do the job. The Germans had backed a range of hopefuls, from Finnish nationalists to Central Asian jihadists. \u201cIt was not until the Bolsheviks had received from us a steady flow of funds through various channels,\u201d Kuhlmann explained in a frank memorandum, \u201cthat they were in a position to build up their main organ, Pravda, to conduct energetic propaganda and to extend the originally narrow basis of their party.\u201dLenin\u2019s bank records were scrupulous enough. He protested that he had snubbed every agent the Germans sent him. He insisted (rightly) that his party had triumphed by giving voice and shape to real passions and despairs. Still, cash had been essential. In the summer of 1917, the British estimated that it would cost them 2 million pounds a month to match Lenin\u2019s propaganda effort. The high price had to take account of Bolshevism\u2019s genuine appeal, but even Lenin knew that newspapers and posters did not print and distribute themselves.That\u2019s where the condoms and lead pencils come in. Lenin could not risk accepting direct bribes, but it was easy for Berlin to supply his agents with commodities and then forget to send the bill. Goods were exported to Denmark (which was legal), the packaging was changed (illegal), and then they were resold to countries where imports from Germany were banned. Part of the profit found its way into the Bolsheviks\u2019 coffers via businesses in Stockholm. A key part here was played by Yakov F\u00fcrstenberg, the manager of a Scandinavian-based import-export company whose directors, Alexander Helphand and Georg Sklarz, were known agents of Germany. Though Lenin publicly disdained Helphand, F\u00fcrstenberg was one of his closest contacts, his north European fixer.\u201cLenin\u2019s entry into Russia successful,\u201d the German spy chief in Stockholm reported to his masters in April 1917. \u201cHe is working exactly as we would wish.\u201d But it was Lenin who would win the high-stakes gamble in the end. The kaiser and his ministers were swept away, but Lenin\u2019s empire went from strength to strength. As he had put it years before: \u201cSometimes a scoundrel is useful to our party precisely because he is a scoundrel.\u201dCatherine Merridale is the author, most recently, of \u201cLenin on the Train.\u201dThis is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}

Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the administration \u201cappreciates his service.\u201d Mr. Trump, she said, would nominate a successor \u201cin short order.\u201dBy departing ahead of schedule, Mr. Shaub handed Mr. Trump an opportunity to begin putting his mark on the agency overseeing the federal government\u2019s vast ethics program, including that of the White House. The office\u2019s director has traditionally had wide latitude to set its priorities, its tone in working with the White House and other federal agencies, and, perhaps most important, how to interpret the country\u2019s ethics laws.The vacancy is all but certain to frighten Democrats and those in the small world of government ethics who see the office under Mr. Shaub as an important political bulwark against conflicts of interest in the upper echelons of the government. To Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders, who have seen Mr. Shaub, an Obama appointee, as politically motivated, it is more welcome news.It is the job of the ethics office, a creation of a post-Watergate Congress, to work with a web of ethics officials at each agency to help people entering the government sidestep potential conflicts. The office guides each administration\u2019s political appointees through financial disclosure requirements and creates agreements to restrict participation in deliberations over topics they handled for paying clients.Mr. Trump did not heed his advice, and by the middle of January, Mr. Shaub thought he might be fired. To minimize his attachment to the position, he packed up the personal possessions that filled his office.But he was not fired, even as he continued to spar with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides over a range of ethical concerns, including the ethics office\u2019s authority to exercise oversight of the White House.Mr. Shaub, who served for about a decade as a career civil servant at the agency before being appointed director, said his role had always been politically neutral. He says he has not been fighting Mr. Trump, as some critics have suggested, but that, rather, his decisions to speak out have been motivated by a desire to defend an ethics program that has traditionally counted on support from Democrats and Republicans alike. He said he spoke publicly only after more traditional channels were exhausted.\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure,\u201d Mr. Shaub said. \u201cAmerica should have the right to know what the motivations of its leaders are, and they need to know that financial interests \u2014 personal financial interests \u2014 aren\u2019t among them.\u201dMr. Shaub will leave the agency this month to take up his new position as a senior director for ethics at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, a nonpartisan group that advocates campaign finance reform and litigates voting rights cases. There, he will have more freedom to comment on the government\u2019s ethics program and to propose a set of changes he said were needed badly.News of Mr. Shaub\u2019s departure was greeted on Thursday with more acquiescence than surprise. Those who have worked in the ethics office or in the White House said it raised pressing questions over whether Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of Mr. Shaub\u2019s successor would quiet the agency\u2019s criticism.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who comes after Walter is going to challenge the White House publicly the way that I think he did,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, who served as ethics counsel for the George W. Bush White House. \u201cIt is a great loss.\u201dMr. Painter said the administration would do itself a favor by naming a successor with experience in ethics law and a reputation for independence.The White House could also elect to leave the position to an acting director indefinitely. Shelley K. Finlayson, the office\u2019s chief of staff, is first in line for the acting director position, but the law governing such vacancies also allows the White House to choose from among the office\u2019s upper ranks.That arrangement, experts said, could help preserve the office and allow it to go about much of its work. Or it could simply be a quieter way to neutralize it, said Marilyn L. Glynn, who served as the agency\u2019s acting director during the Bush administration.\u201cBased on my experience as acting director, you clearly don\u2019t have the visibility and power that a full director would have,\u201d Ms. Glynn said. \u201cThat is one way of keeping the office fully below the radar.\u201dEric Lipton contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Germany is Turkey\u2019s main trading partner, and more than 3.3 million German tourists visited Turkey last year, more than came from any other country.On Friday, Mr. Erdogan scoffed at the ministers\u2019 warnings.\u201cI want to remind my German friends, and to all the world, you do not have the power to defame Turkey,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said at a fund-raising event for a hospital. \u201cYou do not have the power to scare us with these kinds of things.\u201dThis week, the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, called Mr. Steudtner\u2019s arrest \u201cabsurd\u201d and said it showed \u201cthat German citizens are no longer safe from arbitrary arrests\u201d in Turkey.In remarks published Friday in Bild, the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said that if Turkey \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop these games, we will have to tell people: \u2018You are traveling to Turkey at your own risk, we can no longer provide guarantees.\u2019\u201dAlso on Friday, two German news channels said they would no longer run ads that feature the soccer star Lukas Podolski encouraging investors: \u201cCome to Turkey. Discover your own story.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Erdogan is angry that Germany has granted asylum to former Turkish Army officers and other officials accused of playing a role in last year\u2019s coup attempt in Turkey. Mr. Erdogan also says that Germany harbors members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has waged an insurgency in southeastern Turkey for several decades.\u201cThe government who is hiding Turkish terrorists in Germany should first explain this,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said on Friday. \u201cWhy are they hiding in Germany? How they can explain the material support given to them?\u201dMembers of the Turkish diaspora in Germany were also at the center of a dispute in the spring, when German officials refused to allow Mr. Erdogan\u2019s political party to hold rallies for German-Turks in the run-up to a referendum in April, when Turks voted to expand the president\u2019s powers.\u201cIf it was up to Turkey, actually, Turkey would prefer to remain \u2018strategic partners\u2019 forever,\u201d Kurtulus Tayiz wrote in his column in Aksam, a pro-Erdogan newspaper. But he said that Germany and the United States had become the \u201ccenter of activities that pose both internal and external threats to Turkey\u2019s survival.\u201dWhile Germany has been reluctant to antagonize Turkey because it relies on Turkey to stem the flow of refugees toward Europe, migration pressures have lessened in the past year, and Turkey is no longer seen as quite so essential. Additionally, as Germany prepares for federal elections, its politicians stand to gain domestically from taking a strong stance on Turkish issues.\u201cTurkey is playing a game of brinkmanship with the hope that Germany will back down because that is what has happened in the past,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. \u201cBut that may not be the case this time.\u201dEven if Turkey now has no realistic chance of joining the union, Mr. Dalay said, Ankara is unlikely to want to halt the membership talks entirely, since they provide some reassurance to foreign investors.\u201cThe E.U. process is dead, but the fact it isn\u2019t terminated is beneficial for Turkey,\u201d Mr. Dalay said. \u201cIf tomorrow the process is officially terminated, that will have economic consequences.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s title.

She raised more than $100,000 in that category \u2014 which is limited to the first $175 from each donor \u2014 compared with $61,000 for the mayor.The donations were a kind of unintentional gift to the de Blasio campaign: It has made tying Ms. Malliotakis, who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn in the Assembly, to the national Republican Party and specifically to Mr. Trump a centerpiece of its strategy since she became the Republican front-runner last month.\u201cTheir pockets have no bottoms,\u201d Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign said of the Mercers in an email sent to supporters on Monday. The email linked the Mercers to Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and the right-wing website Breitbart News. The email also referred to Ms. Malliotakis as \u201ca Trump acolyte.\u201dMs. Malliotakis, speaking at a news conference in Queens to attack the mayor\u2019s handling of crime and police issues, dismissed concerns about the donations as \u201cirrelevant\u201d and said she believed the mayor had also accepted money from people whom he \u201cdoes not see eye-to-eye with all the time.\u201d She added, \u201cIt has nothing to do with Trump.\u201dMr. Albanese could still qualify for the Democratic primary debate with Mr. de Blasio next month. With his current contributions, he would have to collect roughly another $50,000 by Aug. 11 to meet the threshold for the debate.Bo Dietl, who is running for mayor as an independent, raised $245,266 during the two-month reporting period. Notably, he raised only $38,020 after Mr. Massey dropped out \u2014 a development that might have been seen as a boost to his bid as well. Mr. Dietl spent more than he raised over the last two months, including more than $150,000 on television advertising.Mr. Dietl, a former police detective who runs a private investigation company, had hoped to challenge the mayor in a Democratic primary but made a mistake filling out his voter registration form and wound up without a party affiliation. He then lost a court case in which he sought to run as a Republican. (Filings show he paid $10,000 to a lawyer, Martin Connor, who assisted in that effort.)Another independent-minded candidate, Roque De La Fuente, a millionaire real estate developer and California transplant, continued to put his own money into a campaign that has raised little from outside donors. Mr. De La Fuente, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, but is running for mayor as a Republican, lent his campaign $350,000 and raised a little over $8,400 in contributions.An earlier version of this article misstated Roque De La Fuente\u2019s political affiliation.

{"Headline": "China Showers Myanmar With Attention, as Trump Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 When Myanmar\u2019s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, wanted to hold a peace conference to end her country\u2019s long-burning insurgencies, a senior Chinese diplomat went to work.The official assembled scores of rebel leaders, many with longstanding connections to China, briefed them on the peace gathering and flew them on a chartered plane to Myanmar\u2019s capital. There, after being introduced to a beaming Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, they were wined and dined, and sang rowdy karaoke late into the night.A cease-fire may still be a long way off, but the gesture neatly illustrates how Myanmar, a former military dictatorship that the United States worked hard to press toward democracy, is now depending on China to help solve its problems.The pieces all fell into place for China: It wanted peace in Myanmar to protect its new energy investments, it had the leverage to press the rebels and it found an opening to do a favor for Myanmar to deliver peace.China is now able to play its natural role in Myanmar in a more forceful way than ever before as the United States under the Trump administration steps back from more than six years of heavy engagement in Myanmar, including some tentative contacts with some of the rebels. The vacuum left by the United States makes China\u2019s return all the easier.When Myanmar began to adopt democratic reforms in 2011, the Obama administration quickly reciprocated, loosening sanctions as part of a broader effort to strengthen relationships with Southeast Asian nations as a bulwark against China\u2019s rise.As Myanmar\u2019s relations with China cooled, the result of what many saw as heavy-handed intervention by Beijing, Barack Obama became, in 2012, the first American president to visit the country. He came again in 2014, promoting stronger trade and security relations, and counted Myanmar\u2019s opening as a foreign policy coup.But the United States did little to build on the new relationship, and now the tables have turned. As the Trump administration pays little attention, China is exercising strategic and economic interests that come from geographic proximity, using deep pockets for building billion-dollar infrastructure and activating ethnic ties with some of the rebel groups, all areas where the United States cannot compete.\u201cChina wants to show: \u2018We are doing our best at your behest,\u2019\u201d said Min Zin, executive director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy in Myanmar, who attended the peace gathering in May. \u201cAs the United States recedes, Aung San Suu Kyi is relying more and more on China in Myanmar and on the international stage.\u201dAnd not only Myanmar. Across Southeast Asia, China is energetically bringing nations into its orbit, wooing American friends and allies with military hardware, infrastructure deals and diplomatic attention.But nowhere is China\u2019s effort to win over Myanmar clearer than as mediator in Myanmar\u2019s ethnic civil wars, the mission Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi says is dearest to her heart.China is well positioned to help. Among the armed groups most resistant to peace talks are the United Wa State Army and the Kokang Army, both of which have been tacitly supported by China for years in their battles with the Myanmar military.The Wa, whose army is said to have 20,000 members, use Chinese currency in their autonomous region, where illegal narcotics are made and exported into China. Two Wa arms factories produce weapons with the help of former Chinese Army officers, and the Wa have received Chinese armored combat vehicles and tank destroyers, probably through Chinese middlemen, experts say.A third group, the Arakan Army, uses Chinese arms and vehicles provided by the Wa.China\u2019s special envoy for Asian affairs, Sun Guoxiang, brought the leaders of all three to the peace conference, as well as the leaders of four other rebel groups, most of whom use Chinese weapons.\u201cChina wants quiet in Myanmar,\u201d said Maung Aung Myoe, an expert on the Myanmar military at the International University of Japan. \u201cIt hurts their interests to have fighting because it disrupts China\u2019s trade. China now owns the peace process. The Myanmar military knows that.\u201dThe stakes are rising as a Chinese state-owned corporation negotiates final permissions to build a $7.3 billion deep-sea port at Kyaukpyu, a port town in Rakhine that will give China highly prized access to the Indian Ocean.Citic Construction of China is to start building the port early next year, having won the contract by covering 85 percent of the cost, said Oo Maung, vice chairman of the Kyaukpyu special economic zone management committee. Citic also won the right to build a $3.2 billion industrial park nearby, he said.The United States generally leaves construction projects and other investments abroad to private companies, and Myanmar, a frontier economy fraught with risks, is considered an unattractive destination, said Mary P. Callahan, associate professor of international studies at the University of Washington.\u201cAmerican companies haven\u2019t come because of the high price of land, and a difficult approval process,\u201d she said. \u201cThe labor force is cheap but not skilled.\u201dAmerica\u2019s loss may be China\u2019s strategic gain. China\u2019s ownership of the port \u2014 Citic will have the right to operate it for 50 years, with a possible 25-year extension \u2014 hands Beijing a giant boost in its long-term plans for supremacy in the Indian Ocean, analysts said.Once completed, \u201cKyaukpyu will be a Chinese naval base,\u201d said Mr. Maung Aung Myoe, the military analyst. \u201cChina desperately needs access on the eastern side of the Indian Ocean.\u201dChina is already building Indian Ocean ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and it is seeking approval for one in Bangladesh.Some hurdles remain. Frustration with China roils the scruffy town of Kyaukpyu, among the poorest in Myanmar. After a decade of Chinese pipeline construction in the area, ordinary people say they received few benefits. The schools built by China as part of a corporate responsibility project were empty shells, they said.\u201cI got a few cents a day for digging the pipeline and about $250 for the five-year use of my land,\u201d said Tun Aung Kyaw, 56, a farmer who was walking to herd his six cows in bare feet, a thin tarpaulin tied across his bare chest to protect him from the monsoon rain.Citic is aware of the hostility and is working with nongovernmental organizations in Kyaukpyu to avoid past mistakes, Mr. Yuan said. Citic will train Myanmar workers for 3,000 jobs for the park and the port, he said.A confidant of hers and a member of her political party, Mi Khun Chan, said China viewed aiding the peace process as part of the cost of winning a green light for the dam.For all the misgivings among her people about China, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi seems impressed with Beijing\u2019s power to assist in peace.Her father, Aung San, the leader of Burma after World War II, dreamed of a united country. He almost got there, presiding over an agreement with ethnic leaders in 1947 for a federation of states. Six months later he was assassinated.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi wants to finish the job. \u201cOur goal is the emergence of a democratic federal union based on democracy and federalism,\u201d she said at the opening of the peace conference.For the moment, she has China at her side.Wai Moe contributed reporting, and Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}

London\u2019s biggest rival, according to analysts, is probably the New York Stock Exchange.What the F.C.A. proposes is to create a category of premium listing specifically for state-owned companies. The twist: Interactions between these corporations and their sovereign controlling owners won\u2019t be treated as related-party transactions, meaning they won\u2019t require approval by other shareholders.Here\u2019s what the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, had to say:\u201cSovereign owners are different from private sector individuals or companies \u2014 both in their motivations and in their nature.

But he did call for the creation of an advisory board to review transparency in the bond market and for a continued crackdown on stock swindles.He also tried to balance his concern for investor protection with trying to reduce regulatory obstacles that deter companies from going public.The gaggle of reporters gathered around the Sun Valley Lodge, blocked from attending any of Allen & Co.\u2019s events, have dutifully noted the usual parade of moguls, including Timothy D.

{"Headline": "A Russian Developer Helps Out the Kremlin on Occasion. Was He a Conduit to Trump?", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russian Island, near the port city of Vladivostok in the far east, was a decaying former military base and home to a scattering of cattle when President Vladimir V. Putin suddenly envisioned it as a $1.2 billion campus where he could welcome heads of state for an Asia-Pacific conference.That sent Kremlin officials scrambling to find a developer to transform a site lacking fresh water, a pier or roads. They rejected numerous bids before one of them took a flier on a man known mostly for his glamorous shopping malls: Aras Agalarov of the Crocus Group.Not long after, Mr. Putin pinned a blue-ribboned state medal, the Order of Honor, on Mr. Agalarov\u2019s chest at a dazzling Kremlin ceremony. Soon, a string of demanding, more prominent projects followed: a stretch of superhighway ringing Moscow; two troubled stadiums for the 2018 World Cup, including one in a Baltic swamp.Mr. Agalarov, 61, also worked on a project with a future president, Donald J. Trump. Last week, the Russian developer and his crooner son and heir, Emin, were thrust into the swirl of speculation about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election.\u201cThis is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d wrote Rob Goldstone, a music producer and publicist working for Emin.The American attorney for the Agalarovs, Scott S. Balber, contradicted Mr. Goldstone\u2019s version, asserting in an interview that the senior Mr. Agalarov\u2019s role was merely a matter of an introduction. \u201cPeople in the business world do favors for each other all the time. As a courtesy to a lawyer they had a relationship with, they made an introduction,\u201d Mr. Balber said. \u201cWe were not in possession of damaging info. We had no reason to believe this was in relation to the Russian government.\u201dWhile there is no indication beyond what was said in the emails that the Agalarovs were serving as a conduit between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, wealthy and well-connected businessmen are often called on to do the bidding of the Russian government.Kremlin analysts stress that its red, crenelated walls conceal not a well-oiled machine but a hornet\u2019s nest of interests and influences competing to dominate an Erector Set of ad hoc policies and sudden opportunities, many of them highly lucrative.When it comes to exploiting those opportunities, the Kremlin often ignores its own bureaucrats, diplomats and other agents in favor of someone it thinks will get the job done \u2014 a charmed group whose members rise and fall in status along with their usefulness to Mr. Putin and his top aides.In that context, analysts find it entirely plausible that the Kremlin would tap Mr. Agalarov, a construction tycoon with a web of contacts to Mr. Trump, as a way to pass information to the Trump presidential campaign.\u201cIn a sense, almost no one is a direct agent of the Kremlin, but almost anyone can become one if the need arises,\u201d said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.Aleksei A. Navalny, the leading opposition figure in Russia and an anticorruption campaigner, says he has no doubt that the Agalarovs would do the bidding of the Kremlin if asked.In a blog post, Mr. Navalny refers to Yuri Chaika, the Russian state prosecutor \u2014 a position equivalent to the United States attorney general \u2014 whom Mr. Goldstone identified in his emails as the source of the information on offer at the Trump Tower meeting. Mr. Chaika, a staunch Putin loyalist, has been in that position since 2006.In the view of Mr. Navalny, a bitter opponent of Mr. Putin, it makes perfect sense that information passed from the Kremlin through Mr. Chaika and Mr. Agalarov to Mr. Trump, as the security services could easily have used such a trusted channel to reach out to the Trump campaign.That is no more than informed speculation, yet there are deep connections among the men. After Mr. Navalny released a documentary in 2015 accusing Mr. Chaika of corruption, for example, Mr. Agalarov rose to his defense. Writing in the newspaper Kommersant, he said the film mixed fact and fiction and echoed the work of Joseph Goebbels, the chief Nazi propagandist.Ms. Veselnitskaya has done legal work connected to real estate for Mr. Agalarov\u2019s company in Russia, said Mr. Balber, the family lawyer.Mr. Trump entered this circle with the 2013 Miss Universe contest, carried out with the help of lower-level bureaucrats and Mr. Agalarov, who paid $20 million to bring the pageant to his family\u2019s Moscow concert pavilion, Crocus City Hall.It would be natural for the Kremlin, aware of that relationship, to reach down to that level to try to get something done with the Trump campaign, analysts said.\u201cIf you are a business person, you are supposed to do something that the Kremlin asks you; you are otherwise free to pursue your own interests. That is how Russia works,\u201d said Mrs. Schulmann, noting that most would be eager to respond to any such call as an expression of loyalty.In this particular case, the Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying it was not in touch with Mr. Agalarov and did not even know the lawyer, Ms. Veselnitskaya. It is unclear precisely what was discussed at the meeting with members of the Trump team. Participants have said that it dealt largely with an American law called the Magnitsky Act, which blacklists those suspected of human rights abuses in Russia, and a ban on the adoption of Russian children, and that nothing of significance was given to the campaign.Mr. Agalarov, in a Russian radio interview, called the story around the meeting \u2014 that it was about information damaging to Hillary Clinton \u2014 a \u201cfabrication.\u201dThe Crocus Group did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Agalarov.For Mr. Agalarov, the involvement in the Trump administration\u2019s Russia scandal is at best an unwelcome diversion in a career of steady if not always spectacular success.He was born in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, then part of the Soviet Union, where he studied computer engineering and was a member of the Baku City Committee of the Communist Party.He went to Moscow to study, and even before the collapse of the Soviet Union began trying to fill pent-up Russian demand for Western goods, especially computers.What started as a modest trading company grew into a business organizing trade fairs that eventually mushroomed into the Crocus Group, a real estate empire that encompasses mammoth shopping malls, a chain of hypermarkets, an exposition center, restaurants, luxury housing developments and other enterprises.\u201cHe is not the biggest retail guy, but Crocus City Mall was the first luxury mall to appear in Moscow,\u201d said Darrell Stanaford, a 20-year veteran of the Russian real estate world as the former managing director in Moscow for the CBRE Group, a Los Angeles-based commercial real estate firm. \u201cHe likes the glitz. It is high-end luxury, so that is why he becomes such a good matchup for Trump.\u201dAside from the 2013 Miss Universe contest, it is not known what business ties, if any, the Agalarovs have with Mr. Trump, or with any other American companies. They clearly have an affinity for the United States, however, naming one chain of shopping malls \u201cVegas\u201d and another luxury residential complex \u201cManhattan.\u201dIn November 2013, after the buzz of the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow had subsided, Mr. Trump met privately with a group of elite Russian businessmen, including the head of Russia\u2019s state-owned Sberbank at one of the Nobu restaurants in Moscow.The elder Mr. Agalarov had been talking with Mr. Trump about building a Trump Tower in Moscow as part of a $3 billion real estate project involving hotels, a shopping center and office space.Sberbank was ready to make it happen. About a week after the meeting, the bank announced a \u201cstrategic cooperation agreement\u201d with the Crocus Group to finance about 70 percent of the ambitious project, including, potentially, a building bearing the Trump name.\u201cIt was one of the 14 buildings that we planned to build here,\u201d Mr. Agalarov\u2019s son Emin said in a March interview with Forbes, adding that if Mr. Trump \u201chadn\u2019t run for president, we would probably be in the construction phase today.\u201dThe Sberbank financing \u2014 reported at the time as the biggest real estate development loan the bank had made \u2014 was another measure of the Agalarovs\u2019 increasingly close connections to the centers of power in Russia.In another indication, the Crocus Group was written into a 2014 bilateral treaty with the government of Kyrgyzstan to help that country integrate into Russia\u2019s regional alliance, the Eurasian Economic Union.In that deal, worth $127 million, the Crocus Group was designated the \u201csingle supplier\u201d of services to integrate the two countries\u2019 bureaucracies and reinforce the new customs common border, by, for example, building new border posts.By naming the company in an international treaty, the Russian government avoided opening the work to competitive bidding, ensuring that the Crocus Group won the contract, Edil Baisalov, a former Kyrgyz presidential chief of staff, said in a telephone interview.In Kyrgyzstan, he said, the apparent giveaway to Kremlin-connected insiders became known as \u201cCrocusgate.\u201dMr. Agalarov mentions occasionally how difficult it is to earn money on public works, telling the newspaper Vedomosti in 2015 that he had to buy a larger Gulfstream jet to make the cross-continental trek to Vladivostok to check on progress at the Far Eastern Federal University. On that project, he said, he spent more than $100 million of his own money because the official plans skipped significant costs like roads and landscaping. He won some of it back in court.Statements about losing money are all part of the game, analysts said, noting that construction costs on Russian infrastructure routinely run 30 percent higher than for comparable projects in Europe.\u201cIt is showing the wounds that he got in the service of the motherland,\u201d said Ms. Schulmann, the political scientist. \u201cYou see how indifferent I am to profit when I do a service for the Kremlin. I have to make sacrifices.\u201dMr. Agalarov, however, was more candid than most when asked whether it is altruism that leads him to respond when the Kremlin calls. In the interview with Vedomosti, he said, \u201cThere are things that you cannot turn down.\u201dReporting was contributed by Andrew E.

{"Headline": "For the Top Fed Job, Slow and Steady Beats Wall Street Brash", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsOnly in Trumpland can Gary D. Cohn be considered a suitable Federal Reserve chairman.The registered New York Democrat did not have a government background when he became director of the National Economic Council. Still, he had honed his finance skills during more than 25 years at Goldman, and he quickly hired White House staff members with complementary experience. His operation contrasted with those of cabinet members like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who struggled to answer basic questions about school curriculums in her confirmation hearing.Choosing Mr. Cohn as head of the central bank would be an unconventional pick. Over the last 40 years, Fed chiefs have been economists and have also served at least two four-year terms. Ms. Yellen will have served only one if Mr. Trump does not renominate her. The last one-term, noneconomist Fed chairman was G. William Miller, who had been the chief executive of Textron before President Jimmy Carter tapped him. At a time of high inflation, his policies tanked the dollar and he lasted just over a year.Mr. Cohn spent much of his time at Goldman as a trader. He joined its J. Aron commodities unit and became the head of the divisions for fixed income, equities and global securities before he became the company\u2019s president. Goldman is known as the most alpha of the investment banks, and the hard-charging job fit Mr. Cohn\u2019s personality.Running the central bank is a more sedate affair. The staff consists of number crunchers with doctorates in economics who pore over various models to analyze growth and employment. News conferences after meetings by the interest-rate-setting committee are carefully scripted. Ms. Yellen, like her forebears, chooses her words carefully, knowing any hint of surprise can rattle markets.Her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, learned that in 2013, when he said the central bank would no longer be purchasing bonds, causing United States Treasury yields to surge in what became known as the \u201ctaper tantrum.\u201d Mr. Cohn, a blunt talker, may find such restrictions suffocating.

{"Headline": "One Woman\u2019s Slide From Middle Class to Medicaid", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyDEDHAM, Mass. \u2014 A dozen or so years into retirement, Rita Sherman had plenty going for her financially.Recently widowed, she had a net worth of roughly $600,000 as of 1998. Her health was excellent, and she dutifully purchased a long-term care insurance policy that would cover three years of nursing home costs should she ever need help. Watching over it all was her daughter, a medical social worker, and her son-in-law, a financial planner.By the time she died at the age of 94 last year, however, all of the money was gone after a diagnosis of dementia and five and a half years in a nursing home. Like so many people who never see it coming, she\u2019d gone from being financially comfortable to qualifying for Medicaid.Marcia Perna, Ms. Sherman\u2019s daughter, and her husband, Michael, were acutely aware of this fact from decades of work at their day jobs, but it was not something that they imagined they would personally encounter.Rita Sherman did worry about money, according to her daughter. Ms. Sherman\u2019s father had fallen ill when Rita was a child, and the family\u2019s fortunes had taken a negative turn. Ms. Sherman worked much of her adult life as a bookkeeper and also as a recreational aide for older people who were sick. Her husband, Stanley, had worked as an industrial psychologist and educator before becoming too ill from emphysema to work.Ms. Perna still remembers the stern warning her father gave her about his own care. \u201c\u2018You make sure I don\u2019t go to a nursing home!\u2019 he told me,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018If you think you\u2019re going to transport me, I\u2019m going to jump out of the car.\u2019\u201dHer mother, according to Ms. Perna, was the kind of health-obsessed person who even decades ago would exercise regularly and go sparingly on the cheese. Still, Ms. Sherman had watched her own mother end up in a nursing home and wanted to plan for that possibility in a way that might preserve some of her money for Ms. Perna, her only child. So after her husband\u2019s death, another relative helped Ms. Sherman buy that long-term care insurance policy.According to Ms. Perna, her mother\u2019s mother succumbed to her illness mere months after moving into a nursing home, and everyone assumed that Ms. Sherman would go just as quickly, too, if it ever came to that. But just in case, the family put some of her assets in a trust, so that in the unlikely event that she lived in a nursing home longer than the three years that her insurance policy would cover, any bills would not entirely wipe out her savings.Things did not work out that way, though. Ms. Sherman started having trouble with daily tasks, was found to have dementia and moved into an assisted-living facility and then a nursing home with specialized staff members for memory care patients. Along the way, the insurance company declared her not sufficiently ill to warrant paying out on the policy. Then the trust, which is common and legal, did not hold up to state scrutiny because of a problematic passage.These twists and turns reveal two terrifying facts about aging and how we pay for it. While it\u2019s hard to imagine a couple better suited to help an aging parent navigate her final years than a social worker-financial planner duo, the Pernas still ended up hiring five additional professionals to help them with complex, specialized tasks: a long-term care insurance salesman, a nurse consultant to help get the insurance company\u2019s decision reversed, an elder care lawyer to set up the trust, another consultant to help with the Medicaid application, and a malpractice lawyer to sue the attorney who created the defective trust. (The family eventually received a settlement. And to the many readers who have asked about the ethics and economics of Medicaid planning and trusts, please watch this space in the coming weeks.)So add aging to the maddeningly long list of enormously complex financial tasks that each of us faces. And pity those in their 70s or 80s who must navigate this morass without expert adult children or other advocates.Second, for people like Rita Sherman who lead healthy lives for three-quarters of a century, it is often their brains that give out first, not their bodies. And when that happens, the decline can be both lengthy and expensive, given how much supervision dementia patients need.Just over three years into Ms. Sherman\u2019s nursing home stay, her money was gone and the long-term care insurance had been used up. She eventually did qualify for Medicaid, which paid for much of her final two years of care. By then, her daughter was calling the shots, since Ms. Sherman was no longer able to speak. \u201cBy the time my mother died, I had long since said goodbye to her,\u201d Ms. Perna said.Sitting in their garden here this week, still a bit shocked by all that happened before Ms. Sherman\u2019s death last year, the Pernas tried to make sense of their story and its morals. First, there are their own circumstances. Michael, 67, has diabetes and assumes that qualifying for long-term care insurance is impossible for him at any price. He plans to keep working, in part because he loves it, though the ability to self-insure with more savings for his own possible future care doesn\u2019t hurt. Marcia, 66 and less than two years into retirement, may price out a policy for herself soon.As for the rest of us, Ms. Perna has a few words of advice. To the people who believe that adult children should simply take in their aging parents and care for them at home, she paints a harrowing picture of dementia. The incontinence may come first, often many years before someone dies. Then there are the middle-of-the-night wakings and the insistence that there is someplace urgent to go. Wandering is frequent, and violence is not unusual. Her mother, physically contracted in her final days, required two nursing home staff members to lift her into her wheelchair and frequent, manual bed-turning to prevent too much skin damage.Mr. Perna had to prod her into discussing how many hours she had put into the coordination, the logistics and all the rest. Adult children who handle even this suffer their own lost productivity, which may make it harder for them to retire comfortably.And to those who think Medicaid recipients simply should have worked harder, more and longer, Ms. Perna makes no apology for her taxpaying mother, who lived in her starter home until her husband died and stopped working only to take care of him when he was sick.\u201cI think that it\u2019s human nature to think that if someone is in a bad circumstance, that there was something they were doing to cause it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that is not how life works. Things happen to people, and people don\u2019t really understand how easily those things can happen.\u201dEmail: lieber@nytimes.comvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Keith Conners, Psychologist Who Set Standard for Diagnosing A.D.H.D., Dies at 84", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeith Conners, whose work with hyperactive children established the first standards for diagnosing and treating what is now known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D. \u2014 and who late in life expressed misgivings about how loosely applied that label had become \u2014 died on July 5 in Durham, N.C. He was 84.His wife, Carolyn, said the cause was heart failure.The field of child psychiatry was itself still young when Dr. Conners joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the early 1960s as a clinical psychologist. Children with emotional and behavioral problems often got a variety of diagnoses, depending on the clinic, and often ended up being given strong tranquilizers as treatment. Working with Dr. Leon Eisenberg, a prominent child psychiatrist, Dr. Conners focused on a group of youngsters who were chronically restless, hyperactive and sometimes aggressive.Doctors had recognized this type \u2014 \u201chyperkinesis,\u201d it was called, or \u201cminimal brain dysfunction\u201d \u2014 but Dr. Conners combined existing descriptions and, using statistical analysis, focused on the core symptoms.The 39-item questionnaire he devised, called the Conners Rating Scale, quickly became the worldwide standard for assessing the severity of such problems and measuring improvement. It was later abbreviated to 10 items, giving child psychiatry a scientific foothold and anticipating by more than a decade the kind of checklists that would come to define all psychiatric diagnosis.He used his scale to study the effects of stimulant drugs on hyperactive children. Doctors had known since the 1930s that amphetamines could, paradoxically, calm such youngsters; a Rhode Island doctor, Charles Bradley, had published a well-known report detailing striking improvements in attention and academic performance among many children at a children\u2019s inpatient home he ran near Providence. But it was a series of rigorous studies by Dr. Conners, in the 1960s and \u201970s, that established stimulants \u2014 namely Dexedrine and Ritalin \u2014 as the standard treatments.In recent years, rates of A.D.H.D. diagnosis have soared and drugs like Adderall and Concerta have become so widely prescribed that many patient advocates and doctors see an epidemic of overmedication. The drugs have also become a staple on college and high school campuses as de facto study aids for any striving student, diagnosis or not.But when Dr. Conners began publishing his trials, the diagnosis was handed out far less commonly, and the treatments often made children worse.\u201cWe take the drugs for granted today, and they\u2019ve become controversial, but at the time these kids were being given much stronger medications \u2014 tranquilizers \u2014 that had all sorts of side effects,\u201d James Swanson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Irvine, said in an interview. \u201cKeith was a leader in switching the field from drugs that knocked kids out to those that enhance behavior and performance.\u201dThrough the 1990s, Dr. Conners was a force in A.D.H.D. research. He played a leading role in a long-term government-financed trial \u2014 it began recruiting patients in 1994, published its first main finding in 1999 and ran through 2014 \u2014 that compared drug treatment with behavioral therapy, a system of incremental rewards that teaches self-control and has also proved effective.After a year, the study found that drug treatment was most effective, and sales of stimulant medications spiked. But two years into the study, the gains on medication had vanished \u2014 and, in what was considered a concession, Dr. Conners wrote in 2001 that combined behavior-drug treatment was probably the best approach.Carmen Keith Conners was born on March 20, 1933, in Bingham, Utah, one of three children of Michael and Merle Conners. His father was a machinist, and his mother ran the household and worked at a department store.The family moved frequently, as Michael Conners chased work, and eventually settled in Salt Lake City (Bingham was later razed to accommodate a copper mine). Keith entered high school there and soon proved himself an exceptional student. On a teacher\u2019s recommendation, he applied for \u2014 and won \u2014 early entry to the University of Chicago. He left for college at 15 and never got a high school diploma.After graduating from Chicago in 1953, he became a Rhodes scholar, earning a master\u2019s degree from Oxford, Queens College, in 1955 in philosophy, psychology and physiology. In 1960, he completed a doctorate in clinical psychology at Harvard.Dr. Conners\u2019s long career took him from Johns Hopkins to Harvard Medical School to the University of Pittsburgh, George Washington University and, finally, the Duke University School of Medicine, where he founded the Duke A.D.H.D. Clinic.Dr. Conners, who lived in Durham, was married three times. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a twin sister, Carol Wagner; six children from his first two marriages, Anthony Conners, Rachel Carr, Sarah Homolka, Rebecca Conners, Michael Conners and Katie Conners; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.After a half-century of publishing treatment studies and maintaining a clinical practice, Dr. Conners came to see the ascendance of A.D.H.D. as a mixed blessing. The explosion of the diagnosis and the reckless prescribing of stimulant drugs were hardly on his account alone: In 1991, the United States Education Department made students with A.D.H.D. officially eligible for special education, which accelerated rates of diagnosis, and drugmakers have aggressively marketed their products to parents, doctors and adults who think they have attention deficits.But in a 2013 interview with The New York Times, Dr. Conners, then a professor emeritus at Duke, expressed dismay that some 15 percent of high schoolers reported having been given an A.D.H.D. diagnosis.\u201cThe numbers make it look like an epidemic. Well, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s preposterous,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a concoction to justify the giving out of the medication at unprecedented and unjustified levels.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Vision for America Abroad", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsPresident Trump just concluded a second overseas trip to further advance America\u2019s interests and values, and to strengthen our alliances around the world. Both this and his first trip demonstrated the resurgence of American leadership to bolster common interests, affirm shared values, confront mutual threats and achieve renewed prosperity.Discussions with world leaders highlighted extraordinary potential: vast supplies of affordable energy, untapped markets that can be opened to new commerce, a growing number of young people seeking the chance to build better futures in their homelands and new partnerships among nations that can form the basis for lasting peace. At every opportunity abroad, President Trump articulated his vision for securing the American homeland, enhancing American prosperity and advancing American influence.Meetings in Poland and at the Group of 20 summit conference in Germany focused on building coalitions to get the best possible outcomes for America and for our allies. The United States cannot be a passive member of international organizations. We are working with friends to confront common threats, seize mutually beneficial opportunities and press for solutions to shared problems.In Warsaw, President Trump spoke to the Polish people and reiterated our commitment to mutual support and defense of Poland and our NATO allies against common threats. He affirmed that a \u201cstrong Poland is a blessing to Europe\u201d and that \u201ca strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.\u201dHe also met with 12 leaders of the Three Seas nations and pledged America\u2019s commitment to expanding access to affordable and reliable energy in the Baltic States, Central Europe and the Balkans. Helping countries diversify their energy sources strengthens economies, creates jobs and prevents adversaries from using energy to intimidate or coerce. During a dinner President Trump hosted with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Hamburg, the leaders agreed on a common strategy to confront the threat of North Korea and ensure the security of Northeast Asia and the United States.The G-20 leaders agreed that a strong economy and a healthy planet are mutually reinforcing. America will continue to lead by example in demonstrating that market forces and technology-driven solutions are the most effective means of protecting the environment while fueling economic growth.On migration, the leaders reaffirmed the \u201csovereign right of states to manage and control their borders.\u201d They discussed the need to \u201caddress the root causes of displacement\u201d and create better opportunities for people to remain in their home countries and rebuild their communities.Perhaps most important, President Trump affirmed on this trip that America First is grounded in American values \u2014 values that not only strengthen America but also drive progress throughout the world. America champions the dignity of every person, affirms the equality of women, celebrates innovation, protects freedom of speech and of religion, and supports free and fair markets.For example, to help empower women across the globe, the United States joined with the World Bank in an initiative to provide more than $1 billion to advance entrepreneurship. This effort will help women in developing countries gain increased access to the capital, markets and networks needed to start and grow businesses in the modern economy. And the United States remains the world\u2019s single largest source of humanitarian assistance. At the G-20, we committed an additional $639 million to help save the lives of the millions of people threatened by famine \u2014 and called on other nations to join us in doing more to address this humanitarian catastrophe.America First is rooted in confidence that our values are worth defending and promoting. This is a time of great challenge for our friends and allies around the globe \u2014 but it is also a moment of extraordinary opportunity. The American delegation returned from the trip with tremendous optimism about the future and what the United States, our allies and our partners can achieve together.Gary D.

{"Headline": "At Private Dinners, Pence Quietly Courts Big Donors and Corporate Executives", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence has been courting scores of the country\u2019s most influential donors, corporate executives and conservative political leaders over the past several months in a series of private gatherings and one-on-one conversations.The centerpiece of the effort is a string of dinners held every few weeks at the vice president\u2019s official residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory in Washington. Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, have presided over at least four such soir\u00e9es, and more are in the works. Each has drawn roughly 30 to 40 guests, including a mix of wealthy donors such as the Chicago hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin and the brokerage firm founder Charles Schwab, as well as Republican fund-raisers and executives from companies like Dow Chemical and the military contractor United Technologies.The guests and their families collectively donated or helped raise millions of dollars to support the Trump-Pence ticket in 2016, and some are viewed in Republican finance circles as likely supporters for two new groups created to promote President Trump, Mr. Pence, their legislative agenda and congressional allies. The dinner guest lists were curated in part by two of Mr. Pence\u2019s closest advisers, who have also played important roles in starting the new political groups, America First Policies and America First Action. Mr. Pence has appeared at recent events outside his official residence with prospective donors to the groups.Mr. Pence\u2019s aides point out that he also has dinners at the residence for groups other than donors, including members of Congress, world leaders, military families, civic leaders and friends. They cast the donor dinners as an effort to build support for the administration\u2019s agenda, not for Mr. Pence personally.\u201cMike Pence is the ultimate team player and works every day to help the president succeed,\u201d said Robert T. Grand, an Indianapolis lawyer who helped raise money for Mr. Pence\u2019s campaigns in Indiana for Congress and for governor. Mr. Grand attended a dinner at the vice president\u2019s residence in June. \u201cThere were a lot of folks who, if you were vice president, you would want to meet,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Grand said. \u201cCorporate executives, other government leaders, people from past administrations, not just donors.\u201dHe added that \u201cany administration, past and present, has an interest in getting to know folks. If you\u2019re an incumbent president and vice president, then that\u2019s part of what you do.\u201dMr. Pence\u2019s office declined to release the lists of guests invited to the dinners, which have not appeared on schedules released by the vice president\u2019s office to the news media. Marc Lotter, Mr. Pence\u2019s press secretary, called the dinners \u201cprivate\u201d and said that the vice president had not held any political fund-raisers at his residence, which would be complicated by a law barring the solicitation of political contributions in government buildings.Mr. Pence typically kicks off his dinners with a cocktail hour at which he recounts the history of the taxpayer-funded residence, followed by a brief assessment of his administration\u2019s legislative and foreign policy agendas and a question-and-answer session, according to guests. After people are seated for dinner at four or five separate tables, they said, Mr. Pence makes his way around the room, chatting for a few minutes with each guest.Mr. Pence\u2019s willingness to use his residence to host wealthy donors has been reassuring to Republican finance and political operatives, who worry that their congressional candidates could be severely hampered if they faced financial shortfalls during 2018 midterm elections, when Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity is expected to create strong headwinds.The dinners are \u201ca smart way for Vice President Pence and his team to recognize major supporters of his and the president\u2019s agenda, and build resources that are going to be necessary for the upcoming battles,\u201d said Charles Spies, a leading Republican election lawyer.Associates say Mr. Pence has discussed with the president the importance of encouraging major donors to support America First Policies. Mr. Pence signaled his own support for the group by appearing with his wife at a reception in Washington this spring for prospective donors to America First Policies that was hosted by a fund-raising consultant, Jeff Miller.The group was founded soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration by political operatives outside the administration, including two close advisers to Mr. Pence \u2014 Nick Ayers and Marty Obst \u2014 who helped arrange the Naval Observatory dinners and attended some of them.In May, Mr. Obst and Mr. Ayers founded Great America Committee, a political action committee to fund Mr. Pence\u2019s political operation \u2014 an unusual step for a sitting vice president. Typically, vice presidents rely on their respective party committees for such functions. This past Thursday Great America Committee held a reception for prospective donors at the Washington offices of the powerful lobbying firm BGR.America First Policies, a nonprofit required to spend the majority of its money on costs unrelated to partisan political campaigns, has in the meantime spun off a super PAC called America First Action that will have more legal flexibility to directly advocate for the election of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies and the defeat of his opponents. As a super PAC, America First Action is required to publicly disclose its donors but America First Policies is not.Katie Walsh, a senior adviser to America First Policies who has attended some of Mr. Pence\u2019s dinners, said the group did not use the gatherings to prospect for donations.Although Ms. Walsh said that some attendees \u201chappen to support\u201d groups backing the administration, \u201ca lot of those folks have never given to anything related to Trump or Pence, and are leaders of businesses and industries that have worked, and continue to work, with the administration to get things done.\u201dSome dinner guests \u2014 including Andrew N. Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, and Gregory J. Hayes, the chairman and chief executive of United Technologies \u2014 have donated either primarily to Democrats or to a mix of Democrats and Republicans.Other guests \u2014 including the hedge fund manager Mr. Griffin and the investors Ronald Weiser of Michigan; Lewis Eisenberg of Florida and Doug Deason, Ray Washburne and Tom Hicks Jr., all of Texas \u2014 were significant donors or fund-raisers for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the committees supporting it. Mr. Trump has since nominated Mr. Washburne to head the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

Not incidentally, Mr. Brown is relying on money raised from the program to help finance another of his last-term priorities, construction of a high-speed train between San Francisco and Los Angeles.Democrats hold a two-thirds majority in both the Assembly and the Senate. But in pushing the bill through, Mr. Brown had to navigate moderate Democrats, who were nervous voting for a measure that could raise the cost of gasoline, as well as objections from Republicans, who have often opposed such measures as costly for consumers and businesses.In addition, one Democratic member of the Assembly was absent this week, putting pressure on Democrats to recruit some Republican support.While the business community was supportive of the bill, environmentalists \u2014 a critical constituency in the state \u2014 were split: Some opposed it, arguing that the bill was not tough enough on industry.The cap-and-trade bill extends a program that otherwise would have ended in 2020. Kevin de Leon, the Democratic president of the Senate, and one of the leaders of the effort to extend the law, expressed satisfaction at the vote.\u201cCalifornians overwhelmingly support our efforts to tackle climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s an urgent threat and they want us to continue to lead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Officer Accused of Excessive Force in Arrest of James Blake Spurns Plea Deal", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe officer, James Frascatore, rejected the agreement at a hearing at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan on Thursday.Officer Frascatore\u2019s decision means that after nearly two years of delays, he now faces a two-day trial in September, according to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct and abuse. In the most serious cases the agency handles, those in which it recommends disciplinary charges against officers, it acts as the prosecution in proceedings before an administrative judge at Police Headquarters.\u201cThe C.C.R.B. will present evidence at trial on Sept. 19 and is confident it will meet its burden,\u201d Jonathan Darche, the review board\u2019s executive director, said in a statement.The deal Officer Frascatore spurned would have allowed him to keep his job if he pleaded no contest and agreed to forfeit a few vacation days, according to his union lawyer, Stephen C. Worth.Mr. Worth said in an interview after the hearing on Thursday that his client was rejecting the agreement because he had not received a signed form from the New York City Law Department indicating that Mr. Blake would surrender his right to sue Officer Frascatore.\u201cIt fell apart because of this,\u201d Mr. Worth said. \u201cThis is a sticking point. My client doesn\u2019t feel he has all the protection he should have, and he\u2019s not prepared to go forward without all the protection he can get.\u201dMr. Blake\u2019s lawyer, Kevin H. Marino, said the release had nothing to do with the officer\u2019s trial.\u201cThe suggestion that Mr. Frascatore has turned that down because of something Mr. Blake did or did not do just does not have any basis in fact,\u201d Mr. Marino said.Of his client, he added: \u201cMr. Blake is pleased that the case was not resolved by plea agreement because he, too, relishes the opportunity to testify at a hearing against Mr. Frascatore.\u201dThree British men were eventually arrested and pleaded guilty to using stolen credit cards to buy more than $18,000 in luxury goods and having them shipped to the hotel, but neither Mr. Blake nor the man he was mistaken for, Sean Satha, had anything to do with the crime.The goal of establishing the fellowship is to help the review board complete more of its investigations. Last year, more than half of the agency\u2019s inquiries could not be completed because complainants or witnesses stopped cooperating, the agency could not reach them or because a complaint was withdrawn.If police officers\u2019 cases are not resolved before trial, those who are found guilty can face punishments ranging from having a letter placed in their files to being fired.In cases closed by the review board last year, officers were equally likely to be found guilty, not guilty or take a plea agreement. The agency\u2019s Administrative Prosecution Unit closed 258 cases in 2016; 67 yielded a guilty verdict, and 69 a not-guilty verdict. Officers accepted plea agreements in 67 cases.The most common punishments was a loss of vacation time: 103 cases ended with officers being suspended for up to 10 days or losing an equal amount of vacation time. Twenty officers lost more time, while 34 were ordered to undergo training or were given a warning or letter of instruction. None were fired.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Re-Election Campaign Doubles Its Spending on Legal Fees", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign more than doubled its spending on legal fees over the past few months as its lawyers assisted the campaign in its handling of investigations into interactions between the president\u2019s associates and Russia.Mr. Futerfas\u2019s firm had not previously been paid by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Neither he nor Donald Jr. responded on Saturday to questions about the payment.The majority of the legal payments reflected in the second-quarter reports \u2014 $545,000 \u2014 went to the law firm Jones Day. It has represented the campaign in election law matters and ongoing lawsuits, and is also advising it on legal issues related to the Russia investigations.The campaign has been sending letters to former employees instructing them to retain documents that could be relevant to the ongoing investigations, according to several people who received them. Some of the letters, signed by the campaign\u2019s executive director, Michael Glassner, alert the former employees that lawyers from Jones Day might contact them.Representatives from Jones Day, the Trump campaign and the White House did not respond to questions about the firm\u2019s role in helping the campaign navigate the Russia investigations, which have expanded to include several former campaign officials, as well as the campaign\u2019s digital operation.Federal election law permits campaign committees to pay legal fees incurred as a result of activity related to the campaign.The Trump campaign also paid nearly $90,000 to the Trump corporation for legal consulting and $120,000 in rent for the campaign\u2019s offices at Trump Tower in Manhattan.In addition to the re-election campaign, two joint fund-raising vehicles established with Republican Party committees also filed reports to the commission. The committees ramped up their big-donor fund-raising during the second quarter of the year, raising $13.2 million \u2014 much of which came from big donors \u2014 according to the reports.The reports make it clear that although Election Day 2020 is nearly three and a half years away, Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign operation is already in high gear, and that it is working to engage the Republican Party\u2019s deepest pockets in a way that his unconventional 2016 campaign did not.About 43 percent of the second-quarter total came from donors who gave $10,000 or more to the committees, according to the reports. And that probably does not reflect most of the checks collected in connection with a fund-raiser at the end of last month at Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, which raised an estimated $10 million from 300 guests who each donated at least $35,000.The commission reports show that donors who contributed $200 or less accounted for less than 38 percent of all funds raised in the second quarter. That is a reversal from Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, when small donors accounted for a majority of the outside donations raised by his committees, not including the $66 million he donated to his campaign.In some ways, the shift to high-dollar fund-raising represents a move toward a more traditional political operation than the one that helped power Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory. In 2016, his campaign relied more on donations from Mr. Trump\u2019s own pocket (he has not donated to his re-election campaign) and on the power of mega-rallies and his social media presence than on traditional \u2014 and costly \u2014 political infrastructure like field offices and television advertising.It is unusual, however, for a sitting president\u2019s team to be raising money and building a re-election effort in the first half of a first term, when political and fund-raising efforts are typically channeled through the president\u2019s national party committee.The reports show that Mr. Trump\u2019s committees spent $229,000 on salaries and political and communications consulting. The committees spent $2.1 million on digital consulting, all of which went to firms associated with the San Antonio-based consultant Brad Parscale, who served as digital director of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and who is now advising a nonprofit group seeking to raise huge sums of cash to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.Mr. Parscale\u2019s firms were by far the highest-paid vendors on the Trump committee\u2019s payrolls. And those payments seem to indicate that Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election operation will again rely heavily on social media and other digital targeting of voters, which is credited with helping to harness grass-roots support for his candidacy. To that end, the reports also show that the committees spent nearly $500,000 on data management services in the second quarter.The reports filed Saturday also show that the committees spent nearly $200,000 on Trump-branded merchandise, including more than $80,000 toward hats. In 2016, hats featuring the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d became symbols for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Advertisement"}

More chillingly, it asserted that because Mr. Nixon was a candidate for re-election, his stand on the Vietnam War was a campaign issue.

{"Headline": "Dr. Raj Panjabi Goes the Last Mile in Liberia", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Conversation WithDr. Raj Panjabi, 36, is a co-founder and the chief executive of Last Mile Health, a charity that brings medical care to some of the most remote corners of Liberia.We spoke for three hours at his offices in Boston. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.Q. Why do you call the organization Last Mile Health?A. Because there are a billion people around the world who live in communities so distant from health care services that they might die of diseases that no one needs to die from.These people live in small isolated settlements where no doctor or nurse visits. They exist beyond \u201cthe last mile\u201d of the organized health care system. In Liberia, I\u2019ve been to districts where people walked for two days to get to a clinic.To solve this, we\u2019re partnering with the Liberian government to create a model where lay people from these rural villages are hired to serve as community health workers. We train them in about 30 lifesaving practices.We then give them backpacks with medical supplies and smartphones connected to nurses based at clinics. The professionals on the phone supervise and coach.An obvious question: Why is this important to do?The first reason is moral: Why should anyone die from diseases that others don\u2019t?The disease spread quickly and was not detected because the early victims were so out of the range of the health care system. Within three months, it had jumped borders and moved into cities. We lost 11,000 of our people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.You say \u201cwe\u201d \u2014 are you African?I was born in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. I\u2019m not a citizen. My parents are from India. When I was 9, the civil war broke out. Charles Taylor\u2019s rebel army marched on Monrovia. Some foreign embassies organized evacuation flights. My mother told me to pack one bag.At the airport, foreign nationals were separated from Liberians and allowed to board outgoing flights. Liberians were not. My family and I were stuffed into the cargo section of this old military airplane. The hatch was left open, and I could see other Liberians, including soldiers, trying to escape.Leaving those people on the tarmac was something I never forgot.Where did your family go?First to Sierra Leone. Ultimately, we ended up in High Point, N.C., where a family took us in. My sister and I grew up like ordinary American teenagers. I went to the University of North Carolina. The plan was for me to go to medical school and practice in High Point.Then came Sept. 11. It brought back memories of Liberia and got me thinking about the roots of extremism. I also read Paul Farmer\u2019s book, \u201cPathologies of Power,\u201d which made me realize that medicine could be a way to bridge inequality, one cause of extremism.Soon I was rethinking my future. I wanted to go back to West Africa and to find a way to serve those I\u2019d left behind.How did you make that happen?I began by researching programs that had brought health care to the rural poor. While in medical school, I went to Alaska, where the Community Health Aide Program had brought access to the most remote areas. They had done it by training local people to become providers.Then in 2005, I took my fianc\u00e9e, Amisha Raja \u2014 later my wife \u2014 to see where I\u2019d grown up. In the wake of the civil war, there were 51 doctors in the entire country. We volunteered to work at a rural clinic.The first patient I saw, a newborn, died of pneumonia in my arms. I\u2019d never seen anything like that before. The mother had lived too far from the clinic to get prenatal care.When we returned to the United States, I wrote a proposal to start a clinic modeled on what I\u2019d observed in Alaska. Amisha and I raised the funds for Last Mile Health at our wedding. Instead of a gift registry, we asked people to donate cash.We got $6,000, enough to hire and train 30 community health workers. As of today, we have over 500 working directly for us.Was there any resistance to your doing this?Not from the government. The minister of health was positive. Liberia was now headed by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa\u2019s first elected woman president, and she was open to new ideas. With other partners, Last Mile Health is now supporting the government by helping to train 2,000 of its own health workers.However, the general rhetoric among local professionals was that it was not possible to provide health care in the rural areas \u2014 so why try? What these critics didn\u2019t recognize was how new technologies had changed things.Smartphones can connect lay workers to supervising nurses at clinics who can coach them on what they\u2019re seeing. There are apps now that help diagnose disease \u2014 at least in uncomplicated cases.For instance, a village child shows shortness of breath. There\u2019s a smart watch that helps count the number of times he breathes. If it\u2019s over 50 per minute, it might mean pneumonia. The community health worker has antibiotics in her backpack.A life that might have been lost is possibly saved.What else is in that Last Mile backpack?A digital thermometer to check for fever, blood pressure cuffs to screen pregnant women, zinc for dehydration, testing kits for malaria.Now, that\u2019s something new. We have a test kit that costs a dollar and that you can take anywhere and use without electricity. Within 15 minutes, it can tell you if the patient has malaria. Before this, it could only be done by a trained person at a hospital.Do you think of yourself as Liberian?Well, that place gave me so much: a sense of purpose and meaning. But I am an American citizen.In North Carolina, people are dying of things they don\u2019t need to die from.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Nominates Randal K. Quarles to Oversee Wall Street Banks", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday named Randal K. Quarles, a former Treasury Department official, to serve as the Federal Reserve\u2019s top watchdog overseeing Wall Street and to play a leading role in the administration\u2019s plans to reduce financial regulation.Mr. Quarles would be the first person to serve in the role of vice chairman for supervision, which Congress created after the financial crisis to sharpen the Fed\u2019s focus on regulatory issues. As a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, he would also have a vote on monetary policy.The position requires Senate confirmation, but Republicans, who hold a majority, can confirm Mr. Quarles without support from Democrats, should that be necessary.Mr. Quarles, 59, would be a counterweight to the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who has led the Fed\u2019s postcrisis stimulus campaign and its efforts to strengthen financial regulation.Mr. Quarles has criticized some of those policies, including the focus on constraining the largest banks. He is regarded as more sympathetic than Ms. Yellen to the industry\u2019s view that regulation is restricting lending and impeding economic growth.Mr. Quarles has also publicly criticized the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy, and will probably push for the central bank to end those efforts more quickly.He has endorsed a Republican proposal to constrain monetary policy by requiring the Fed to publicly describe a mathematical formula for determining the level of interest rates.His wife\u2019s great-uncle is Marriner S. Eccles, the Fed\u2019s chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the Fed\u2019s marble headquarters on the National Mall in Washington.Mr. Trump must also decide whether to nominate Ms. Yellen for a second term as chairwoman.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Ally Didn\u2019t Register as Lobbyist Despite Big Push for a Donor", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrustrated by the pace of negotiations with a city agency over millions of dollars that were in dispute, a restaurateur decided to bring in a hired gun: Neal Kwatra, a political consultant and lobbyist with ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio.Mr. Kwatra ended up working so closely with top City Hall officials on behalf of the restaurant owner, Harendra Singh, that a city commissioner complained that officials were giving Mr. Kwatra confidential information during delicate negotiations to settle a lawsuit with Mr. Singh.When one meeting with city officials resulted in an unsatisfactory offer, Mr. Kwatra angrily responded, \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t get the memo from City Hall,\u201d according to the city official in charge of the talks, Ricardo Morales, a former deputy commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, known as DCAS.Yet none of Mr. Kwatra\u2019s efforts on behalf of Mr. Singh, in 2015, were registered as lobbying work, even though Mr. Kwatra and his company, Metropolitan Public Strategies, have registered as lobbyists for other clients, including United for Affordable NYC, a short-lived nonprofit group created by Mr. de Blasio to support his housing policies.A search of the public record websites of the state\u2019s Joint Commission on Public Ethics and the New York City Clerk\u2019s Lobbying Bureau found no record that Mr. Kwatra or his company had registered as a lobbyist for Mr. Singh or his restaurant, Water\u2019s Edge, in Queens, or any of Mr. Singh\u2019s companies.On Monday, Mr. de Blasio, appearing on \u201cRoad to City Hall\u201d on NY1, dismissed the notion that Mr. Singh received special treatment because he was a campaign donor.\u201cIt\u2019s been looked at, and there\u2019s just nothing there,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\u201cI think it\u2019s very clear how we run our government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open and transparent government, where we help people bring forward legitimate issues and try to see them through to conclusion.\u201dMr. Kwatra, whose mother, Pam Kwatra, is a donor and fund-raiser for the mayor, played a key role in Mr. Singh\u2019s case, but his involvement was not revealed publicly until The New York Times reported it on Monday.Austin Shafran, a senior vice president of Metropolitan Public Strategies, said on Monday that Mr. Kwatra\u2019s efforts on behalf of Mr. Singh did not meet the definition of lobbying under state and city law.\u201dOur firm consulted experienced legal counsel, and was advised that we were not required to register as a lobbyist in this case because our work involved the renegotiation of an existing lease that was the subject of litigation, which is explicitly excluded from the lobbying law,\u201d Mr. Shafran said by email. He would not identify the lawyer who advised his company, and said that Mr. Kwatra was unavailable to speak with a reporter.A group of city documents and emails reviewed by The Times that describe the talks do not mention renegotiation of the lease. They focus instead on unpaid rent, money that the city said was owed by Mr. Singh to rebuild a pier near the restaurant, and lawsuits deriving from those disputes.Officials at the administrative services agency had told Mr. Singh they could not discuss a new lease while he owed back rent and millions of dollars for the pier reconstruction. They made clear that even though Mr. Singh was already operating the restaurant, a new lease would require public hearings under city land use laws and would need to be offered for competitive bidding. Efforts to influence procurement decisions, including decisions regarding new leases on city properties, are frequently considered to meet the definition of lobbying.That did not stop Mr. Kwatra and Mr. Singh from continuing to push the issue of a new lease. Their efforts included discussions with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top political aide, Emma Wolfe, the director of intergovernmental affairs, who began participating in the negotiations in mid-2015.A new long-term lease would have been very valuable, in part because the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation was considering ways to use other city-owned parcels near the restaurant for a development project that could have included housing, office and retail space \u2014 potentially increasing the value and earning power of Water\u2019s Edge.Mr. Kwatra and Ms. Wolfe\u2019s office worked so closely that Stacey Cumberbatch, the administrative services commissioner, accused a City Hall official of disclosing confidential information during talks to settle the lawsuits and discussions about Mr. Singh\u2019s interest in negotiating a new lease.The emails show that city officials had discussed the possibility of moving talks for a new lease out of the administrative services agency to the Economic Development Corporation, known as EDC. That could have benefited Mr. Singh by freeing him from negotiating with staff members at the administrative services agency, which had shown itself to be a tough negotiating partner. In addition, Mr. de Blasio had recently appointed Ms. Kwatra to the corporation\u2019s board.The emails show that this possibility was being discussed internally among city officials (who ultimately rejected it) and was not intended to be shared with Mr. Singh and his representatives. But Gabriel Schnake-Mahl, an aide to Ms. Wolfe who was working closely with Mr. Kwatra, did just that.\u201cI am speaking with Kwatra today at 5:30 p.m. for an update on their end,\u201d Mr. Schnake-Mahl wrote in an email to Ms. Cumberbatch and Ms. Wolfe on Sept. 3, 2015. \u201cAnything I can share re: why needs to stay in DCAS for future lease?

{"Headline": "Soviet Veteran Who Met With Trump Jr. Is a Master of the Dark Arts", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile not, he insisted, an expert in the technical aspects of hacking nor, a spy, Mr. Akhmetshin talked openly about how he had worked with a counterintelligence unit while serving with the Red Army after its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and how easy it was to find tech-savvy professionals ready and able to plunder just about any email account.A journalist who visited his home was given a thumb drive containing emails that had apparently been stolen by hackers working for one of his clients.On another occasion, at a meeting with a New York Times reporter at the Ararat Park Hyatt hotel in Moscow, Mr. Akhmetshin, by then an American citizen, informed the journalist he had recently been reading one of his emails: a note sent by the reporter to a Russian-American defense lawyer who had once worked for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the anti-Kremlin oligarch.In that instance, the reporter\u2019s email had become public as part of a lawsuit. But the episode suggests Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s professional focus in the decades since he immigrated to the United States \u2014 and the experience that he brought to a meeting last June in New York with President Trump\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the then-head of the Trump presidential campaign, Paul J. Manafort.Mr. Akhmetshin often warned his friends and contacts: \u201cNothing is secure.\u201d It was a conviction that emerged from the chaotic and often violent corporate battles that convulsed Russia in the 1990s, when \u201cchyorny P.R.\u201d or \u201cblack public relations\u201d based on stolen or fabricated documents became a powerful weapon for businessmen seeking to damage their rivals without resorting to physical threats, another frequently used tool.Instead of simply examining old media reports, court records and other public documents to try to dig up dirt or embarrassing gossip, Russian-style \u201cchyorny P.R.\u201d has often focused on pilfering private information through hacking and physical intrusion into offices and filing cabinets.In his own investigations over the years, Mr. Akhmetshin has acquired a reputation for obtaining email records, information from spyware and other data that appeared to be drawn from Russian hackers.He has denied that, insisting that he conducted research for his clients and relayed accurate information to the press. A 2011 case illustrates his style.In a defamation lawsuit later brought by Mr. Egiazaryan in a New York federal court, Mr. Akhmetshin testified that Mr. Vavilov invited him to his home in Moscow to discuss how to derail his enemy\u2019s asylum application. \u201cHe had some cash around the house,\u201d Mr. Akhmetshin testified. \u201cI remember there was money in like $100 bills bags.\u201dHe said Mr. Vavilov, who had been dogged for years in Russia by accusations of corruption, handed him a total of $70,000 to $80,000 in cash. That was the start of a concerted campaign to portray Mr. Egiazaryan as an anti-Semite in the news media and to Jewish organizations that then opposed his asylum application. \u201cI met with people in Russia. I met with people in Washington D.C.,\u201d Mr. Akhmetshin testified. Mr. Egiazaryan remains in the United States, but his lawyer would not comment on his asylum status.There is no evidence that Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s efforts on behalf of any of his clients, whether they had close or hostile relations with the Kremlin, were illegal. Nor is there evidence that he personally engaged in the technical aspects of hacking himself. But a 2015 lawsuit filed in a New York State court put forward detailed allegations.An international mining company controlled by a trio of flamboyant millionaires from Kazakhstan sued in a New York State court, accusing Mr. Akhmetshin of orchestrating a hacking campaign against their company to benefit a rival Russian tycoon, Andrey Melnichenko. Each side of the dispute is known for aggressive business practices and lavish excesses.Mr. Akhmetshin has called this characterization misleading. He was, he said, drafted as a young man to serve in a military unit performing counterintelligence functions during the Soviet-Afghan war. As an enlisted man, he said, he never received any training in \u201cnegative public relations.\u201dThe suit alleged that Mr. Akhmetshin was retained by EuroChem VolgaKaliy, a Russian potassium mining company controlled by Mr. Melnichenko, which was involved in a $1 billion litigation with I.M.R. The suit also names as a defendant Salisbury & Ryan, a New York law firm representing EuroChem.The lawsuit alleged that Mr. Akhmetshin was hired to hack into the computer systems of I.M.R. and had stolen about 28,000 files, or about 50 gigabytes of data. It said the sensitive material was then distributed to journalists and others in an effort to harm the company\u2019s reputation.The suit claims that Mr. Akhmetshin stole passport information, emails and personal contact lists for executives within I.M.R., along with bank account information; loan agreements; business strategy documents; board meeting minutes; drafts of market-sensitive documents; and financial forecasts and projections for the company.An investigator for I.M.R. reported personally witnessing and overhearing a conversation at a London coffee shop during which Mr. Akhmetshin handed someone an external hard drive that Mr. Akhmetshin described as containing files obtained from I.M.R. computers, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit was withdrawn in 2016, and Mr. Melnichenko denied all the allegations in it.Mr. Akhmetshin has denied that he hacked the company\u2019s computers.An early client of Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s was an opposition leader from Kazakhstan who, from self-imposed exile in the West, was waging a lonely campaign against one of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest allies, the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.And in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, he helped to unravel a brazen corruption scheme by a former pro-Kremlin leader and his family that had been cheating the population, poor already, out of millions of dollars.On other occasions, however, Mr. Akhmetshin worked on causes that clearly benefited the Kremlin, like a long-running campaign by Ms. Veselnitskaya to get Congress to repeal legislation imposing sanctions on Russian officials suspected of corruption and involvement in the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian accountant who died in a Moscow jail in 2009.Mr. Akhmetshin had also at times been in touch with Russian government officials, court records show.In 2010, he submitted an op-ed column to The Washington Times on behalf of Viktor Ivanov, then the director of Russia\u2019s anti-narcotics police, according to one of Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s own emails, subpoenaed as evidence in a case in the Southern District of New York. Mr. Ivanov is a longtime veteran of Russia\u2019s security services.Mr. Akhmetshin has spoken openly about his service in the Soviet military in Afghanistan, and his current work throughout Russia and Central Asia.Once, a reporter arrived for a meeting at a coffee shop in Moscow with Mr. Akhmetshin and peered around the room, trying to see where he was sitting.Mr. Akhmetshin had come in with what amounted to a disguise: He sat smiling at a table, wearing a hat resembling a skull cap and his beard grown to an impressive length. He was headed next, he said, on an assignment to Afghanistan and had assumed the appearance of an Afghan elder.David D.

{"Headline": "A Debut Novel Asks, What if His First Wife Was the One?", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cStandard Deviation,\u201d Katherine Heiny\u2019s first novel, is about a marriage, and, as with marriage, it is easier to catalog this novel\u2019s individual sly charms than it is to nail down the essential, quicksilver thing that makes it such a success.Heiny\u2019s follow-up to her 2015 short story collection \u201cSingle, Carefree, Mellow\u201d opens with a husband, Graham, and wife, Audra, doing their grocery shopping on a Saturday morning in New York City. Told in the third person but heavily mediated by Graham\u2019s consciousness, this first scene tells us much of what we will need to know about the couple: They have been married for 12 years. Audra, 41, is \u201cnot quite beautiful but her liveliness kept her far away from plain.\u201d Graham is 15 years older \u2014 it is \u201cone of those marriages\u201d he assumes everyone thinks when they are out in public. They have a son named Matthew. They are white, and gruesomely so; Graham idly imagines he \u201cwould have made an excellent owner of a safe house in the Underground Railroad,\u201d while Audra makes a special, alarming point of telling a black store clerk what a great job he\u2019s doing.Crucially, we learn from this grocery scene \u2014 which is, incidentally, one of the breeziest, most assured and detailed novel openings in recent memory \u2014 that Audra has a preternatural knowledge of the life story of every person in a hundred-block radius. While pushing her grocery cart she meets and chatters to her yoga teacher (who prefers to go by her spiritual name), a classroom parent (whose husband had a vasectomy) and her appliance repairman (whose cat suffers from bladder infections).Audra\u2019s prodigious knowledge of people\u2019s names, faces and bewildering, often pointless personal details \u2014 that someone recently broke an eyetooth on a bagel, for example \u2014 is an animating force in the book. Graham thinks of her as \u201ca female Warren Buffett who knew about everything except finance\u201d; the sort of woman who provides advice to all comers on \u201cprivate schools, on marriage counselors, on hairdressers, on au pairs, on restaurants, on shops, on neighborhood watches, on gyms, on doctors, on internet providers\u201d but may not know, he suspects, the name of the mayor of New York City.Heiny finds a wonderful specificity in archetypes. Audra and Graham\u2019s apartment is a revolving door of down-on-their-luck houseguests, whether the friend who owns her own brownstone but doesn\u2019t want to be alone while her husband is off on a retreat (and cheating on her, as Audra knows but the friend doesn\u2019t), or the building doorman who is having an unspecified problem \u2014 bedbugs or landlord issues \u2014 with his apartment. The couple\u2019s 10-year-old son, who is on the autism spectrum, is an accomplished origami practitioner whom they ferry to an exclusive \u201cfolding\u201d club populated by extremely quirky middle-aged men.The book has a kind of \u201cMen Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\u201d feel, but its confidence, and the texture of the small world it creates, keep it from feeling parodic, as do the various \u201cdeviations\u201d from the archetypes Heiny explores. Nor is it completely lighthearted, despite its comic tenor; Graham and Audra fret over their son\u2019s prospects as a non-neurotypical person, and mourn the breakup of his sole friendship at school. Despite Audra\u2019s charm, she isn\u2019t particularly nice. It\u2019s obvious to the reader, although not to Graham, that her disarming brand of overshare, her encyclopedic social knowledge, are not an indication of guilelessness. Graham, who self-identifies as the staid and reasonable one next to Audra\u2019s effusions, has his own less-examined foibles. (He spends part of the novel in an Audra-sanctioned emotional affair with his ex-wife.) Like Graham, the novel gestures at darker corridors, mostly choosing to leave them untraveled. But as with any marriage, it\u2019s better to take this novel just exactly as it is, rather than nitpick all the things that it\u2019s not.A review on July 9 about the novel \u201cStandard Deviation,\u201d by Katherine Heiny, misstated part of the title of a 2015 story collection by the same author. It is \u201cSingle, Carefree, Mellow,\u201d not \u201cSingle, Careful, Mellow.\u201dLydia Kiesling\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Golden State,\u201d will be published next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dispute Over British Baby\u2019s Fate Draws In Pope and U.S. President", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Charlie Gard, who turns 11 months old on Tuesday, was born with an extremely rare genetic disease. He is blind and deaf, and he cannot breathe or move on his own. He suffers from persistent epileptic seizures.Now the British infant is at the center of a global debate, drawing in the Vatican and President Trump, over what medical treatment, if any, he is entitled to receive, and who decides \u2014 his family, his doctors or the courts.The London hospital that is treating Charlie has asked permission to remove him from life support. His parents want to take him to the United States, where they believe an experimental treatment has a chance \u2014 however remote \u2014 of prolonging his life, even though the disease has no cure.But Pope Francis and Mr. Trump have also weighed in, adding another dimension to an extraordinarily thorny bioethical and legal dispute that pits Britain\u2019s medical and judicial establishment against the wishes of the child\u2019s parents.Italy\u2019s top pediatric hospital, which is run by the Vatican, told the Italian news agency ANSA on Monday that it would be willing to take Charlie.\u201cWe understand that the situation is desperate,\u201d said Mariella Enoc, director of the Bambino Ges\u00f9 hospital in Rome, noting that she had been in touch with British officials to signal a willingness to take the patient, the agency reported. \u201cWe are close to the parents in prayer and, if this is their desire, we are open to receiving their child at our structure for the time it will take for him to live.\u201dBoth the pope and the president stopped short of criticizing the court rulings or the hospital. Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, the director of the White House office of media affairs, said Mr. Trump had decided to speak out after he learned about \u201cthis heartbreaking situation.\u201d Mr. Trump has not spoken with the family, she said, and does not want \u201cto pressure them in any way.\u201d\u201cThe president is just trying to be helpful if at all possible,\u201d she added.Charlie was born on Aug. 4 with encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He is thought to be one of only 16 children globally with the condition, the result of a genetic mutation.The High Court ruled that Charlie would face significant harm if his suffering were to be prolonged without any realistic prospect of improvement. Moreover, it said the experimental treatment, known as nucleoside therapy, would not be effective.Money is not at issue; an academic medical center in the United States has offered to provide the experimental treatment. But a neurologist at the hospital, who has offered to oversee the treatment, told the court by telephone: \u201cI can understand the opinion that he is so severely affected by encephalopathy that any attempt at therapy would be futile. I agree that it is very unlikely that he will improve with that therapy.\u201dNeither the hospital nor the neurologist was identified in court documents, and the White House has declined to identify either.The Court of Human Rights ruled last week that the British courts had acted appropriately in concluding that \u201cit was most likely Charlie was being exposed to continued pain, suffering and distress, and that undergoing experimental treatment with no prospects of success would offer no benefit, and continue to cause him significant harm.\u201dThe case has drawn attention to important differences in legal systems.Courts in the United States are less inclined to get involved when there are disputes between parents and doctors, said Professor Moreno of the University of Pennsylvania, stressing that it was usually left to doctors, in consultation with parents, to decide on a child\u2019s treatment.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be a supportable position morally or ethically,\u201d he said of the stance taken by the hospital in London, adding that what is legal and what is ethical are not always the same.There was no immediate response to Mr. Trump\u2019s statement from Charlie\u2019s parents, who last week appeared to accept the finality of the courts\u2019 rulings. Photographs of the couple sleeping with their sick child have circulated on social media recently.\u201cWe are really grateful for all the support from the public at this extremely difficult time,\u201d Ms. Yates said on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re making precious memories that we can treasure forever with very heavy hearts. Please respect our privacy while we prepare to say the final goodbye to our son Charlie.\u201dThere was also no immediate reaction from the hospital.\u201cIn Charlie\u2019s case we have been discussing for many months how the withdrawal of treatment may work,\u201d the hospital said. \u201cThere would be no rush for any action to be taken immediately.\u201d It added that it would consult the family and that \u201cdiscussions and planning in these situations usually take some days.\u201dReporting was contributed by Aneri Pattani and Roni Caryn Rabin from New York, Michael D. Shear from Washington, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}
