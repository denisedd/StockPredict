{"Headline": "Charles W. Bachman, Business Software Innovator, Dies at 92", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles W. Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92.His daughter Chandini Bachman confirmed his death.Mr. Bachman was a pioneer in the field of database management software. His work would later be eclipsed by that of other innovators, and software tools have changed drastically over the years. But behind every product search on Amazon, movie recommendation on Netflix or bid on eBay, there is a flood of digital communications mediated by database management software, which owes an intellectual debt to Mr. Bachman.He was working for General Electric when he developed a layer of software that allowed programmers to retrieve data for an automated manufacturing system that controlled a variety of tasks \u2014 production scheduling, parts ordering and inventory management.His Integrated Data Store software, first demonstrated in 1963, made it possible to share data across different applications. That capability had been talked about before, but Mr. Bachman was the first to carry it out.His software was crucial to converting the G.E. manufacturing-control system from an idea to a reality, an impressive technical feat given the limitations of the primitive computers at the time.In 1973, Mr. Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to database technology. The award is often described as the Nobel Prize for computer science. In 2014, Mr. Bachman visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama.Mr. Bachman was the first Turing Award recipient who did not have a Ph.D. The earlier winners of the prize, which was first issued in 1966, had academic backgrounds, mainly as mathematicians or physicists. Mr. Bachman had degrees in mechanical engineering, a bachelor\u2019s from Michigan State College and a master\u2019s from the University of Pennsylvania.Mr. Bachman spent his career in the business world at a series of companies large and small, including Dow Chemical, G.E., Honeywell and a start-up backed by venture capital in the 1980s.Yet it was the application of computing to business problems \u2014 rather than business itself \u2014 that Mr. Bachman found appealing.\u201cHe was always an engineer at heart,\u201d said Thomas Haigh, a technology historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who interviewed Mr. Bachman for an oral history project and studied his work. \u201cHe was motivated by the joy of tinkering with complex systems and making things work better.\u201dCharles William Bachman III was born on Dec. 11, 1924, in Manhattan, Kan., the second of four children of Grace Marie Cary Bachman and Charles W. Bachman Jr. His father was the football coach at Kansas State College, and later at Michigan State.The younger Mr. Bachman grew to be a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches, and he inherited his father\u2019s fondness for sports, but his real passion was building and fixing things. \u201cI was always going to be an engineer,\u201d Mr. Bachman told Mr. Haigh in 2004.Mr. Bachman graduated early from high school, took spring and summer courses at Michigan State and then joined the Army in 1943, serving two years in the artillery corps in New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Antiaircraft guns at the time used simple mechanical computers to target a plane\u2019s predicted flight path, a rudimentary primer for Mr. Bachman\u2019s later work.After the war, Mr. Bachman returned to Michigan State to complete his undergraduate degree in 1948. The following year, he married Constance Hadley, shortly after she graduated from Michigan State. They were married for 62 years. She died in 2012.Besides his daughter Chandini, Mr. Bachman is survived by a brother, J. Cary; three other children, Thomas, Jonathan and Sara Bachman Ducey; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Mr. Bachman began his engineering career with big companies that were starting to use computers \u2014 Dow Chemical, G.E. and Honeywell, which bought G.E.\u2019s computer business in 1970. During that time, Mr. Bachman took a leading role in computing organizations, which were establishing standards for how data is represented, shared and modeled.Later in his career, Mr. Bachman worked for smaller companies and started one of his own, Bachman Information Systems, in 1983. It focused on a technology called computer-aided software engineering that was intended to make creating software easier by offering programmers graphical tools instead of requiring them to write code line by line. His company attracted funding from two leading venture capital firms, Venrock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and it enjoyed some early success. It sold shares in a public offering in 1991, and its stock price surged for a while.The young company had some impressive technology. But it failed to catch the shift to personal computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows software and lower-cost applications programs. The remnants of Bachman Information Systems went through a couple of mergers and eventually sold to a larger corporation.\u201cCharlie was always the architect, not a managerial C.E.O. type,\u201d said Jonathan Bachman, a software project manager who worked with his father for years. \u201cAnd a lot of what he designed lives on, in a new guise, today.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201dFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201dEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201dAt least they hope not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Big Sick,\u2019 South Asian Identity and Me", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI never told my Bengali parents about my first kiss. I was 14 and we were in the basement of my house in Howell, N.J. Her name was Sharon and she had braces. It didn\u2019t go well. Sorry, Sharon.They never knew about my high school crushes, my dates at Applebee\u2019s, or my first couple of girlfriends. I hid all this because I knew my parents wouldn\u2019t approve. They had an arranged marriage. In India, where they grew up, choosing your life partner was uncommon.Right after graduating college, I finally mustered the courage to introduce my mother to my longtime girlfriend, Michelle, hoping that after four decades in the United States, my mother might be ready for the idea that (a) I had chosen my own girlfriend and (b) my girlfriend might be white.I was optimistic about how the dinner at my mother\u2019s apartment would go, and it started off well. Michelle brought flowers. But my hope was misplaced.The dinner was mostly me being a nervous chatterbox, trying in vain to spark conversation between two people with little in common. My mother didn\u2019t talk much, if at all. She grew up in a different culture and a different generation. She was too polite to say it, but I know she wanted my partner to be Indian, like us. She wanted someone who understood her world. That wasn\u2019t Michelle, or Sharon, or anyone else I had chosen.Crossing the cultural divide can be lonely, particularly when you\u2019re growing up in a mostly white town. Especially when few television shows and films tell stories of people who look like you.\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d is a welcome exception.The film is about Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s real-life courtship, breakup and eventual marriage to Emily V. Gordon, his wife and co-author (played by Zoe Kazan). And even though no one I\u2019ve dated fell into a coma, as Ms. Gordon did, Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s struggle was a recognizable one.But a number of South Asian women have expressed a reaction completely different from mine, seeing \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d as yet another movie that portrays South Asian women as inherently less desirable.Ms. Ahmed also took issue with a dynamic in several American movies featuring South Asian men: \u201cWhy does there always need to be a white leading woman? Are we unable to tell Brown romantic narratives without grounding them in Whiteness?\u201dFor me, though, \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d is the wrong target for this frustration.Stories of South Asian culture are rarely given voice. We certainly need more of these, particularly from female writers and producers. But here, it is Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s story being told \u2014 not that of a roomful of white writers looking to throw some diversity into their screenplay. He is married to a white woman. The story is about their courtship.I didn\u2019t see \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d as a rejection of South Asian women, but rather a rejection of arranged marriage, a difficult and searing subject for some of us who have experienced it up close.My parents were a terrible match. But they stayed together because arranged marriages are often transactional at first; the love, in theory, comes later. That never happened for my parents. And it took them 30 years to end the marriage, at least partially because divorce is stigmatized in South Asian culture. (Estimates for the divorce rates among Indian-Americans range from 1 to 15 percent.)My reaction to this, admittedly flawed, was to reject the part of myself that came from India. Searching for something to blame for my family ills, I blamed arranged marriage. \u201cHow could I subscribe to a culture that forced these two together?\u201d I would often think, silently pulling away from my roots as I entered adulthood.Along the way, my mother did her best to keep me grounded. I took classical Indian vocal lessons. We went to annual Hindu festivals to offer prayers to various gods and goddesses. Sometimes I performed the songs I learned, but it was never quite right. (In \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s character fake prays to please his parents. Been there.) I never felt at home. And my parents, especially my mother, felt a profound sense of loss.This is what I have struggled with in my 20s as I consider my brownness. When it came to marriage, I\u2019ve thought: \u201cIf I say no to my Indian roots, I won\u2019t have the marriage my parents had. I won\u2019t be like that with my kids.\u201dThe inherent awkwardness of an arranged first date around the family dinner table is highlighted. In my eyes, the point wasn\u2019t to relegate South Asian women to a punch line, but to add levity to a story in which Mr. Nanjiani struggles with a choice that could isolate him from his family.When my brother, Sattik, who is 10 years older than I am, married Erica, a white woman, they had a Catholic ceremony.My mother was devastated. She wanted an Indian wedding. I asked why it was important.\u201cBecause we are Indian. I am Indian,\u201d my mother said. South Asian weddings, generally, are about a marriage of two families, rather than two individuals. My brother\u2019s wedding went on, but my mother never fully embraced the nuptials.\u201cShambo, I want you to have an Indian wedding to an Indian girl,\u201d my mother said to me, using a childhood nickname. I was 19 at the time and thought, \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201dI was frustrated and baffled by her mind-set. I am sure she felt the same about mine.I have since dated South Asian women and been very happy. I may very well marry one and have the wedding my mother wants for me. But if I do, it will be because the woman is someone I want to be with, and who wants to be with me.Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s film explored that freedom to choose \u2014 one brown guy\u2019s experience crossing the chasm between two very different cultures. Faulting him for telling his story feels like a kind of erasure, too. I am also not going to deprive Ms. Gordon her due, because it is her story as well.Rather than criticizing the film for what it is not, I appreciate what it offers: a clear, illuminating reflection of the world that I grew up in, a world that few outsiders see.And on the other side, my parents have gradually inched across the divide, accepting more of the cultural differences, as Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s parents ultimately did.They have even asked \u2014 ever so gingerly \u2014 who I am dating.The writer is a culture reporter at the Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bowie Knives and a Tick Head: Marketing Gets Elaborate at Comic-Con", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 A woman clad entirely in white greeted me with a robotic smile and a warning. \u201cThis may be disorienting,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you O.K. with that?\u201d Inside a nearby display case were Old West weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun and a bowie knife. \u201cPlease select one,\u201d she said brightly.And so began my trek through \u201cWestworld: The Experience,\u201d an HBO marketing stunt that sums up both the promise and the challenges of Comic-Con International, which kicked off its 48th installment here on Thursday.Hollywood has long seen the fan gathering as a crucial marketing opportunity. But Comic-Con\u2019s epicenter, the San Diego Convention Center, has now grown so chaotic and overcrowded that many movie and television companies complain that it is hard, if not impossible, to stand out. The blinding hubbub, combined with the ever-increasing power of social media, has led many studios and networks to focus more intently on elaborate experiences \u2014 \u201cactivations,\u201d in industry shorthand \u2014 in the surrounding hotels and streets.To participate, fans register in the lobby of the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. Then they receive the secret headquarters location of Delos, the fictional company behind Westworld, a theme park where wealthy visitors live out Wild West fantasies amid robot \u201chosts.\u201d (It\u2019s in a hotel on the other side of downtown.) Once inside, participants seem to step inside the show, with hosts preparing them for a trip inside the park.And it is disorienting. In one room that looked a bit like a futuristic doctor\u2019s office, I sat alone with a host who did a \u201cpsychological assessment\u201d by asking questions like, \u201cWhat percentage of your dreams are nightmares?\u201d\u201cAbout 30 percent,\u201d I answered honestly. The woman shot me a startled look. (Later, I quizzed participants about their answers, which turned out to be much lower. And then I went home and had a bad dream about having too many bad dreams.) Ultimately, the host gave my personality this appraisal: \u201cYou are strong-willed but not unhinged.\u201d (I clearly fooled her.)The experience ended with a trip inside the show\u2019s saloon, complete with player piano and bartender hosts pouring cocktails. Everyone leaves wearing a cowboy hat.Here are some other stunts planned for Comic-Con\u2019s 2017 run, which concludes on Sunday.Perhaps the most elaborate Comic-Con stunt of them all. To generate interest in \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d arriving in theaters in October, Alcon Entertainment and Warner Bros. teamed with Johnnie Walker to replicate the movie\u2019s futuristic setting \u2014 complete with an Oculus virtual reality experience, a neon-lit Los Angeles street scene, more than 50 props and vehicles from the film, and a cast of 34 actors in costume. The 12,800-square-foot exhibit, near the convention center, took a production team of 40 people working a full week to install, Warner said.To introduce fans to this new superhero series about human mutants, Fox set up a \u201cgene screening station\u201d outside the Hilton Bayfront. Participants must submit to swabbing inside their mouths (yes, seriously) and will later learn about their personal genetic profiles.Netflix built an elaborate complex across from the convention center to promote several of its offerings, including this coming science-fiction film starring Will Smith. There are \u201cBright\u201d sets and a related augmented reality experience.

Stephen Colbert will host the ceremony, which will be broadcast by CBS.At least by the standards of this sometimes relentlessly predictable awards show, this will be a year of change at the Emmy Awards, with many first-time nominees populating several major categories.Here are some significant story lines that took shape on Thursday:\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which has won best drama the last two years, is ineligible for this year\u2019s Emmys because of a later start date. (Its seventh season begins on Sunday.) And HBO\u2019s competitors have gleefully filled the vacuum.This year was a transformative one for the best drama category, with five new shows \u2014 all freshman series \u2014 nominated.Those include \u201cThe Crown\u201d (Netflix), \u201cStranger Things\u201d (Netflix), \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu), \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO) and \u201cThis Is Us\u201d (NBC). Previous nominees, like \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d have been welcomed back, but \u201cHomeland,\u201d \u201cThe Americans\u201d and \u201cMr. Robot\u201d are out.NBC\u2019s landing a nomination for the tear-jerking \u201cThis Is Us\u201d snaps an embarrassing dry spell for the big four broadcast networks. The last time a drama from ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC was nominated was in 2011 \u2014 for CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201dThe best comedy category, however, had just one newcomer \u2014 \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 while the two-time winner \u201cVeep\u201d and the five-time winner \u201cModern Family\u201d were both back.Several late-night shows have adopted a staunch anti-President Trump posture in the last year, and that appears to have helped them with Emmy voters.\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which was withering toward Mr. Trump and his inner circle last season, led all shows \u2014 along with \u201cWestworld\u201d \u2014 with 22 nominations. This NBC stalwart was nominated for best variety sketch series, along with nominations for three cast members (Kate McKinnon, Vanessa Bayer and Leslie Jones), Alec Baldwin (for his portrayal of Mr. Trump) and Melissa McCarthy (for her hugely popular Sean Spicer impression).Meanwhile, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Hulu\u2019s dystopian drama about a dark future in the United States, very likely benefited from what some TV critics have described as its unique timeliness. Its nomination in the best drama category was a first for Hulu.Move over, gentlemen. This may be the year of the actress at the Emmys.The much-anticipated limited series and TV movie best-actress category will be a showdown between four Oscar winners from two shows: HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon) and FX\u2019s \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan\u201d (Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange). The other nominees in the category were Carrie Coon for FX\u2019s \u201cFargo,\u201d her first Emmy nomination, and Felicity Huffman for \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201dAs an indication of how much more interest is in the actress categories this year: Last month, when the Television Critics Association announced the nominees for its acting categories \u2014 one for drama, one for comedy, neither separated by gender \u2014 11 of the 14 nominees were women.The best actress drama category is wide open since last year\u2019s winner \u2014 Tatiana Maslany \u2014 is ineligible because \u201cOrphan Black\u201d debuted too late this year. Nominees include actresses from rookie shows \u2014 Elisabeth Moss (\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d), Claire Foy (\u201cThe Crown\u201d) and Evan Rachel Wood (\u201cWestworld\u201d) \u2014 and past nominees like Keri Russell (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) and Viola Davis (\u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d), who won the award in 2015.HBO had the most nominations with 111 \u2014 the 17th consecutive year that it has led the pack \u2014 but its lead is narrowing. Netflix, which had 92 fewer nominations than HBO just two years ago, had just 20 fewer this year.An earlier version of this article, using information from the Television Academy, misstated the number of Emmy nominations HBO garnered this year. The number is 111, not 110.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Meal Kits, Lyft and \u2018Despacito\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGoogle Fiber, the broadband service that Google started years ago to challenge the cable company monopolies, has run into yet another set of snags. They lost their new C.E.O. for untold reasons. Five months in, and he\u2019s a goner. Ouch!Speaking of which, I decided to bite the bullet and try one of these meal kits. I signed up for Blue Apron, so we\u2019ll see if I can make it through a cooking session without setting my house on fire. I also tried cooking a week\u2019s worth of dinners from Green Chef, which were really tasty. Everyone keeps telling me Sun Basket is good, too.Really what I\u2019ve learned is that dinners are essentially becoming Lego blocks for adults. I\u2019m not sure if I like it.I can\u2019t see any reason I\u2019d want to use this. Seems like it would make much more sense for Amazon to buy Pinterest, which already skews heavily toward shopping and list-making. But perhaps I\u2019m wrong. (Also, Amazon just spent a bunch of money on Whole Foods, so they might not want to whip out the checkbook again so soon.)Meanwhile, over in Twitter-land, the company said that early results on its abuse reduction tactics showed they were actually working. As a result of using technology and artificial intelligence better, abuse and harassment seem to be slowly decreasing on the site, according to some slightly opaque statistics they\u2019ve shared.And yet, you still have an account and are allowed to tweet at me. Big oversight, methinks.I\u2019m curious to hear your take on this, but my inclination is to believe it\u2019s a smart enough play by Lyft. If you believe that autonomous vehicles are the future \u2014 and literally almost every major company in transportation believes this is the case \u2014 then you need to position your business for a day in which there are more robot drivers than human ones. That could benefit Lyft, as they could take a larger cut of revenue from each ride they complete. (Admittedly, there are many other costs associated with driverless tech, to be clear.)However, Lyft just isn\u2019t as well funded as Uber, the $70 billion behemoth that is developing its own self-driving tech in house. So I can see a kind of platform play and striking deals with partners as a decent compromise.What do you think? I have a feeling you disagree with me.In other words, self-driving looks as if it\u2019s shaping up like the cloud business. There\u2019ll be two or three big providers that will sell tech to lots of different transportation companies. And those transportation companies \u2014 whether they\u2019re carmakers or shared-ride providers like Lyft or some other type of business \u2014 will build many different kinds of businesses using that licensed technology, just like Netflix stores its videos on Amazon\u2019s cloud.So it\u2019s weird to me to see all these transportation companies spending so much to create their own tech. It would be as if American Airlines decided to build autopilot for its planes rather than let Boeing and Airbus do it. Or if Netflix started its own cloud service to host its videos. It\u2019s odd.But I\u2019m just a tech columnist with a lot of time on my hands. See you next week!Advertisement"}

I, Keegan, want to be able to go, O.K., what\u2019s the intensely personal thing that I want to do, and I don\u2019t care if I fail? I admire people like that.\u201d\u201cFriends From College\u201d is very different from the work you did on \u201cKey & Peele.\u201d How would you describe it?It\u2019s a bunch of paradoxes. It\u2019s like a heightened \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm,\u201d yet more grounded. It\u2019s zany and dark, but also heartfelt. It\u2019s got everything smushed in it. It\u2019s an ensemble, but I\u2019m Rudolph. [Laughs.] I\u2019ve got the best Donners and Blitzens and Comets in the world. And people keep asking me to be Rudolph.Your character, Ethan, is married to one college friend and having an affair with another. Does that make him harder for audiences to identify with?He\u2019s comfortable with his behavior, but he\u2019s also comfortable in his misery. He knows he shouldn\u2019t be doing what he\u2019s doing. So he\u2019s constantly trying to justify what he\u2019s doing. But what it is that makes him not stop is what we\u2019re exploring.How did you feel about viewers meeting your character completely naked in an opening sex scene?You have a B.F.A. from the University of Detroit Mercy and an M.F.A. from Penn State. What were your higher-education experiences like?Unlike our parents in the \u201960s, I wanted to listen to my elders. I did not want to rock the boat. I would say there was more technical learning than there was self-discovery. It\u2019s a completely different part of my life that I\u2019m trying to look at now. And the show has actually helped reveal a little bit of that.What kind of lessons has it taught you?I\u2019m allowed to have my own opinions. I\u2019m trying, every day, when I meet a new human being, to not have the first thought that comes into my mind be: Are they going to like me? I\u2019m allowed to say, I like this and I don\u2019t like that. That\u2019s a whole new thing in my life.That\u2019s surprising \u2014 looking at \u201cKey & Peele,\u201d that would seem to come from a person with a very strong point of view. Given the success Jordan had this year with \u201cGet Out,\u201d do you feel any burden to succeed to the same degree in something of your own?It\u2019s not about succeeding to that exact level. He did exactly what he wanted, and that was the result. So I have a profound admiration for him. If you actually express what you feel, and you know where you\u2019re coming from and what makes your heart beat, that can happen. We\u2019re two different artists. He wants to be in charge of creating worlds. I\u2019m more than happy to be a person who lives in those worlds. I\u2019m making sure to pick projects that reflect what I actually want to do. I\u2019ve learned that from him.Does that include looking for leading-man roles that, in a different era, might have gone exclusively to white actors? Something that Jordan and I have said many times, in our previous work, is that the African-American experience is not a monolithic one. If you\u2019re telling a specific story, and then you drop a person who happens to have more melanin in their skin in the middle of that story, you can\u2019t help but identify with the person. You get swept up in the story of that human. I\u2019m looking for human stories to do.How did you end up in \u201cHamlet\u201d?What\u2019s fascinating about Horatio?When I was younger, he interested me because I didn\u2019t have enough confidence to think I could play Hamlet. [Laughs.] So I\u2019ll just play the best friend. Now, there\u2019s a lovely speech in the play, where Hamlet talks about Horatio being a man who is \u201cnot a pipe for Fortune\u2019s finger.\u201d He\u2019s the steady rock \u2014 he can handle anything. And I go, Oh, I want to be like Horatio.\u201cHamlet\u201d is about three and a half hours. Have you ever had a live theatrical experience that\u2019s as demanding as this one?This is going to sound strange, but sometimes we forget how good of a writer this guy is. You\u2019re tired, and then sometimes you just lock in and you start really listening to one of your cast mates speaking. And it lifts you up. The language is so full and dynamic and descriptive and whole. You can\u2019t help but be turned on by it. Nobody wants two-show days, and I can\u2019t wait for two-show days. I can\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sam Shepard, Actor and Pulitzer-Winning Playwright, Is Dead at 73", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "Mr. Shepard, one of the most important and influential writers of his generation, specialized in capturing the darker sides of American family life.Supported bySam Shepard, whose hallucinatory plays redefined the landscape of the American West and its inhabitants, died on Thursday at his home in Kentucky. He was 73.A spokesman for his family announced the death on Monday, saying the cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.A reluctant movie star who was always suspicious of celebrity\u2019s luster, he was more at home as one of the theater\u2019s most original and prolific portraitists of what was once the American frontier.12 PhotosThat includes any comforting notions of family, home, material success and even individual identity. \u201cTo me, a strong sense of self isn\u2019t believing in a lot,\u201d Mr. Shepard said in a 1994 interview with The New York Times. \u201cSome people might define it that way, saying, \u2018He has a very strong sense of himself.\u2019 But it\u2019s a complete lie.\u201dThat feeling of uncertainty was translated into dialogue of an uncommon lyricism and some of the strangest, strongest images in American theater. A young man in \u201cBuried Child,\u201d a bruising tale of a Midwestern homecoming, describes looking into the rearview mirror as he is driving and seeing his face morph successively into those of his ancestors.Mr. Shepard wrote more than 55 plays (his last, \u201cA Particle of Dread,\u201d had its premiere in 2014), acted in more than 50 films and had more than a dozen roles on television. He was also the author of several prose works, including \u201cCruising Paradise\u201d (1996), and the memoir \u201cMotel Chronicles\u201d (1982). Though he received critical acclaim almost from the beginning of his career, and his work has been staged throughout the world, he was never a mainstream commercial playwright.Several writers who grew up studying Mr. Shepard\u2019s works said that they were struck by his boldness. Christopher Shinn, whose plays include the Pulitzer finalist \u201cDying City,\u201d said he was reminded of Mr. Shepard\u2019s gifts as a writer while watching \u201cBuried Child\u201d Off Broadway last year.\u201cI felt the play pulsing with Sam Shepard\u2019s unconscious, and I realized how rarely I feel that in the theater today,\u201d Mr. Shinn said on Monday. \u201cSam always wrote from that place \u2014 a zone of trauma, mystery and grief. Whether the play was more mainstream or experimental in its conception, he took the big risk every time.\u201dIn the relatively naturalistic \u201cTrue West,\u201d two brothers of opposite temperaments find themselves assuming the personality of the other. (John Malkovich and Gary Sinise made their names in the Steppenwolf Theater Company production; Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly memorably traded off the parts in the 2000 Broadway revival.) Roles within families depicted onstage continually shift and dissolve, as in Mr. Shepard\u2019s great \u201cA Lie of the Mind\u201d (1985), the title of which might serve for every play he wrote.As for love between a man and a woman, Mr. Shepard, whose long relationship with the actress Jessica Lange cast an unwanted spotlight on his private life, described that as \u201cterrible and impossible.\u201d He later explained: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible the way people enter into it feeling they\u2019re going to be saved by the other one. And it seems like many, many times that quicksand happens in a relationship when you feel that somehow you can be saved.\u201d\u201cI loved Sam,\u201d Mr. Harris said in a statement on Monday. \u201cHe has been a huge part of my life, who I am, and he will remain so.\u201dThe dynamic of love in that play, as it is for family in \u201cTrue West\u201d and \u201cBuried Child,\u201d is the wrestling match. Cast members in Shepard plays are often required to tear down the set, literally (in his early \u201cLa Turista,\u201d a young man walked through a wall), and engage in highly physical fights. Bruises, sprains and broken bones are common casualties of appearing in a Shepard production.But collaborators remembered Mr. Shepard as being easy to work with. \u201cEspecially gratifying was the trust he placed in a young director,\u2019\u2019 said Daniel Aukin, who directed \u201cHeartless\u201d in 2012 and \u201cFool for Love\u201d on Broadway. \u201cFor such a meticulous artist he was a million miles from precious. After a rehearsal room run-through of \u2018Fool for Love\u2019 I was concerned about a bit of blocking. He said, \u2018If they\u2019re in the pocket, they can do it standing on their heads.\u2019 \u201dMr. Aukin said Mr. Shepard told him of his illness before they began working on the production, as he did with at least one other recent collaborator. But the playwright largely kept his battle private. He is survived by his children \u2014 Jesse, Hannah and Walker Shepard \u2014 and his sisters, Sandy and Roxanne Rogers.Born Samuel Shepard Rogers III on Nov. 5, 1943, he came naturally by his Strindbergian view of love, marriage and family. The father for whom he was named was an alcoholic, nomadic man, and he haunts Mr. Shepard\u2019s work, in the ghostly form of the cynical, romantic narrator of \u201cFool for Love\u201d and the title character of \u201cThe Late Henry Moss\u201d (2005).Known as Steve Rogers through his childhood and adolescence, the younger Mr. Shepard grew up on his family\u2019s avocado farm in Duarte, Calif. Jobs in his youth included stablehand, orange picker and sheep shearer. He briefly attended Mount San Antonio College, as an agriculture student, but dropped out to move to New York in 1962, having discovered jazz and the plays of Samuel Beckett.Mr. Shepard was soon writing plays in which characters and images melted into one another, suggesting a poetically cadenced LSD trip. (Mr. Shepard admitted to free acquaintance with drugs in that phase of his life.) Of that era in downtown Manhattan he has said, \u201cYou were right in the thing, especially on the Lower East Side. La MaMa, Theater, Genesis, Caffe Cino, all those theaters were just starting. So that was just a great coincidence. I had place to just go and put something on without having to go through a producer or go through the commercial network.\u201dHis work extended to the music world. He wrote songs with John Cale and Bob Dylan, notably \u201cBrownsville Girl,\u201d from Mr. Dylan\u2019s 1986 album \u201cKnocked Out Loaded,\u201d and he played drums for a time in a group called the Holy Modal Rounders, who once opened for the progressive rock group Pink Floyd. (He also had a well-publicized relationship with the singer-songwriter Patti Smith.)Besides acting in films, he directed a few, including \u201cFar North\u201d (1988), which he wrote and which starred Ms. Lange. Mr. Shepard wrote or collaborated on screenplays for, among others, the directors Michaelangelo Antonioni (\u201cZabriskie Point,\u201d 1970), Robert Frank (\u201cMe and My Brother,\u201d 1969) and Wim Wenders (\u201cParis, Texas,\u201d which won the top prize at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival).Another screenwriting collaboration was with Mr. Dylan, for his widely panned, self-referential 1978 film \u201cRenaldo and Clara,\u201d described by one critic as a \u201cfour-hour fever dream\u201d about the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll life.Most recently he portrayed the patriarch of a troubled Florida family in the Netflix series \u201cBloodline.\u201d But the role that may have matched actor and subject most neatly was Chuck Yeager in \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d Philip Kaufman\u2019s adaptation of Tom Wolfe\u2019s book about the early days of the space program. It earned Mr. Shepard an Oscar nomination.\u201cHe was playing Yeager, but for the other actors who worked with him, he was Sam,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said in a phone interview on Monday. \u201cHe was such a cool guy with as perfect an ear as I\u2019ve ever come across. He could hear and reproduce sounds in a way \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 that maybe Bob Dylan could do.\u201dSpeaking of how he creates his characters, Mr. Shepard once perfectly summed up the artful ambiguity that pervades his work and is a principal reason it seems likely to endure: \u201cThere are these territories inside all of us, like a child or a father or the whole man,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s what interests me more than anything: where those territories lie.\u201cI mean, you have these assumptions about somebody and all of a sudden this other thing appears. Where is that coming from?\u201cThat\u2019s the mystery. That\u2019s what\u2019s so fascinating.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the occupation of Chuck Yeager, whom Mr. Shepard portrayed in the movie \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d He was a test pilot, not an aspiring astronaut.Sopan Deb, Patrick Healy and William McDonald contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Soothe Luxury-Car Buyers: Add Perks and Subtract Haggling", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe automobile \u2014 connected to the internet, powered by electricity, driven with computer support \u2014 is evolving faster than at any point in its history.Buying one, though, remains just about the same as always.But luxury dealers are betting that technology, and a healthy dose of more personal interaction, can vastly reduce bad buying experiences.\u201cHow do I have a sustainable business when everyone laughs thinking about car salespeople?\u201d asked Peter Cooper, owner of Lexus of Lehigh Valley, in Allentown, Pa. \u201cWe\u2019re so out of touch with the consumer.\u201dAware that many buyers hate haggling, Lexus introduced a fixed-price program in May 2016, called Lexus Plus, in which the customer deals with only one person from beginning to end. Only 10 of its 238 dealers in the United States are involved so far; another three are preparing to enter.\u201cBuyers won\u2019t have to wait 45 minutes to see a finance director,\u201d said Jim Dunn, general manager for JM Lexus of Margate, Fla., the world\u2019s highest-volume Lexus dealer, which will offer Lexus Plus. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put your best price up front and live with that.\u201dAt Mr. Cooper\u2019s dealership, the program has been well received. Unit sales are up 28.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.Not getting a straight answer on price is one reason Will Kunkel, who wanted to acquire three new Audis for his family, left two dealerships in disgust.\u201cThe first dealer told me that I had to buy immediately because the car would be gone that night,\u201d Mr. Kunkel said. \u201cAnd the second would only talk about monthly payments rather than price. They may as well call you an idiot to your face.\u201dCadillac is testing a program whereby customers never buy any particular vehicle at all. Instead, they buy rights to a car and can change which one they want to drive using a mobile app.Book by Cadillac, being tested in New York City, offers the ability to switch among Cadillac models up to 18 times per year. Using the Book app, customers can reserve a vehicle that, if it is available, will be delivered the next morning to the location of their choice.The program costs $1,500 per month, which includes registration, insurance, service and repairs. All vehicles, including the Escalade, CT6, XT5, CTS-V and ATS-V, have high-end trims, plus a 4G LTE connection and hot spot, OnStar and satellite radio.About 8,000 people have asked to be part of the program, the company said. And the high-tech, no-commitment approach has attracted younger drivers: Although the average age of a Cadillac owner is 62, the average age of those signing up for Book is 34, 90 percent of them first-time Cadillac drivers.\u201cWe\u2019re a Netflix for cars,\u201d said Melody Lee, Cadillac\u2019s director of brand marketing.When customers do go to a dealership to buy, they have often done research online before leaving home, industry experts say. That makes it harder for dealers to keep the upper hand when discussing typical prices, features or available inventory.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge for dealers when customers have instant access to vehicle information,\u201d said Chris Sutton, vice president for United States automotive retail practice at the research firm J. D. Power.Alfa Romeo, trying to make a comeback in the United States, is arming its dealers\u2019 sales teams with iPads to help them communicate on more equal terms with their customers, said Pieter Hogeveen, director of Alfa Romeo North America.Lincoln Motor Company, Ford\u2019s luxury division, is approaching the problem of selling to a well-informed, focused public by reshaping a car sale as a luxury experience. Customers don\u2019t want to submit themselves to one salesperson to haggle with, then to a closer and finally to a finance manager, surrendering the better part of a day.\u201cFor affluent customers, time is the key thing; it\u2019s their ultimate luxury,\u201d said Kumar Galhotra, Lincoln\u2019s president.To reduce the time that people spend buying and servicing their vehicles, Lincoln is offering at-home test drives and service pickups and deliveries. Customers can even evaluate a vehicle over the weekend.Such convenience-based initiatives are part of Lincoln\u2019s Black Label program, a sales and service package that was first offered in 2014 and is available at 106 of the company\u2019s 800 dealers, in 29 states.Black Label models have certain levels of trim and are offered in unique color and fabric combinations. Sales representatives visit customers at their homes or businesses with a sample swatch kit to determine how the car will look inside. Once purchased, Black Label vehicles are picked up and delivered for servicing, and replaced with a loaner car.Lincoln\u2019s theory is that a good sales process continues after the sale, so the company offers additional features to keep customers coming back.One example: The company is also testing a chauffeur service in Miami and San Diego. For $30 an hour, drivers will take customers, in their own vehicles, anywhere they wish to go \u2014 a useful feature for those who can\u2019t drive after doctor\u2019s appointments or a night on the town or simply have too much to do. The chauffeur can also handle shopping trips or pick up the kids at a soccer practice.\u201cIn the Black Label program, we\u2019re getting wealthier, substantially younger customers,\u201d Mr. Galhotra said. \u201cCompared to the mid-50s age for luxury car buyers in general, our Black Label customers are mostly in their 40s.\u201dThat is the kind of program that Mr. Kunkel, creative director at Grayling, a public relations firm based in New York, would have welcomed. He walked out of two dealerships before finding an online price at a third-party website to lease two vehicles and buy a third.\u201cI told the dealer I didn\u2019t want to haggle,\u201d Mr. Kunkel said. \u201cI was not going to buy mudguards. They said they\u2019re a no-haggle dealership.\u201dHe then got the dealership to agree to his price without even stepping through the front door.Advertisement"}

It also suffers a little: In building the four-hour series around their stories, she doesn\u2019t quite succeed in giving it a shape. The issue of caste drifts in and out of focus, and the material that\u2019s strictly about the school and its goals tends to be a little eye-glazing.(She also doesn\u2019t directly address the question of why she focused on five girls at a coeducational school \u2014 it\u2019s odd to see boys in every shot but never hear from them \u2014 though she makes the point that the combination of caste and gender discrimination is particularly odious.)Her access, however, results in fascinating, even mesmerizing scenes and situations.

A graduate prepares a lawsuit that would give ownership of a quarry to the Dalits who both work and live there \u2014 one of whom is her mother.For every instance of success, there are two or three scenes that are problematic at best \u2014 family strife, hopelessness, promise unfulfilled. \u201cDaughters of Destiny\u201d can and will be used as a promotional tool for the Shanti Bhavan project, but it\u2019s to Ms. Roth\u2019s credit that it sometimes feels like the opposite.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s one of 18 nominations that \u201cStranger Things\u201d earned in its first season, including one for best drama series.In a phone interview, Ms. Brown spoke about the first Emmy nomination of her career and the superpower she\u2019d rather have.How did you learn about your Emmy nomination today?I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t look, but obviously you have to look. My dad was watching the announcement, and the guy on the live stream was like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re finished with this.\u201d The live stream stopped, and my dad had three different electronic devices on, like, \u201cCome on!

{"Headline": "Cliffhangers Are Ruining the Golden Age of TV", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe CW superhero series \u201cArrow\u201d did not get an Emmy nomination for best drama series.It\u2019s not in my regular TV rotation, but \u201cArrow\u201d tops my teenage teleholic niece\u2019s. Together we watched its Season 5 finale (spoiler alert): the ensemble is gathered on an island, and the protagonist and villain are adrift on a boat in the ocean. Then, without warning, the island explodes.I had a billion questions. The first was, why manipulate us like this?This year\u2019s Emmys celebrate shows that, for many critics, constitute a golden era of TV. \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and many others employ the cliffhanger to advance and intensify the narrative, to heighten feelings and to deliver on the mind-body promise of art and entertainment \u2014 and also to ensure that viewers find the edges of their seats and stay there.I think it\u2019s a golden era, too, but \u2014 hate to talk behind TV\u2019s back \u2014 I also think artistry is in special danger of becoming mere stimulation.Even great shows surrender storytelling\u2019s functions by overusing them, and then sacrifice the narrative to meet the frenzied demands of an industry that\u2019s always improving upon sitting still.Cliffhangers can serve storytelling or hijack it, can reward audiences or scam them, can put us off or suck us in and possess us. The cliffhanger can even help us understand the best and worst of TV, as well as the tension between creative possibilities and commercial pleasures.The best-drama nominee \u201cStranger Things\u201d showcased a great cliffhanger finale. Rather than breed confusion, it fueled speculation. It didn\u2019t mess with us; it enlisted our participation. More mysterious than inconceivable, it left us with our own theories; its last scenes are ours to interpret and to try to shake. I still see the final image when I blink.\u201cArrow\u201d is an example of cliffhangers gone too far.Streaming media has taken the cliffhanger craze up a notch, or 500. Subscription services (I\u2019m up to four) compete for our undivided attention with their magnitude and features like autoplay, which can briskly carry us through hours of TV, from one seductive cliffhanger question to the next, and the next.It goes like this: \u201cJust one episode.\u201d Cliffhanger. \u201cMy life depends on knowing what happens. Just another.\u201d Cliffhanger. \u201cLast one, I swear,\u201d having sworn it before. Cliffhanger, and canceled plans.Midbinge, \u201cTime to watch one more?\u201d is rhetorical. We must find out what happened; finding out becomes the priority, the plan for the day. We make time to kill time.We don\u2019t so much watch \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d as consume it, as one would potato chips. TV binge culture has adopted the language of junk food. We crave, devour and gorge, trying and failing to sate our ungoverned hunger. More than once I\u2019ve salivated over a series, most recently the Emmy-nominated \u201cWestworld.\u201d Just as I\u2019ve fallen into a food coma, I entered a hypnotic fugue when Hulu released \u201cThe Path,\u201d snubbed by the Emmys.Streaming sites are our delivery systems, and cliffhangers are the carrot.The very intensity of our immersion allows for anything. A series can be great, but it can also be stupefyingly bad. At some point I stop asking \u201cIs it good?\u201d and instead plead, \u201cIs there more?\u201dThe critic and author Michelle Orange points to the original seasons of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d as \u201ca master class in the difference between building an authentic, cumulative sense of suspense (Season 1) and the completely gratuitous, cheap use of cliffhangers to keep people tuning in next week (Season 2).\u201dThe distinction between legitimate tension and manipulation and histrionics is thinning all the time. \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is cliffhanger K-12. Now in its 13th season, it has kept me on the hook my entire adult life, from its first cliffhanger finale (the estranged wife shows up and surprises the new girlfriend) to its eighth (who will survive the plane crash?) to the latest one (I don\u2019t even remember).As seasons advance, a fantastic series can get indefensibly artificial, running on fumes and cliffhangers, until \u201cWho will die?\u201d is the main reason to watch. Part of artistry is to elicit an emotional response; but to elicit and elicit (and elicit) is commercialism.Agonizing is not the same as being left in suspense, and a constant state of cliffhanger suspense gets boring. For example, the point of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 created after Netflix collected and analyzed subscriber data, then synthesized our tastes to guarantee our obsession \u2014 has become to watch more of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a point I\u2019ve taken to heart.So it\u2019s the golden age of television with an asterisk. Now TV can be surveyed and engineered. Now it\u2019s art by algorithm, with artistry going with the whim of data analytics and gimmicks.I wonder if, in some way, we\u2019ve spoiled our appetite for artistry.Maybe artistry has gone down and cliffhangers have skyrocketed because art gets us out of the house. Art puts us more in touch with life outside and doesn\u2019t compel us with cosmic force to actively submit, to alternate between trance and withdrawal, between replenishment and exhaustion.But streaming as a medium and cliffhangers as a tool haven\u2019t turned us into fanatics. Rather, it\u2019s the behavior and attitude toward our lives that media consumption has been orchestrated to encourage. Bingeing, aided by cliffhangers, sells engagement by way of disengaging; together they make a sport of spectatorship.Most of us can\u2019t stand an open narrative loop, so we persevere and sprint back to our devices, again and again. Cliffhangers deny us resolution and closure so that we may never find peace, may not turn off the machine, may continually dissolve into some violent or exotic disaster involving a volcano.Perhaps this played into the critical and collective swoon over the series finale of \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d replete with nuptials, reunions, answers, infants and love that conquers all, even time and space.Resolution, closure \u2014 these, too, are things to binge on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding a More Inclusive Vision of Fitness in Our Feeds", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe series, of course, wasn\u2019t really about working out. Yes, they did squats and uppercuts to techno music. But it was more about the entertainment of exercise. Each tape featured a guest instructor who demonstrated complicated dance combinations, the kind that pop stars like Britney Spears and Janet Jackson performed onstage and in their videos. Half the fun was watching Nies and his crew fall effortlessly in line with the synchronized movements. Occasionally, the teachers would pause and deliver a brief lecture: about the importance of, say, a healthy heart rate or staying hydrated. I made note of it all from my perch on a sofa, usually lying down, working my way through a bag of chips and a bottle of soda. The contrast between the toned thighs, sculpted arms and washboard abs on-screen and my soft preteen figure felt like too large a gulf to ford.It took me years to find a program that kept me in shape: Gyms felt intimidating, and women\u2019s magazines seemed tailored for toning the bodies of already trim white women. We had nothing in common, including our so-called problem areas. I experimented with every kind of class possible \u2014 yoga, spin, Pilates, rowing \u2014 but it was all haphazard, cobbled together by trial and error.Arias belongs to a growing coterie of personal trainers who are building empires on Instagram. The fitness universe on Instagram is almost incomprehensibly vast \u2014 there are hundreds of millions of photographs with hashtags like #fitness, #workout, #fitfam, #fitnessjourney or #fitlife, featuring people in various states of undress, lifting weights, making and drinking shakes, demonstrating techniques and documenting inches and pounds lost, all alongside messages about staying motivated to hit the gym and eat right. It\u2019s as inspiring and vapid as anything else on social media \u2014 and somehow manages to invoke awe and envy at the same time. In a way, fitness Instagram is just the next iteration of a business model that began in the 1980s and 1990s, when workout gurus like Richard Simmons and Jane Fonda created their own empires by selling VHS workout tapes (and eventually workout DVDs) to people who wanted to learn to exercise from the comfort of their living rooms. Those products were marketed in health magazines, on daytime and nighttime talk shows and in infomercials. But as streaming-media sites like YouTube and Netflix matured, businesses built on the backs of older media dwindled. And as social-media sites like Instagram grew, people like Arias realized they could sidestep the traditional machinery that ruled the fitness world to tap into new audiences, especially those the fitness industry has often ignored.Arias told me that she started working out as a holistic way to treat chronic depression. She documented her fitness journey online, which held her accountable and allowed others to participate remotely, if they wanted. After weeks of working out, she posted a photograph of her sculpted abdomen, which went viral. She gained several tens of thousands of followers overnight. \u2018\u2018People started asking me how I did it, and how can they do it,\u2019\u2019 she said. She became certified as a personal trainer, so she could start teaching and dispensing advice, and began doing workout classes in Central Park. Eventually, she started posting short videos on Instagram, teaching people quick routines they could do at home. She began creating 30-day workout and meal programs that people could sign up for on her website; for a fee, they could get access to Arias and a digital community that was also working out that month. Her Instagram functions as a marketing tool, driving people to her website and paid services. And it works: Arias told me that between 1,000 and 2,000 people sign up each month to receive personalized workout advice. She also works with brands that want to reach her 2.2 million followers on Instagram to advertise, say, a supplement or active-wear company, and that advertising makes up about 20 percent of her income.Arias has benefited from the fact that social media has become a place for people ill served by most traditional industries, and fitness is no different \u2014 it allowed people to more easily find trainers, lifestyles and information that were previously more difficult to access. As Jessamyn Stanley, a yoga teacher with a large following on Instagram, put it to me: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about making something accessible by making it visible to lots of people.\u2019\u2019 Stanley said she was able to find an audience online that would have been hard to build offline: \u2018\u2018There was a niche community of people waiting for a yoga book written by a queer, fat, black person. It was just about finding the means to reach them.\u2019\u2019 But as much as Stanley credits her successes to social media, she noted that the performativity and stylization popular on the internet can quickly get out of hand. \u2018\u2018It can create molds and archetypes that become bigger than the activity itself,\u2019\u2019 she told me. She gave the example of an Instagram clich\u00e9: a handstand at sunset on a beach. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s so idealized, like, your life must be perfect if you can hold a balance posture on the beach,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But the actual practice of yoga isn\u2019t about that at all. The image isn\u2019t important. The practice is.\u2019\u2019But Stanley also told me that ultimately, she feels that social media\u2019s ability to forcibly expand perspectives on lifestyles trumps the pressure it may induce among viewers who now feel they have new standards to live up to. Stanley and Arias have attracted followings in part because they play into certain eye-catching aesthetics: a full-figured woman and another whose physique is so toned and muscular it is irresistible click-bait. And they\u2019ve managed to turn that into profit, becoming an entirely new class of fitness entrepreneur \u2014 one that perhaps never would have existed without the advent of social media. Both women have changed my relationship to fitness and my body: Although I am frequently the only woman of color in my real-world yoga and fitness classes, I can always turn to a screen and look at Stanley\u2019s and Arias\u2019s accounts to remind myself that bodies like ours have a place in this realm.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018To the Bone\u2019 Opens Frank Dialogue on Eating Disorders: \u2018They Steal Your Voice\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe film is loosely based on Ms. Noxon\u2019s experience with an eating disorder. She and its star, Lily Collins, are among the 30 million Americans \u2014 a third of them men \u2014 who have struggled with one. Ms. Collins plays Ellen, an anorexia patient who enters her fifth eating disorder treatment center, an unorthodox group home run by a doctor played by Keanu Reeves.Many of those reacting to the film\u2019s trailer worried that watching it could trigger unhealthy thoughts in viewers who may be prone to eating disorders or already struggling with them. Indeed, some experts said that people who have had eating disorders should consider the state of their health before watching the film.Others say the film may help spur action. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, and can affect individuals across every demographic.If you watch the film and recognize that a friend or family member exhibits some of the same behavior as the characters, Dr. Austin recommends approaching the discussion \u201cwith care and love, not judgment,\u201d and avoiding comments on weight or appearance. Professionals at eating disorder clinics around the United States recommend broaching the topic as soon as you identify concerning patterns.\u201cI would caution parents: You need to watch this film with your child, get educated yourself and be aware that this is one story,\u201d Dr. Cabera said, noting the diversity and complexity of different cases of eating disorders.The New York Times asked readers to share their experiences with eating disorders. In less than 48 hours, we received more than 1,200 responses. Some described daily struggles, other celebrated full recoveries, and many spoke of their hopes of helping others by sharing their stories.Here are some of their responses, edited and condensed. Some readers who submitted comments requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.Anonymous, 42, Texas As a parent, it was like being thrust back to the infancy stage in so many ways but with a heightened level of fear that you were failing at a parent\u2019s primary responsibility \u2014 to keep your child alive. All the research, therapy, family therapy, doctors\u2019 appointments, meal prep, and meal lessons (which was like having a second job) didn\u2019t seem to matter. Because in the end, the difference between infancy and her being sick was one crucial factor \u2014 her own agency ... she had to want to fight, too. Fight with all her will everyday, every hour, every moment for success to happen. It\u2019s a bitter lesson as a parent.Lisa Gorove, 56, Virginia Ms. Gorove\u2019s daughter, Caitlin Piper Gorove-Funk, died in 2016 after battling anorexia nervosa for 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of an illness and a voice, it\u2019s not a choice. That voice took a while to explain to other people, that Caitlin wasn\u2019t doing this because she wanted to, it was that something had taken over. Her mind was consumed by the disease. She tried to explain how hard it was.\u201d\u201cI held her and she died in my arms. I told her over and over and over again how much everybody loved her and that she could go. We did not have a funeral, we had a service that was beautiful on many levels. After her service, four people voluntarily went back to treatment.\u201dIf parents recognize any behaviors portrayed in \u201cTo the Bone,\u201d Ms. Gorove said: \u201cI would say immediately seek help. Don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t pass go, go to a doctor who knows eating disorders.\u201dTeddy Teece, 26, California. Former collegiate rower. There\u2019s a notion of \u2018Men don\u2019t have eating disorders, men don\u2019t have mental health issues.\u2019 I was a skeleton and a zombie but I made boats go fast and the coaches all applauded me.A lot of people think eating disorders or addictions are a choice and they make that assumption and then blame the individual: \u2018Why don\u2019t you go fix yourself?\u2019 It\u2019s much more complicated than that, it\u2019s a disease, and I hope that in five to 10 years from now people will look at mental injuries the same way they look at physical ones.Shamma Pepper Fox, 16, New YorkI am gay. I did not want my already awkward 14-year-old character to be mired by something as taboo and shameful as homosexuality. And, for all the crushes on girls I could muster up, I cannot control my sexuality.But my weight, well, that is something easily manipulated.Often people associate eating disorders with young women. But it is not unique to females, nor to queer males, like me. When not-talked-about and societally shamed, one cannot overcome such emotional struggles..Lucy Kelly, 21, New ZealandAfter a summer of being sexually abused and a year of bullying and being isolated by my peers, compounded by years of depression and anxiety, I became fixated on this goal of being the thinnest. I wanted to be so thin that I turned into a little girl again ... I wanted to be so thin I would disappear. Before I could begin to comprehend what was happening, it had grown like a disease I was completely powerless to control or stop.Shannon Wills, 23, San Diego My eating disorder began when I was 13 years old, and was not managed until I was 19. It began with anorexia, and I worked my way through various other eating disorders through high school. It sucked all of the joy out of my life \u2014 all of the personality out of my body ... But the minute my eating disorder developed, my voice was gone. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s what they really do; eating disorders steal your voice, steal the space that you occupy. I learned that I was not allowed to take up space, and that the best parts of me were the areas that I did not fill.Lauren Lopez, 27, Brooklyn, N.Y. My eating disorder started at 16, I\u2019m now 27. It was an endless, exhausting pursuit to disappear. I wanted to disperse into thin air ... I eventually spoke less, felt less, physically became less. Almost like a child.Anonymous, 61, MichiganI knew I was in trouble, although I was not willing to talk about it. And, even though my parents were concerned enough to take me to two doctors, it went undiagnosed. I began to binge and purge, my way of trying not to starve to death, but not willing or able to get back into healthy eating patterns. What I remember is an intense and overwhelming compulsive mental state, akin to addiction as I would imagine it.This was in the 1970s and it was not recognized as readily as it would be now.Misha, 25, Bayreuth, Germany My experience with the disorder was confusing, among other things. I grew up in India at a time when there was minimal public awareness or discourse about eating disorders and the myriad ways in which they ravage a person\u2019s body and mind ... People around me started discovering my secret years before I got better, but there was no socially acceptable way to get me professional help, so they didn\u2019t try.Kathy P, 36, Los Angeles Eating disorders are far from glamorous. You don\u2019t walk into a hospital and have Keanu Reeves waiting to console you. You feel like crap, smell like vomit, hide secrets, lose friends, lose hair, lose muscle mass, suffer from severe isolation and basically become a shell of your once happy, hungry self.Recovering both physically and emotionally from my eating disorder took me many years. The worst thing I did was spend years ignoring it and not talking about it, when I could\u2019ve been reaching out for professional help and personal support. Like many people with eating disorders, I never thought I could recover completely, but I am proud to say that it is possible, and I am proof of that.Laura, 24, Florida I want people to know that recovery is not a matter of willpower. And it certainly is not a matter of hearing an impassioned speech from a motivated therapist. As media consumers, we yearn for the redemption narrative \u2014 the ravaged girl who is jolted out of her self-destruction by the right words delivered with enough passion. But the reality is that eating disorders are a complex web that cannot be swept away in one fell swoop.Sondra Storm, 33, Oregon U.S. culture is so messed up around weight and food that recovery from an eating disorder requires almost superhuman resilience. Diet and weight loss are discussed constantly, foods are categorized into \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Employers increasingly have wellness programs that promote this kind of discussion at work. I am frequently complimented on my body and on what I eat by others. The compliments are always about how \u201chealthy\u201d I am. I am not healthy, I am underweight and have an eating disorder.Advertisement"}

I was out talking to the tomato plants this morning, watering them in the still, dank humidity just after dawn, willing them to continue to thrive. It was my intention to have that quiet experience power the rest of the day, to allow the memory to make bearable a workday commute in high-summer New York City. My urban pastoral: tomatoes as anti-anxiety meds.To do so anyway is our charge.

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Get Excited About Maintenance!", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIt\u2019s been a bad summer for maintenance, especially in New York. Last month Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, underscoring a problem that New York subway riders understand all too well: The M.T.A. relies heavily on emergency repairs because it does not conduct sufficient preventive upkeep. Likewise, in the wake of two recent derailments that caused major disruptions, Pennsylvania Station this month closed aging tracks for repairs and reduced the number of trains serving the station \u2014 another example of the costs of neglecting maintenance.Sadly, the neglect of maintenance is not limited to New York, public transit or this summer. All varieties of American infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, airports, sewers \u2014 are in decrepit condition. Lead poisons the water systems of Flint, Mich., and hundreds of other cities and towns across the nation. The American Society of Civil Engineers considers 17 percent of American dams to be \u201chigh hazard potential,\u201d including the one outside Oroville, Calif., that nearly collapsed in February.Why are we in this predicament? One obvious answer is that officials in federal, state and local government do not allocate the resources necessary for preventive maintenance. But their inaction is a symptom of a deeper problem, one that is too seldom discussed: Americans have an impoverished and immature conception of technology, one that fetishizes innovation as a kind of art and demeans upkeep as mere drudgery.When Americans talk about technology, they often use \u201cinnovation\u201d as a shorthand. But \u201cinnovation\u201d refers only to the very early phases of technological development and use. It also tends to narrow the scope of technology to digital gadgets of recent vintage: iPhones, social media apps and so on. A more expansive conception of technology would take into account the diverse array of tools, including subways and trains, that we humans use to help us reach our goals.While innovation \u2014 the social process of introducing new things \u2014 is important, most technologies around us are old, and for the smooth functioning of daily life, maintenance is more important. Statistics are difficult to come by, since American federal agencies do not account for maintenance costs in a standard way. But in the computer industry, software maintenance \u2014 that is, fixing bugs and distributing upgrades \u2014 can account for more than 60 percent of total costs. According to one study, roughly 70 percent of engineers work on maintaining and overseeing existing things rather than designing new ones.It\u2019s not just maintenance that our society fails to appreciate; it\u2019s also the maintainers themselves. We do not grant them high social status or high salaries. Typically, maintenance is a blue-collar occupation: mechanic, plumber, janitor, electrician. There are white-collar maintainers (like the I.T. crowd) and white-jacket maintainers (like dentists). But they, too, are not celebrated like the inventor.Once you notice this problem \u2014 innovation is exalted, maintenance devalued \u2014 you begin to see it everywhere. The entrepreneur and inventor Elon Musk, for example, announced on Thursday that he had been given \u201cverbal\u201d government approval for an underground transportation system between New York and Washington. He has also proposed a similar project that would revolutionize transportation in Los Angeles by creating an enormous system of underground traffic tunnels.Apart from the practical problem, in Los Angeles, of creating a tunnel system in a region known for geological instability, Mr. Musk\u2019s idea indulges a fantasy common among Silicon Valley types: that the best path forward is to scrap existing reality and start over from scratch. With urban transport, as with so many other areas of our mature industrial society, a clean slate is rarely a realistic option. We need to figure out better ways of preserving, improving and caring for what we have.Always eager for the photo-op and the exciting new announcement, politicians, too, prefer creating shiny new things to maintaining old, dingy ones. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York is an enthusiastic supporter of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, a proposed streetcar line that would cost many billions of dollars to build and run. But a recent report by the Transit Center, a public transportation advocacy group, estimates that New York City bus service could be greatly improved with relatively small costs and a few simple fixes like redesigning bus routes \u2014 giving the city far more bang for its buck.Unlike innovation, which has a cottage industry devoted to its study and cultivation, maintenance is not something we spend a lot of time trying to understand better. Perhaps if we thought harder about it, we would grant it the prestige and the funding it deserves.There is certainly a financial reward to greater understanding: Maintenance is big business. Giant industrial corporations like General Electric and Boeing make heavy investments in tools and procedures for predictive maintenance, since their success depends on the reliability of their products and the existence of orderly routines to follow when things break down. Even in the digital industries, where the gospel of innovation is sacrosanct, the kings of \u201cdisruption\u201d \u2014 Netflix, Amazon \u2014 keep their customers happy only through reliable and well-maintained data and distribution networks.To shift our focus from innovation to maintenance would also create an opportunity for greater political consensus. Maintenance is an area of public policy where conservatives and progressives should see eye to eye. The conservative tradition asks us to preserve what we have inherited from our ancestors, and the progressive tradition seeks to provide the greatest good for the greatest number. What better way to do this than to maintain the technologies bequeathed to us by past generations, and to recognize and reward the efforts of the maintainers who keep our society working?Andrew Russell is a professor of history and the dean of arts and sciences at SUNY Polytechnic Institute. Lee Vinsel is a professor in the department of science and technology in society at Virginia Tech.Advertisement"}

At the time, I was writing jokes for Adam Sandler for \u201cFunny People.\u201d I thought doing some stand-up to write for him would be good and I had a great time. I went back last year and did a few shows. Netflix happened to be at a midnight show. They asked me to do a special, and I said, \u201cO.K., give me a year.\u201dWhat\u2019s the Just for Laughs festival like?As a comedy nerd, the idea that there\u2019s a place you can go where there\u2019s an enormous amount of your favorite comedians all performing and you can jump around to different shows is just crazy. As a fan, I ran around and caught Andy Dick, the \u201cOh, Hello\u201d show, Maria Bamford. I brought my daughter who was about to run off to college and we had the best time.How are the audiences, compared with other places?I thought they were so warm and excited about comedy that it felt like the perfect place to tape a special. I like getting out of major cities like New York and talking about my life, show business and politics in a place where people are watching it from a distance.People who come are so receptive to comedy. That made it fun and allows you to experiment more.How do you characterize Montreal\u2019s sense of humor?I don\u2019t know if cities are funny, but you definitely feel the vibe of certain cities or people who go to comedy shows. When you play San Francisco it\u2019s different than Philadelphia. It\u2019s a little more raucous in Philadelphia. There\u2019s a fun, aggressive energy in the crowd in Philly and very attentive energy in San Francisco. Montreal feels like a very smart, warm, enthusiastic crowd. There seems to be some sense of the absurd. I also think because Hollywood is so far away that they seem pretty amused by any story I told about the ridiculous things that happened there.How does Cirque du Soleil fit into the comedy scene in Montreal?I\u2019m such a fan of Cirque du Soleil. My daughters are 19 and 14 and we\u2019ve probably seen 80 percent of all the shows they\u2019ve ever put on. When we travel around the world promoting things, we try to see the Cirque du Soleil show in that city. It\u2019s scary and funny and beautiful and experimental. A city that creates and embraces, that is the best kind of city.What did you most enjoy when you were in Montreal last?Advertisement"}

In the scene, you can see Okja pushing people and breaking things. But her intention is not to attack these people. What you see is the character who is most scared and the most fearful is Okja. It\u2019s an unintentional chaotic mess caused by a shy, introverted character who doesn\u2019t want this to happen.Since the character Okja is a computer generated character, what was the stand-in for her on set?We called it Stuffy. It was a soft plastic figure but the shape and size was precisely the same as Okja. Our animation supervisor was holding Stuffy and controlling it. But in the moment in this scene where Okja crashes into everything in the shop, we used a minivan, then we replaced that with Okja in post production. It was a really crazy moment on the set where hundreds of crew members watched the minivan crash into our precious props.How many takes of that did you do?One (laughs). But with two cameras.How did you come to use \u201cAnnie\u2019s Song\u201d by John Denver in the scene?I never planned it when I was preparing the movie. But when I was a little kid my older brother was a huge fan of that song. He repeated that song, humming and would keep playing, playing, playing it. At that time, I was a little bit sick of that song. But it\u2019s a nostalgic song. And suddenly, during the editing process when the moment of the slow motion begins, suddenly I was reminded of the song.Advertisement"}

The laws remain murky, but the government is unlikely to prosecute you, and the streaming video services have shown no desire to go after customers.But so far, Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming companies have indicated that they\u2019re either quietly accepting of the practice or possibly even cheering it on as a marketing strategy.In 2016, two court decisions led some to conclude that password sharing is illegal, but whether the decisions apply to your Netflix account remains in dispute.In the dissent, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the decision could be applied to everyday password sharing.\u201cIf we interpret \u2018without authorization\u2019 in a way that includes common practices like password sharing, millions of our citizens would become potential federal criminals overnight,\u201d he wrote.But the majority opinion disputed the sentiment, dismissing fears as hypotheticals while writing that \u201cthis appeal is not about password sharing.\u201d Much of the media coverage focused on the dissenting opinion.Legal experts have said both cases leave a lot of uncertainty.\u201cA lot of times you get legal clarity when there are cases,\u201d said Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University who represented Power Ventures. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have cases because the government doesn\u2019t prosecute password-sharing cases, or hasn\u2019t, and the companies have not brought lawsuits either. So we just don\u2019t know.\u201dJamie Williams, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the organization is among those seeking clarity from the Supreme Court.\u201cAs a technical matter, it is illegal,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cWill the federal government prosecute you for it? Probably not.\u201dNetflix, HBO, Hulu and Amazon declined to comment for this story. But in past statements, the companies have indicated they\u2019re not too worried about the trend.\u201cPassword sharing is something you have to learn to live with, because there\u2019s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s no bright line, and we\u2019re doing fine as is.\u201d\u201cShould it become a big number, we will deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will change the number of concurrent streams that are available. But right now, the number really isn\u2019t significant.\u201dOne reason the companies appear hesitant to police the passwords harder: Freeloaders could become the next customers.\u201cWe could crack down on it, but you wouldn\u2019t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief financial officer David Wells said in September, according to Reuters.In both cases, there might be a lingering sense that if you like the content enough to be watching it, you ought to pay a bit of money so the creators can keep creating things like it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Leader Who Rebuilt Time Warner Empire Prepares an Exit", "Date": "2017-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeffrey L. Bewkes championed acclaimed series like \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cSex and the City\u201d at HBO, salvaged Time Warner from its disastrous merger with AOL and publicly battled his rival media mogul Rupert Murdoch three years ago to fend off a hostile takeover.Since Mr. Bewkes took over as chief executive in 2008, Time Warner has delivered the highest stock market returns of the big media conglomerates. Now, after a 38-year career at Time Warner during which he shaped it into one of the most formidable media companies of its day, he is preparing for his final act.If regulators approve AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner, two major changes are expected: Mr. Bewkes plans to leave as chief executive following a transition period, and the Time Warner name is likely to be eliminated, as AT&T subsumes the company\u2019s assets: HBO, the Turner cable network brands and the Warner Bros. film and television studios.It would all make for a smooth, perhaps even glamorous exit for Mr. Bewkes, and certainly a lucrative one, given that he stands to earn as much as $95 million if the merger is completed and he leaves the company. But there is one big storm cloud hovering over the deal: the Trump White House.In his understated manner, Mr. Bewkes said he was not worried about the White House interfering in the deal. \u201cI know people say things like that,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is true.\u201dMr. Bewkes said that the review of the proposed merger was an antitrust analysis of whether the combination would enhance or harm competition, and that Time Warner\u2019s programming \u2014 including CNN\u2019s aggressive reporting on Mr. Trump \u2014 was not relevant.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s hostility toward CNN has thrust the network into the spotlight as the review of the deal continues. The issue of CNN\u2019s editorial independence arose late last month at a dinner Mr. Bewkes attended with AT&T board members in Dallas.If Time Warner is folded into AT&T, it will mark the end of an era, for both an executive who rose through the corporate ranks after starting as an HBO staff member in 1979 \u2014 using a stack of boxes as a desk \u2014 and a media conglomerate. Over the past century, dating to its roots in Time Inc., the company ushered in a series of innovations, including the first talking feature film, the first premium cable network, the first 24-hour news network and, on Mr. Bewkes\u2019s watch, a push toward video-on-demand and other digital offerings.\u201cIt is the legacy that I have been the steward of,\u201d Mr. Bewkes, 65, said. \u201cThat is why we thought, \u2018We have got to do the next step.\u2019\u201dIn an industry filled with larger-than-life executives, driven to expand their empires, Mr. Bewkes developed a reputation as a cerebral, private figure with a dry sense of humor, who was focused on creating value for investors. He did so by spinning off Time Warner Cable in 2009, AOL the same year and the Time Inc. magazine division in 2014.What was left was a focused TV and film company. Mr. Bewkes invested in ambitious programming, including original series on HBO like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d sports deals like the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and big bets on major film franchises like the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies and the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy.He also pushed toward a streaming future, evangelizing his \u201cTV Everywhere\u201d video-on-demand initiative and creating HBO\u2019s stand-alone streaming service.As a result, Time Warner was positioned as an attractive takeover target.Mr. Bewkes\u2019s success can be attributed to \u201cbeing very, very rational in his decision making and, on the other hand, having a real flair for the creative,\u201d said Michael Lynton, a longtime media executive who was at Time Warner when it merged with AOL. \u201cThat is a rare combination.\u201dThere is no question that Mr. Bewkes has delivered value to shareholders. A $1,000 investment in Time Warner stock when he became chief executive in 2008 would be worth about $4,400 today.\u201cThere are different kinds of legacies,\u201d said Richard D. Parsons, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive from 2002 to 2007. \u201cThere are people who build things that last and last and last, that would be Ted Turner. His legacy is CNN. And there are people who create value for those who invested in him, and that is going to be Jeff.\u201dShould the deal with AT&T be completed, attention will turn to Time Warner\u2019s properties as new corporate owners try to manage a business that sometimes brings controversy.Mr. Bewkes said that the heads of Turner, Warner Bros. and HBO \u2014 all of whom had been viewed as candidates to succeed him \u2014 are expected to continue in their roles. The job of managing those assets, now Mr. Bewkes\u2019s role, is expected to be assumed by John Stankey, the chief executive of AT&T\u2019s entertainment group.AT&T\u2019s priority, Mr. Bewkes said, will be to find new ways to present programming to audiences. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they think their focus is about what to do about HBO\u2019s programming schedule or how to mess around with the Warner show slate,\u201d he added.That issue arose at the dinner last month in Dallas with AT&T board members. When the discussion turned to CNN, Mr. Bewkes said, he supported Mr. Zucker\u2019s handling of the retracted story. He argued that CNN was a successful and growing business, citing its global news operations and its push toward mobile platforms. CNN brings in more than $1 billion a year in profit.\u201cIt is a huge achievement of the whole company under Jeff\u2019s leadership,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in the interview.Asked for his reaction to comments by the president \u2014 especially those attacking CNN \u2014 Mr. Bewkes said that he did not think they were relevant to how the network covered news or the review of the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner.\u201cI think statements out of high political office ought to be considered statements,\u201d he said.Mr. Bewkes said Mr. Zucker continued to have the support of Time Warner management.\u201cWe have always been a public-trust journalism company,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in the interview. \u201cWe have all kinds of critics that say we failed.\u2019\u2019 He alluded to CNN\u2019s having been criticized during the campaign for its extensive coverage of Mr. Trump and being attacked by Mr. Trump for coverage he deemed unfair.\u201cWe either elected the president by giving him airtime \u2014 when in fact nobody else would come,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cor we have been trying to not elect him by doing something with an agenda, which I hope isn\u2019t the case.\u201dAs he prepared to move on, Mr. Bewkes said he had few regrets. The $850 million acquisition of the social networking site Bebo was a flop, he acknowledged. And he said the company should have bought Netflix in its early years and taken full control of Comedy Central when it had the chance.Mr. Bewkes jokingly lamented the decision to allow Time Warner Cable to hold on to the Time Warner name, which has led cable customers to call him with complaints about their service. (He said he still received about 10 a day.)Mr. Bewkes said he was focused for the moment on closing the deal with AT&T and, until then, continuing to manage Time Warner. He said he was not sure what he would do next.\u201cIf I was following the crowd, I guess I would just run for president like everybody else,\u201d he joked, before adding that at 65 he was not in a rush to take on another job like his current one.\u201cHow could you do something like this, after this?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is great.\u201dAn article on Monday about Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, erroneously attributed a distinction to the company. It introduced a weekly magazine, but not the first one. (The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines started before the company was founded.)David Gelles and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018GLOW\u2019 Season 1: Watched It All? Let\u2019s Talk", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLOWThis is a recap of the entire first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cGLOW.\u201d\u201cGLOW,\u201d the delightful Netflix comedy about an all-women\u2019s pro-wrestling league in the 1980s, spent its entire first season inching toward opening night. It\u2019s time for some color commentary on those 10 episodes.In the red corner, it\u2019s our antiheroine, Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), an out-of-work actress in Los Angeles who can\u2019t stop sabotaging herself. She reads men\u2019s parts in auditions because they\u2019re juicier. She pays for an acting class, but she has to make two meals out of one takeout taco. She sleeps with the husband of her beautiful best friend, Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin) \u2014 twice \u2014 and cringes as he marvels that she\u2019s so \u201creal.\u201d\u201cGLOW\u201d is as warm as its title suggests, and its emotional center is the rift between these two characters. You don\u2019t have to dig too deep to understand the unconscious motivations behind Ruth\u2019s betrayal. A former soap star who retired to become a full-time wife and mother, Debbie has already had and given up the only thing Ruth wants: an acting career. Although Ruth nearly wrecks her chances of becoming a Gorgeous Lady of Wrestling by trying too hard to please GLOW\u2019s cranky director, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron), her advantage over Debbie is her hunger for work. Each woman is fragile in her own way, and in between all the laughs the show offers, it\u2019s painful to watch a friendship that initially feels so intimate devolve into a physical fight, then a (thematically appropriate) Cold War, and finally an uneasy truce.Sam, another wounded veteran of the entertainment industry, is a director who made B-movies in the \u201970s. He\u2019s also a character we\u2019ve seen before: the grumpy, jaded male coach who gets his groove back with some help from the irrepressible young women he was reluctant to mentor. But Maron deepens the role by exposing both the director\u2019s self-loathing and his genuine desire to make great movies (even if most people find his films so bad, they\u2019re funny). When he breaks up with the sexy, flighty Rhonda (Kate Nash), he\u2019s shocked to learn that she actually liked him.In a season that runs just over five hours, \u201cGLOW\u201d does a remarkable job of developing its many supporting characters. Carmen (Britney Young), the shy daughter of a wrestling legend who practically disowns her for joining the league, comes out of her shell and wins over her dad as the hulking hero Machu Picchu. A washed-up stuntwoman who has lots of history with Sam, Cherry Bang (Sydelle Noel) takes refuge from a disappointing career in a steamy, supportive marriage. Sheila (Gayle Rankin), an outcast who dresses in ripped-up fur and identifies as a \u201cshe-wolf,\u201d retracts her claws after her co-stars throw her a roller-skating birthday party. The teenage Justine (Britt Baron) isn\u2019t obsessed with Sam and his work because she has a crush on him, as he believes, but because she\u2019s his daughter. Her story line might have come off as hacky if her secret hadn\u2019t been so carefully revealed in Episode 9, a standout half-hour directed by Lynn Shelton (\u201cYour Sister\u2019s Sister\u201d), one of indie film\u2019s subtlest storytellers.Although \u201cGLOW\u201d is lighter than \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d Netflix\u2019s other series for which Jenji Kohan acts as an executive producer (Kohan also created \u201cOrange\u201d), the show is serious about addressing wrestling\u2019s history of racism. Bored by Sam\u2019s high-concept script, GLOW\u2019s slightly creepy, rich-kid benefactor, Bash (Chris Lowell), assigns new characters based on stereotypes. Jenny Chey (Ellen Wong) becomes a martial artist named Fortune Cookie, while Arthie Premkumar (Sunita Mani), a bookish Indian student, is cast as an Arab terrorist. There\u2019s a tense scene in the finale in which Arthie steps into the ring and gets pelted with spit, beer and slurs, and the bigotry wrestling exploits suddenly hits home. A few minutes later, Tamm\u00e9 (Kia Stevens), a middle-aged black woman who\u2019s been rechristened Welfare Queen, unexpectedly takes out Liberty Belle and wins the crown \u2014 and exacts symbolic revenge on Reagan-era America on behalf of black Americans and the poor. It\u2019s just a shame that none of these three characters gets her own story line off the mat.At risk of reading too much subtext into a fun show, \u201cGLOW\u201d seems designed to compare the well-worn tropes that wrestling cherishes with the authentic relationships and dialogue that fuel good TV comedy. Best friends torn apart by jealousy, a burnout who discovers he\u2019s a father, directors who bed their actresses \u2014 none of these stories are new. There\u2019s nothing novel, either, about a ragtag band of performers who pull together to put on a great show on a shoestring budget, as the wrestlers do in the finale.It\u2019s what happens after that match, in the last moments of the season, that makes \u201cGLOW\u201d special. \u201cYou wanna grab a drink?\u201d Ruth asks Debbie. \u201cNo,\u201d she replies, denying Ruth \u2014 and us \u2014 the tidy ending we crave. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201dBonus Round:\u2022 Marc Maron and Betty Gilpin, whose performance as Debbie plays up the vulnerability of a character who could have come off as merely catty, are the cast\u2019s clear standouts. But Alison Brie deftly balances brittleness with determination, and the entire ensemble is lovable. Who\u2019s your favorite wrestler? I was especially charmed by Britney Young, who makes it impossible not to root for her sweet character, Carmen, and by Gayle Rankin, whose \u201cSheila the She-Wolf\u201d registers as more of a scared loner than a full-on freak.\u2022 \u201cGLOW\u201d is thrillingly frank about women\u2019s bodies and sexuality. There\u2019s talk of maxi-pads, synchronized menstrual cycles and period sex. In a conversation about Cherry\u2019s miscarriage, Sam coins the memorable euphemism \u201cwomb goof.\u201d How did you feel about the way the show handled Ruth\u2019s abortion, in Episode 8? I loved that Sam came along to inject some humor into the waiting-room scene, and the episode\u2019s final shot, in which Ruth stares at the clouds painted on a single tile of the clinic\u2019s ceiling, gave me chills.\u2022 Speaking of Ruth and Sam, \u201cGLOW\u201d seems to be setting them up for a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they. First they hated each other, now they make each other laugh and strangers keep mistaking them for a couple. While I\u2019d like to see Ruth get a love interest, I\u2019m not sure it should be the self-destructive boss who\u2019s twice her age.\u2022 As far as I\u2019m concerned, Episode 6 is the season\u2019s only major misfire. Ruth\u2019s visit to a family bris with Gregory the motel proprietor feels unlikely, and for a show that prides itself on deconstructing stereotypes, it paints Russian Jewish immigrants with a pretty broad brush.\u2022 \u201cGLOW\u201d hasn\u2019t been renewed for a second season yet, but the finale leaves us with plenty of questions: Will Ruth and Debbie ever fully repair their friendship? How will Arthie handle the hatred her character inspires? Can Sam sober up and become a decent father to Justine? Will he and Bash get any blowback from the network for Welfare Queen\u2019s symbolic victory? Will the league survive to fight another day?Advertisement"}

They\u2019re entertaining when diluted by the company of others, enjoyable as long as you part before you remember how exhausting they are, how everything needs to be about them.In Netflix\u2019s \u201cFriends From College,\u201d arriving on Friday, nearly everyone is that friend. And well before the end of the eight-episode season, they and the series have overstayed their welcome.This ensemble cringe comedy centers on the marriage of Lisa (Cobie Smulders), a lawyer, and Ethan (Keegan-Michael Key), a writer of well-reviewed and less-well-purchased novels. They\u2019ve decided to move from Chicago to New York, which puts them back in the orbit of their old group of pals from Harvard.They end up crashing on the couch of Marianne (Jae Suh Park), a flighty, free-spirited actress, and catching up on their old friendships, which have become more competitive and complicated. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 20 years of grievances built up and ready to explode,\u201d Lisa says.Little does she know about the biggest time bomb: Ethan has been having a two-decade affair with Sam (Annie Parisse), trysting with her when she visits Chicago. She\u2019s also married, and once Ethan arrives in New York, they agree it can\u2019t go on.It does, of course, maybe because the dalliance returns Ethan and Sam to a time when their possibilities seemed limitless. In bed, they\u2019re still 20. In the real world, biological clocks are ticking (Lisa and Ethan are undergoing expensive fertility treatments) as are career ones. \u201cI am 40 years old,\u201d Ethan says. \u201cThe drawbridge is going up.\u201dSet to a 1990s soundtrack \u2014 Cornershop, Liz Phair, Oasis \u2014 \u201cFriends From College\u201d is about curdled nostalgia, the dark side of those \u201cWanna Feel Old?\u201d online listicles.Created by Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco (who are, like their characters, married Harvard grads), \u201cFriends From College\u201d has moments of funny slapstick and observational comedy. But what promises to be an appealing adult relationship sitcom becomes a sour story of self-absorption and infidelity. Think of it as \u201cHow I Cheated on Your Mother.\u201dIt would be too simplistic to say that the problem is unlikable characters. Flawed, abrasive and selfish characters are responsible for some of the best TV in the past several years \u2014 \u201cGirls,\u201d for instance, or \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst.\u201dBut you need some payoff, some insight, for putting in the time with them. No one here is unlikable in any interesting way. They\u2019re just aging and dissatisfied with what life has given them (which, for most of them, has been plenty, materially at least). Yet the show\u2019s vantage point leaves little space to appreciate it if you find the characters insufferable.The cast members compensate by leaning into their characters with manic energy. There\u2019s an extended set piece in which Ethan and Max play tennis, grunting so showily that it drives their neighbors on the court batty, which is often the experience of watching. (Billy Eichner plays Max\u2019s reserved, long-suffering partner, Felix, and when Billy Eichner gives the most subdued performance on your show, that is saying something.)The result is a comedy-drama whose comedy is grating and whose drama doesn\u2019t really engage with its essential sadness. To its credit, \u201cFriends From College\u201d is conscious of how tough its core group can be to take. But what it does best \u2014 reproducing the experience of going out with an insular gang whose members aren\u2019t as clever or adorable as they think \u2014 is exactly the sort of thing you try to avoid by staying home and watching Netflix.Advertisement"}

My weight fluctuated by 10 to 20 pounds each semester. I would drink to forget and in my drunken blurs I leaned far too heavily and unfairly on friends who were just as lost and scared as I was. During what felt like the worst period of my depression, I took a health and wellness class my junior year. In that class, we discussed nutrition, healthy relationships and conflict resolution skills. We even had a unit on \u201cstress management and resiliency.\u201d But we never talked about mental illness or how to recognize or treat it.And the truth is that everyone can benefit from learning about mental health. It shouldn\u2019t scare us; it should light a fire under us to ensure that people across the United States and the world can recognize these illnesses like they would high cholesterol or asthma or any other health condition.We should not be afraid to put a name to these illnesses. Chester Bennington wasn\u2019t. We should not be afraid to come forward or tell our stories about our struggles with these issues. We should be open to learning the symptoms and the signs of mental health disorders. We should encourage everyone (not just those with mental health issues) to seek therapy because therapy is good for your mind just as exercise is good for your body.If it was not for my family and friends, who knows what would have happened to me. But I do know that if I had learned about depression and anxiety, or even that therapy is an option, when I was 11, I wouldn\u2019t be staring at my faded scars as I write this. We must push the conversation about mental illness forward whether it be in the classrooms of public schools or with our families and friends.

Harriet Harman, a Labour Party member of Parliament, said the \u201clid has been lifted\u201d on pay discrimination, citing an \u201cold boys\u2019 network where they are feathering their own nests and each other\u2019s, and there is discrimination and unfairness against women.\u201dThe BBC has long faced criticism from commercial rivals who regard its prominent position as a bar to their ambitions.Mr. Hall said the BBC was now competing for talent not only with broadcasters like ITV and Sky, but also with online media giants like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.He cited research showing that BBC users overwhelmingly agreed that the organization should employ top actors and journalists \u201ceven if it means paying the market rate.\u201dHuw Edwards, one of the main anchors of the BBC\u2019s flagship \u201cNews at Ten,\u201d earned \u00a3550,000 to \u00a3599,999; Fiona Bruce, another main anchor, made about \u00a3200,000 less.\u201cThe right has for a long time targeted the BBC as wasteful and inefficient, as part of its free-market agenda,\u201d said Tom Mills, a sociologist at Aston University in Birmingham, England, and the author of \u201cThe BBC: Myth of a Public Service.\u201d Top salaries at the broadcaster increased in the 1990s, he said, partly in response to pressure to make the BBC more commercial.He said the BBC should consider a ceiling on salaries, perhaps based on a multiple of the salary of its lowest-paid workers. The high salaries, he said, contribute to a growing public feeling that the broadcaster is elitist.Reporting was contributed by Stephen Farrell, Peter Robins, Des Shoe, Amie Tsang and Michael Wolgelenter.Advertisement"}

It helps him create his comic characters and neatly encapsulates the absurdism and detailed characterization that distinguish his style.\u201cAll of his characterizations are both demented and affectionate,\u201d the comedian and actor Billy Eichner said. \u201cHe has a bone-deep knowledge of who these people are.\u201d\u201cMatthew was definitely written for Cole, and since then he\u2019s become an integral part of the show,\u201d said Julie Klausner, the series\u2019 creator, co-star and main writer. \u201cI call him our Kramer because he comes in, says something insane and just disappears. It\u2019s been a challenge to use Matthew sparingly.\u201d (Ms. Klausner did give him a juicy gift in the new season, casting Vanessa Williams as Matthew\u2019s ex-wife and writing them a sex scene she described as \u201cwackadoo.\u201d)Mr. Escola, who is as self-effacing in life as he is confident onstage, doesn\u2019t appear to mind the limited screen time, noting, \u201cI would much rather be in something for two minutes and have it be great than do those supporting-character parts that are like, \u2018How did the date go?\u2019\u201dBesides, these two minutes add up: Mr. Escola was wig-browsing after a day spent shooting Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d for which he plays Lola Kirke\u2019s roommate; he recently was on Netflix\u2019s \u201cGirlboss\u201d and will appear on TruTV\u2019s \u201cAt Home With Amy Sedaris\u201d in the fall.Not bad for someone who left Clatskanie, Ore., when he was 18 to follow a boyfriend to New York, promptly got dumped, then dropped out of Marymount Manhattan College after a year. And still, that\u2019s better than what he left behind. \u201cI grew up in a trailer until I was 5 or 6, and then my dad chased us out with a gun,\u201d Mr. Escola said. \u201cWe moved in with my grandma for a while and eventually to government housing.\u201dWhile Mr. Escola is now multiplying TV appearances, it is still best to catch him in less controlled settings, where his impish humor and willingness to do just about anything can fully bloom. A large part of what makes him so subversive is the way he looks utterly innocent while perpetrating assaults on propriety.\u201cHe had to go to Duane Reade before every show and buy diapers,\u201d said Scott Wittman, who was a co-creator of \u201cRock Bottom\u201d and directed it. \u201cHe\u2019s a great low comedian and a sophisticated satirist \u2014 that\u2019s a great combo platter.\u201dIf there is an old-fashioned variety show feeling to his work, that is the point for someone whose sensibility lands closer to Carol Burnett than to \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d \u201cAll I listen to are bootlegs of dead ladies\u2019 cabaret shows, like Dorothy Loudon, and some not dead,\u201d Mr. Escola said. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s been on Merv Griffin, I\u2019ve heard their cabaret show. I\u2019m not so much into contemporary Broadway stuff. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that \u2014 I do not want hate from fans of Pasek and Paul, who I love actually.\u201dMr. Escola still has a ways to go before matching Ms. Burnett\u2019s expansive repertoire, but he\u2019s diligently working on it. One of the wigs he bought was for yet another character, whom he described as \u201can author who had one book in the \u201980s that was really big, about eating right for your star sign.\u201d He glanced at a display of beards and mustaches, and breezily dismissed them: \u201cThings I\u2019ll never need.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Ozark\u2019 on Netflix: This Lake Has Hidden Depths", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the end of the first episode, he is wide-awake \u2014 he has witnessed multiple murders and is moving his family to Missouri\u2019s Lake of the Ozarks in a last-ditch effort to placate the drug lord he has been laundering money for in secret. His new mission: \u201cClean\u201d $8 million by the end of the summer, or everyone dies. Also, parry the F.B.I. officers, local cops and crime clans that plague him along the way.This primary narrative makes for a thriller that checks many boxes of the genre: Marty, an Everyman dropped into a fraught situation, negotiates mortal jeopardy and an inexorably ticking clock as he wriggles out of one perilous situation after another (after another, after another).\u201cThere are no tricks to it,\u201d said Mr. Bateman, who also directed four episodes and is an executive producer of this show. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rely on our ability to make it feel authentic and raw, and to get the audience into that vicarious place.\u201dBut beneath its choppy crime-drama surface, \u201cOzark\u201d explores deeper issues.It\u2019s a middle-class nightmare amped to the extreme \u2014 in a blink everything you\u2019ve worked for is gone, your stability shattered and the future full of peril. The show also suggests, in flashbacks depicting Marty\u2019s descent into money laundering, that the line between ambition and felonious greed is thinner than we might like to believe.Early in the production process for \u201cOzark,\u201d the showrunner Chris Mundy explained the general story to Netflix. Then he did it again.\u201cI said \u2018I\u2019m going to lay this out to you twice \u2014 once on a pure plot thriller level, and once on an emotional family level,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we thought of it as both things.\u201dAs much as it is a story of a man trying to scramble out of a life-threatening bind, \u201cOzark\u201d is equally about a fractured family that is forced to reconnect. The early moments find the marriage between Marty and Wendy on the rocks and their children absorbed in their own melodramas. Their daughter, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz), is a classic teen, resentful and lost in her phone. The son, Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) is quirkier, and might have darker inclinations.\u201cFor us, the big question of the season was, can this family stay together somehow?\u201d Mr. Mundy said.\u201cWe thought, why don\u2019t we take this on a trip where the familial bond, and what these children are capable of, are actually benefited by what they\u2019ve gone through rather than decimated by it?\u201d he said.Elsewhere on the lake, assumptions about families and class are similarly subverted. An extended clan of petty crooks is overseen by one of its youngest members, a teenage girl. Perhaps the warmest relationship on the show is a marriage between two other local criminals, a pair of murderous heroin dealers.These dynamics get at how families can function as both liabilities and sources of strength, and at their fundamentally esoteric nature. They are really only understood from the inside, even as the members can be mysterious to one another.\u201cThey all have secrets, and they\u2019re all going to learn a whole lot about each other,\u201d Ms. Linney said.\u201cWhen you hear the word \u2018Ozark,\u2019 there\u2019s this immediate perception of what you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Mr. Dubuque said.\u201d But to make it interesting, you\u2019ve got to stand that on its head.\u201dThe annual summer influx of tourist cash also made it an ideal setting for a story about money laundering. (The series\u2019s 10 episodes were shot partially at the title lake but primarily in Atlanta.)\u201cHere\u2019s an area you just don\u2019t see on television,\u201d he said. But \u201cthe one thing I stressed was, you can\u2019t make these people stereotypes.\u201dMarty, the arrogant Chicago financial expert, is consistently thwarted by locals who are smarter than he assumes, with schemes of their own. \u201cHe makes a really bad miscalculation in what he perceives that environment\u2019s going to be, and his ability to manipulate it,\u201d Mr. Bateman said.This story about urbanites confronting a heartland culture they don\u2019t understand coincidentally captures a dynamic that has received plenty of attention since Donald J. Trump won the presidency. Initial \u201cOzark\u201d scripts were written long before the election. But Mr. Bateman allowed that the parallels between \u201ca pseudo-intellectual guy who thinks that he can go down to the sticks and big-city these simple folk\u201d and President Trump\u2019s critics, flabbergasted by his victory, \u201cweren\u2019t lost on us.\u201d\u201cThese people are not in a cosmopolitan, metropolitan, \u2018progressive\u2019 society, and they are to be reckoned with,\u201d Mr. Bateman said. \u201cThey have a different set of ideas and rules about the way things are done.\u201dThe filmmaking reinforces the themes \u2014 in one scene in the pilot, directed by Mr. Bateman, the camera pulls away dramatically to isolate family on a rocky cliff, suggesting what they\u2019re up against. But the overarching metaphor actually posits the newcomers as the interlopers bringing chaos to a stable environment. At one point, Jonah watches a documentary about the European starling, and how it wreaked havoc upon its introduction to North America. (The Byrde family, get it?)\u201cThat came out of the idea that this family was an invasive species,\u201d Mr. Mundy said \u201cIf they\u2019d never come in, think of people who would still be alive, whose businesses would be fine.\u201d\u201cThey disrupted, without knowing it, a whole ecosystem,\u201d he added.But amid all the carnage there is a simpler and perhaps encouraging point, in these divided times, about the ultimate fruitlessness of clinging to regional or any other prejudices.\u201cYou\u2019ve got highly intelligent people everywhere in the country, and you\u2019ve got remarkably stupid people everywhere in the country,\u201d Mr. Dubuque said. \u201cIt\u2019s not geographically specific.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rural Resilience After a Devastating Flood", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 17______Was this really the same place that had been devastated by flooding a few months ago after Cyclone Debbie?First, I searched for images and video from the flooding just to confirm I was in the right place, and sure enough, there was the central business district, under muddy water. Where I stood, near a truck selling fresh meat pies, had been swimming in sediment just 13 weeks earlier.Crossing a bridge over the now-calm river that had overflowed, I wandered into a mental health agency figuring someone there could give me a sense of the town\u2019s recovery.There a half dozen people (the ones at the top of this newsletter) gathered around a table of food. They told me I\u2019d stumbled upon the first meeting of the Flood Survivors Social Support Group, a new informal drop-in session for people in need of assistance because of the disaster.\u201cThere\u2019s formal support but not very much informal help,\u201d said Sarah McCormick, 41, one of the group\u2019s founders. \u201cThere\u2019s still people who \u2014 even after the cut off dates for aid \u2014 are only now getting their heads around things.\u201dThat morning, for example, a man named Walter had come in asking about the free mattress program set up by the local Catholic Diocese. About 1,500 mattresses had already been given out but Walter still didn\u2019t have a place to sleep, and needed one. Ms. McCormick said she\u2019d be calling on his behalf to work it out.Alongside the mattresses, people donated clothing and money flowed in as well. A team of chaplains are still doing regular house calls to check on families\u2019 spiritual and emotional needs. There was a program to give people new refrigerators and other appliances.Ms. McCormick and the other volunteers made clear that there was also a fair amount of frustration. One insurer seemed to have included a clause in its contracts that allowed it to avoid paying certain claims. Some residential property owners seemed to have received more government help than others, which led to some grumbling. The group also estimated that 15 to 20 percent of businesses were still closed, including some banks.Still, walking through town, eyeing the marks on utility poles showing the high-water mark from previous floods, it was hard not to notice the strength of the recovery. I\u2019ve covered hurricanes in Florida and earthquakes in Haiti and Mexico. Rarely have I seen such a full revival so quickly.At least in Lismore, Australia\u2019s overall wealth and community can-do spirit seem to have created a dynamic of rapid resilience. In the United States and other countries I have worked in, it\u2019s easier to fall from the middle class to destitution, especially in rural areas that struggle with some of the same agricultural churn as Lismore \u2014 where timber has died, dairy is dying and the macadamia industry can only do so much.Even the support group seemed torn between advocating for improvement, and appreciating the capacity to rebuild.\u201cYou do get positives along with the negatives,\u201d said Doug Ribley, 72, a lay minister with the Anglican Church here. \u201cWhen a store reopens, it gets out on social media to go out and support them, and we do. There\u2019s just a lot more interaction in the community.\u201dIs what I saw in Lismore typical?Now here\u2019s my weekly roundup of New York Times stories, and a recommendation from my recent travels \u2014 also drawn from readers, like you!__________________Nestled into a very small town up in the hills about 20 minutes drive out of Byron, it\u2019s an oasis of fine Japanese cooking founded by two Japanese entrepreneurs who just opened a new outpost in Beijing. The sushi specials, the teriyaki \u2014 everything really \u2014 was fantastic, at least as good as what could be found in Sydney or Melbourne.\u201cIt used to be popular just for local people,\u201d Kaz Saito, one of the managers, told me. \u201cNow they are telling others.\u201dOnward.Advertisement"}

A few quick clicks on the app may be all it takes to help make your home network more secure.*Maximum wireless data rate is derived from IEEE standards 802.11 specifications. Actual data throughput and range may vary as a result of network conditions and environmental factors including volume of network traffic, building materials and construction, obstacles and interference.

For example, he explains, although some routers update themselves or prompt users to update manually to receive the latest security updates and other enhancements, fewer IoT devices do so, making them more vulnerable to attacks.\u00a0Since Norton Core monitors internet traffic flowing to and from IoT devices, anything that deviates from the norm sends up a red flag.

The company updates its definitions of known viruses and other threats several times a day. Norton Core references these definitions, thanks to the accompanying Norton Security Plus subscription, in order to spot attacks.Norton Core, with its own regularly updated firmware, fortifies security software on PCs, laptops, tablets and phones by continually scanning for malware, intrusions, and even spam to catch threats before they reach devices on the network. Just in case, however, Norton Core also comes with a subscription to Norton Core Security software that can be installed on an unlimited number of connected personal PCs, Macs and Android and iOS devices.This layered approach to security is practiced by major corporations and is seen by experts as increasingly important for the home as well, according to Haley. \u201cIf you have security on your router and on your desktop,\u201d Haley explains, \u201cthat would be layered security and you would be following best practices as done in almost every business of any size in the world.\u201dOur children, who are often glued to their device screens, are simultaneously a risk and at risk. They may be particularly vulnerable to clicking on the wrong links and accidentally viewing inappropriate material. Their time online can also be difficult to manage as connected devices proliferate throughout the house.Norton Core handles these concerns \u2014 security from a home network standpoint and the need to keep kids safe on the internet. Using the Norton Core app, parents can set daily time limits on screen time, set bedtime schedules, activate content filters and more. This gives parents flexibility to manage internet content and time spent online, while helping families to plan better and enjoy their time together.Not only is the router\u2019s firmware updated, but so too are content filters that prevent children seeing inappropriate material or accessing potentially dangerous sites. The filters are intended only as guides, however. The app allows parents to selectively allow or block access to individual websites and other material as they see fit, giving them full control over their children\u2019s internet experience.When you buy a new car, a piece of jewelry, or new furniture, you may reassess your home\u2019s physical security. Is the garage locked down? Do you now need a home security system? Now, say experts, it\u2019s time to apply this kind of assessment to the digital home.In the digital sphere, the value of our data (to us and to hackers) increases as the number of connected devices grows. Each device potentially becomes its own vulnerable point on a home network, so it\u2019s time for a complete rethinking of home network security, with the router as the digital deadbolt.Which is exactly what Symantec has done with Norton Core.Animation by Chris Gannon\n1. dyn.com/blog/dyn-statement-on-10212016-ddos-attack/ 2. symantec.com/connect/blogs/mirai-what-you-need-know-about-botnet-behind-recent-major-ddos-attacks 3. dyn.com/blog/dyn-statement-on-10212016-ddos-attack/ 4. nytimes.com/2017/05/17/technology/bitcoin-ransomware-pay-lose-data.html 5. nytimes.com/2017/02/01/technology/personaltech/stop-hijacking-home-devices.html 6. nytimes.com/2017/03/08/technology/personaltech/defense-against-cia-hacking.html 7. iotsecurity.eecs.umich.edu/ 8. sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/layered-security-works-34805 9. gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917 10. symantec.com/security-center/threat-report 11. ymantec.com/security-center/threat-report 12. symantec.com/security-center/threat-reportThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Jessica Williams Charts Her Course: \u2018I Know What I\u2019d Be Incredible At\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan there be more than one Jessica Williams?Then there\u2019s the Ms. Williams who would rather confine herself to her apartment, put on sweatpants and play the Sims on her computer all day.\u201cSome days I\u2019ll be like, \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything great today,\u2019 and I\u2019ll be bummed,\u201d she said recently. \u201cAnd some days I\u2019ll wake up and I\u2019m like, \u2018I am the dopest woman to exist on earth.\u2019\u201dThe character of Jessica James may be riddled with doubts and phobias, played for humorous and poignant effect. But to Ms. Williams, taking her on represents an act of boldness: the choice to portray herself very differently than on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d in a part created specifically for her, as someone invested in her own search for self-assurance.\u201cFor me, so far, confidence has been a journey, not a destination,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see a woman be like, \u2018This is what I want \u2014 this is what I don\u2019t want.\u2019 It\u2019s good to see someone making choices for themselves.\u201dOver breakfast at a Clinton Hill cafe near her home, Ms. Williams, 27, sometimes spoke like a human Twitter feed, punctuating intentionally corny jokes with an audible LOL. She confessed to waving back at another restaurant patron who thought Ms. Williams was waving at her, though the gesture was intended for someone else. (\u201cI didn\u2019t want to invalidate the interaction,\u201d she said meekly.)Ms. Williams, who landed the position at 22, said it was \u201cthe biggest job I\u2019ve had in my adult life.\u201d It just wasn\u2019t quite the trajectory she imagined for herself.While growing up in Torrance, Calif., where her father runs a security company and her mother recently retired from the state Department of Transportation, Ms. Williams took inspiration from her maternal grandmother, who turned her onto comedy shows like \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s milk-and-cookies Grandma, and there\u2019s Colt 45 and Atlantic City Grandma,\u201d Ms. Williams explained. \u201cShe was the latter.\u201dMr. Stewart said in an email that Ms. Williams immediately distinguished herself with a presence that was \u201cso funny and electric.\u201d\u201cI hate to sound clich\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Stewart said, \u201cbut some people have it, and it was so apparent from the tape we had on Jessica. I can\u2019t even talk about it without going into my old Jewish man agent voice. She made great choices, surprising choices. Thirty seconds in, we were trying to figure out how to get in touch with her. We couldn\u2019t believe it when we found out she was still in school!\u201d\u201cWe try to make sure we\u2019re the stars of our own narratives,\u201d Ms. Williams explained.\u201cI know what I\u2019d be incredible at, and I know what I wouldn\u2019t be as great at,\u201d she explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to insert myself into that narrative to please everybody else. I was listening to my heart and making sure I honored what I was truly excellent at.\u201dMs. Robinson said Ms. Williams has been careful to step back and assess the bigger picture at moments when expectations can feel overwhelming.\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine dealing with all this attention on her \u2014 wondering if people really want to be her friend or if they just want access to Jon Stewart,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.She added, \u201cShe\u2019s giving herself opportunities to be a normal person and not have capital letters Jessica Williams be the thing that defines her.\u201dWhile he promoted that movie at the Sundance Film Festival, Mr. Strouse recalled, \u201cI kept saying what a powerful screen presence Jessica is, and how I couldn\u2019t wait until she had her own film.\u201dHe added, \u201cI left Sundance thinking I\u2019m going to write something for her.\u201dThat film was \u201cThe Incredible Jessica James,\u201d which Mr. Strouse directed and wrote in close consultation with Ms. Williams, who is one of its executive producers.The Jessica James character, who daydreams about violent ends for her ex (Lakeith Stanfield), pores over online dating sites and contemplates a new suitor (Chris O\u2019Dowd), is not meant as a stand-in for Ms. Williams.\u201cOh my God, no,\u201d she said. \u201cThat seems mortifying.\u201dStill, Ms. Williams said she could identify with the protagonist\u2019s desire to express herself and feel comfortable in her own feelings.\u201cI\u2019m almost childlike, in the way that kids are like, \u2018You like them,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018No, I don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cAt my core, I\u2019m a little like that. I have to remind myself, it\u2019s O.K. for you to like people.\u201dAlready, she and Mr. Strouse have started discussing a new collaboration, possibly for television, which he would write and in which she would star.No studios or broadcasters were mentioned, and Mr. Strouse only loosely described their conversations as centering around \u201ca character we can live with for longer, in a story that doesn\u2019t end in an hour and a half.\u201dMs. Williams was mostly relieved that \u201cThe Incredible Jessica James\u201d did not freak out her mother.When Ms. Williams watched the film at Sundance for the first time with family members and friends, she recalled, \u201cI was really worried about all the making out in the movie. I remember grabbing my best friend and being like, \u2018What\u2019s my mom doing? Is she covering her eyes?\u2019\u201dFortunately, Ms. Williams reports that her mother loved the movie: \u201cI was like, cool, cool, cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Netflix Is in the Woods With \u2018Ozark\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExcept that Byrde, a Chicago financial planner played by Jason Bateman with the aggressive blandness of an airline gate agent, is already bad. His primary occupation for many years has been laundering money for what he always refers to as Mexico\u2019s second-biggest drug cartel. (He\u2019s a numbers guy.) His life is turned upside down not because of a terminal disease, like Walter White\u2019s lung cancer, but because someone\u2019s talking to the feds.It\u2019s a significant difference. Walter\u2019s white-hot sense of being betrayed by fate in \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d was central to a story that reached toward tragedy and the mythological dimensions of noir fiction. \u201cOzark\u201d uses Marty\u2019s voice-over musings about hard work and the wages of parenthood to give the appearance of gravitas, but the show\u2019s through line is really just his resourcefulness in the face of gruesome, cartel-style justice. The show isn\u2019t a tragedy \u2014 most of the time, it\u2019s a satirical (though quite violent) culture-clash caper with pretensions.The clash of cultures comes after an episode\u2019s worth of dirty business in Chicago, when Marty uproots his family \u2014 wife, teenage daughter, younger son \u2014 and moves to Missouri, specifically the vast, serpentine Lake of the Ozarks, to set up a new laundering operation. The city-slicker Byrdes adjust to their new surroundings and interact with local residents \u2014 including criminals, both small-time and large-scale \u2014 who are Southern Gothic stereotypes to a degree you wouldn\u2019t expect in a prestige Netflix drama.And while it\u2019s unfair to put the onus on Netflix, the real difference between \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cOzark\u201d feels institutional, or generational. \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d had propulsive, straightforward stories that dragged you from season to season. In \u201cOzark,\u201d a lot happens, but not much is going on.Marty and his wife, Wendy (Laura Linney), hatch and abandon laundering schemes \u2014 plowing money into a strip club, a lakeside resort and an evangelical church \u2014 in a rat-a-tat fashion that provides lots of plot and supporting characters but isn\u2019t that interesting or convincing. The writers and producers (the show was created by the screenwriter Bill Dubuque, known for \u201cThe Accountant\u201d) seem less interested in coherent storytelling than in characters\u2019 pausing to deliver homilies \u2014 on the difference between rednecks and hillbillies, say, or the nuances of the social contract when it\u2019s applied by Mexican gangsters or Missouri poppy growers.If you have a taste for that kind of confection \u2014 a bloody mystery thriller, layered with darkly comic ganache \u2014 then you may well enjoy \u201cOzark,\u201d despite the sketchiness of the plot and the way the writers jerk the story around to make it seem more substantial than it is. (In pure prestige-TV fashion, an entire episode late in the season consists of a flashback that explains the central characters\u2019 current behavior.)Your comfort level will be enhanced by the arty, muted cinematography. (The mesmerizing lake-and-forest landscapes were shot on Georgia locations.) But the real saving grace of the show \u2014 and an almost sufficient reason to watch \u2014 is Ms. Linney. Mr. Bateman (who is also an executive producer of the series and directs four of the season\u2019s 10 episodes) isn\u2019t really able to make a compelling character out of the blankly craven Marty, but Ms. Linney, with her gift for high-comic indignation, makes Wendy at once hilarious and sympathetic. If there\u2019s a Season 2, maybe she can take over the business.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charlize Theron\u2019s Sick Work Ethic", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "At a time when audiences crave female empowerment, she is packing a punch, first in \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d and now in \u201cAtomic Blonde.\u201dSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Going into a lunchtime meeting with Charlize Theron a few weeks ago, I wasn\u2019t sure whether to feel amped or a little afraid.Ms. Theron does, however, suffer colds, and had to cancel a few hours before our lunch and reschedule for the next day. She was fighting a virus, she later explained, and shortly before our planned chat had downed daytime cough medicine that left her a little high, and not all that cogent.\u201cI did two movies with Jean-Claude Van Damme as his stunt double,\u201d said David Leitch, a former stunt coordinator and a director of \u201cJohn Wick,\u201d who directed \u201cAtomic Blonde.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s trained as hard as he\u2019s ever trained. Not to disparage Jean-Claude, who\u2019s great. But she didn\u2019t have a martial arts background, and went in at ground zero. She had the will to want to be great right off the bat.\u201dBeyond positioning Ms. Theron solidly as a compelling female action hero, \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d feels like the logical next step for an actress who stunned in 2015 as the one-armed warrior Furiosa, effectively stealing \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d from the film\u2019s ostensible star, Tom Hardy. After shining throughout her chameleon-like career, be it playing the romantic interest, the dramatic lead, the darkly comedic antiheroine, or, of course, a serial killer, Ms. Theron is, at 41, deploying a brand of female empowerment and ferocity that audiences crave now more than ever. Like Furiosa, and also Cipher in the most recent \u201cFast and Furious\u201d film, Ms. Theron\u2019s \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d character is unapologetic and cunning, wholly owning her space, rather than merely populating or decorating a world defined by men.She is also a ruthlessly efficient killer, laying waste to 200-pound men, flipping them and hurling them down stairwells and into walls. During production, Ms. Theron bruised her ribs, wrenched her knee and clenched her jaw so tightly that she cracked two teeth. \u201cI was a nervous wreck,\u201d said AJ Dix, a partner at Ms. Theron\u2019s production company, Denver and Delilah, which helped produce the film. \u201cNothing scares her.\u201dMs. Theron optioned the story before the graphic novel it was based on, \u201cThe Coldest City,\u201d came out in 2012. She loved that Lorraine was impenitent and fought out of professional duty, rather than to avenge, say, the loss of a husband or child. (There are intimations that she had a personal connection with the dead spy.) Part of what is so arresting and even transgressive about the film is its forthright depiction of Lorraine\u2019s battle wounds. Her face is bruised because she has done her job, not because she has been victimized.\u201cI became very aware of women in certain circumstances not being allowed to play by the same rules guys get to play by,\u201d Ms. Theron said. \u201cI was actively looking for a protagonist that could break those rules.\u201dLorraine also fits the mold of characters that Ms. Theron tends to embrace, I suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of vengeance thing,\u201d I hedged, \u201cbut also something \u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cBroken?\u201d Ms. Theron offered, deadpan. \u201cPsychopaths?\u201d\u201cHumor is the only way that I get through most of my days,\u201d Ms. Theron said. \u201cHumor is what gets you through some of the darkest times in your life.\u201dAs bad as that night was, Ms. Theron said, the agonizing years that preceded it were almost worse, with her home life swinging wildly between turbulence and calm. \u201cThat was my entire childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cMy trauma was all of that.\u201d After the shooting, her mother, Gerda Jacoba Aletta Maritz, told her that this was a moment where they could sink or swim.Ms. Theron\u2019s voice caught, and her eyes began to well.\u201cI survived that, and I\u2019m proud of that. I\u2019ve worked hard for that, too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am not scared of that. I am not fearful of the darkness. If anything, I am intrigued by it, because I think it explains human nature and people better.\u201dShe continued: \u201cPeople like Aileen Wuornos that people just want to label and, like, shove under a rug. Nobody wants to examine that human. Nobody wants to look at that person and say, \u2018But why did this happen?\u2019 I\u2019m fascinated by the why. Because in many ways, I am here today because of the why.\u201dMs. Theron has resisted links between her history and characters like Furiosa (\u201cincredibly broken\u201d) and Ravenna (a \u201cmess,\u201d she said, throwing in an expletive; her language is Dead Sea-level salty). But the turmoil those characters endured, and the strength they acquired as a result of it, is, for Ms. Theron, personal.\u201cI mean, you\u2019d be an idiot not to put it together that I like women who can struggle, and win the struggle, and get out of their situations,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not victims, but they\u2019re also not superheroes.\u201dMs. Theron paused. Something across the restaurant had caught her eye. \u201cOh that\u2019s Jason Reitman,\u201d Ms. Theron said. He directed her in \u201cYoung Adult\u201d (2011) and their coming \u201cTully,\u201d scheduled for 2018.\u201cAs I talk about my childhood trauma,\u201d Ms. Theron said, shifting back into wryness, \u201clet me just name-drop.\u201d\u201cShe just said, \u2018By the time they pull the plug, we\u2019ll be wrapping this movie,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Theron, who won an Oscar for the performance. \u201cAnd we just kept going. And they were screaming and hollering and hating every second of it.\u201d (Ms. Theron said the angry caller was Mark Damon. Mr. Damon, however, said that while he was taken aback by the character\u2019s prosthetic teeth and mottled skin, any suggestion that money would be withheld was \u201cnonsense\u201d and that the film was one of the best investments he has made.)As our lunch wrapped up, Mr. Reitman came over to say hi, and sang the praises of Ms. Theron. \u201cShe\u2019s legitimately the best,\u201d he said. A few weeks later, reached by phone, he elaborated. \u201cUsually when you encounter someone with that deep well of emotional understanding, they\u2019re usually not a fun, easygoing person,\u201d Mr. Reitman said. \u201cUsually they\u2019re a complicated dark cave that you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time in. The opposite is true of Charlize.\u201d\u201cAll I wanted to do was take every fat photo of you in \u2018Tully,\u2019 and just put \u2018J\u2019adore,\u2019 \u2018J\u2019adore,\u2019 and email them all to you,\u201d he said.Ms. Theron shot back with a posterior-related curse word, and Mr. Reitman smiled affectionately.Advertisement"}

(The show itself was also nominated for drama series, with Elisabeth Moss receiving a nod for lead actress and Alexis Bledel for guest actress.)In a phone call from a makeup chair in Los Angeles, where she was shooting a YouTube Red series, Ms. Wiley chatted about her latest role, its political impact and a love that still endures. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.When last we spoke, about a year ago, your story line on \u201cOrange\u201d had come to a close. Did you know then that you would be playing Moira? I did not know about this show when I exited \u201cOrange.\u201d There were a few months there when I was out of a job and just happened to have the script cross my desk, as they say. By the story and also by the character, I felt like I could really bring something to her, and I would be devastated if anyone else was playing her, so I put my all into it. And to have this be the outcome is more than I could imagine.So that cloud had a silver lining. What is it about Moira that appealed to you?The main thing is her sense of self. She is someone who is never going to become complacent with the world she is living in. We see her become downtrodden and lose a little bit of herself, or we think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. But she remains resilient and she is able to come out of that.Had you read \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d before being cast?I had not, but I immediately consumed it. I count myself lucky to have not had any preconceived notions. I was able to come to it fresh. I had some people tell me before that if I messed this up they were going to kill me. [laughs] We have such a huge fan base of Margaret Atwood and her work. She\u2019s on the forefront of feminist work, and to come to it the way I did, I didn\u2019t have added pressure on myself, which was nice.You\u2019ve traded one large female ensemble cast for another. How is that?It\u2019s hard to compare. \u201cOrange\u201d was my first experience in having my face in the public consciousness in a way that it never was before. And that series became my view of what Hollywood and that entertainment world was: women cast, women producers, women behind the camera and in front of the camera. Now I\u2019ve gone to another show where that\u2019s happening, so it\u2019s sort of become my norm. And I\u2019m really spoiled in that way, not having had the typical experience in the industry.The handmaid\u2019s uniform \u2014 red robes and white bonnets \u2014 has become prevalent at women\u2019s rights protests. What is your take on the infiltration of this symbol of oppression into real life?The way that it\u2019s permeated the culture, I never thought that it would be quite like this. It\u2019s showing me the impact that art can have on society. Art imitates life and life imitates art, and to be a part of the conversation of what\u2019s happening in our world right now, I feel completely, exactly where I want to be with my art. I want to be making things that are relevant.How was it filming the show during this political environment?It\u2019s a little bit scary, honestly. We knew that this story was relevant, we knew that it was timely, we knew that it was important for us to \u201cget this right.\u201d But as the elections happened in the middle of filming, I think we understood in a different way the responsibility that we had to tell the story with the utmost integrity, and to bring our all to it as an ensemble, led brilliantly by Elisabeth. She really set the bar and the rest of us were, I believe, able to meet her.Do people still come up to you on the street to talk about Poussey?Oh my gosh. Yeah, that\u2019s the No. 1 thing people want to talk about, and I don\u2019t have any feelings about that except for love. It shows how much she really touched people and that we were successful with the story we decided to tell. Poussey will probably always be a part of my legacy. And it\u2019s so great to see that something you put yourself into is not just gone \u2014 that she\u2019s there in every single breath.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d when Poussey Washington broke countless hearts. It was the fourth season, not the fifth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emmy Nominations 2017: Claire Foy on Queen Elizabeth II and \u2018The Crown\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClaire Foy received her first Emmy nomination on Thursday for a role that she\u2019s already done playing.\u201cIt\u2019s still very much like it\u2019s part of my life because it hasn\u2019t aired yet and there\u2019s still some postproduction,\u201d Ms. Foy said Thursday. \u201cWhen I start my next job I\u2019ll kind of go, \u2018Aww.\u2019 That will be the moment it\u2019s over and I know I\u2019ll never play her again.\u201dMs. Foy called from London to discuss the nomination, Season 2 of the drama and what Queen Elizabeth II has in common with James Bond. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.Why do you think \u201cThe Crown\u201d resonated beyond Britain?I think this family is universal in the sense that people around the world have grown up with them, and been caught up in their family dramas and their lives, and how they changed through time as the world changed. A lot of Americans said to me that after the election, it was, not a relief, but kind of an enjoyable escape about the making of a society and how politics works.President Trump and Queen Elizabeth II have different leadership styles.I think that was probably the escapism part.What was it like to inhabit someone so famous, who has been a presence throughout your entire life?It was never not going to be weird. You come to it with so many expectations and you have to let go of them; you can\u2019t let them guide you because it could go so wrong. None of us did that. I think that\u2019s why people liked it so much and went along with us \u2014 instead of portraying them as the figures, we tried to portray them as people.What new insights did you get into the royal family?Just that they\u2019re a family. The stresses and restrictions on them are slightly odd, I suppose. It was really about how much their role in society and those pressures affected them as people. It can\u2019t help but change you. And the death of [King George VI] shook the family to the core. It really affected the girls and the whole family. He was the linchpin and when he was gone, it changed the way the family worked. Which is what happens with every family, because that\u2019s life, isn\u2019t it?What were some keys to playing Queen Elizabeth II?She lets people come to her \u2014 she doesn\u2019t force her opinions on people. She likes to see how things play out and then quietly and carefully express her opinions. It really helped me to remember that quite a lot. She wouldn\u2019t take the shouty route \u2014 she\u2019s much more underplayed and calm. But she also has an incredible sense of humor.She reportedly liked the show. What\u2019s the best review you could hope for from her?Oh God. As long as she doesn\u2019t take one look and: \u201cTut! That was the worst thing.\u201d But we\u2019ll never really know unless she approaches and I go, \u201cSo what did you think, Ma\u2019am?\u201d But I don\u2019t expect that to happen.How is Season 2 different?She\u2019s a very different kind of person in the sense that she\u2019s much more true to herself, and secure in her role. But that doesn\u2019t translate to other parts of her life, her marriage and relationships. One part of your life is going really well and one part crumbles to nothing, that\u2019s life. She definitely struggles from that and from the fact that the world is changing at a pace she hasn\u2019t got control of \u2014 everything is happening and she\u2019s trying to understand what it means to her and her family.What advice do you have for whoever plays her next?Get some sleep! I don\u2019t have any advice. Whoever takes her on will reincarnate her, and it will be entirely their own thing. I don\u2019t own her as a character. She\u2019s the James Bond of the royal family.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Shark Lovers Love \u2018Unabomber\u2019? Asking for a Cable Network.", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's Notebook\u201cDiscovery wasn\u2019t a big player in scripted,\u201d Mr. Ross said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur goal was to diversify the kind of storytelling we do.\u201dThe series certainly succeeds at that. It is a gripping and sophisticated account of how James R. Fitzgerald (Mr. Worthington), then a newly minted F.B.I. profiler, upended a lot of the bureau\u2019s assumptions in pursuing the suspect who became known in popular lore as the Unabomber (Mr. Bettany). The supporting cast includes Chris Noth as Fitzgerald\u2019s supervisor and Jane Lynch as Janet Reno, the attorney general in the mid-1990s.\u201cManhunt: Unabomber\u201d might seem an incongruity in a schedule anchored with shows like \u201cNaked and Afraid\u201d and \u201cDeadliest Catch.\u201d But not to John Goldwyn, a producer who had worked with Mr. Ross on the Fox series \u201cGracepoint\u201d and on another good fact-based series for Discovery, \u201cHarley and the Davidsons.\u201dThe network, he said, has always liked American history, and it has always liked aspirational stories in which a protagonist confronts a challenge, whether it\u2019s the sea, the wilderness or a resistant law enforcement bureaucracy.\u201cIn their success, they change the world in which they live,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said.After establishing the hunt narrative, the series breaks from it and devotes a full episode to this chapter in Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s youth. It\u2019s a brash decision, but Mr. Goldwyn said that he made sure Mr. Sodroski\u2019s voice and vision would be preserved with the selection of a television veteran, Greg Yaitanes (whose credits include \u201cBanshee,\u201d a show that helped broaden Cinemax\u2019s lineup), to direct all eight episodes and serve as showrunner.\u201cGreg has a famous reputation for protecting the voice of young writers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he understood that the idea was not to make Ted into a monster.\u201dMr. Yaitanes said that it would have been a mistake to offer a straightforward pursuit-and-capture chronicle, especially with such a well-documented case.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to plot this in a way that is saving the reveal, I think that is ultimately disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a Google search away from spoiling it. It\u2019s not as simple as catching someone. As amazing as that story was, it was only the beginning.\u201dMr. Kaczynski is hardly made into a hero, but the series doesn\u2019t flinch from examining what drove him to murder.\u201cIt was important to examine the case from all angles and directions,\u201d Mr. Yaitanes said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the weaponizing of a civilian by the United States government.\u201dIn a time when headlines are devoted to radicalized terrorists abroad and sometimes at home, that gives the series a fascinating present-day relevance. So does its inevitable revisiting of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s manifesto about the insidiousness of technology and its ability to take over our lives.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly relevant to today,\u201d noted Mr. Yaitanes, who banned cellphones from the set to focus his crew\u2019s attention on this very message. \u201cThis guy prophesied exactly where we\u2019d be 20 years ago.\u201d\u201cWe felt that we had this tremendous opportunity with these two actors,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said, referring to Mr. Worthington and Mr. Bettany. \u201cThe audience would feel cheated if we didn\u2019t find opportunities for these two Goliaths to face off.\u201dIt\u2019s a delicious confrontation; disingenuous, perhaps, but no more so than countless other enhancements of reality used in such dramatizations. Mr. Goldwyn said that the fictional face-to-face reflects a real fear of Mr. Fitzgerald and others that the warrant that got them into Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s Montana cabin could be thrown out.Mr. Ross said that his vision for remaking the channel wasn\u2019t to flush out the old content and replace it with a full slate of premium series. Instead, he wants enough ambitious offerings that the regular audience is periodically surprised and new viewers become intrigued.It seems a reasonable bet \u2014 after all, just because you might enjoy shark shows doesn\u2019t mean you want to watch only shark shows.Mr. Bettany, for one, thinks people will find good TV no matter where it is.\u201cIt\u2019s like the wild West with television,\u201d he said, recalling a lunch with Kevin Spacey a few years ago at which Mr. Spacey shocked him by saying not only that he intended to do a TV series, but also that the series \u2014 you\u2019ve heard of it; \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 was going to be on Netflix. \u201cThe paradigm is shifting all the time, and content is king.\u201dA Critic\u2019s Notebook article on Tuesday about the Discovery Channel show \u201cManhunt: Unabomber\u201d misstated the surname of the F.B.I. profiler portrayed by Sam Worthington.

Money is being poured into low-cost exchange-traded funds. And these funds are piling into companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 known as the FANG stocks for the companies\u2019 first initials.That is putting stock pickers at traditional mutual funds into an existential crisis.They are finding it ever more difficult to beat the broader market, especially as FANG stocks outpace the rest.Still, fears remain about the rise of machines and such passive investing distorting the market, not the least because Amazon, with its deal for Whole Foods, poses a threat to several companies in which Parnassus owns stock.The team at Parnassus \u2014 where business suits and ties prevail despite being based in the tech hub of San Francisco \u2014 has chosen instead to bet on other areas like life sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d argues Benjamin E.

{"Headline": "\u2018Chasing Coral\u2019 on Netflix Goes Underwater to Highlight Climate Change", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingMr. Vevers was not the first to notice. One climate scientist, who warned the world about coral bleaching in the early \u201990s, recalls how he was dismissed as an alarmist. But Mr. Vevers was seized by the idea of documenting the phenomenon, which makes the movie a scientific suspense narrative, as a team devises the necessary equipment and sets out to reefs around the world to record the damage. If you\u2019re unschooled in marine biology, you see a coral reef as an unusual form of plant life. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s animal life, and the movie provides a cogent explanation of how coral works. The macro photography of coral polyps, thousands of which protrude from any given coral formation, yields imagery that is more awe-inspiringly peculiar than anything in sci-fi cinema. And yet this is part of our real world.In its explanation of how coral feeds, and how other forms of sea life feed on or around coral, the movie imparts an understanding of how humans rely on coral as well. So we\u2019re made to care about how much of it is dying \u2014 what\u2019s at stake is much more than an eye-popping attraction for diving tourists.\u201cWe hadn\u2019t planned on making a series,\u201d Mr. Orlowski said in a telephone interview. \u201cMaking \u2018Chasing Ice\u2019 really had awakened me to the urgency of the climate change problem, and this looked like an opportunity to tell a new story, and also one that had a very different visual aspect.\u201dAt one point, members of Mr. Vevers\u2019s team have to operate out of a barge that\u2019s also a floating restaurant. Forced to dive daily and manually record the process of bleaching (a last-minute change in location has restricted the use of stationary, installed cameras), the researchers have to navigate a deck full of oblivious party people while an ecological disaster is happening below them.\u201cIt just so happened that the barge was parked directly at a reef site in New Caledonia, and it gave great access; you could just take a boat out to it every day,\u201d Mr. Orlowski said. \u201cThe shots of the partyers just happened to be captured by one of the cinematographers, Andrew Ackerman. It was only in retrospect that we saw the irony of it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re documenting the planet dying,\u201d Mr. Orlowski told me. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be cheaper to repair the damage that\u2019s been done. I am guardedly optimistic, mostly because of the changes in technology and the changes in mind-set. The youth get it; the global audience gets it; and internationally, corporate, city, municipal forces get it.
