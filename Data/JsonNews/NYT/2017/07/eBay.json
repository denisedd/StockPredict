{"Headline": "Charles W. Bachman, Business Software Innovator, Dies at 92", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles W. Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92.His daughter Chandini Bachman confirmed his death.Mr. Bachman was a pioneer in the field of database management software. His work would later be eclipsed by that of other innovators, and software tools have changed drastically over the years. But behind every product search on Amazon, movie recommendation on Netflix or bid on eBay, there is a flood of digital communications mediated by database management software, which owes an intellectual debt to Mr. Bachman.He was working for General Electric when he developed a layer of software that allowed programmers to retrieve data for an automated manufacturing system that controlled a variety of tasks \u2014 production scheduling, parts ordering and inventory management.His Integrated Data Store software, first demonstrated in 1963, made it possible to share data across different applications. That capability had been talked about before, but Mr. Bachman was the first to carry it out.His software was crucial to converting the G.E. manufacturing-control system from an idea to a reality, an impressive technical feat given the limitations of the primitive computers at the time.In 1973, Mr. Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to database technology. The award is often described as the Nobel Prize for computer science. In 2014, Mr. Bachman visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama.Mr. Bachman was the first Turing Award recipient who did not have a Ph.D. The earlier winners of the prize, which was first issued in 1966, had academic backgrounds, mainly as mathematicians or physicists. Mr. Bachman had degrees in mechanical engineering, a bachelor\u2019s from Michigan State College and a master\u2019s from the University of Pennsylvania.Mr. Bachman spent his career in the business world at a series of companies large and small, including Dow Chemical, G.E., Honeywell and a start-up backed by venture capital in the 1980s.Yet it was the application of computing to business problems \u2014 rather than business itself \u2014 that Mr. Bachman found appealing.\u201cHe was always an engineer at heart,\u201d said Thomas Haigh, a technology historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who interviewed Mr. Bachman for an oral history project and studied his work. \u201cHe was motivated by the joy of tinkering with complex systems and making things work better.\u201dCharles William Bachman III was born on Dec. 11, 1924, in Manhattan, Kan., the second of four children of Grace Marie Cary Bachman and Charles W. Bachman Jr. His father was the football coach at Kansas State College, and later at Michigan State.The younger Mr. Bachman grew to be a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches, and he inherited his father\u2019s fondness for sports, but his real passion was building and fixing things. \u201cI was always going to be an engineer,\u201d Mr. Bachman told Mr. Haigh in 2004.Mr. Bachman graduated early from high school, took spring and summer courses at Michigan State and then joined the Army in 1943, serving two years in the artillery corps in New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Antiaircraft guns at the time used simple mechanical computers to target a plane\u2019s predicted flight path, a rudimentary primer for Mr. Bachman\u2019s later work.After the war, Mr. Bachman returned to Michigan State to complete his undergraduate degree in 1948. The following year, he married Constance Hadley, shortly after she graduated from Michigan State. They were married for 62 years. She died in 2012.Besides his daughter Chandini, Mr. Bachman is survived by a brother, J. Cary; three other children, Thomas, Jonathan and Sara Bachman Ducey; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Mr. Bachman began his engineering career with big companies that were starting to use computers \u2014 Dow Chemical, G.E. and Honeywell, which bought G.E.\u2019s computer business in 1970. During that time, Mr. Bachman took a leading role in computing organizations, which were establishing standards for how data is represented, shared and modeled.Later in his career, Mr. Bachman worked for smaller companies and started one of his own, Bachman Information Systems, in 1983. It focused on a technology called computer-aided software engineering that was intended to make creating software easier by offering programmers graphical tools instead of requiring them to write code line by line. His company attracted funding from two leading venture capital firms, Venrock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and it enjoyed some early success. It sold shares in a public offering in 1991, and its stock price surged for a while.The young company had some impressive technology. But it failed to catch the shift to personal computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows software and lower-cost applications programs. The remnants of Bachman Information Systems went through a couple of mergers and eventually sold to a larger corporation.\u201cCharlie was always the architect, not a managerial C.E.O. type,\u201d said Jonathan Bachman, a software project manager who worked with his father for years. \u201cAnd a lot of what he designed lives on, in a new guise, today.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s not a problem, as long as you remember one very common idiom.We\u2019re not told directly what that idiom is in the clues, but that just makes the hunting more fun, in my opinion.The idiom, if you haven\u2019t already guessed, is \u201cKilling two birds with one stone,\u201d which is suggested in Mr. Agard\u2019s grid in the clues at 35- and 37-Across.How cool is that?In addition, Mr. Agard\u2019s puzzle has some really nice entries in it, despite the plethora of shorter entries (a constraint of the theme). I liked BIPODS, PIBB, KORN, UNTAG, RUM RAISIN, SPARE TIRE (perhaps from all the rum raisin), ABFAB, BEEF PATTY, ADOPT-A-PET, POLE DANCE (Yes, I did like that one. It\u2019s clued in an agender way, so why not?) and SNOW ANGEL.The clues in his grid are also entertaining. Anyone who can take me back to the Transformers universe is O.K. by me.\u25a0 5A: Remember, clues inside brackets are hints at nonverbal communication (Verbal communication would be in quotation marks). The answer to \u201c[Ask me what\u2019s wrong]\u201d is SIGH.\u25a0 15A: Tricky one! \u201cMark\u2019s replacement\u201d is not referring to a person named Mark, but the currency. The replacement for the German mark would be the EURO.\u25a0 21A/60A: I liked the fraternal twin clues here: The first word of a fairy tale is ONCE, as in \u201cOnce upon a time ...,\u201d and the last word is AFTER, as in \u201chappily ever AFTER.\u201d\u25a0 22A: Yes, BAE, short for \u201cbabe,\u201d is a term of endearment.\u25a0 30A: This had me stumped for a while, but in hindsight, it really shouldn\u2019t have: EBAY, the auction site, uses computer clicks instead of bidding paddles.\u25a0 52A: If you\u2019ve ever had someone post an unflattering photo of you on Facebook, this is a no-brainer. For those without Facebook accounts, people can post photos of others and tag them so that it appears on your own page as well. There is also an option to go into settings and UNTAG the photo, so it no longer appears on your own page.\u25a0 34D: Not Icarus, at least not today. The \u201cFigure whose wings melt in the sun\u201d is a SNOW ANGEL.I have to shout out two indirect inspirations for this puzzle:\u25a0 Zhouqin (C.C.) Burnikel, the LeBron James of crossword construction: I\u2019m totally biting her style here with these double-stacked long downs (1- and 2-Down, as well as 33- and 34-Down).Hope you dug it.I certainly did, Mr. Agard.

{"Headline": "How to Save on Your Trip to a Theme Park", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerTheme parks can be great fun for all, but tickets, parking, food and incidentals can rapidly mount up to burn a hole in your pocket. Here is a list of tips to help you save a few bucks on that summer theme-park excursion, be it one of the popular Disney parks or your local favorite.A one-day Park Hopper ticket to Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom can cost $174. If you buy a 10-day ticket, however, the per-day cost drops to about $51. Keep in mind that for these multiday tickets, there is a limited amount of time to use them. In this case, you must use all 10 days within a 14-day period.You can buy theme-park tickets at the gate, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should. Parks always want to know when you\u2019re coming (it helps them determine their discount and blackout days, for example), and they love to have your money upfront. In return, many parks (with the notable exception of Disney) offer significant discounts for buying online.Conventional wisdom says that a good way to save money on the egregious pricing of food items is to bring your own; many parks will allow visitors to bring snacks, within reason. (Nearly all parks will allow reusable nonglass water bottles that can be refilled throughout the day, a much better choice than spending $2 to $5 on bottled water.)But toting your own food doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone. \u201cThat\u2019s not really something I want to do when I\u2019m on vacation,\u201d Ms. Marino says. Instead, she suggests skipping the side dish when ordering at restaurants as a way to cut costs. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018I want the chicken sandwich, but no fries,\u2019\u201d she says, which saves a dollar or two per meal.Many parks have water rides, and water is not your smartphone\u2019s friend. It sounds simplistic, but you\u2019ll be kicking yourself after drenching your $800 iPhone. Bring a sealable plastic bag to protect your phone during water rides. It costs virtually nothing, and can potentially save you a major headache.We\u2019ve all forgotten where we put the car. Don\u2019t let it happen in an enormous parking lot when you\u2019ve got tired children in tow. To save some frustration, take a photo of where you parked (\u201cO.K., kids, remember: We\u2019re in Foghorn Leghorn!\u201d). Better yet, open Google Maps on your phone and drop a pin at your car\u2019s location. You can then add a label or star to the location, making it a cinch to find at the end of the day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AlphaBay, Biggest Online Drug Bazaar, Goes Dark, and Questions Swirl", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The largest online black market for drugs, AlphaBay, has been down for nearly two days, raising questions about whether it was seized by law enforcement authorities or taken down in a swindle.The site is one of many so-called dark net markets that came into existence after American authorities took down the first and most famous such market, the Silk Road, in 2013.Researchers say that AlphaBay has grown into the largest black market site by far.The site was hosting $600,000 to $800,000 in transactions daily earlier this year, according to unpublished statistics from Nicolas Christin, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has written many papers about the scale of such sites. Those figures would make AlphaBay about twice as large as the Silk Road when it was shut down in October 2013.Operators of other large black market sites have absconded with user deposits and shut the sites, in what are known as exit scams.In some cases, the authorities, in so-called honeypot operations, have taken down black market sites, then reopened them to get more information about users.Federal authorities have not commented on, or taken responsibility for, AlphaBay\u2019s being down. When the authorities took down the Silk Road they quickly put up a banner on the site alerting users to the operation.AlphaBay users have flocked to Reddit to speculate about what happened and express concern about their drug supplies and deposits on the site.\u201cAt least if it was a verified exit scam people could write off their btc as gone and plan accordingly,\u201d one user wrote, using an abbreviation for Bitcoin. \u201cI think it\u2019s not not knowing that drives so many people crazy.\u201dThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201cI have been in touch with our devs and admins and they are working to restore AlphaBay as soon as possible,\u201d he wrote, using shorthand terms for developers and administrators.Users were skeptical about why the site\u2019s administrators had been so late in posting information.\u201cTelling us 1 minute after it goes down would be fine. It literally took him like 28hrs,\u201d a user named yellow_viper wrote on Reddit.AlphaBay is only accessible through dark web browsers, which scramble the location of users and site operators, making it all but impossible for the authorities to identify the whereabouts of the servers hosting a specific site.Users pay for goods with virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which cannot be easily tracked by financial institutions or law enforcement.The authorities took down the Silk Road because its creator, Ross Ulbricht, accidentally revealed his real email address in an early online post about the site. Mr. Ulbricht is now serving a life sentence in prison for his role as the kingpin of the worldwide digital drug-trafficking enterprise.AlphaBay operates much like eBay, hosting vendors who offer their wares and pay a commission to the site on each purchase. Customers deposit money with the site before making purchases. This is the money the operators could have stolen.In 2015, the operators of the marketplace known as Evolution closed the site and took millions of dollars of users\u2019 money.Other sites have been taken down by law enforcement agencies in various countries using sophisticated techniques to unmask the operators\u2019 anonymity.In recent months, authorities in the United States have arrested several large vendors on AlphaBay who had sold synthetic opioids like fentanyl and U-47700.In April, police arrested a couple in Greenville, S.C., who were allegedly connected to a popular vendor on AlphaBay known as PeterTheGreat. An 18-year-old in Portland, Ore., died after taking U-47700 that she bought from PeterTheGreat on AlphaBay, the authorities said.When large dark net markets have gone down in the past, the transactions have quickly moved to other sites. AlphaBay currently has many large competitors, including sites like Valhalla and Dream Market.Luke Rodeheffer, a cybercrime analyst with Flashpoint, said that criminals around the web were buzzing about the problems at AlphaBay.\u201cGiven that a number of Eastern European cybercriminals use AlphaBay as a marketplace, the down status is already being discussed on top-tier Russian forums,\u201d he said.\u201cNo one has any particular insights into the cause,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Losing an Heirloom as a Family Tradition", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesI don\u2019t mean to brag, but every movie theater usher in Kansas City once knew me by name. On humid summer days, my father would pull me from camp at lunch to catch an action flick and cool down in the best air-conditioning Missouri had to offer. I cherished these retreats, which included Reese\u2019s Pieces, Cherry Coke and zero pressure to talk.But every 10th matinee or so, my father would launch into a predictable routine. In the second half of the movie, just when the Russians, space aliens or cyborgs were really getting the upper hand, Dad would tense up, lean over his extra-extra-large soda and inform me that, sorry, we\u2019d need to search the aisles for his class ring after the credits rolled.The jewelry was gold and gaudy, showcasing a faux-ruby gemstone the size of a pinkie nail and the words \u201cRhode Island School of Design,\u201d where my grandfather studied machine design many decades ago.My father drew comfort not from booze or sports, but from twisting this splendid band, left and right and left. Then further left and right again. It was a 24-karat fidget spinner. When Dad added industrial grade butter-flavored popcorn sauce to all that heat and pressure, his second-longest digit became a tiny, lubricated missile launcher, firing the band into the air and down the aisle, flickering in the light of Jean-Claude Van Damme jump-kicking a Soviet right in the trachea.Class rings, more than any other ring, are skilled at disappearing, which may explain why you rarely see one on an adult. My father\u2019s ring hid in difficult to reach places where only my 11-year-old hands could fit. Most theatergoers, who shuffle in and out in the familiar twilight, never see the powerful cinema floodlights that lit up my searches. They are the second brightest source of illumination in our solar system, custom-designed to reveal the grimy residue produced when a couple hundred people laugh, cry, grope and snack in the dark for two hours.Under the gaze of the extremely cool teenagers who worked at the theater, I crawled on my hands and knees to find the lost ring. I was easily embarrassed as a child, but I endured because I coveted the ring \u2014 you build a special relationship with the object of your torment \u2014 which had been passed down from my grandfather to my father.I never met my grandfather, who died when my father was in seminary preparing to be a priest. Dad left school, returned home, married my mother, became a fireman. In my baby photos, Dad cradles me in his arms, his hands protecting my face. The ring pinches his finger into a pair of sausage links, and what would have looked tacky on lesser hands made my father into The Godfather. (His olive complexion and Eddie Munster hairline certainly didn\u2019t hurt.) I always hoped my fingers would swell into thick, meaty digits just like his, at which point I\u2019d claim my golden birthright, and rule as the king of a three-bedroom split-ranch, just like my old man.My hands were small and thin, requiring me to make a constant knuckle to keep the jewelry from sneaking away. When I went for a run around the neighborhood three days after my birthday, I decided not to risk losing the ring mid jog, and instead left the band in what my 17-year-old brain determined was the safest spot within five feet: on the trunk of my family\u2019s 1995 white Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera parked in the driveway. I don\u2019t know when the ring vanished. Maybe someone stole it. But if I\u2019m honest, I suspect it disappeared when, returning from the run dehydrated, forgetting to reclothe my naked finger, I drove to 7-11 for a Slurpee.The ring was never seen again.My dad forgave me, but he\u2019s never stopped looking for the ring. Now I know my dad held onto the ring not as a stress reliever, but as the last piece of his own father, and I despise my 17-year-old-self, a covetous, irresponsible and unaware kid.My father and my grandfather grew up in an age of scarcity. Today, it\u2019s generally assumed that everything can be purchased online with enough searching and willingness to go into debt.I\u2019ve tried to find another \u201cRISD Class of 1960\u201d band \u2014 eBay, Craigslist, cold-calling the apathetic grandchildren of alumni \u2014 but, no luck. I figured I\u2019d commission a replica, but the school\u2019s historians couldn\u2019t find a single photo of my grandfather or his ring or any class ring from that year. And although my dad wore it for decades, we have no photographs that show it clearly enough to serve as a model.We don\u2019t talk about the loss, but I think it still bothers my father even after 15 years. The closest we came to acknowledging the ring\u2019s absence was a year ago, when Dad bought a gimmel ring as an overdue stand-in. A gimmel ring is a funny choice for a fidgeter. When twisted or squeezed, it collapses into three separate loops.After some gentle prodding, he demonstrated the trick. With a twist, one band became three, and his finger transformed, right there, into the trunk of our family tree. Grandfather. Father. Son. We spent the next hour trying to get the gimmel back together.In the summertime, when I step from heat into air-conditioning, I still picture the movie theater. It\u2019s dark and cold. My dad leans over, and I know what he\u2019ll say. The ring is lost, and we need to stay and find it together. I crawl around the sticky floor, I check all the familiar places. The ushers, my dad and I search and search as the bright lights flip on and the heat rushes in.Chris Plante is a co-founder of Polygon and editor at Vox Media who lives in Austin with his wife and his dog, Pasta Bowl.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maestros of the Concert Merchandise Movement", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWelcome to the world of elevated concert merch: special collections linked to specific cultural events, limited in availability, and one of the newest and fastest-growing subsectors in the fashion world. From the first half of 2014 to the first half of 2017, the amount of tour-related products sold online increased by 720 percent, according to Edited, a company that tracks analytics at more than 90,000 brands and retailers.In a twist of corporate musical chairs, Bravado\u2019s Mr. Vlasic actually founded the Thread Shop during a 12-year stint at Sony, where he began in the finance department, while Ms. Wong worked at Bravado until 2015.Now, the two are engaged in something of an arms race to own the increasingly lucrative cross-disciplinary fashion territory they have defined.The Thread Shop is a much younger operation. It began in 2009 as a straightforward T-shirt business to support touring artists, and eventually grew to provide more exclusive, higher-priced pieces and capsule collections. The company now works with some of the same retailers as Bravado, including Urban Outfitters, Pacsun and Kohl\u2019s, and, like Bravado, operates globally.Sony would not provide revenue figures for the Thread Shop. But Richard Story, the president of Commercial Music Group, which handles licensing, estate management, television and film contracts and more for Sony, acknowledged that while currently a minor contributor to the parent company\u2019s balance sheet: \u201cThere\u2019s no question that when we\u2019re in our strategic planning conversations, we look at these types of businesses and think, \u2018Can they be very robust multimillion-dollar revenue operations?\u2019 We firmly believe they can be.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at Sony\u2019s offices on Madison Square Park in Manhattan, Ms. Wong considered Bravado\u2019s position in the field. \u201cThey are the leader of our arena,\u201d Ms. Wong said. But, she added: \u201cI start from a trend standpoint because I think that\u2019s why people will come to us. How do you do a concert tee and take it to the next level? Do you crop it, do you cut it, do you put safety pins in it?\u201d Ms. Wong, who previously worked at Bloomingdale\u2019s, Calvin Klein and Benetton, was wearing an ASAP Ferg shirt that she had cut a V-shaped neckline into herself.When first releasing an artist\u2019s products, both Bravado and the Thread Shop will often do so through pop-up shops. \u201cWe\u2019ll identify the ground zero retailers that create demand, create urgency,\u201d said Frank Bartolotta, Bravado\u2019s senior vice president for national sales. \u201cThat creates a crazy amount of energy. Because it\u2019s like, \u2018If I didn\u2019t get it during that three-day cycle, I need to figure out when I\u2019m going to get it.\u2019 Then we go to a larger retail partner.\u201dThus in early May, \u201cStarboy\u201d merchandise was sold for three days only at boutiques in eight cities across the United States, including Patron of the New in New York and FourTwoFour on Fairfax in Los Angeles, and also online for limited periods. After that, Bravado went to PacSun for a larger rollout. \u201cIf there\u2019s not an experience tied into this, it becomes stale, it becomes mute,\u201d Mr. Bartolotta said. \u201cWhen we create these moments that live there for literally 72 hours, there\u2019s an alertness, and that fan is rabid.\u201dThe key is to ensure that pop-ups offer certain exclusive items. \u201cThe kid that goes to New York wants the New York piece,\u201d Mr. Bartolotta said. \u201cThe kid who goes to L.A. wants the L.A. piece. And then there\u2019s the main collection. So if you weren\u2019t in L.A., you can then go, weeks later, to PacSun to get that extended collection.\u201dMs. Wong takes it a step further and offers a different collection at each distribution point. \u201cI don\u2019t want fans to see the same thing over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan, you\u2019re going to be shopping online; if we drop something at Urban Outfitters, you\u2019ll go to Urban; and if you\u2019re at the tour, you\u2019ll buy a T-shirt, too.\u201dOr, if you know your way around the resale market, you might go to eBay, Grailed or similar online marketplaces for the items you missed. After all, not everyone lives in the city where a store pops up or a tour stops. \u201cThe reselling culture is now crossing over into the world of music and merchandise,\u201d said Lawrence Schlossman, the brand director of Grailed. \u201cWith social media, when you see a line outside of a pop-up or you see people making money or getting a lot of likes and looking cool, that creates a hype cycle that feeds itself.\u201dStill, while the pop-up shops and exclusive items are a key for building attention, the moneymakers are the items that many consumers can afford and easily access. \u201cYou always need premium to sell the mass,\u201d Ms. Wong said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a Gucci bag at $5,000, but I\u2019ll buy a wallet for $700 and still be part of that lifestyle.\u201d And in fact, according to Edited, the artists who drive the most e-commerce traffic are Run-DMC, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Ramones (all Bravado clients). Not exactly of the moment.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge middle market in this trend,\u201d said Katie Smith, senior analyst at Edited. \u201cIt\u2019s not just buzzy, like, \u2018Check out the latest Pablo tee.\u2019\u201d (Pablo being from Kanye West\u2019s album \u201cThe Life of Pablo.\u201d) \u201cFor retail, there\u2019s still a big opportunity for the older, more known artists. That stuff doesn\u2019t sell as fast, but it performs very well.\u201dLaird Adamson, the head of international at Bravado, said: \u201cThere\u2019s an evergreen business that happens at Kohl\u2019s that\u2019s in constant replenishment. It\u2019s the stuff that lives there all day long, drives volume for us, doesn\u2019t make a lot of noise. And then there\u2019s us identifying with key retailers where every other month there\u2019s a different event happening. At Urban Outfitters, there\u2019s a Gaga event for one month. Then there\u2019s a Bieber event for two months and then that goes away.\u201d\u201cThe challenge I have on a daily basis is, \u2018How do we drive traffic to these stores?\u2019\u201d Mr. Bartolotta said. \u201cYou look at malls and you see traffic is down. We\u2019re bringing an experience that\u2019s being driven by the artists. When you do that, these retailers\u2019 appetites are stimulated. If we don\u2019t do this, we\u2019ll die like a lot of malls are dying.\u201dLike all successful brand builders, Mr. Vlasic and Ms. Wong know their references.Ms. Wong calls out \u201cArmani and Valentino and Prada\u201d because \u201cyou can look at it right away and know whose hand it is.

{"Headline": "Chef Sean Brock Puts Down the Bourbon and Begins a New Quest", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Sean Brock went to rehab.Mr. Brock wasn\u2019t the kind of chef who drank during work, but he was often the last man standing at the end of a night saturated with Budweiser and J\u00e4germeister. In some circles, his name had become a verb. After a long stretch on the line, one cook might look at another and say, \u201cLet\u2019s get Brocked.\u201d\u201cThe second I opened the door I knew exactly what was happening,\u201d he said in a recent interview at a cafe here. \u201cWe sat down and had us an old-fashioned intervention.\u201dBy all accounts, he came back a markedly different man from the angry, isolated star chef who more than one person, including Mr. Brock himself, suspected might die young. He had been coping with an autoimmune disease that threatened his eyesight, but he was falling apart emotionally, too.\u201cI was concerned about killing myself not by my choice, but by being unhealthy and miserable,\u201d he said.Counselors diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, not from a single event but from a pile of them. They told him that the part of his brain that controls behavior and emotion was essentially frozen.\u201cFreeze is the scariest, darkest place you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only emotion I knew was anger. I was miserable and angry at the world.\u201dToday his crazy giggle is back, and he is about 20 pounds lighter. Mr. Brock had never had a lick of personal therapy until he went to the Meadows. Now, he spends a few hours a day in self-care activities like meditation and reiki and is a regular at support groups and therapists\u2019 offices.He has taken up inner healing, boundary-setting and other bedrock emotional acts of recovery with the same intensity that drove him to raise an Ossabaw Island hog so he could deliver a perfect slice, cured and dressed in sorghum syrup and wild red bay laurel, as part of his $115 tasting menu at McCrady\u2019s.And he has a new mission. Forget cooking shrimp and grits, he said, using a much stronger verb. \u201cAnybody can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have this opportunity in front of me. If I can inspire people to take better care of themselves in this industry, that will be my greatest contribution.\u201dIt\u2019s not just about alcohol, he said. It\u2019s about teaching people in the restaurant business how to ask for help.\u201cSuffering is suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are addicted to porn on the internet or you\u2019re codependent or you\u2019re addicted to gambling or if you\u2019re addicted to \u2018The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u2019 You\u2019re suffering, and that\u2019s what gets us into trouble.\u201dThen again, Mr. Brock may be still riding what people in recovery call a pink cloud. Friends worry that talking so publicly about his recovery could jeopardize it, but they support him.\u201cIt\u2019s a way for him to be accountable and to do service,\u201d said his girlfriend, the publicist Adi Noe. \u201cI told him instead of being known for bourbon, you could be known for choosing recovery and choosing health.\u201dThe festival was the first one Mr. Brock had attended sober. He hosted a ham and bourbon seminar with the Kentucky distillers Preston Van Winkle and Drew Kulsveen. Not one of the 60 people who attended asked him why he wasn\u2019t drinking. Later, he went upstairs to the chill space. \u201cIt was the safest I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d he said.Over lunch in Atlanta the next day, Mr. Brock said he hoped the intervention was a final piece of punctuation on years of extreme highs and lows.He grew up in rural Virginia with a father who worked overtime hauling coal and a mother who read Gourmet magazine. He was 11 when his dad died of a heart attack; he watched it happen, something he didn\u2019t even tell Ms. Noe until recently.By age 15, he was working in a restaurant. \u201cI found a place to hide in the shadows,\u201d he said. \u201cI found a place where I was safe, I was secure and surrounded by people just like me. I didn\u2019t leave.\u201dThere is another curveball thrown in Mr. Brock\u2019s story. In January 2014, while holed up in his Nashville apartment nursing a kneecap he had smashed in a fall on the ice, he woke with double vision. His eyelids wouldn\u2019t behave. One would droop while the other would pop open.His vision became so bad that he couldn\u2019t drive, and had to bend over to see the food he was cooking. After a year and a half of tests and several brutal eye surgeries, he was given a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disease that interferes with the way nerves and muscles communicate. At its worst, it can take away the ability to swallow and, eventually, breathe. At best, it might go into remission.Managing the symptoms requires rest and a drug cocktail that includes the steroid prednisone. Mr. Brock didn\u2019t rest much. Feeling more creative than he had in a couple of years, he threw himself into remaking McCrady\u2019s as a dual restaurant, with a high-end American tavern on one side and his boutique experimental dining counter on the other.With Ms. Noe watching over him, he tried to slow down and drink less. He preached the virtues of rest and gluten-free eating. He said he wanted to become an advocate for research into his disease and for a more balanced approach to restaurant work.\u201cHe had lost his ability to see himself,\u201d said Patty Bundy, a marriage and family therapist in Roanoke, Va. whose daughter, Melany Robinson, is Mr. Brock\u2019s publicist and was one of the architects of his intervention. Ms. Noe, an executive director for Ms. Robinson\u2019s public relations company, confided frequently in Dr. Bundy.\u201cThe article made it clear he was springing leaks all over the place,\u201d Dr. Bundy said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that goes well as the ship\u2019s going down.\u201dFights at home became so frequent that neither he nor Ms. Noe could remember what it was like not to be in conflict. She would go to bed and he would rummage around his bourbon collection, drinking and staring at the wall until he could sleep.At work, he was moody and demanding. He punched walls. One day, he went to plate a dish and realized he couldn\u2019t make his hand move properly. \u201cI threw the spoon down and panicked,\u201d he said.\u201cYou get angry, and that anger just builds and builds into rage, and you hurt a lot of people around you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to survive. You\u2019re gasping for air.\u201dWhen it was over, he checked into a Nashville hotel just to be alone. Meanwhile, people who saw him at Blackberry Farm called Ms. Robinson. She and Ms. Noe decided it was finally time to act, and with Dr. Bundy\u2019s help, they planned their intervention.\u201cIn a short period of time, he\u2019s gone from a young guy from a little town in Virginia to a point where he can\u2019t walk down the street in Charleston or New York without someone identifying him,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a blessing and a burden, and requires you to always be on point. With that comes addiction.\u201dMr. Brock\u2019s rebirth, as he calls it, could help change an industry that has always demanded too much.Before he returned to Nashville in March, he made sure that Ms. Noe had moved his precious bourbon collection to the garage. There was so much that she had to spread the work out over a week, being careful not to damage bottles that could command thousands of dollars apiece.Mr. Brock sold them all and used some of the cash to buy a black 1969 Plymouth Road Runner on eBay. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted that car since I was a little kid,\u201d he said. \u201cMy garage used to be full of bourbon. Now there\u2019s my childhood obsession.\u201dNo one around him doubts that there are tests to come even though the double vision is at bay, he is taking less medicine, and his head is clear. Though he has slowed down, the projects are stacking up. In coming months, he and Mr. Howard plan to open Husks in Greenville, S.C., and Savannah, Ga. A major television project is in the works.Mostly he plans to enjoy his freedom.\u201cSurrendering,\u201d he said, \u201cis the greatest feeling on the face of the planet.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Award-Winning Philanthropists Explain the Roots of Their Giving", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersLong before Jeffrey Skoll helped Pierre Omidyar build eBay into a company that made them both billionaires, he wanted to tell stories. He said a yearlong backpacking trip to Pakistan and India after he graduated from college opened his eyes to a world he didn\u2019t know.Coming out of Stanford University\u2019s business school in 1995, he was hired by Mr. Omidyar as the auction site\u2019s first employee. He wrote the business plan the company followed, and when eBay went public in 1998 he was wealthy beyond belief. His estimated net worth is $5.6 billion, according to Wealth-X, a financial research firm.\u201cThis is where the philanthropy part starts for me,\u201d Mr. Skoll said in an interview. \u201cI was tasked with finding a way to share the success of the company with the people who helped make it what it was. I decided to start a company foundation.\u201dAfter that foundation was up and running, he returned to his desire to tell stories, now as someone with the means to fund people and their ideas.\u201cWe gravitated to the idea of social entrepreneurs when it was a fairly nascent thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe began to build the organization, focused on investing in and celebrating social entrepreneurs. Not long after that, we realized there was another opportunity to help bring them together and tell their stories.\u201dSince then, telling stories to bring awareness to issues has been the unifying force of his giving. That includes the Skoll Awards, which recognize social entrepreneurs, and his funding for documentary and feature films like \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d on climate change, and \u201cSpotlight,\u201d on the cover-up of clergy sexual abuse in Boston, which won two Academy Awards.From the start of the Skoll Awards, in 2004, the aim was to do more \u201cthan just giving people a grant,\u201d he said.\u201cWe felt that a lot of social entrepreneurs do very hard work and they\u2019re on the front lines,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut most of them are not very well known. We felt that part of our mission was to create a ceremony where these folks are given more notoriety.\u201dHow the biggest philanthropists in America choose their causes isn\u2019t always apparent from how they made their money. But those donors who have put a lot of thought into their choices not only have the best success in keeping themselves focused on those projects but also on making an impact on issues where billions of dollars could easily be squandered.\u201cWith the really wealthy, they begin to realize their power and their ability to have impact,\u201d said Ann Limberg, head for philanthropic solutions and the family office of U.S. Trust. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to put a Band-Aid on it. They want to create change.\u201dAn admirable aspiration but not an easy one to fulfill. \u201cFor wealthy donors, the greatest challenge they have is finding what causes they care about and where they\u2019re going to donate,\u201d Ms. Limberg added.U.S. Trust and the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University found in a recent study that two-thirds of wealthy donors struggled with this decision.Most people who give to charity start off with donations to their alma mater, their house of worship or a hospital or social service agency that helped them, according to the annual Giving USA report, which found that charitable giving was up 2.7 percent, to $390 billion, in 2016.A separate report commissioned for the biannual Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy \u2014 of which Mr. Skoll is one of nine recipients this year \u2014 found that most philanthropists go through a six- to seven-step process in their evolution as philanthropists.What begins as reactive giving \u2014 a cause catches their attention, a friend asks for a donation \u2014 evolves into proactive charity, and for a few, the type of philanthropy and strategic giving that can bring about change.Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation \u2014 which announced this year\u2019s winners in June and will award the philanthropy medals in October \u2014 said the recipients were selected for having given consistently through their lives to causes focused on people. The medal serves to shine a spotlight on what they have done.Another of this year\u2019s winners, Julian Robertson, the hedge fund pioneer who created Tiger Management, began giving early in his career to his alma maters, the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va., and the University of North Carolina. As his wealth grew, he said, he began expanding his giving to areas that could be seen as having a focus on education or research.He is active in funding the creation of charter schools in New York City and has made several large donations to Teach for America. He said he was also proud of the money he had given to cancer research.\u201cYou get it right some times on some things,\u201d Mr. Robertson said.Philanthropists whose major giving rose out of their careers said it was a natural extension of their work.Kristine McDivitt Tompkins\u2019s philanthropy came out of the culture in which she worked. She was an early employee at Patagonia, the outdoor apparel company, where she became chief executive. In the early 1990s, she married Douglas Tompkins, a founder of the North Face, another outdoor apparel company.Her life was intertwined with being outdoors and enjoying nature. Conservation and protection of the natural world was a logical extension of her philanthropy.Together she and Mr. Tompkins, who died in 2015, have donated millions of acres to Chile and Argentina for national forest land. This year, she worked with the government of Chile to turn 11 million acres \u2014 three times the size of Yosemite National Park \u2014 into national park land.\u201cIf we can finish up what we started, we\u2019ll have 11 national parks created and 12 million to 15 million acres conserved,\u201d Ms. Tompkins, also a Carnegie Medal winner, said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good about what we\u2019ve accomplished so far.\u201dH. F. Lenfest, whose cable company was acquired by Comcast in 2000, said he looked to do the most good for institutions and places that had helped him, like Columbia University, where he went to law school, and the city of Philadelphia, where his cable company was based.But after he came to own Philadelphia\u2019s two main newspapers and news website, Mr. Lenfest, another of this year\u2019s Carnegie Medal winners, started to think about how he could ensure that the institutions remained viable.\u201cI saw the erosion of circulation and advertising over the years, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before printed newspapers go out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cI created the Lenfest Institute of Journalism to try to solve that problem of what will happen when the printed newspaper is no longer around.\u201dMs. Limberg of U.S. Trust said developing a philanthropic focus could involve defining the giver\u2019s \u201cvalue set\u201d \u2014 an exercise that donors big or small could benefit from.She gave an example of a person who had been giving to mental health charities for years and wanted to do more but didn\u2019t know how. After meeting with several neuroscientists, the donor focused his giving on autism research.\u201cIt\u2019s about helping people get smarter about how they do it and make them feel like they\u2019re evolving,\u201d Ms. Limberg said.Mr. Skoll said that in the past 18 years he had made mistakes along the way. But what has kept him focused, he said, was \u201chaving a game plan from the start.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carrying On a Legacy of Early-American Collecting", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShow Us Your WallHere are edited excerpts from a recent conversation with Noah Wunsch.Has your grandfather\u2019s approach to collecting inspired you?Absolutely. He would study something to death to make sure he fully understood the genre. I\u2019m an obsessive reader and always make sure I educate myself on anything I\u2019m interested in. I try to respect the way my grandfather collected while also listening to my own tastes. I think there\u2019s something really interesting about having these abstract pieces by Eric Mack, a contemporary artist who usually works in textile, along with early American decorative and a work by Thornton Dial, an outsider artist.This drawing of a stooped figure is an unusual Thornton Dial, quieter than his typical work.You can see it as a very sad piece or a very hopeful piece. The figure is carrying a heart. He\u2019s burdened. It\u2019s a question of whether he is longing for someone or whether he has just been broken by someone.What was an important early acquisition?How do you tend to find things?I scour all the auction pages to see what they\u2019re offering. If there\u2019s something I like, I cross-reference eBay, 1stdibs and the galleries themselves to see if the prices are any better. I found this highly stylized Kuramata vase at a gallery in Japan that deals with radical design, and it was much more reasonable than I expected. I threw away a bunch of clothing to fit it into my suitcase so I could dodge the shipping charges.What\u2019s on your current wish list?Is there any advice you give to other young collectors?Buy what you like. If you think you\u2019re making a good investment, kudos.

{"Headline": "What to Do With the Swastika in the Attic?", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionI once thought there were a few things on which Americans all could agree, and that \u201cNazis are bad\u201d was among them. I\u2019ve recently been unnerved to discover, or to be reminded, that this is not the case.I hoped it might end with the election \u2014 that, when the political frenzy faded, the activity of neo-Nazis emboldened by Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy would dwindle. It didn\u2019t.That\u2019s before you get to the internet. There, people are just flinging swastikas everywhere, like confetti at a surprise party in hell.I figure it\u2019s about time to do something with that swastika in the attic.I must have seen it for the first time in childhood. The red edges are ragged; this circle, four feet across, cut from a giant banner and signed by the men in my grandfather\u2019s United States Army unit, the 460th Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion. They made it to the Berghof, Hitler\u2019s retreat in the Bavarian Alps, in the spring of 1945. The war was over when they got there. My grandpa took the flag. A souvenir.Every swastika I see reminds me of this one. How it is darkened all over with stains and dirt. Or, as my grandpa would have said, schmutz.\u201cYou have to understand,\u201d is how my grandpa\u2019s sentences about the war usually began. When I think about it now I realize this inheritance came with no other instructions \u2014 including about where to keep it.I\u2019m not sure which new swastika flicked some switch in me. But after the election I decided, with conviction so intense it was almost alarming, our flag needs to be seen.The swastika hummed with violence, like something cursed, or alive.The first thing I learned in my quest to get this bit of Nazi paraphernalia out of my parents\u2019 house was that it is actually pretty difficult to offload a swastika.When I reached out to the National World War II Museum donations department directly, I learned that what I have, besides an unambiguous symbol of evil incarnate, is a classic supply and demand problem.\u201cIf ever a figure in history surrounded himself with flags, it was Adolf Hitler,\u201d Robert Citino, the senior historian at the museum, told me. \u201cIf Hitler was driving down the street in Berlin, there were \u2014 this is a conservative estimate \u2014 50,000 flags on that street. Nobody were flag-wavers like the Nazis.\u201d\u201cJust as Nazi Germany was awash in these flags, we may be getting to the point where museums are awash in flags,\u201d Dr. Citino said.The law has a loophole: Thanks to the autographs of men in my grandfather\u2019s unit, my swastika was eligible for donation. \u201cThe signed ones are the ones we covet the most,\u201d Toni Kiser, assistant director for collections management at the World War II Museum told me.I expected a rigorous authentication process, but Ms. Kiser says there isn\u2019t one: \u201cWe do often take people \u2014 to an extent \u2014 at their word.\u201d Since there\u2019s no money and little glory in artifact donation (only 1 percent to 2 percent of the collection is on view at any given time), \u201cfaking it wouldn\u2019t be worth your while,\u201d she said. Discharge papers, as well as a photo of the relevant soldier in uniform, generally suffice. I have both. My grandpa saved his discharge papers in the original envelope.Less than two weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, I boarded a plane to New Orleans. In Dr. Citino\u2019s sunlit, book-lined office, Ms. Kiser asked me, \u201cDid you feel weird walking around with a Nazi flag in your purse?\u201dI admitted that I did.I\u2019d spent much of the morning in a new exhibition, \u201cState of Deception: The Power of Nazi Propaganda.\u201d It opened the same day that President Trump issued an executive order barring Syrian refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. I was stunned by the installation\u2019s unplanned prescience. The language of religious fear mongering has changed little since the 1930s. It felt as if the present was plagiarizing the past.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to say whether the swastika has an up or down trend right now,\u201d Dr. Citino said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what definitely has an up trend, whether you find a swastika or not: anti-Semitism. Incontrovertible.\u201dRising Islamophobia, he added, is not a distraction but an accelerant. \u201cI think hatred begets more hatred. You start developing a taste for it.\u201dThe official deed of gift came by mail. I \u201cirrevocably and unconditionally\u201d gave the flag to the museum. A letter from Ms. Kiser promises me the flag will be treated with care. We\u2019d been keeping it in a two-gallon Ziploc bag, so I\u2019m confident this was an improvement.Amid my relief that the swastika was no longer haunting my apartment, it occurred to me: Maybe I\u2019m more hopeful than I realize. Otherwise I would have insisted we keep the flag in the family. I would not have given it away unless I thought there was a decent chance that the future would see this savage history for what it really was. That even when weak, reckless people, generations from now, still delight in this emblem of hate, there will be someone to look after this flag, to say to everyone who sees it: You have to understand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Karaoke at Home", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationEarly in my life, without any supporting evidence, I fretted over what I believed was my fate: accidentally becoming an international pop star. The pages of my diary were filled with hypothetical ethical dilemmas. Could I at least retire early, or would that deprive my 20 million fans of my voice? What if world peace depended on my continuing to sing? I was 10 and lived almost entirely in my mind. In retrospect, this fixation was a heightened version of my parents\u2019 very real fear that they would lose me to the ravenous, nightmarish black hole that was American culture.While I was growing up in Flushing, Queens, we socialized exclusively with other Chinese immigrants. I was forbidden to make contact with nonapproved, non-Chinese peers outside school. That was fine with me. We went to parties every weekend at some family friend\u2019s house that always concluded the same way: an adult drunkenly puking and another one turning on the karaoke machine.Americans are just now settling into the age of doing things communally by staying at home, but Chinese karaoke technology has been around for decades. While Americans tend to do karaoke onstage at a bar in front of strangers, in Asia and in most Asian-American neighborhoods, you rent out private rooms or have a full setup at your place. It\u2019s not uncommon to sing all by yourself, either: Recently, young people in urban China have started frequenting self-service karaoke booths that link to social-media apps so users can share their perform\u00adances online. Whenever my parents traveled back to the homeland they would always return with the newest home-karaoke technology. The early models filled an entire checked-in suitcase, massive clunkers that took LaserDiscs.The adults \u2014 drunk or sober, it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 would gather around the machine for hours to belt out old standards from their youth, as well as the occasional Communist anthem about smashing Western imperialism and plenty of Teresa Teng, the Taiwanese pop sensation. I was the oldest of a coterie of kids, and I had to see to it that we made an appearance, usually with our hands over our ears. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t ask us to sing,\u2019\u2019 we\u2019d warn pre-emptively. Still, I fantasized about singing to a crowd of revelers, only to freeze up every time the microphone was thrust in my face. None of the karaoke machines ever had English songs, anyway.Karaoke was my family\u2019s happy secret. In those early years in America, like many immigrants, my parents struggled with poverty and loneliness, but they also built provisional families, and inside our bubble there was joy, understanding, an intimate language I could never translate \u2014 and above all there was song. Out there, we were flat-faced, all-look-the-same nobodies. But in our own homes, I saw how my parents and their friends could be loose, free and loud.In the middle of seventh grade, we moved to a white suburb on Long Island, and everything changed. Not only was the drive back to Queens long enough to make trips infrequent, but with the high of our newfound class mobility came crushing paranoia that the tentacles of American individualism, recklessness and narcissism were coming for me, and so my parents clamped down even harder. Meanwhile, among my classmates, I no longer flew under the radar; instead, I was singled out, and my ethnicity made me a target for mockery. Faced with ostracization at school and confinement at home, I turned to karaoke. That year, my mother returned to Shanghai and came back with yet another karaoke machine. \u2018\u2018It has English songs,\u2019\u2019 she said, pulling out a LaserDisc that came free with the system. I recognized two of them. I feigned nonchalance, but the next day after school when no one was home, I turned it on and began to learn the words to \u2018\u2018What\u2019s Up\u2019\u2019 by 4 Non Blondes.Accomplished vocalist I was not, but it felt good to belt out someone else\u2019s words. The rage I didn\u2019t know what to do with \u2014 for having to endure racism and bullying from my peers, for the intense isolation my parents put me through \u2014 slipped free of my body, and I felt worthwhile, dazzling even. At school, I was reviled; at home, I could shake the walls with my voice until the moon rose in the sky \u2014 or at least until my parents came home from work.The latest in Chinese home karaoke \u2014 a portable microphone that connects to your smartphone, with a built-in speaker \u2014 has now made solo singing more appealing than ever. Last week, after a surge of renewed anxiety about the world, I ordered a knockoff from eBay, and alone in my cramped New York apartment, I put my new rose gold microphone up to my lips. I felt like the speaker in the William Carlos Williams poem \u2018\u2018Danse Russe,\u2019\u2019 who dances naked in front of the mirror once his wife, baby and nanny have gone to sleep and sings to no one: \u2018\u2018I am lonely, lonely./I was born to be lonely,/I am best so!\u2019\u2019 I cued up a song and suddenly realized that I wasn\u2019t lonely, lonely. No longer that dim creature who lived subterraneously for years, longing to perform while terrified of an audience, I told myself a small New York lie: All my neighbors are at work \u2014 surely no one can hear me. And I took a deep breath, and I sang at the top of my lungs, \u2018\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

Hampered by Deep Split on Board", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Some members of Uber\u2019s eight-person board were excited about the idea of Meg Whitman becoming the ride-hailing company\u2019s next chief executive.The jockeying between factions has put billions of dollars on the line, as the Uber board fights over control of the $70 billion ride-hailing giant. Interviews with more than a dozen people close to the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential, indicate that board members\u2019 relationships have been damaged by leaks, shifting wildly as alliances are forged and then broken.Four people are now on the shortlist to succeed Mr. Kalanick, according to one person close to the process. And at an internal meeting with Uber employees last week, Liane Hornsey, the company\u2019s senior vice president and head of human resources, said a top candidate was expected to be chosen within the next six weeks.Representatives for Uber, the company\u2019s board of directors and Mr. Kalanick declined to comment, as did G.E.\u201cAs Meg has made clear, she is fully committed to H.P.E.,\u201d a spokesman for Hewlett Packard Enterprise said. \u201cOur focus remains on driving the company forward and delivering for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders.\u201dThe Uber board \u2014 which recently added new members amid a history of internal tensions \u2014 is mostly split into two camps. On one side is Mr. Kalanick, who is plotting a comeback. On the other are many of the company\u2019s other directors, including the venture capitalist Matt Cohler and the private equity investor David Trujillo, who represent Uber investors like Benchmark and TPG Capital. Garrett Camp, an Uber co-founder, and Ryan Graves, an early employee, were part of this group in supporting Ms. Whitman\u2019s candidacy last week.The positions of some board members \u2014 such as Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive, and Yasir Al Rumayyan, who represents Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2014 are unclear.The changing alliances have led to major disagreements within the board. Some members are upset that no chief financial officer has been appointed, even though the job has been vacant for more than two years.A spokesman for SoftBank declined to comment.According to people with knowledge of the quarterly meeting last Thursday, board members\u2019 cellphones started buzzing during the evening with text messages regarding Ms. Whitman\u2019s removing herself from consideration. Some board members appeared crestfallen that the person they viewed as the most attractive candidate had taken herself out of the running so publicly days before she planned to spend time with the few board members she had not yet met.In a text message between those involved in the discussions that was shown to The New York Times, one person reacted to Ms. Whitman\u2019s announcement with a grim laugh, punctuated by an expletive.After the news of Ms. Whitman\u2019s decision sank in, the board members continued the meeting. By the end of the evening, they had agreed to a truce in hopes of avoiding another negative round of media coverage, according to the people familiar with the meeting. Communicating directly and avoiding backstabbing, the directors agreed, was paramount from here on.After all, they still had a new chief executive to find.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Rebooting Justice,\u2019 a Call to Help the Lawyerless in Court", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe current debate over how to solve the health care crisis provides a relevant backdrop to a provocative new book that proposes a wide range of solutions to the crisis in another sector whose availability in extreme circumstances can also mean the difference between life and death: legal services.In medicine and law, it appears that the appellation \u201ccrisis\u201d comes to apply only when longstanding challenges faced by the poor in obtaining essential services begin to affect the middle class. The sweeping narrative of \u201cRebooting Justice\u201d encompasses both the criminal and civil legal systems.Although failures in criminal justice \u2014 highlighted most graphically by those on death row later exonerated by DNA evidence \u2014 grab headlines, it is the fundamental breakdown of the civil justice apparatus that is most likely to affect the daily life of the middle class. Whether dealing with a divorce, the estate of a parent, a personal injury, personal bankruptcy, a business dispute or a disagreement with some government entity, very few of us manage to go through life without needing a lawyer.Yet increasingly, since the 1980s, most cannot afford one. But the relevant legal institutions have not adjusted to reflect this new reality. This has particularly harsh results when one of the litigants can afford a lawyer and the other cannot.So, for instance, in many major cities, landlord-tenant disputes are characterized by more than 90 percent of the tenants\u2019 being unrepresented and a similar percentage of landlords being happily lawyered-up. You do not need a law degree to know how that movie ends.Many of the most compelling proposals of \u201cRebooting Justice\u201d revolve around using technological tools and institutional reforms to more effectively support the overwhelmingly lawyerless who seek redress from the courts.Another striking similarity between the debates over our heath care and legal systems is the extent to which the possibility of intelligent discourse is undermined by a confused framing of the fundamental issue. In the health domain, the problem is presented as the availability of adequate insurance, rather than the availability of adequate care (which insurance may or may not facilitate).In the legal domain, the problem is presented as the availability of lawyers, rather than the availability of justice. And, as Mr. Barton and Mr. Bibas convincingly demonstrate after surveying the research, in many contexts the presence of more lawyers actually reduces the speed and effectiveness of achieving justice.One particularly significant difference between health and the law is a poorly understood structural obstacle to actually legislating common-sense solutions to the crisis in legal services. Whatever one thinks of Obamacare or any of the proffered alternatives, there is not much controversy over Congress\u2019 authority since the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the Affordable Care Act. But in the legal realm, the profession has to date managed to largely insulate itself from potential outside interference. How it achieved this feat is itself a fascinating story.Few realize that the long-accepted understanding that courts have the final say on the interpretation of laws in general is not explicitly established by the Constitution. Instead, the seminal 1803 Supreme Court decision, Marbury v. Madison, enshrined this principle, which has been accepted by all branches of government ever since.Similarly, state courts have simply asserted that they have \u201cinherent authority\u201d over the administration of the legal system. Under this view, rules governing lawyers, as \u201cofficers of the court,\u201d and the practice of law in theory are \u201cnot subject to legislative reversal or encroachment.\u201d \u201cRebooting Justice\u201d painstakingly documents how this clearly self-interested legal doctrine has been abused by courts in an unholy alliance with bar associations to shield lawyers from competition at the expense of the public.This regime has spawned the twin pillars of the current crisis. On the one hand, providing any legal services typically requires attendance at a law school whose accreditation requirements \u2014 often entailing an expensive library, burdensome faculty guidelines, three years of course requirements and more \u2014 impose a prodigious entry barrier and an equally prodigious debt burden on graduates. On the other hand, once admitted, members benefit from a secretive disciplinary process that almost never results in penalties or expulsion, combined with aggressive policing of the \u201cunauthorized practice of law\u201d should any nonlawyer try to assist a litigant unable to afford the real deal.One of the biggest surprises of this enlightening and well-written book is that its authors are highly regarded law professors, with extensive experience not only as academics but as practitioners. The surprise is not primarily that it is against their self-interest as established members of the club. Rather it is because the most powerful innovations documented in \u201cRebooting Justice\u201d appear to have sprung from the creative minds of nonlawyers.For example, the dispute resolution software developed internally at eBay \u2014 and subsequently licensed as a \u201cfairness engine\u201d applied to a wide range of alternative domestic and international settings \u2014 was the brainchild of a former Peace Corps volunteer, Colin Rule. More broadly, a startling number of the entrepreneurs who are reshaping the legal landscape for the better have come from outside the profession. For example, Law360, which changed the way legal news is collected and reported, was founded by two graduate students who were neither lawyers nor American.Since so many of the innovations that have had the effect of actually improving things have come from nonlawyers, the legal establishment\u2019s continued protection of the status quo \u2014 all justified under the spurious guise of \u201cconsumer protection\u201d \u2014 is all the more indefensible.Mr. Barton and Mr. Bibas have used their deep knowledge of the culture, history and institutions involved to identify which specific functions can be at least as effectively performed by laymen or technology. They also demonstrate how corresponding adjustments to the roles still played by full-fledged lawyers \u2014 most notably, judges \u2014 should enable the system to generate more justice with fewer lawyers.Now if only we could get Mr. Barton and Mr. Bibas to focus on the health care crisis.Jonathan A.
