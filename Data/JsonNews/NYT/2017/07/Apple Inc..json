{"Headline": "Inside Yelp\u2019s Six-Year Grudge Against Google", "Date": "2017-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp, the local search and reviewing site, would like this article to be focused on his company\u2019s growth, or on how its reviews help independent businesses, or on pretty much anything besides what it is about: how Yelp became Google\u2019s most tenacious pest.\u201cIf you were to have asked me 15 years ago, \u2018Hey, are you going to be an antitrust crusader?\u2019 I would have said, \u2018No, I have no interest in that,\u2019\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThat was not a childhood dream.\u201dGoogle wasn\u2019t always a rival. At one point, it was a suitor. But out of that union that never happened was born a mighty grudge, perhaps even an obsession.At one point, Yelp held a hackathon to create a sort of alternate-universe Google, the better for it to explain Google\u2019s ways to regulators. And then you have Luther Lowe.Unlike Google, whose office is full of artwork and free food, Yelp\u2019s Washington presence is just a rented co-working space. So Mr. Lowe keeps the elephant at Yelp\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, where there is more room. \u201cThis is a shoestring operation,\u201d he said.Asked about future investigations, Margrethe Vestager, the antitrust chief, offered a diplomatic answer, saying that even though other cases make similar allegations against Google, they must be considered one by one.\u201cThe one thing that has sort of changed from yesterday, before the decision was taken, was that now we will consider Google as a dominant company,\u201d she said.Yelp is one of a number of American companies \u2014 Microsoft and Oracle are others \u2014 that have agitated for the world\u2019s governments to take up the fight against Google. It is one tiny player, but through persistence and doggedness, and by being loud and public with its complaints, it has become an unusually prominent voice.Mr. Stoppelman feels he has no choice. Like a lot of small internet companies, Yelp lives in a world where one company, Google, accounts for an outsize share of its business, and could destroy it at any time. Its complaints to regulators are less about working toward some epic and definitive conclusion than they are about continuously brushing back the giant so Yelp can have more room to grow.\u201cIt\u2019s like, you get traffic from this company, and this company is a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re me, it seems like the obvious move.\u201dYelp\u2019s campaign against Google provides an inside look at a constant battle in the technology industry: the conflict between large companies that control how people use technology and the internet, and the smaller, more vulnerable businesses that live inside those platforms.Be it Netscape, whose 1990s-era internet browser was the catalyst for antitrust charges against Microsoft and its Windows operating system, or Spotify, whose music service must now compete with Apple\u2019s own music app, any company trying to build a business on another company\u2019s system runs the risk of being snuffed out or swallowed up.For Yelp, the issue is where Google displays \u201corganic\u201d website rankings \u2014 the ones spit out by its algorithm \u2014 in relation to the \u201cvertical\u201d results that Google itself provides.For example, say you searched for \u201csteakhouse New York.\u201d The first set of results, consuming the entire screen of a mobile phone, is a map and a set of restaurants from Google\u2019s local offering. The results have information like hours, stars and customer reviews. Below that are links to reviews, articles and other sites. Like Yelp.Yelp\u2019s contention is that by putting its own results at the top, Google is giving itself an unfair advantage, because those results don\u2019t have to jump through the same algorithmic hoops non-Google sites are subjected to. And since Yelp says few people go beyond the first or second result, companies like Yelp are made invisible.Local queries \u2014 such as looking for nearby restaurants \u2014 account for roughly a third of all search traffic. So Google has a big incentive to keep people within its search engine, where it can sell ads, instead of sending them to Yelp, which also sells ads.This dispute would be moot if people were in the habit of using a variety of search engines. Google has become so universally known and depended upon that it is sometimes hard to remember that it is a company, and it exists to make money.But as Microsoft learned in its 1990s antitrust battle, companies can face a heap of legal problems when their platform becomes so popular that people hardly use anything else. With one strike against it now in Europe, Google may be increasingly careful about how it treats competitors throughout the search engine.\u201cEven if nothing else takes place, a consequence of this kind of intervention, so visible and so significant, has been to give other firms more room to maneuver,\u201d said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the United States Federal Trade Commission and now a professor at the George Washington University Law School.Google is sitting on close to $100 billion in cash, so the $2.7 billion fine \u2014 a sum larger than Yelp\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 is hardly unmanageable.A larger concern is that the decision, and the potential for other antitrust actions, will limit Google\u2019s ability to position ads around its search box. And for all the talk about self-driving cars and delivery drones, Google is still the foundation of a big advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been as concerned as we are following this ruling,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, after the fine was announced.The impact is hard to discern, because it\u2019s impossible to judge whether Google has done wrong \u2014 and if so, how to make things right \u2014 without delving into minute detail about software algorithms and concepts like \u201cconsumer harm.\u201d Explaining all that, in a way that ordinary people can understand, has been Yelp\u2019s principal challenge with regulators. The war over how Google serves up information has been an information war.In summer 2004, a few months before the highly anticipated moment when Google first took its shares to market, Mr. Stoppelman got the flu. He searched the internet for a doctor, but instead of learning anything \u2014 like whether a doctor\u2019s patients were satisfied, or the ease of getting an appointment \u2014 he kept landing on insurance websites.This gave him an idea: How about a site where users rate and review local services? He and a co-founder got $1 million from investors and began work on the site that became Yelp. A year later, Yelp signed a two-year licensing deal that allowed Google to use Yelp content.\u201cIt was better to be friends than enemies at that stage,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said.Later, when the deal came up for renewal, Google told Mr. Stoppelman that it would soon add a feature allowing its own users to review and rate local services. Worried that Google wanted to create a parallel service that would snuff out his company, Mr. Stoppelman declined to renew the license.By 2011, Google was facing inquiries by various federal and state authorities along with regulators in Europe and Asia. It had steadily added services focused on areas like local businesses, comparison shopping and travel, and companies were complaining that it was giving its own properties preferred treatment in results.That year, Mr. Stoppelman got worried about something else. Google, he said, was taking Yelp\u2019s reviews and using them in Google products that competed with Yelp. When he raised these concerns, he said, Google responded that it was displaying information derived from search results, and that if Yelp objected, it could simply withhold its content from the search engine.Given Google\u2019s market share, the response amounted to saying \u201ctake yourself off the internet,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cThat would have destroyed the company, so it was a false choice.\u201dYelp took its first step into the regulatory arena that July, when Vince Sollitto, the company\u2019s senior vice president for communications and government relations, accused Google of stealing Yelp content at a conference of state attorneys general.The next day, according to Mr. Stoppelman, a Google executive sent him an email saying it would stop. A Google spokesman said the decision had been made long before, and was unrelated to the prosecutors\u2019 gathering. Nonetheless, Yelp concluded that there was no better way to get Google\u2019s attention than to raise the specter of regulation.\u201cThe pattern was that they would do something pushing the envelope or, frankly, evil, and we would complain about it privately, and they would say they would fix it, and nothing would happen,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cWe realized that if we were going to get what we wanted, we had to be very scrappy.\u201d\u201cI thought, this is a chance to totally refine our strategy,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.Mr. Lowe is from Arkansas and speaks with a slight drawl. He is passionate and garrulous and has a habit of sometimes tattooing his audience with a mix of detailed history and arcane policy points about Yelp\u2019s problems with Google. He is crushed if listeners don\u2019t find it to be as big a deal as he does.He said he learned some hard lessons when the F.T.C. closed its Google investigation. The first was that antitrust law is boring, complicated and political. The second was that technology is difficult to explain, even to regulators.Mr. Sollitto, who made the presentation at the prosecutors\u2019 meeting, said that during the trade commission\u2019s case, he had found himself making imperfect analogies, such as the one that Google was the only store in town and put all of its own products on the best shelves. Not an unusual thing for a merchant to do, he concedes, except that Google puts competitors\u2019 products on shelves that are out of reach.\u201cWe were having a difficult time explaining to the F.T.C. why consumers were harmed,\u201d he said.In March 2013, Mr. Lowe asked Yelp engineers if they could build an online simulator showing what Google would look like if its own services had to live by the algorithm dictating the position of third-party services, like Yelp.\u201cThey need something they can touch and experience,\u201d he wrote in an email.During a company hackathon, engineers created software that produced pages of search results ranked purely by an algorithm and compared them with Google\u2019s presentation. Their conclusion, which Google disputes, is that Google was providing its users with less useful information by steering them to its own products instead of results from around the web.That month, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, then the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, announced he was discussing a possible settlement with Google, and asked interested parties for comments. In addition to the legal documents it had sent to the F.T.C., Yelp submitted a white paper that it said showed users preferred outside companies\u2019 results over Google\u2019s in-house products.\u201cYou can do PowerPoints all day long, but it\u2019s hard for people to understand until they can sit in the driver\u2019s seat and come up with their own searches and see the results for themselves,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.When Mr. Almunia\u2019s term ended without a settlement, and Ms. Vestager became Europe\u2019s new head of competition, Yelp went into a full-on political campaign. Mr. Lowe started building a small European government-relations operation, which he staffed with employees from companies and consumer groups that were also pursuing complaints about Google.Mr. Lowe bid for it online, and ended up spending $3,000. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I had to have it,\u201d he said.A few months after Europe filed its first antitrust charges, Microsoft withdrew its regulatory complaints against the search giant because of \u201cchanging legal priorities.\u201d Last year, it dropped out of FairSearch, an anti-Google industry group.Mr. Stoppelman said Yelp had no real choice but to keep at the regulators. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the overall competition playbook for us,\u201d he said.It would be hard to find a drier assessment than the one from Mark Mahaney, a veteran internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco. Mr. Mahaney covers both Google\u2019s stock and Yelp\u2019s. Right now, he recommends buying Google, but not Yelp.Asked about Yelp\u2019s regulatory battles with Google, Mr. Mahaney said he had no idea what kind of impact, if any, it might have on the company\u2019s prospects. Still, it never hurts to try.\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the decision by Yelp to go to regulators made a lot of business sense.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Microsoft Has Become the Surprise Innovator in PCs", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWhen Microsoft unveiled the first Surface tablet five years ago, it was a spectacular failure.At the time, the Apple iPhone was well on its way to conquering the technology industry, and the iPad appeared set to lead an even more devastating invasion of Microsoft\u2019s office-worker kingdom. Microsoft conceived of Surface, an innovative laptop-tablet hybrid, as a way to show off the versatility of its software. Windows machines, it argued, could work as phones, personal computers and tablets. And didn\u2019t everyone love Windows?Still, Microsoft persisted \u2014 and today, the company is making the most visionary computers in the industry, if not the best machines, period. In the last two years, while Apple has focused mainly on mobile devices, Microsoft has put out a series of computers that reimagine the future of PCs in thrilling ways.Yet perhaps because it\u2019s way behind Apple, Microsoft\u2019s hardware division is creating products more daring than much of what has been coming out of its rival lately.The hybrid Surface Pro \u2014 the inheritor of that first Surface\u2019s vision, the latest version of which was released in May \u2014 hasn\u2019t just become a moneymaker for the company. It was also the clear inspiration for the Apple iPad Pro, which supports a pen and keyboard but still feels less like a full-fledged laptop than Surface does.Late last year, Microsoft also unveiled Surface Studio, a big-screen desktop that bears a passing resemblance to the Apple iMac \u2014 except its vertical display effortlessly pivots into a kind of digital drafting table, a slick trick that you can imagine Steve Jobs having lots of fun showing off at a keynote address.And in the spring, Microsoft showed off Surface Laptop, which sounds humdrum enough; in shape and purpose, it isn\u2019t much different from the MacBook Air, Apple\u2019s pioneering thin and light laptop. But Microsoft\u2019s machine has a better screen than the Air, and, more important, a future. People loved the Air, but Apple doesn\u2019t appear to want to upgrade it, so Microsoft stepped in to perfect Apple\u2019s baby.\u201cI think Microsoft has recognized over the last couple years that maybe the creative community isn\u2019t as locked into the Mac as many people think it is,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s this window of opportunity for Surface to get in there \u2014 and even if that window closes with some of Apple\u2019s upcoming devices, I don\u2019t think Apple has that market locked up.\u201dLast month, I visited Microsoft\u2019s hardware lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. I arrived in the midst of a renovation, finding a team of its best hardware designers sitting in a cavernous, mostly empty room \u2014 a scene that perfectly captures Microsoft\u2019s approach to hardware.Under Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s Surface chief, the company has given its designers and engineers license to rethink the future of PCs in grand ways \u2014 to sit in an empty room, dream big things, and turn those visions into reality.\u201cWe have this mind-set that says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to take a shot at this, and if it\u2019s not going to work, we\u2019ll move on to the next thing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Panay told me. \u201cThat is celebrated \u2014 it\u2019s always, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s move.\u2019\u201dThe mind-set has resulted in several shining ideas. For Surface Studio, Microsoft built a brilliant companion device called Surface Dial \u2014 a palm-size knob that sits on your drafting-table screen, creating a tactile interface with which to control your computer.You can use Dial for basic things like turning up the volume. But in the hands of a designer, it becomes a lovely tool; you can scrub through edits in a video or change your pen color in Photoshop with a turn of the wheel. Like Microsoft\u2019s digital stylus \u2014 which works across the company\u2019s PCs and tablets, whereas Apple staunchly, weirdly opposes adding touch-screen abilities to its Macs \u2014 Dial is one of those interface breakthroughs that we might have once looked to Apple for. Now, it\u2019s Microsoft that\u2019s pushing new modes of computing.Microsoft\u2019s machines aren\u2019t perfect. I found Surface Studio, which starts at $3,000, to be underpowered for its price. Surface Pro is a wonderful laptop, but as a tablet, it isn\u2019t as good as the iPad. And it, too, is pricey \u2014 though it starts at $800, you\u2019re looking at $1,200 to $1,500 to get a model with decent speeds and the pen and keyboard accessories (crazily, they\u2019re sold separately).For these reasons and others, it\u2019s unlikely that Microsoft\u2019s PC hardware business will beat Apple\u2019s anytime soon. But anyone who cares about the future of the PC should be thrilled that Apple now faces a serious and creative competitor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201dFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201dEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201dAt least they hope not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Software made by foreign companies to help Chinese users skirt the country\u2019s system of internet filters has vanished from Apple\u2019s app store on the mainland.A search on Saturday showed that some of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on Apple\u2019s app store there.ExpressVPN wrote on its blog that the removal was \u201csurprising and unfortunate.\u201dIt added, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China\u2019s censorship efforts.\u201dSunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been removed from the app store.\u201cWe gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.\u201dIn a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license.\u201cWe have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThis is not the first time Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the country\u2019s leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet.But the move by Apple is also the first example of China successfully using its influence with a major foreign tech platform to push back against the software makers.Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, is Apple\u2019s largest market outside the United States. That has made the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean the country off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.In response, Apple has taken a number of steps to ensure that it stays on Beijing\u2019s good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.The company said this month that it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in the country.Apple has operated its app store in China for many years with only occasional run-ins with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing\u2019s move in December to target news sites indicate that China\u2019s internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple\u2019s China app store.Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mind-Boggling Ascent of Amazon and Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesAmazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are having a moment.Yet noteworthy as these real-world achievements are, they may understate Amazon\u2019s importance. Despite an earnings report on Thursday evening that disappointed the market and led to a 2.5 percent decline in its share price, Amazon is remarkable as a purely financial entity. Its stature as one of the most successful companies in the history of the stock market is already assured. In fact, the numbers show that since 1997, when it became a publicly traded company, Amazon has evolved into one of the century\u2019s greatest wealth-generating machines.When I first spoke with Professor Bessembinder in May, he had prepared a list of the 30 greatest wealth creators in the stock market through 2015. But this past week, he showed me a Lifetime Wealth Creation list, with fresh rankings through 2016. The stocks at the very top remained the same: Exxon Mobil, followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM.But further down the list, Amazon appears for the first time. It is ranked 14th, just behind such august names as Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble and ahead of Coca-Cola and DuPont.In essence, the list shows which stocks have been the most profitable for shareholders over history. A very small group \u2014 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks \u2014 account for all of the stock market\u2019s net gains from 1926 through 2016, he found. And only 30 stocks \u2014 Amazon is now one of them \u2014 account for more than 30 percent of all of the market\u2019s wealth creation in that 90-year period.What\u2019s more, Professor Bessembinder found that Amazon\u2019s annualized return through 2016 was 37.4 percent, the highest of all the top 30 wealth creators. That is partly because Amazon hasn\u2019t existed for that long: It\u2019s easier to sustain fast growth for shorter periods. Exxon, for example, which has created more than $1 trillion in wealth for shareholders since 1926, more than any other company, ground out its gains at a slower pace: It has an annualized return of only 11.9 percent, Professor Bessembinder said.Even after the earnings blip on Thursday, Amazon\u2019s value in the market has skyrocketed this year. It has risen more than 36 percent. \u201cIf it holds onto those gains, we can expect that it will climb higher on the cumulative wealth creation list,\u201d he said.Of course, while Amazon\u2019s market power has been wonderful for its own investors, it has damaged many of its competitors \u2014 diminishing the wealth of shareholders of those companies.Consider how Amazon\u2019s cumulative stock returns dwarf those of its retail competitors and the overall market. Using Thomson Reuters data, I calculated that over the last 15 years through Tuesday, Amazon returned more than 8,200 percent, compared with 125 percent for Walmart, 2.2 percent for Sears, and 302 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, dividends included.If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 \u2014 and had held onto your shares \u2014 that money would be worth $83,000 today.By comparison, $1,000 invested in the entire Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends, would amount to $4,100 \u2014 not a bad performance, until you look at the gaudy Amazon returns. Far worse, if you had put the money in Walmart shares, your investment would be worth only $2,250. And if you had stuck with Sears during all of its travails, you would be almost where you started, with $1,022.Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm, has another way of comparing Amazon\u2019s stock returns with those of its retail competitors. It has built the Death by Amazon Index, which it describes as \u201ca way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com.\u201d Those companies \u2014 there are now 54 of them \u2014 include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart.The numbers are stark. The Death by Amazon Index has declined 18.9 percent through Monday \u2014 trailing Amazon by almost 55 percentage points.Unlike Mr. Gates, who has diversified his portfolio and has been giving money to charity at a rapid pace, Mr. Bezos continues to bet heavily on Amazon. As Thursday\u2019s earnings report showed, that does entail risk. The company\u2019s ever-expanding retail operations are sapping its profits, but it has been raking in earnings through cloud computing. As has been the case since Amazon\u2019s inception, it pays no dividends, instead plowing cash back into the company\u2019s core.For now, the mighty Amazon wealth-creation machine continues to roar. Whatever happens next, this is already one of the great tales in the history of capitalism.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "News Outlets to Seek Bargaining Rights Against Google and Facebook", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorSo what we used to call \u201cthe newspaper industry\u201d \u2014 but which now includes outlets with robust online existences \u2014 is coming together to make its biggest push so far to change the balance of power.This week, a group of news organizations will begin an effort to win the right to negotiate collectively with the big online platforms and will ask for a limited antitrust exemption from Congress in order to do so.It\u2019s an extreme measure with long odds. But the industry considers it worth a shot, given its view that Google and Facebook, regardless of their intentions, are posing a bigger threat economically than President Trump is (so far) with his rhetoric.The Alliance, the main newspaper industry trade group, is leading the effort to bargain as a group. But it has buy-in across the spectrum of its membership, bringing together competitors like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, as well as scores of regional papers like The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, which face the gravest threats.Capturing the current mood, News Corporation \u2014 which oversees The Journal, The New York Post and Dow Jones \u2014 said in a statement that it supported the effort to \u201cfocus the public and Congress on the anticompetitive behavior of the digital duopoly, especially as it adversely affects the news and information businesses.\u201dMark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, told me that \u201cthe temperature is rising in terms of concern, and in some cases anger, about what seems like a very asymmetric, disadvantageous relationship between the publishers and the very big digital platforms.\u201dThe thinking is that publishers need the option of operating as a group \u2014 and the leverage that would come from any collective action \u2014 should they determine that it\u2019s the only way to win meaningful accommodations.In the tumultuous news climate, Google and Facebook don\u2019t want to be seen as undermining real journalism. And executives with both companies told me it was in their interests to have ample, reliable news content.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, said. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do.\u201d\u201cWe want to help publishers succeed as they transition to digital,\u201d Google said in a statement, calling the effort \u201ca priority.\u201dPublishers say they appreciate how Google and Facebook put their news content in front of many millions of users they couldn\u2019t reach on their own. And they acknowledge the efforts the platforms are making to help.But as Mike Klingensmith, the publisher of The Star Tribune and the chairman of the News Media Alliance, told me in an interview, \u201cthey\u2019re talking to us, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of action yet.\u201dMr. Klingensmith said that for midsize dailies, which have been hit particularly hard by the shift in ad spending, \u201cit is impossible for us to go as a one-off company and negotiate or even get an appointment with these companies.\u201dThe Times is backing the move for what is called an anticompetitive safe haven, in part, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cbecause we care about the whole of journalism as well as about The New York Times.\u201dHe said The Times would consider joining a collective negotiation should its own talks fail to yield satisfactory results, which, he noted, they have yet to do.The Alliance acknowledges that its bid requires legislation giving them specific clearance to negotiate as a group, which is not commonly granted. It\u2019s an especially big ask from a Congress that hasn\u2019t had a great legislative batting average and whose controlling party, the Republicans, is not in a very press-friendly mood these days.Press representatives for the Senate and House Judiciary Committees \u2014 led by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia \u2014 said they couldn\u2019t comment without hearing directly from the Alliance.The Alliance\u2019s outside counsel, Jonathan Kanter, said he was hopeful that one argument in particular could sway them: \u201cThe product at issue is important from a public policy perspective \u2014 we\u2019re not just talking about widgets, we\u2019re talking about news, and news is crucial for a democratic society.\u201dWhatever the outcome, that should be a starting point everyone can agree upon.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Instead, he told her that a group of taxi drivers at the airport had vandalized the vehicle and that he needed the money from this ride to fix it. He also mentioned that he had been saving to see Iggy Pop, his late brother\u2019s favorite rocker, at the South by Southwest festival, which Ms. Saint John was attending as the head of global consumer marketing for iTunes and Apple Music.She gasped. Her dinner was with Iggy Pop. Would the driver, perhaps, like to come along?Cue the tears (and the five-star passenger rating).\u201cWe\u2019re all rushing in our lives, and I was so concerned with getting from here to there, and if not for the moment of humanity where we just started talking, that connection would not have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a miss that would have been. What a miss!\u201dThis story was part of what convinced Arianna Huffington, a founder of The Huffington Post and a high-profile member of Uber\u2019s board, that Ms. Saint John was the right person to shepherd Uber out of its recent thicket of legal and ethical scandals.\u201cSometimes it takes you months to get to know someone,\u201d Ms. Huffington said. \u201cWith her, I felt like she has this incredible capacity for intimacy and for sharing her story and for sharing others\u2019 stories.\u201dAnd, Ms. Huffington said, \u201cShe\u2019s great at social media.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been told that I overshare,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I get criticized for it, but how else would I be if not all of me?\u201dShe amplifies this presence with statement-making ensembles like the ruffled, lilac Marni skirt and crop top, gold-encrusted Chanel purse and stiletto heels she wore on a recent morning at Uber\u2019s San Francisco office. \u201cThat\u2019s my own personal thing,\u201d Ms. Saint John said of her interest in fashion, so distinct from the hoodie aesthetic around her.She has stood out from the crowd since her family settled in Colorado Springs when she was 12, after an itinerant childhood spent in Connecticut, Washington D.C., Kenya and Ghana, where her father was a member of the Parliament from 1979 until the 1981 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat there. Her mother designed and sold clothes and ensured that Ms. Saint John and her three younger sisters stayed connected to their culture, especially once they moved to the Southwest.\u201cThe first few months were really hard,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cHaving a name that people can\u2019t pronounce\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s BOZE-mah \u2014 \u201chaving a mom that refused to serve pizza on Friday nights when friends came over.

In her sophomore year, she ran for student council under the tagline \u201cAin\u2019t Nothin\u2019 but a Boz Thing,\u201d inspired by her anthem of the moment, Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cNuthin\u2019 but a \u2018G\u2019 Thang.\u201d\u201cI just thought it was so cool, but nobody got it,\u201d she said. She lost, \u201cbut it was a great lesson \u2014 you need to connect on your audience\u2019s level, not on your own.\u201dMs. Saint John attended Wesleyan University, ostensibly to prepare for becoming a doctor but managing to teach a class on Tupac Shakur, with a professor\u2019s supervision, in her spare time. She got into medical school but lobbied her parents for a yearlong sabbatical. \u201cThey agreed, which was their mistake,\u201d she said.\u201cShe walked in, she got the job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was evident that she was going to go places.\u201d\u201cThat became the turning point where, O.K., I can actually use my knowledge of pop culture, running around these streets with my friends, knowing the inside track on things, to help inform business decisions,\u201d she said. She also met her husband-to-be, an advertising executive, in the company cafeteria.In 2013, she orchestrated the halftime show Pepsi sponsored at the Super Bowl featuring Beyonc\u00e9. Four months later, her husband\u2019s illness was diagnosed. Their daughter had just turned 4.\u201cTowards the end of his life, as everything started to fail, he was very adamant that I not stop what I was doing,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cHe was telling me to hold his hands because he couldn\u2019t grasp anymore, saying, \u2018Promise me, you\u2019re going to keep going.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe ended up talking for four hours,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cI was raw.

{"Headline": "Apple Disrupts Silicon Valley With Another Eye-Catcher: Its New Home", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Things change when a spaceship comes to town.Tourists stroll by, whipping out their iPhones to get a photo. New businesses move in. And real estate prices go up even more.Apple\u2019s new home in Cupertino \u2014 the centerpiece being a $5 billion, four-story, 2.8 million-square-foot ring that can be seen from space and that locals call the spaceship \u2014 is still getting some final touches, and employees have just started to trickle in. The full squadron, about 12,000 people, will arrive in several months.But the development of the headquarters, a 175-acre area officially called Apple Park, has already helped transform the surrounding area.In Sunnyvale, a town just across the street, 95 development projects are in the planning stages. The city manager, Deanna J. Santana, said she had never seen such action before. In Cupertino, a Main Street Cupertino living and dining complex opened in early 2016. This downtown enclave includes the Lofts, a 120-unit apartment community opening this fall; small shops; and numerous restaurants and cafes.Other local businesses are also gearing up in anticipation. A Residence Inn at Main Street Cupertino, expected to open in September, has been slightly customized to meet the needs of Apple employees. Guests will have access to Macs and high-speed internet connections, said Mark Lynn, a partner with Sand Hill Hotel Management, which operates the hotel and consulted with Apple about what its employees need at a hotel.\u201cAll the things we have, lined up with what they needed,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cThey will represent a large part of our business.\u201dTech companies are nothing new for Cupertino. Apple has called the city home for decades, and Hewlett-Packard had a campus in Apple\u2019s new spot, employing 9,000 people. The surrounding towns have been remade as well in the last decade, as giant tech companies have transformed Silicon Valley\u2019s real estate into some of the most expensive in the country.But city officials and residents say this project is like nothing they\u2019ve seen before. It is even bringing tourists.Onlookers snap pictures of the spaceship from the streets. TV helicopters circle above. Amateur photographers ask residents if they can stand on driveways to operate their drones, hoping to get a closer look at Apple Park.\u201cI just say, \u2018Hey, go ahead,\u2019\u201d said Ron Nielsen, who lives in Birdland, a Sunnyvale neighborhood across the street from the spaceship. \u201cWhy not?\u201dDrone operators want that coveted aerial shot while pedestrians want to get an eyeful of the curved glass building before the headquarters become hidden by a man-made forest.The campus is one of the last major projects started by Steven P. Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple, who died six years ago. Just a few months before his death, he went before the Cupertino City Council and laid out his vision for a futuristic circular house of glass that would foster creativity and collaboration. Two years later, the Council unanimously approved the plans for the campus.The main center features the spaceship ring, the Steve Jobs Theater, a 100,000-square-foot gym and a visitors center in a woodland setting with two miles of running and walking paths. An orchard, a meadow and a pond are inside the ring.The entire project shows off Apple\u2019s obsession with details. The custom windows were made in Germany and are considered the world\u2019s largest panels of curved glass. One pair of glass doors is 92 feet high. The finish on the underground concrete garage, said David Brandt, Cupertino\u2019s city manager, is so shiny it is almost like glass.\u201cMind-blowing, mind-blowing, mind-blowing,\u201d the mayor, Savita Vaidhyanathan, said about her visit to the site. \u201cI saw the underground 1,000-seat theater and the carbon-fiber roof. The roof was made in Dubai, and it was transported and assembled here. I love that it\u2019s here and that I can brag about it.\u201dMany of the public views will soon be going away. Apple Park will eventually have 9,000 trees, filling in much of the big open spaces. The public will instead have access to a visitors center with a cafe, a store and rooftop observation views.\u201cIt will be a separate glass structure and be set in an old-growth olive tree grove,\u201d said Dan Whisenhunt, Apple\u2019s vice president of real estate and development.Not all of these changes have thrilled everyone. Residents of Birdland, an 877-home neighborhood, have been particularly vocal. They have complained about early-morning construction rigs that beep and rumble along major streets, unpredictable road closings, unsightly green sheeted barriers and construction potholes that result in punctured tires.When her car was covered with construction dust, Sheri Nielsen, Mr. Nielsen\u2019s wife, contacted Apple. The company sent carwash certificates.Mr. Whisenhunt said the company strove to answer every complaint it received, \u201cand if the issue is serious enough, I will personally visit to see what is going on.\u201dIn the design phase, he said, Apple hosted more than 110 community gatherings for feedback. Birdland was addressed in late 2012 and early 2013 and was given information about what would be happening over the next three years of construction. Apple published community mailers five times and sent them to 26,000 households.Homestead Road, the thoroughfare that separates Apple Park from Birdland, became its own subject of debate. Cupertino officials wanted to construct a tree-lined median to calm traffic. Apple offered to cover the costs.But homeowners objected. Residents complained that the island would eliminate one lane, backing up the heavy traffic even more. When 20 or so neighbors approached a Sunnyvale town meeting in solidarity, the city ended up siding with the residents.The price of property in the neighborhood has also become a source of some worry. Sunnyvale and Cupertino, like many other Silicon Valley towns, have had an extended real estate boom, as the tech industry has expanded. Prices in the area really started to rise, real estate agents and residents said, after Apple released its plans.A three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,400-square-foot ranch-style house that cost $750,000 in 2011 has doubled in price. Since Apple said it was moving into the former Hewlett-Packard site, prices have moved up 15 to 20 percent year after year, said Art Maryon, a local real estate agent. Today, bidders usually offer 20 to 25 percent over the asking price.Birdland is already drawing Apple employees, replacing homeowners who have cashed out to move to quieter regions. Those who remain are realizing that life will not be the same when all 12,000 of the Apple workers go in and come out on a daily basis. People in the neighborhood dread the increased traffic and expect workers to park in front of their homes since there will be fewer available spaces in the company garage.Apple\u2019s answers to concerned residents will continue, Mr. Whisenhunt said.\u201cWhen you tell people what is upcoming, some of the anxiety they have calms down a lot,\u201d he said.And yet, he acknowledged, \u201cyou don\u2019t make everyone happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft to Develop Self-Driving Car Technology in New Silicon Valley Facility", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Controlling the future of the smartphone was the defining technology battle of the last decade. Now, technology companies are betting that the next 10 years and beyond will be spent battling for control of the self-driving automobile.On Friday, Lyft, the ride-hailing company, announced that it was developing its own self-driving technology, marking yet another company\u2019s gamble that the future of transportation will be marked by self-driving cars.Lyft is marking the occasion with the opening of a new self-driving-research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to heavily recruit new engineering and technical people for the facility after it opens in the coming weeks.\u201cWe aren\u2019t thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. It\u2019s core to our business,\u201d said Luc Vincent, vice president of autonomous technology at Lyft. \u201cThat\u2019s why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to grow that team in the months ahead.\u201dUber, Lyft\u2019s much larger rival, has spent millions opening facilities in Pittsburgh, Toronto and San Francisco dedicated entirely to autonomous-vehicle research, while building its own hardware and software systems to operate the vehicles. And many other companies, from Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit in Silicon Valley to major auto manufacturers in Detroit and Europe, are also working on autonomous-driving technology.\u201cWe want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think there\u2019s a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it,\u201d said Raj Kapoor, Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer, in a press event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters.Perhaps the best way to understand the initiative is through the lens of the smartphone.Uber\u2019s approach is closer to that of Apple: Both companies want to control most of the product, whether the software or the hardware.Lyft, in contrast, is acting a bit more like Google in its development of the Android operating system. Both companies are creating software that many different hardware manufacturers can use, while developing the technology collaboratively with hardware partners. In Lyft\u2019s ideal world, that could mean a quicker spread of Lyft\u2019s technology among automakers.Automakers are scrambling to develop their own self-driving technology as they imagine how they might operate in a future in which fewer people own cars. Collaborating with Lyft could help bring that technology to market faster, while automakers could provide Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing network with more cars to serve riders.There are potential drawbacks. Partners could decide to leave the Open Platform Initiative and develop their own software. Or companies could be wary of teaming up with Lyft because it is developing its own self-driving system.Lyft executives believe that the self-driving-car race is in its early days, and that companies that may consider one another rivals still have much to gain from collaborating and learning while building the automobile fleets of the future.\u201cLyft is not getting into the business of manufacturing a car,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to creating a self-driving system. Then the auto industry can bring it to life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The earnings are expected to hit $12 billion, which would surpass analysts\u2019 estimates for Apple\u2019s profit for the same period.But the size and influence of chaebol have prompted scrutiny by authorities and a public backlash over white-collar crime and corruption.While the political cloud remains, Samsung appears to be recovering from its product mistakes.The growth in profit was driven largely by the success of the company\u2019s semiconductor business. With the latest figures, Samsung has overtaken Intel to become the world\u2019s biggest chip maker by sales, according to C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities who is based in Seoul.Samsung has been a dominant force in memory chips and displays for smartphones. The company said this week that it would invest a further $18.6 billion in its semiconductor operations in South Korea.\u201cThe question is how they controlled the mistake,\u201d said Mr. Chung, the Nomura analyst. \u201cSamsung did that well, and recalled all the smartphones.\u201d\u201cSamsung regained their reputation with the S8,\u201d he added, predicting that if an upcoming model was also a success, \u201cpeople will forget that Samsung made a mistake.\u201dThe S8, which was released in April, has been met with broadly positive reviews, with experts noting in particular the quality of its display and its camera. The smartphone also represented the debut of Samsung\u2019s voice-activated assistant, Bixby, its rival to Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.Although Samsung is winning back customers, the technical failure exposed deeper cultural shortcomings. Former employees, suppliers and analysts have said that Samsung management discourages employees from speaking up and identifying problems.It is a perception reinforced by the corruption scandal and political turmoil that continue to engulf Samsung \u2014 disruptions that may prove harder to quell.Mr. Lee, a vice chairman at the conglomerate, has been accused of bribing Park Geun-hye, the former South Korean president, for government approval of the merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. That merger helped Mr. Lee, who goes by Jay Y. Lee in the West, retain control of the wider conglomerate.The scandal surrounding Ms. Park was one of the biggest in South Korea\u2019s history. She was accused of conspiring with Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend and confidante, to accept bribes and extort major companies.Samsung has acknowledged that it made payments but denies that it paid the money in exchange for Ms. Park\u2019s approval.The close ties between companies and government officials have prompted a public outcry.Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, was himself convicted of bribery and tax evasion twice, but he never spent any time in prison. The elder Mr. Lee, who had a heart attack in 2014, was pardoned each time by the president, eventually returning to the helm of the company he helped transform into a technology behemoth.In his first court appearance in the case in April, Mr. Lee rejected charges of bribery. His lawyers said Samsung had offered money to help the daughter of Ms. Choi because it feared a backlash from the president\u2019s longtime friend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s New Parental Control App Has a Flaw: Puberty", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixBut if you sign up for Family Link, which is Google\u2019s new parental controls software for managing children\u2019s Android phones, Google decides for you. At the age of 13, a child can choose to \u201cgraduate,\u201d as Google calls it, or lift restrictions, getting the keys to the internet kingdom and all the good and bad things that come with it.That\u2019s too bad, because at first glance, Family Link has all the hallmarks of a winner. It is free, well designed and packed with thoughtful features for regulating a child\u2019s smartphone use, like the ability to monitor how often a game is played or even to lock down a device during bedtime.Yet nearly all of those benefits are undermined by Google\u2019s decision to let children remove the restrictions the instant they become teenagers.Google made Family Link available for public testing in March, though the software is still in development and available for use on an invitation-only basis. Before it goes wide, I tested the parental controls for a week and assessed the features and policies with child safety experts.The takeaway: If you are contemplating the purchase of an Android phone for your child but want to restrict access, there are better parental apps out there that give you more control. Or you could buy your child an iPhone, which has restrictions that can\u2019t easily be removed.Inside the app, you can create Google accounts for your children, sharing information like their names and birth dates. Then when your child logs in to an Android phone, the device immediately requires you, the parent, to log in and install the Family Link app onto the device so it can be monitored.From there, Family Link is a breeze to use. On the parent\u2019s phone, tapping on the child\u2019s account profile brings up a list of options. You can follow a child\u2019s location, which can be useful for safety purposes or for picking the child up from school. You can also approve or reject apps that a child is trying to download \u2014 so if you\u2019re reluctant about Snapchat or an addictive game like Boom Beach, simply block the apps. Parents can also get a weekly report to see how often a child is using a certain app, like a game, and choose to have a conversation with the child about using the software responsibly, or block the app temporarily.Parents can also use Family Link to create restrictions for how children browse the web. You can turn on a filter that blocks mature websites, though Google acknowledges the filter is imperfect and some offensive sites may get past it. For a more nitpicky approach, you can also require the child to get permission for each site visited, blocking the ones you disapprove of.Parents will probably love a feature called screen time, which can be used to set limits for how long a child can use a phone each day. For instance, you could give the child three hours of screen time on weekdays. You can also schedule regular bedtime hours that lock down the device at specific times \u2014 between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., for example. Before the device is about to be locked, the child gets a notification; when the screen locks down, the child will still be able to answer phone calls to talk to the parent or tap on an Emergency button to call the police.\u201cIt\u2019s not a set-it-and-forget-it thing where parents think, \u2018Oh, great, this is going to solve all my problems,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all still learning this technology, and life is very unpredictable.\u201dAll these neat parental controls start to come undone the day the child turns 13. At that point, Google gives the child the option to be free of the Family Link restrictions or stick with them \u2014 and I can\u2019t imagine any child choosing the latter.Saurabh Sharma, Google\u2019s product manager for Family Link, said the policy was designed this way because 13 is when people can register for Google accounts without parental consent. That complies with a federal regulation in the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which forbids companies from collecting data from children under 13 without a parent\u2019s approval.Yet I would argue that Google should design a policy with parents\u2019 best interests in mind. It could let the parent decide when the child has demonstrated safe, responsible smartphone use and graduate from all restrictions. That might happen when the child turns 13, 15 or even 17. But the children should not be allowed to strip away settings just because they turn 13.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand why a parent would give a kid a phone and then turn off all the features through the app and then grant them all the features once they turn 13,\u201d said Ms. Knorr of Common Sense Media. She said the age of 13 was related purely to the federal regulation, not safety or childhood development guidelines.Google\u2019s Mr. Sharma said Family Link was still in testing and the company was continuing to collect feedback from parents on issues including the age policy.\u201cThis is a tricky subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to figure out what works for every family.\u201dIf you agree that your child should get unrestricted access to a smartphone at the age of 13, Family Link is an excellent product. But how can parents ever predict that?Ms. Weinberger, the internet safety expert, said she had heard stories from parents and children about a 9-year-old addicted to pornography, a fourth grader being \u201csextorted\u201d by a 13-year-old, and child predators stalking minors through social networking apps. In other words, any child is subject to danger, no matter how old.She called Family Link \u201cdepressing\u201d because of the age policy.\u201cWe want our kids to have some access and we want to be able to decide,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need for Google in particular to be the leader on this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Wins Tax Case in France, Avoiding $1.3 Billion Bill", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle emerged on Wednesday as the victor in its latest legal battle in Europe, after a French court said the technology behemoth did not have to pay $1.3 billion in back taxes.At issue was whether Google had avoided taxes in France by routing sales in the country through an Irish-based subsidiary over a five-year period ending in 2010. An administrative court in Paris ruled that the Irish unit was not taxable in France.Google has faced a series of legal challenges across Europe, with many of them focused on the company\u2019s tax and competitive practices.Google employs 700 people in France through its subsidiary there, but the company used a division based in Ireland to sell French customers digital services like its well-known advertising platform AdWords, according to court filings. The case hinged on whether Google owed various taxes in France, even though it sold services from Ireland.French tax authorities argued that Google\u2019s French employees were instrumental in selling the ad space, even if the contracts were made with the Irish subsidiary.In its rulings on Wednesday, the court agreed with Google. It found that the Irish unit did not have a \u201cstable\u201d presence in France, meaning that the French tax authorities could not collect corporate income and withholding taxes from it. The court also decided that other taxes, including a value-added tax, did not apply.The office of the French budget minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, said in a statement that the country\u2019s tax authorities planned to appeal the court\u2019s decision, \u201cgiven the important stakes in these cases, and, more broadly, the issue of fair taxation, in France, of profits derived from the digital economy.\u201dGoogle said in a statement that the rulings confirmed that it \u201cabides by French tax law and international standards.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain committed to France and the growth of its digital economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Phone Is Smart, but Where\u2019s the Big Idea?", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI used a smartphone GPS to find my way through the cobblestoned maze of Geneva\u2019s Old Town, in search of a handmade machine that changed the world more than any other invention. Near a 13th-century cathedral in this Swiss city on the shores of a lovely lake, I found what I was looking for: a Gutenberg printing press.\u201cThis was the Internet of its day \u2014 at least as influential as the iPhone,\u201d said Gabriel de Montmollin, the director of the Museum of the Reformation, toying with the replica of Johann Gutenberg\u2019s great invention. It used to take four monks, laboring in a scriptorium with quills over calfskin, up to a year to produce a single book.With the advance in movable type in 15th-century Europe, one press could crank out 3,000 pages a day. Before long, average people could travel to places that used to be unknown to them \u2014 with maps! Medical information passed more freely and quickly, diminishing the sway of quacks. And you could find your own way to God, or a way out of believing in God, with access to formerly forbidden thoughts.The printing press offered the prospect that tyrants would never be able to kill a book or suppress an idea. Gutenberg\u2019s brainchild broke the monopoly that clerics had on scripture. And later, stirred by pamphlets from a version of that same press, the American colonies rose up against a king and gave birth to a nation.So, a question in the summer of this 10th anniversary of the iPhone: has the device that is perhaps the most revolutionary of all time given us a single magnificent idea? Nearly every advancement of the written word through new technology has also advanced humankind.For all of that, I\u2019m still waiting to see if the iPhone can do what the printing press did for religion and democracy. This year is also the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther posting his 95 theses against the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church; the Geneva museum makes a strong case that the printing press opened more minds than anything else.The museum\u2019s exhibition \u2014 \u201cPrint! The First Pages of a Revolution\u201d \u2014 quotes Luther as saying that the press was \u201cthe greatest and most extraordinary act of Divine Grace.\u201d As a renegade Catholic monk, Luther might never have seen his writings find their way out of a monastery. But through Gutenberg\u2019s democratizing machine, about 300,000 copies of Luther\u2019s provocations were circulated between 1517 and 1520. Christianity would never be the same.Similarly, it\u2019s hard to imagine the French or American revolutions without those enlightened voices in print.In the beginning of the written word, about 5,000 years ago, people scrawled information on clay. Their messages were sometimes bawdy, more often banal. The Greeks gave us humor, tragedy and poetry. Scrolls of papyrus were portable; Roman commanders used them as the equivalent of paperbacks, tucked into pockets.\u201cOn the Nature of Things,\u201d a poem from the Roman philosopher Lucretius in the first century B.C., was one of the most \u201cdangerously radical\u201d things ever written, Stephen Greenblatt argued in his book \u201cThe Swerve.\u201d Rediscovered and then printed in the early stages of the Renaissance on Gutenberg\u2019s press, the poetic celebration of the good life overturned much of Europe\u2019s dour medieval mind-set.Count Magna Carta, one of the founding documents in the evolution of free societies, and Chaucer\u2019s \u201cCanterbury Tales,\u201d which popularized English vernacular, among the highlights of the thousand years or so when books were made by hand-cramped scribes, or printed from wooden blocks.Not long after Steve Jobs introduced his iPhone, he said the bound book was probably headed for history\u2019s attic. Not so fast. After a period of rapid growth in e-books, something closer to the medium for Chaucer\u2019s volumes has made a great comeback.The hope of the iPhone, and the Internet in general, was that it would free people in closed societies. But the failure of the Arab Spring, and the continued suppression of ideas in North Korea, China and Iran, has not borne that out. And it\u2019s beyond pathetic that the leader of the free world uses his phone to insult women, or send out bizarre videos of him beating up imaginary reporters.The iPhone is still young. It has certainly been \u201cone of the most important, world-changing and successful products in history,\u201d as Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook said. But I\u2019m not sure if the world changed for the better with the iPhone \u2014 as it did with the printing press \u2014 or merely changed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China appears to have received help on Saturday from an unlikely source in its fight against tools that help users evade its Great Firewall of internet censorship: Apple.Software made by foreign companies to help users skirt the country\u2019s system of internet filters has vanished from Apple\u2019s app store on the mainland.A search on Saturday showed that a number of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on the company\u2019s app store there.ExpressVPN wrote in its blog that the removal was \u201csurprising and unfortunate.\u201dIt added, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China\u2019s censorship efforts.\u201dSunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been taken down from the app store.\u201cWe gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,\u201d he said, \u201cso we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.\u201dIn a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license. \u201cWe have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThis is not the first time that Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a new reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet.But they also mark the first time China has successfully used its influence with a major foreign tech platform, like Apple, to push back against the software makers.Greater China is Apple\u2019s largest market outside the United States. That has left the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean itself off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.In response, Apple has made a number of moves to ensure that it stays on Beijing\u2019s good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.This month, the company said it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in China.Apple has operated its app store in China for many years with only the occasional run-in with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing\u2019s move in December to target news sites indicate that China\u2019s internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple\u2019s China app store.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the software produced by Golden Frog. It is VyprVPN, not VyperVPN.Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Is Dealt a Fresh Blow in European Legal Case", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Uber suffered a blow to its expansion plans in Europe on Tuesday after a senior adviser to the region\u2019s highest court said that the ride-hailing service should have to abide by tough rules governing taxi services.The French authorities brought criminal proceedings last year against the ride-hailing service for infringing a law that required any vehicle carrying passengers for a fee to be licensed as a taxi service and to have appropriate insurance.Uber had argued that the law was also a \u201ctechnical regulation\u201d over digital services. That being the case, the company said, the French authorities were required to notify the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, before adopting the legislation. Because France did not do so, Uber contended, the law could not be enforced.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.\u201cWe have seen today\u2019s statement and await the final ruling later this year,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. She said that the company had stopped offering the services in question, and that it now worked only with professionally licensed drivers in France.The court typically follows the recommendations of its senior advisers, but it could still rule in the company\u2019s favor.\u201cThe two ways Uber sold itself \u2014 as a digital company and as a ride-sharing service \u2014 don\u2019t stand up, according to this legal opinion,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Cass Business School at City University in London.When companies like Uber and Airbnb, the short-term rental company, set up, he said, \u201cThey skirted around national laws, and that was what made them competitive and cheap.\u201d He added, \u201cMany national regulators are beginning to chip away at that.\u201dUber already operates in many European cities in compliance with transportation rules, but some of its services \u2014 particularly those that do not require drivers to have a taxi license \u2014 have been banned and face stiff opposition.The pushback against Uber is part of wider tensions between the European authorities and American technology companies.After months of turmoil and questions about its leadership and culture, the company is now without a chief executive \u2014 a committee of executives is in charge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Quiet Should You Be During \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019? Fans Disagree", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWanda Fultz and her husband have been married for a long time. It would be a shame if \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d caused it all to unravel.Like many households and friendships, the couple is torn over a divisive TV etiquette question: How quiet must you be while watching \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and similar shows with other people?\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that after 41 years of marriage, my husband and I may split up over this issue,\u201d she wrote in an email to The New York Times, in what we believe and hope was a playful tone. \u201cMy husband has a habit of commenting on shows, which drives me insane. Since everyone has an accent, I find I must concentrate that much harder. You can imagine what happens.\u201cWe both like to do a recap afterward, so the marriage may survive. The jury is still out.\u201dSome said any noise from companions would ruin their ability to fully absorb every moment. Others said they needed the ability to occasionally ask questions just to make sense of what\u2019s going on. Still others said they should be able to talk freely, because that\u2019s the fun of watching with other people.Here is a selection of the responses, which have been lightly edited.A solid majority of the commenters said they require total silence. Some of them said the issue had lost them friends.Several said the solution was in watching the episode multiple times: Silence is expected on the first viewing, but commentary is allowed in subsequent viewings.Meeghan Holaway, 47, of Pasadena, Calif., wrote in an email:Personally, I watch alone (the first time). I\u2019m not even close to subtle or tactful. When some dear friend asks, \u201cDo you wanna come over and watch GOT?\u201d I look at them like they just offered me a snifter of cyanide. \u201cAre you insane? No! You might sneeze. Or breathe. Or have an opinion.\u201dIt makes me crazy when people can\u2019t shut up during playback of filmed entertainment, be it at the cinema or while watching television. I want to absorb what is being presented and allow the content to take me wherever it needs to go. I have made the mistake of watching things I care about in the company of others, and have been amazed at the incessant comments and unrelated conversation between people who are using a communal watching experience as an excuse to hang out with other people. Shut up and go to a coffee shop.Zane Foley, a 25-year-old from Los Angeles, said in an email:\u201cThe show\u2019s purpose is to take you into another world, to ride dragons and live in a time of kingdoms and magic; a talkative companion chains you to your reality and ruins the encampment of one\u2019s experience. Furthermore, snacks that make any noise (especially chips and popcorn) are in no circumstances permitted.\u201dAnd David Stone wrote by email:Absolute silence! The makers (artistic elements and script) of Thrones are relaying a graphical and scripted story. The visual mood is just as important as the script and every other element. Why would anyone want to ruin the experience by introducing unplanned elements into the experience. Sorry, but those with me have to shut their mouths and stare at the screen.To others, there is a middle ground. There are nooks and crannies in which you can sneak a quick comment without speaking over the action, they say. Or liberal use of the pause button can allow for all of the conversation needed without missing a thing.In an email, Yvette London wrote:Surely it is a balancing act, but when my husband started commenting on everything that was happening I wanted to kill him. On the other hand, a brief statement or observation would have been fine with me. The key is this: Don\u2019t say anything that results in the other person missing the action or significant dialogue. You can have the bigger discussions later.I both require silence during critical dialogue and scenes, and save my discussion until \u201cdowntime\u201d where the mundane or relatively little is happening. I believe most people are like this \u2014 somewhere in the middle. It is fun when someone points out a detail or \u2018lore\u2019 tidbit that helps along one\u2019s grasp of the plot or character development, and makes the occasional prediction. I personally stay away from putting out predictions that would basically spoil the plot, if true. Of course, if in doubt, save it for after. Prolonged conversations that run into the next critical conversation or plot device are a no-no. Cut the chatter at the pivotal moments or I\u2019m watching the show later!My viewing partners and I have employed a system of timeouts if someone has something to say during GOT. Someone just pipes up and says they\u2019d like to use a timeout and then we pause the show and listen to whatever that person has to say. Each viewer gets two timeouts per episode.Some people argued: If you require silence, why are you even watching with other people? Others said the show is so confusing it\u2019s almost impossible to follow without asking questions of more knowledgeable fans.Risa Prenick, 55, lives in Toronto and watches with her husband and daughter. She said:I am a true talker during GOT. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m excited or because it all happens so fast I need confirmation of what just happened. In any case while my family put parameters around episode 1 season 7 that no talking was allowed, as much as I tried, I could not hold back.All I can say is while I wouldn\u2019t want to watch it alone \u2014 who would really? \u2014 my family must love me a whole lot to put up with me.I\u2019m 71. When I saw \u201cForbidden Planet\u201d when it first came out, people were quiet \u2014 but talked. They commented on the action. They even laughed occasionally. In theaters today, audiences are often dead silent. Isn\u2019t being in an audience about sharing? Yes, I drive some family members nuts when I comment during \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d even in the living room. Somewhere along the way we have lost part of the shared experience.I talk constantly through \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant show and so complex, but I find it hard to follow the moving pieces \u2014 I\u2019m constantly asking, \u201cWait, who is that guy again?\u201d \u201cWait, so how are they related?\u201d \u201cWait, who did he kill again?\u201d etc. ... I suppose this is why no one wants to watch GOT with me :(The responses made clear this has been a thorny issue in a lot of relationships.Mike Underwood, writing from Surrey, England, said:This has been the cause of internal strife for years during what should be the time for everyone to relax. My wife wants silence and I like to have fun by commentating about all sorts of topics such as how realistic the writers made a scene, how I might improve a scene or just general jokes (I know I hit and miss on those) about characters or how reality TV is so well scripted/edited.As a result of more than 10 years of disagreement on this issue, we now have five separate TVs, three Apple TVs, and two SKY TV boxes including a TIVO device so that we can all get along.My wife insists on quiet. So like any good husband, I feel an obligation to vocalize all of the absurdities of a dragon-based, fantasy television show. Though she may think she is the Cersei of our home, I will not be silenced!I talk on occasion during shows & films. It was never an issue until I entered a long-term relationship. Our first ventures into joint watching quickly descended into relationship choppy waters. She hated people who talked during shows & films while I thought it was part of the social activities of joint watching. Our resolution was simple: stop watching stuff together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Disrupts WhatsApp Service in Online Clampdown", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The last of Facebook\u2019s major products that still worked in China was disrupted by the government on Tuesday, as Beijing broadly tightened its controls over the internet.The product, WhatsApp, a messaging app used across the globe, was partly blocked by Chinese filters, leaving many unable to send videos and photos and some also unable to send text-based messages.Sites hosting popular foreign television shows have had videos taken down, and tools used to skirt the censors have faced more frequent disruptions. In an article, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s Communist Party scolded the Chinese internet company Tencent over a popular video game, calling it too addictive.To complicate matters, the 19th Party Congress \u2014 where top leadership positions are determined \u2014 is just months away. The government puts an increased emphasis on stability in the run up to the event, which happens every five years, often leading to a tightening of internet controls.WhatsApp, which had generally avoided major disruptions in China despite the full block of Facebook and Instagram, appears to have become a victim of those circumstances.The blocks against WhatsApp originated with the government, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the disruption. Security experts also verified that the partial disruption in WhatsApp started with China\u2019s internet filters.\u201cAccording to the analysis that we ran today on WhatsApp\u2019s infrastructure, it seems that the Great Firewall is imposing censorship that selectively targets WhatsApp functionalities,\u201d said Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a cryptography research start-up.The actions by the Chinese government are another setback for Facebook in a country that has been difficult for the world\u2019s largest social network to crack. Its flagship site was blocked in 2009 after ethnic unrest in western China; Instagram followed in 2014 during protests that fall in Hong Kong.Beginning in late 2014, Facebook began an aggressive campaign to woo the Chinese government and get its main social network back into the country. As part of the courtship, Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, showed off his language chops at a conference and later dined with President Xi Jinping during a state visit to the United States.But Facebook\u2019s efforts have slowed over the past year, and it has little to show for itself. Instead of getting a new product into China, the internet giant now faces the reality that its last app standing is under threat of being pushed outside the walls of Chinese censorship.A spokeswoman for WhatsApp declined to comment.Since taking power almost five years ago, Mr. Xi has presided over a consistent and deepening suppression of internet freedom. He has been vocal in calling for China to establish sovereignty online, and has set up a new internet regulator to consolidate controls over the web.The scale of the recent actions shows the increasing muscle of the Chinese government, which has strengthened this year.In recent months, a number of virtual private networks, tools that allow users in China to access the broader internet around the world, were removed from app stores or shut down. China\u2019s telecom regulator said it would ban unauthorized VPNs starting in February 2018.The new cybersecurity rules, broad and vague, have left Western companies uncertain of how they will be applied and what impact they could have on a difficult operating environment. The government has put strong emphasis on the law, which could serve as a watershed for how the internet is managed and foreign companies are policed.The disruption of encrypted messaging programs like WhatsApp and censorship circumvention tools like VPNs shows a desire to take almost total control over how the internet is used.WhatsApp is hugely popular around much of the globe, but the platform is not widely used in China, where local messaging app WeChat dominates. Even so, WhatsApp provides encrypted messaging, making it a useful tool for many Chinese to communicate or do business outside the country or in Hong Kong.Paul Triolo, the head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group, said that a possible next step would be for China to target other encrypted messaging apps like Signal, pointing out that such apps \u201crepresent a small but growing and potentially important hole in the Great Firewall.\u201d\u201cThe ministries and support organizations that undergird the Great Firewall must constantly prove they can keep abreast of technological change, and encrypted messaging apps are just the latest in a long string of innovations that have drawn the attention of the technical wizards behind the Great Firewall,\u201d Mr. Triolo said.The apparent crackdown is part of the jockeying among Chinese ministries ahead of this autumn\u2019s congress to show that they are doing their job, according to a government tech policy adviser who declined to be named because of possible retribution over speaking to foreign news media. While there is a real push to make it harder to use VPNs, he said the new rules set to take effect next year are unlikely to be so extreme that they entirely prevent individuals from being able to use such tools.Some in the Chinese government are worried that the excess censorship and controls are damaging the country\u2019s ability to access crucial information, like scientific papers and other educational resources. As such, there have been calls for a more surgical way to block specific material, rather than a sledgehammer approach that takes out entire services.In the case of WhatsApp, it is not clear whether the targeted censorship of videos and photos was intentional, or if it was just a prelude to a more complete block. Previous partial blocks have sometimes led to full bans, or they have eventually been removed by the government, and service restored.Beijing\u2019s track record with other American social networking services does not bode well for WhatsApp. Besides Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, Google and Gmail are all blocked in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s like when Gmail first got throttled, the blockage was very uneven,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: With Tough Competition, Chevrolet Equinox Holds Its Own", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenIf I had a dollar for every time I was asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite car?\u201d I could buy that car. Even if it were an exotic.Truth be told, the vehicles that get my professional admiration are the everyday ones, the dependable workhorses that shuttle our children hither and yon, the cars that become part of the family. It\u2019s easy to love performance machines or luxury vehicles with fur-lined glove boxes (not a thing, but you get the gist). But the car geek in me admires budget-restrained engineering teams who create affordable cars that are truly desirable. That\u2019s a black art.The all-new third generation Chevrolet Equinox crossover is more proof that under Mary Barra, General Motors has found its footing. The Equinox takes care of five people, does the chores, doesn\u2019t drink to excess and looks good.In the brutal automotive business, the compact crossover market is the most fiercely competitive. It includes not only the Equinox but also the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Kia Sportage, Volkswagen Tiguan and Hyundai Tucson. The Equinox is critical to General Motors. Chevrolet moved 242,195 of them in the United States in 2016, which was second in volume only to the Silverado pickup truck. The 2018 model will probably sell quicker because it\u2019s a far better vehicle.Here\u2019s why. The Equinox is more than four inches shorter now but retains the same interior space. The 400 pounds it has shed may exceed the weight of the young family who drives it. Let\u2019s buy a round for the engineers.The Equinox\u2019s breezy design language, which also graces the Cruze, Malibu and Volt, could be used by Lexus in a parallel universe. One reason the second generation overstayed its welcome is that the original design for the third generation was so unloved in consumer clinics that it was scrapped. Good to know the Chevrolet team understands that ugly is forever once it\u2019s on the road.Friends and neighbors fawned over the Premier model\u2019s cabin with stitched elements on the instrument panel. Owners will be staring at it for years in bad traffic, so glad it\u2019s handsome. Budget plastics are placed below the center console where they\u2019re seldom seen or touched. (It\u2019s how wise product planners cut costs.) The center console is roomy enough to fit a single-lens reflex camera. G.M.\u2019s touch-screen user interface, with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, is simple to use.A base price of $24,525 will give pause to price-sensitive internet shoppers. Climbing to $33,975, my top trim Premier tester lacked available all-wheel drive and a panoramic sunroof. And adaptive cruise control is not even listed as an option. To be fair, the price includes vented front seats, a heated steering wheel and a surround-view camera system that some competitors don\u2019t offer. Generous pricing margins may allow Chevy dealers plenty of negotiation room. Get in there and haggle hard.Considering the comfort and refinement, the effort may be worth it. The Equinox shines by delivering a polished and quiet dynamic verging on luxury brand levels. If the roads to soccer or Little League practice are rough, this suspension smooths the bumps. It\u2019s respectable in the curves, too, without challenging the Mazda CX-5\u2019s cornering chops.Chevy\u2019s supportive seats impressed my backside (though that\u2019s a personal thing). A bonus: Set off the lane-keeping assist system and the driver\u2019s cushion vibrates discreetly, with no tattletale chimes. It\u2019s a marriage-saving feature first found in Cadillacs.The standard engine is a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder providing 170 horsepower and 203 pound-feet of torque. That\u2019s hooked up to a 6-speed transmission that aggressively holds low ratios for fuel efficiency. This standard power plant is smooth with acceleration in the middle of the pack. The CR-V is a little quicker and efficient. The Environmental Protection Agency rated the average fuel economy of a front-drive Equinox at 28 miles per gallon versus the Honda\u2019s at 30. A comparable RAV4 scores 25.Any performance and efficiency deficiencies can be rectified in spades with two engine options. There\u2019s a 2-liter turbo gasoline engine with 252 horsepower and a nine-speed transmission for Speed Racer. Scrooge McDuck may be interested in the four-cylinder turbo diesel paired to a six-speed that\u2019s expected to return 40 miles per gallon.The Equinox\u2019s automatic engine start-stop system is smooth enough to forget about in many situations. Good thing because it can\u2019t be turned off. Unlike the automatic all-wheel drive systems used by others, the Equinox requires drivers to enable it manually. (There\u2019s a prompt to push the button when conditions warrant.)Automatic emergency braking is standard on the RAV4, the 2018 Nissan Rogue and most CR-Vs. That safety tech is part of a $1,900 package on the Equinox and only available on the top Premier model.The back seat no longer slides fore and aft (eliminated because some second-generation owners never knew it did). The space is generous with a raised seat cushion offering significant thigh support for adults and superior visibility for children. The back also sports two USB ports, a 12-volt socket and a 115-volt three-prong outlet, so there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be charged.The days of Japan Inc. clearly outgunning Detroit & Co. on every level are gone. While my left brain admires the overachieving Honda CR-V, my right brain gives the nod to the comfortable, refined and stylish Equinox. Both engineering teams performed the black magic needed to make a mainstream car appealing. I won\u2019t be around to nag you to test drive. So experience at least three vehicles before writing that big check. A tip? The Equinox is worth a look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Silence in China Sets a Dangerous Precedent", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYet in China over the weekend, when faced with a broad demand by the Chinese internet authority, it was Apple that blinked.Whatever Apple may have done in private to fight the Chinese internet law, the company has not offered a peep of criticism in public. Apple\u2019s only public statement on the VPN ban said that the company had been \u201crequired to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d but noted that the \u201capps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d Despite the pulldown, Apple says there are still hundreds of VPN apps available on its Chinese app store, some of which remain unregistered with the government.Search Apple\u2019s website for a letter from Mr. Cook issuing a public rebuke of China\u2019s intrusion into his customers\u2019 privacy and freedom of expression \u2014 you won\u2019t find it. The company has not fully tested its political and economic leverage in China. It hasn\u2019t tested the public\u2019s immense love of its products. It hasn\u2019t publicly threatened any long-term consequences \u2014 like looking to other parts of the world to manufacture its products.The company\u2019s silence may be tactical; the Chinese government, the conventional thinking goes, does not take well to public rebuke. Yet Apple\u2019s quiet capitulation to tightening censorship in one of its largest markets is still a dangerous precedent.\u201cApple\u2019s response is tremendously disappointing,\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that Apple is playing a bigger role behind the scenes here. But the problem with that is, from the outside it looks exactly like doing nothing.\u201dIt may be na\u00efve to expect Apple to publicly take on the Chinese government. Sure, it may be the world\u2019s most valuable company, with extensive investments and operations in China. But Apple is also just a foreign company \u2014 it must obey local laws, and it must watch for its bottom line. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Apple\u2019s sales, and many analysts see the region as a key growth area for the company. So what was Apple supposed to do? Jeopardize its operations over a few apps?There is also a moral defense of Apple\u2019s decision to give in without a public fight: Despite the VPN ban, Chinese internet users might still be better off with Apple in China than with it outside. Its app store still provides people access to millions of apps that they might not find elsewhere in China. And Apple\u2019s own communications apps in China remain free of government censorship. For instance, Messages, Apple\u2019s texting app, and FaceTime, its video and phone-calling app, are protected by end-to-end encryption, allowing Chinese users to communicate freely.But that may be of limited utility.\u201cIt will only get worse,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a Chinese human rights activist and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. Mr. Xiao sees the latest crackdowns as the beginning of a new wave of internet censorship in China. And he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that saying something publicly would have backfired for Apple.\u201cThey should say something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a U.S. company, after all. And they\u2019re a global company, upholding standards of privacy and speech in many, many markets outside China. So if they have to do things differently in China, they should have some public explanation for why \u2014 because that attitude could matter globally, including in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Opening Data Center in China to Comply With Cybersecurity Law", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Apple said Wednesday that it would open its first data center in China, joining a parade of technology companies responding to growing global demands to build facilities that store online data closer to customers.The move is a response to a strict new law in China that requires companies to store users\u2019 data in the country. The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.As is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how. Already, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have formed partnerships with Chinese companies to offer cloud computing services based in China. Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.Apple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place.\u201d The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple\u2019s encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.\u201cThe addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,\u201d Apple said.China\u2019s rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.The iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple\u2019s business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s global sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.But the iPhone has also become emblematic of China\u2019s long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.Apple already stores some of the data of China\u2019s residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.In 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.Careful not to offend, Apple said it \u201cappreciated\u201d that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users\u2019 locations.The opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple\u2019s iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple\u2019s Chinese partner.Apple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple\u2019s permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.Other American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.Even though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple\u2019s smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

Amazon Is Hiring Aussie Speakers", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe BreakdownSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Think you know the ins and outs of Australian English? Amazon is hiring.Though the job posting didn\u2019t get into such specifics, it\u2019s very likely to involve research for Amazon\u2019s voice-recognition device, the Amazon Echo, which helps users check the weather, stream music and plan to-do lists through a personal assistant named Alexa.The effort by the Seattle-based Amazon to hire more linguists with backgrounds outside American English may point to an acknowledgment that such systems must adapt to all types of voices if they are to appeal to multiple markets.\u201cIf people like Google, Apple and Amazon are putting money into this stuff, localization needs to be a part of it,\u201d said Simon Musgrave, a lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.Current voice-recognition software, he explained, draws from a training database of sounds and uses statistical modeling to match audio with the understanding of vowels, consonants and words.The Australian National Dictionary, a standard guide to the Australian vernacular, added 6,000 words and phrases on Tuesday, its first update since 1988. Test your knowledge of the new terms with this quiz.\u201cThey\u2019re going to need a body of recordings from Australians with good annotations\u201d that connect audio to meaning, Mr. Musgrave said.The Australian accent, for example, is distinct from American English in that it is non-rhotic \u2014 the \u201cr\u201d sound is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel sound. Australian English also has a lot of diphthongs and triphthongs \u2014 \u201cmultiple vowels within the same space,\u201d said Howard Manns, a lecturer in linguistics at Monash University.\u201cAnd that might be difficult for a computer or voice recognition to make sense of,\u201d Mr. Manns said.The software is getting better. In May, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, announced that the company\u2019s voice-recognition software had a word error rate of less than 5 percent, an improvement on the 23 percent error rate it had in 2013.Jobs that tie linguistics and technology are becoming more common.For example, Appen, a company based in Australia that collects data for machine learning for technology companies, employs more than 70 linguists and has thousands of other linguists that it can consult.Linguists annotate recordings of people speaking, down to the pauses in their voices, which are then fed into an algorithm that connects the audio with the meaning, said Phil Hall, the senior vice president of Appen\u2019s language resources.As for the Amazon listing, it\u2019s an attractive prospect for any linguist wanting to work on a cutting-edge project.\u201cI\u2019m going to apply for that job right now,\u201d Mr. Manns joked.An earlier version of this article assigned the wrong linguistic terms to the definition \u201cmultiple vowels within the same space.\u201d That definition describes diphthongs and triphthongs, not diphones and triphones. The term non-rhotic was also incompletely defined. A non-rhotic accent does not pronounce the \u201cr\u201d sound unless it is followed by a vowel sound; it is not the case that it does not pronounce the \u201cr\u201d sound at all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silence Equals Complicity in Workplace Sexism", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneCombating sexism in the workplace has become all the rage, and rightly so.There is no excuse \u2014 not now, not ever \u2014 for treating women differently from men when it comes to pay and compensation, in representation on corporate boards or in the executive suites, in quotidian meetings where women often are made to feel belittled or inadequate or, heaven forbid, in social interactions where men have been known to take advantage of women against their will.The issue has become especially acute in places like Wall Street and Silicon Valley, which have long been insular, male-dominated ecosystems. It is also a big problem in this White House.But as recent events at Uber show, baby steps in the right direction are possible. Not only can sexist behavior get top executives fired, but it can also lead to serious efforts to change a corporation\u2019s culture. That\u2019s meaningful progress, and we should applaud it.Among those leading the charge against sexism at Uber is Arianna Huffington, a co-founder of The Huffington Post and the founder of Thrive, a venture-backed merchandising and consulting firm devoted to disconnecting and to sleep. Ms. Huffington has been on the Uber board since April 2016 (and was its only woman until recently).Her emergence began in February after Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, shared her story of sexual harassment at the hands of a male supervisor. \u201cIt was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him,\u201d Ms. Fowler wrote in a much-discussed blog post, \u201cand it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to H.R.\u201dAfter Ms. Fowler\u2019s post appeared, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder and then its chief executive, announced that Ms. Huffington would join with Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general who had returned to his previous law firm Covington & Burling, as well as two other female executives at Uber, to investigate Ms. Fowler\u2019s charges and the Uber culture generally.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.At the meeting in which Mr. Holder\u2019s report was shared with Uber employees, Ms. Huffington spoke about the need to have more female board members, and how one woman on a board can often lead to having more women on boards. That\u2019s when David Bonderman, the billionaire co-founder of TPG, a private-equity behemoth, and a fellow Uber board member, blurted out: \u201cActually, what it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201d Mr. Bonderman quickly apologized, and later resigned from the board. But to utter such an inane comment in the middle of an \u201call-hands\u201d meeting at Uber to discuss changing the company\u2019s sexist culture takes an extra special lack of emotional intelligence.As recent events at Fox and Uber show, it\u2019s unequivocally clear that sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace are behaviors that can get you fired.But what about at the White House? Why isn\u2019t the message getting through there? President Trump\u2019s tweets about the MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski were vile. Then there were his unprofessional and sexist remarks, in the Oval Office, directed toward Caitriona Perry, the Washington correspondent for Ireland\u2019s RTE News, when he was on the phone with Ireland\u2019s prime minister. Mr. Trump said to the prime minister after Ms. Perry introduced herself to him, \u201cShe has a nice smile on her face so I bet she treats you well.\u201dAs inappropriate as that moment was, making it worse was the fact that Dina Powell, a deputy national security adviser and one of the highest ranking women in the White House, was sitting right there, on the other side of Mr. Trump\u2019s desk. In the video released of the incident, Ms. Powell was smiling broadly. She has said nothing publicly about it.Nor for that matter have the other top women in the Trump administration spoken out publicly about Mr. Trump\u2019s sexist remarks. Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, has been silent. Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, has been silent. Kellyanne Conway, counsel to the president, has been silent. Both Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump have been silent.Even the men in the White House who seem more sentient \u2014 among them Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council; H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; and Jared Kushner, the White House senior adviser (and Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband) \u2014 have remained silent, too.Silence equals complicity. Stephanie Ruhle, an MSNBC anchor, wrote on Twitter on July 1 that Ms. Powell, for one, must \u201cspeak out against this misogynist, sexist behavior once and for all.\u201d Her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace, a former communications director for President George W. Bush, exhorted the top women in the Trump administration to \u201cgo on the record and condemn your boss\u2019s comments,\u201d adding that they \u201cshould work behind the scenes to educate him about just how offensive they are.\u201dThe two MSNBC hosts have it exactly right.Advertisement"}

Air traffic control systems? Hackable. Bridges and dams? Hackable. Nuclear power plants? Also hackable. In fact, one victim of this most recent cyberattack was the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, where the computers that monitor radiation were taken offline by the attack, forcing employees to inspect radiation levels by hand. A lot of these systems are decades old and haven\u2019t been updated or patched to guard against current threats.I guess what I\u2019m asking is, does that cave have room for two?Is this a true turning point to the industry? Is it possible women may feel more empowered now to speak out against bad actors?

But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Plan a Trip With the New TripAdvisor", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTest RunNot that the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s largest travel site\u201d is hurting for attention, with 390 million average unique monthly visitors and over 500 million reviews for hotels, restaurants and other travel destinations. But standing pat is never an option in the highly competitive travel booking industry.But does new really mean a better experience for prospective travelers?I used the new TripAdvisor to help plan a recent trip to North Adams, Mass., and for the most part, the change was good.On TripAdvisor\u2019s new desktop home page, a cleaner design and simpler layout are instantly noticeable, and once you start searching for travel accommodations, you\u2019ll encounter a new \u201cBest Value\u201d filter, which is a ranking using TripAdvisor-specific data such as its user ratings, prices, popularity, location and your personal user preferences. You can also still sort results based on user reviews, cost and distance alone.Restaurants are now filterable by \u201cCheap Eats,\u201d \u201cFine Dining,\u201d \u201cMid-Range\u201d and a host of other categories. One could quickly find a vegetarian-friendly, family-friendly restaurant that has free Wi-Fi with just a few clicks. You can then reserve that table (if it allows online reservations) without leaving the website, thanks to integration with the restaurant booking service OpenTable.The search experience is replicated on the app, which also offers a host of cool features not found on the desktop version or on many other travel apps (though it would be nice if they were available on both desktop and mobile).One such feature is \u201cMy Trips.\u201d By creating a trip, which requires only a name and the dates, I was able to bookmark places of interest and schedule them on a trip-specific calendar. You can easily share your trip via email or SMS with your traveling partner(s) so they can see what you\u2019re interested in and add their own preferences. This may not seem as necessary for couples, but in a large group, the feature would be a great way to keep everyone on track.Once I was in North Adams, I mainly stuck with the app version of TripAdvisor and appreciated that all of my bookmarked attractions and restaurants were easily accessible and placed on a map within the app. For directions between locations, TripAdvisor used Apple Maps on my iPhone, which is not my preferred maps app, but it was better than nothing.The app\u2019s standout feature, depending on how paranoid you are, is the \u201cTravel Timeline\u201d option, which will allow you to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at places along your trip (similar to features on Swarm and Facebook), but tracks your journey in timeline form. As with most apps that track location, you must give the app permission to do so, and the app promises the timeline is only visible to you (though you can share portions of it with friends via SMS or email).The travel timeline will ask you if you\u2019re at a restaurant or attraction; it will never assume you\u2019re anywhere unless you confirm. If you forget to check your app while at a location, it will give you an opportunity to go back and plot previous stops. Should you be taking photos along the way, it will automatically package those near the times and places on your timeline.While my wife was a bit spooked by the timeline tracking our every move, I liked that it was creating a record of where we were. If you\u2019re like me and tend to forget the name of that one restaurant while you\u2019re attempting to recommend it to a friend, you\u2019ll appreciate the timeline.You can also give your mother one less reason to check your Facebook page by easily, and privately, sharing parts of your timeline via SMS or email, photos included.As promising as I found many of these features, some things could be a bit more intuitive. I drove myself slightly crazy trying to turn off the timeline once my trip was over (waiting for the train on the Monday back to work is not a memory I want to retain). The on/off toggle on the timeline page goes away after you turn it on. To turn it off, you have to go to the app\u2019s settings.And while the ability to download city guides is great in theory \u2014 giving you access to information and maps offline when you lose cellular service or just want to save on data \u2014 I spent several minutes poking around trying to download the North Adams guide, but realized there isn\u2019t one for every city. But it would be nice to be able to download maps regardless of whether there is a city guide.If you\u2019re able to download one of the over 300 city guides that are available, you will have convenient access to them in an appropriately labeled tab within the app.The average user of the new TripAdvisor should be impressed with its intuitive layout and improved search capability, and the app has enough promising functionality that already distinguishes it from other travel-booking apps like Expedia\u2019s and Kayak\u2019s. TripAdvisor says new features like better mapping technology are coming soon, which should only strengthen its case for being a premier all-in-one online travel planner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Gets a Tech Makeover", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlso last year, in a less publicized development, Jean Yang, 30, returned to this city after more than a decade of living in Boston, finding a Pittsburgh she hardly recognized from her 1990s childhood.These seemingly unrelated events have one thing in common: Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s School of Computer Science.Because of the top students and research professors at Carnegie Mellon, tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber have opened offices here.The big tech firms, along with their highly skilled, highly paid workers, have made Pittsburgh younger and more international and helped to transform once-derelict neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and East Liberty.\u201cI loved C.M.U., and that\u2019s the main reason why I stayed,\u201d said Mr. von Ahn, who, in addition to his role at Duolingo, is a consulting professor in the School of Computer Science.There were also business advantages to remaining: Duolingo is close to the engineering talent (\u201cC.M.U. is pumping out some of the best, at a rate of about 500 a year,\u201d Mr. von Ahn said), and for millennial job-seekers, Pittsburgh\u2019s quality-of-life-metric is looking better these days than ever-costlier, ever-more-crowded New York or San Francisco.For Mr. Wirth, the software engineer who started at Duolingo in February, Silicon Valley is a fun place to visit, but living and working in the Bay Area would be a grind.\u201cI was just there last week for a conference,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. \u201cI was talking to someone who told me, \u2018My commute is two hours on the bus.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do that.\u201dKamal Nigam, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who is the head of Google Pittsburgh, said that a decade ago, workers hired by the company had family or personal connections to the city. That is no longer the case. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people who are moving to Pittsburgh for the very first time, from all over the country and the world,\u201d Mr. Nigam said.He added, \u201cWith the growing number of start-ups and the big companies in the area, people realize they can have not just one job at a good tech company, but a tech career here.\u201dFor many years, Pittsburgh was a place 20-somethings fled or avoided. In the 1990s, Allegheny County, which includes the city, was the second-oldest large county in the United States, behind only a geriatric zone in Florida. It was a notoriously difficult place to be young and single, and an earlier generation of computer science students put in their four years at Carnegie Mellon, grabbed their diplomas and left.This is the sleepy city Jean Yang knew while growing up near the campus, where her father was a research scientist in the School of Computer Science. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize no one wanted to stay in Pittsburgh,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI was just leaving because I thought everyone wants to leave where they grew up. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come back as an adult.\u201dBut Ms. Yang\u2019s field of research is in computer programming languages, and, as she put it, \u201cC.M.U. is the best place for the kind of work I want to do.\u201d When she was offered an assistant professor position in the School of Computer Science and discovered a changed Pittsburgh on her visits back, Ms. Yang accepted the job and returned last August.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an excitement about being here,\u201d she said. \u201cI go out to eat and drink in East Liberty. Lawrenceville I go to a lot. Everywhere I go didn\u2019t exist when I was growing up.\u201dPut simply, where the tech world is going \u2014 self-driving cars; personal A.I. concierges; robot workers \u2014 is where Carnegie Mellon\u2019s faculty and students have been for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s like being in Hogwarts,\u201d said Andrew W. Moore, the dean of the School of Computer Science. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool and exciting to have these glimpses of the future, and to see all these people running around and having these crazy ideas.\u201d\u201cI get to see these cool things all the time and I\u2019m just stopping to say, \u2018Well, what does this even mean for the world?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou start thinking, \u2018Someone can use this in dance class.\u2019 Then you think: \u2018Wait. Can we use this to judge gymnastics competitions?\u2019 Then you say, \u2018Wait, couldn\u2019t we use this in securing Penn Station in New York?\u2019\u201dSpeaking of Red Whittaker, the professor who led Carnegie Mellon in winning the $2 million Darpa Urban Challenge self-driving car competition in 2007, Mr. Gutkind said, \u201cRed was into self-driving vehicles before anyone,\u201d using Carnegie Mellon\u2019s resources and reaching out to local investors for money and technical support.A legend in the robotics field, Professor Whittaker turns out also to be a gentrification pioneer: He was instrumental in locating the school\u2019s National Robotics Engineering Center in an abandoned foundry in Lawrenceville, in 1996.\u201cLawrenceville was in the lost and found, it was really rough,\u201d he said, adding that the introduction of a state-of-the-art research facility and its educated work force was, among other developments in the area, a \u201ccatalyst and galvanizing influence\u201d for the neighborhood.\u201cThe real estate and the culture of the neighborhood was a very big thing for robotics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd robotics was a very big thing for the neighborhood.\u201dWhich means even a Monocle reporter being dispatched to check out the Espresso a Mano cafe with its rotating exhibitions by local artists can be traced back to the geeks, in a six-degrees-of-Carnegie-Mellon sort of way.Advertisement"}
