{"Headline": "Charles W. Bachman, Business Software Innovator, Dies at 92", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles W. Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92.His daughter Chandini Bachman confirmed his death.Mr. Bachman was a pioneer in the field of database management software. His work would later be eclipsed by that of other innovators, and software tools have changed drastically over the years. But behind every product search on Amazon, movie recommendation on Netflix or bid on eBay, there is a flood of digital communications mediated by database management software, which owes an intellectual debt to Mr. Bachman.He was working for General Electric when he developed a layer of software that allowed programmers to retrieve data for an automated manufacturing system that controlled a variety of tasks \u2014 production scheduling, parts ordering and inventory management.His Integrated Data Store software, first demonstrated in 1963, made it possible to share data across different applications. That capability had been talked about before, but Mr. Bachman was the first to carry it out.His software was crucial to converting the G.E. manufacturing-control system from an idea to a reality, an impressive technical feat given the limitations of the primitive computers at the time.In 1973, Mr. Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to database technology. The award is often described as the Nobel Prize for computer science. In 2014, Mr. Bachman visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama.Mr. Bachman was the first Turing Award recipient who did not have a Ph.D. The earlier winners of the prize, which was first issued in 1966, had academic backgrounds, mainly as mathematicians or physicists. Mr. Bachman had degrees in mechanical engineering, a bachelor\u2019s from Michigan State College and a master\u2019s from the University of Pennsylvania.Mr. Bachman spent his career in the business world at a series of companies large and small, including Dow Chemical, G.E., Honeywell and a start-up backed by venture capital in the 1980s.Yet it was the application of computing to business problems \u2014 rather than business itself \u2014 that Mr. Bachman found appealing.\u201cHe was always an engineer at heart,\u201d said Thomas Haigh, a technology historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who interviewed Mr. Bachman for an oral history project and studied his work. \u201cHe was motivated by the joy of tinkering with complex systems and making things work better.\u201dCharles William Bachman III was born on Dec. 11, 1924, in Manhattan, Kan., the second of four children of Grace Marie Cary Bachman and Charles W. Bachman Jr. His father was the football coach at Kansas State College, and later at Michigan State.The younger Mr. Bachman grew to be a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches, and he inherited his father\u2019s fondness for sports, but his real passion was building and fixing things. \u201cI was always going to be an engineer,\u201d Mr. Bachman told Mr. Haigh in 2004.Mr. Bachman graduated early from high school, took spring and summer courses at Michigan State and then joined the Army in 1943, serving two years in the artillery corps in New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Antiaircraft guns at the time used simple mechanical computers to target a plane\u2019s predicted flight path, a rudimentary primer for Mr. Bachman\u2019s later work.After the war, Mr. Bachman returned to Michigan State to complete his undergraduate degree in 1948. The following year, he married Constance Hadley, shortly after she graduated from Michigan State. They were married for 62 years. She died in 2012.Besides his daughter Chandini, Mr. Bachman is survived by a brother, J. Cary; three other children, Thomas, Jonathan and Sara Bachman Ducey; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Mr. Bachman began his engineering career with big companies that were starting to use computers \u2014 Dow Chemical, G.E. and Honeywell, which bought G.E.\u2019s computer business in 1970. During that time, Mr. Bachman took a leading role in computing organizations, which were establishing standards for how data is represented, shared and modeled.Later in his career, Mr. Bachman worked for smaller companies and started one of his own, Bachman Information Systems, in 1983. It focused on a technology called computer-aided software engineering that was intended to make creating software easier by offering programmers graphical tools instead of requiring them to write code line by line. His company attracted funding from two leading venture capital firms, Venrock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and it enjoyed some early success. It sold shares in a public offering in 1991, and its stock price surged for a while.The young company had some impressive technology. But it failed to catch the shift to personal computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows software and lower-cost applications programs. The remnants of Bachman Information Systems went through a couple of mergers and eventually sold to a larger corporation.\u201cCharlie was always the architect, not a managerial C.E.O. type,\u201d said Jonathan Bachman, a software project manager who worked with his father for years. \u201cAnd a lot of what he designed lives on, in a new guise, today.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}

More than 30,000 messages that she and her team deemed personal and unrelated to her service as secretary of state were deleted. As F.B.I. director, Mr. Comey said Mrs. Clinton had acted irresponsibly but that he would not seek criminal charges against her.The president also referenced his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who met with several Russian figures during last year\u2019s campaign after being promised incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.\u201cMy son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 emails!\u201d he wrote.The younger Mr. Trump released emails setting up the Russia meeting only after being informed that The Times had obtained them and was about to publish them itself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moon Express Sets Its Sights on Deliveries to the Moon and Beyond", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Florida start-up that is striving to become the first private company to put a spacecraft on the moon revealed an ambitious road map on Wednesday for a regular delivery service to send payloads there and elsewhere in the solar system.Robert D. Richards, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Moon Express was on track to launch before the prize\u2019s deadline. But even if the company does not win the prize, he said, Moon Express would still have a profitable future ferrying payloads for NASA and commercial customers.\u201cI think it\u2019s big,\u201d Dr. Richards said of the potential market, adding that he hoped its designs would \u201credefine the possible.\u201dThe company released illustrations of its MX-1E lander, which it says will make the trip to the moon this year.The design change was made so that the lander would fit in a smaller rocket that Moon Express now plans to use for the first mission. \u201cThat\u2019s considered our starter vehicle, our entry-level vehicle, to reach the moon,\u201d Dr. Richards said.The MX-1E then becomes like a Lego piece, allowing Moon Express to use it as a building block for larger spacecraft.\u201cSpace vehicles and landers have traditionally been custom designed for each purpose,\u201d Dr. Richards said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve designed is a common core approach.\u201dMoon Express\u2019s second mission would use a larger spacecraft that looks like two soda cans, one stacked on top of the other, essentially two MX-1Es. One is almost the same as the lander on the first mission. The second module \u2014 without landing legs \u2014 is a propulsion stage that would enable the spacecraft to reach the moon\u2019s south pole, where ice persists inside craters that are eternally in shadows. .Ice is a valuable resource for future human settlements, beyond providing water to drink. Water molecules broken up into hydrogen and oxygen could not only provide air for astronauts to breathe, but also rocket propellent. The ice at the bottom of the craters probably preserves molecules from the earliest days of the solar system, too, which could be a boon for scientists.That same configuration, called MX-2, could also be sent as far away as the moons of Mars, but to land on Mars would require a more complex, more expensive vehicle beyond Moon Express\u2019s current designs. \u201cIt can get basically anywhere in the inner solar system,\u201d Dr. Richards said, meaning the neighborhood from the sun to Mars.Two additional configurations would put together multiple building block propulsion modules in larger moon landers. A propulsion module at the center could serve as a smaller vehicle that could blast off from the moon, bringing back rocks and soil samples to Earth.The cost of building and launching a MX-1E is less than $10 million, Dr. Richards said. NASA missions, by comparison, typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cWe want to collapse the cost of getting to the moon and by doing so, there is going to be a brand new market that is going to emerge,\u201d Dr. Richards said.He said he hoped that in the years to come, Moon Express would be launching at least twice a year.Moon Express is not the only company betting on the moon, which has been largely overlooked since the end of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions four decades ago.Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh dropped out of the competition last year because the 2017 deadline proved unrealistic. It is still developing its Peregrine lander and now plans a 2019 launch, with 11 customers signed up.\u201cWe\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at,\u201d said John Thornton, Astrobotic\u2019s chief executive. He said Astrobotic was aiming to launch once every two years and then increase the rate to once a year.Advertisement"}

The audience members were led to their seats not by ushers but by guards with wooden batons hanging from their belts. Then the unlikely sounds of opera rang out in Attica, the maximum-security prison here in western New York that still bears the scars of the deadly 1971 uprising.\u201cI never cried at Attica until the day I sat in its chapel and heard the glorious voices of your opera company,\u201d one inmate wrote in a thank-you letter to Francesca Zambello, the general director of Glimmerglass, after last summer\u2019s performance of excerpts from Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Another wrote that the music had \u201cpenetrated some of the most guarded parts of the prisoners.\u201dMichael Rhynes, 57, who has been incarcerated since 1984 and is working with other inmates to start a theater group at Attica, said in a prison interview on Tuesday that he had been amazed by \u201cBoh\u00e8me,\u201d his first opera, which was sung in Italian.\u201cDidn\u2019t understand the language,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I understood the universal language: love found, love lost.\u201dMs. Zambello said in an interview that she was grateful to the prison officials who had given Glimmerglass\u2019s project the green light.

(When they did \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d in costume last year, they had to list everything they brought \u2014 down to the last bobby pin.) They did get permission to bring in a crutch for Musa Ngqungwana, the South African bass-baritone playing Porgy, whose disability is key to the plot.Ms. Zambello described to the audience the opera\u2019s story, recounting the twists and turns of a work about love, loss, race, murder, drug use, imprisonment, perseverance and hope. When she set the scene for one aria by saying that \u201ca crap game starts,\u201d a murmur of recognition rippled through the audience.

Inmates and guards gave a standing ovation when the performance ended, and one inmate cried out: \u201cBravo! Encore!\u201d\u201cI need to decompress,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. Ms. Trevigne observed softly: \u201cWe get to leave.\u201d Then the cast boarded the bus for the trip back to Cooperstown.Ms. Zambello stayed behind to lead an evening class for the fledgling inmates\u2019 theater group, which is being called Third Prison from the Sun. She has been corresponding with its founders for much of the year, sending them scripts of several plays that don\u2019t have big parts for women, including \u201cTwelve Angry Men.\u201dIn a classroom overlooking several white ranch houses with outdoor play sets, where some Attica inmates are allowed 48-hour visits with their families, she walked the group through the basics of putting on plays. \u201cEveryone can tell a story,\u201d she told them. \u201cYou can do it anywhere. You can definitely do it here.\u201dWilliam Oree, one of the inmate founders, asked her about casting, how to project, when to try to use an accent and how to avoid potential conflicts among the cast.Ms. Zambello hopes to expand the partnership for next year\u2019s offering, the musical \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d which Glimmerglass is performing as part of Leonard Bernstein\u2019s centennial: She wants to teach the inmates the choruses, so they can participate.It sounded good to Mr. Rhynes. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a Jet,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Prosser Robinson tapped Genevi\u00e8ve Forget of the video game publisher Ubisoft; Stephanie Harvey, a professional e-sports player; and Stephanie Powell, a community manager at Roll20, an online tabletop gaming service for games like Dungeons & Dragons.The quartet, who volunteer time to Misscliks while still engaged in their day jobs, said they created the channel after realizing how often women in the video game industry are made to feel undervalued.\u201cWe were tired of being anomalies,\u201d Ms. Prosser Robinson said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a girl who does gaming, isn\u2019t she a sparkly unicorn?\u2019 We thought if we could make it more normal to see women\u2019s faces in e-sports and make a support network, maybe they\u2019d stick around.\u201dOn any given day, Misscliks features rotating shows and content. Unlike many other Twitch channels that are built around a single personality, Misscliks is collaborative. It has a range of hosts, and users are invited to write in and pitch ideas for shows.One regular show on Misscliks is \u201cLet\u2019s Play,\u201d in which hosts play video games and people tune in to watch. Another show is dedicated to discussing and playing Heroes of the Storm, a multiplayer online battle arena video game published by Blizzard.Misscliks also has a behind-the-scenes Slack channel for its creators and hosts, where people can talk openly about any issue, or ask for help if they are experiencing online abuse or bullying.\u201cPlatforms, organizations and leagues are seeing that women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. folks are an important part of their user base and audience,\u201d said T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at M.I.T. and director of research at AnyKey. \u201cMaking sure they are able to participate is key to the bottom line.\u201dThe popularity of the Misscliks mission has yet to be determined. The channel has just over 23,000 followers, a fraction of the millions of followers drawn to some of the more popular Twitch channels.Ms. Prosser Robinson, who oversees the daily operation of Misscliks with the help of one or two others, said the channel was not aiming to be huge or a giant profit-making entity. While Misscliks makes some revenue from advertisers and subscriptions, the money goes back into the streamers and the channel, she said.Ms. Prosser Robinson said these messages were part of the \u201clittle steps\u201d being made toward dealing with harassment in gaming.\u201cAt least people now have a general awareness that it\u2019s important, which is very different compared to a few years ago,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pinterest Wants to Show Advertisers It Can Run With the Big Dogs", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUp and down the festival\u2019s main boulevard, displays showcased new technology that allows users to search the digital scrapbook site using pictures taken on their smartphones. It claimed a beachfront space for the week and called it Pinterest Pier, a place where colorful signs highlighted the company\u2019s popularity among its users and the potential that represented for brands. (\u201cSee the possibilities,\u201d a sign declared at the beach\u2019s entrance.) Refreshments based on popular Pinterest posts were served, complete with physical cards that mimicked their appearance online.The pageantry represented Pinterest\u2019s renewed efforts with advertisers, which have escalated in the past 10 months as it looks to regain its early buzz and show what it believes sets it apart from the likes of Google, Facebook and Snapchat. Part of that includes breaking from its understated style and playing the game: In addition to its setup at Cannes, it made a splashy appearance at this year\u2019s South by Southwest festival and has attended at other industry events.\u201cIt\u2019s a focus for this year, building better tools and better relationships,\u201d Ben Silbermann, the soft-spoken chief executive and co-founder of Pinterest, said in an interview at an ad agency conference in April, where he was a speaker. A major part of that has been \u201ceducating marketers who may not be that familiar with the platform on what it is and what it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Yet Pinterest\u2019s users, the majority of whom are women, often provide a gold mine for advertisers with their searches and by \u201cpinning\u201d posts that they are interested in, indicating if they are exploring items tied to home redecoration, weddings or everyday needs like recipes and clothes before they have decided what to buy. Pinterest has been positioning itself as a better alternative to Google for search marketing, saying its connection with its users comes a step before someone types words into a search engine, especially now that it offers nascent visual search technology.\u201cThe pitch to advertisers is explaining what people do on the platform,\u201d Mr. Silbermann said. \u201cWhat they do is try to design their life. That\u2019s always a good place to be; Google\u2019s pitch is, \u2018People find stuff here.\u2019\u201dBut changing perceptions has not been Pinterest\u2019s only hurdle with advertisers. The company asks that ads on Pinterest mimic user posts, providing their own beautiful imagery and helpful tips \u2014 another parallel that Mr. Silbermann drew to Google, given how its ads blend in with search results. While they can be more effective than ads that interrupt photos of friends on social networks, it\u2019s a different kind of work for marketers and means that they have one more platform that they need to specifically design content for.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen brands achieve return on investment with Pinterest that blows away Facebook and Instagram, but that only happens when marketers share useful content and inspiring ideas,\u201d said Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company. \u201cIt takes a shift in habits, which takes time.\u201dThe company was also hampered by taking off \u201cat the tipping point of the desktop-to-app transition,\u201d GroupM, the media investing arm of ad giant WPP, said in a report this year, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s likely that its commercial progress was slowed by its immaturity and a need to build for the desktop platform for which it was conceived.\u201dStill, the firm has a positive outlook on Pinterest, adding that with the introduction of promoted pins and search ads, the company \u201cmay be a serious challenger as a natural link between interest (not quite the same as intent) and commerce.\u201dGoogle dominates search advertising, which brings in tens of billions in revenue for the company a year \u2014 and it too has a visual search technology called Google Lens. But that has not stopped the ambitions of its rivals, which were on particular display in Cannes during a panel hosted by Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science agency. The panel, called \u201cConsumer Discovery and a New Way to Search,\u201d featured Pinterest\u2019s sales chief speaking about image search and Amazon\u2019s vice president of global ad sales on voice search, making it clear that they were representing the new ways of searching.The company has also been trying to enhance its appeal with the public, running its first brand campaign in the United States last month around the phrase \u201cWhat if.\u201d The ads featured the phrase and Pinterest\u2019s name on striking photos, like that of a decadent pink milkshake topped with candy and a doughnut and another of an extremely fluffy poodle.Some in the industry viewed Pinterest\u2019s prominent setup in Cannes last month as a sign of more to come from the company.\u201cThere\u2019s an order of operations for Pinterest and it speaks to the methodological nature of Ben Silbermann \u2014 don\u2019t get flashy until you are absolutely confident,\u201d said Kevin Knight, the chief marketing officer of Experticity, who led Pinterest\u2019s creative and brand strategy until last year. \u201cThey had to wait until they were absolutely confident they could stand up in that bright light and withstand the scrutiny, so you\u2019ll see them get way more vocal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Profits Fall Far Short of Expectations, but Investors Shrug", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy day\u2019s end, Mr. Bezos had not returned the favor, with Amazon reporting profits that were less than a third of what Wall Street had expected.No matter. It was still the kind of performance that investors have come to expect from Mr. Bezos and Amazon: a 25 percent increase in sales and example after example of how the company is pouring money into original video programming, warehouses and shaping the future with new technology and products like its Echo family of gadgets.The company\u2019s stock fell only about 3 percent in after-hours trading.The relative indifference to Amazon\u2019s bottom line was another sign of why the company is so frightening to competitors and critics. Investors would almost certainly have pummeled any other retailer that turned in the kind of performance that Amazon reported Thursday. Instead, they give Amazon several miles of leash because of its history of turning investments into sales growth and technology leadership.\u201cYes, we are continuing to invest and stepping up investments,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with reporters, repeating a variation on a theme that company executives have expressed many times before.For a short time on Thursday, Forbes estimated Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth at $90.6 billion, compared with $90 billion for Bill Gates, a philanthropist and a co-founder of Microsoft, moving Mr. Bezos to the No. 1 spot for the first time.By the end of the day, Mr. Bezos had dropped back to No. 2.For the second quarter, ending June 30, Amazon said its net income was $197 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, in the same period a year earlier.Analysts had expected a decline in profits, but not one that big. The average earnings estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was $1.42 a share. Mr. Olsavsky said the company\u2019s operating income, a different measure of profits, was within the range of possibilities it had previously shared with investors.Mr. Olsavsky did not play down the fact that Amazon had found ways to invest in the growth of its business. The company\u2019s revenue increased 25 percent, to $38 billion from $30.4 billion a year ago. That made analysts happy. Their average revenue estimate was $37.2 billion.Since the Whole Foods deal was announced, several members of Congress have raised concerns about its potential impact, expressing fears that it could accelerate consolidation in the food industry, eliminate jobs at brick-and-mortar retailers and further limit the availability of grocery stores in already underserved areas.\u201cI would be very surprised if this deal had really substantive problems with the F.T.C.,\u201d Mr. Keeley said, referring to the Federal Trade Commission.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Boom, but Some Stock Pickers Are Wary", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits\u2019 end as they gathered for the firm\u2019s weekly investment committee meeting.The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies.Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners \u2014 foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity \u2014 these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes.That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent \u2014 the so-called Fang stocks \u2014 on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index.For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema \u2014 and it is showing up in the numbers.This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure.Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don\u2019t meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google.But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks.Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods \u2014 a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio.\u201cThis is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,\u201d said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \u201cIt is just mindless buying of these technology names.\u201dFunds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index.More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place.And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the \u201cE.T.F.-ization\u201d of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009.For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over.Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows.The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous.It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund\u2019s philosophy and its performance.Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008.Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus\u2019 bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund\u2019s peer group has done better over the past year.Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark \u2014 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition.But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost \u2014 and to date \u2014 better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense.Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small \u2014 $150 million out of a $15 billion fund \u2014 and they come after five consecutive years of inflows.Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful \u2014 we are competitive people,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying \u2018Sorry.\u2019\u201dEmbracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking \u2014 as core equity did in 2008 \u2014 as opposed to running ahead of a bull market.So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences.\u201cThere is a herd mentality out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying stocks irrespective of valuations \u2014 if we can\u2019t do the math, we are just not going to own it.\u201dParnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny.As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties \u2014 in the office and on the road \u2014 a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco\u2019s ultracasual workplace culture.To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends.Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here.Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking.And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day.Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten\u2019s office.At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy.But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns \u2014 from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain.All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them.\u201cThe threat to these companies has increased,\u201d Mr. Allen told his colleague. \u201cIt reveals what Jeff Bezos\u2019 ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world.\u201dAt least they hope not.Advertisement"}

A typical Amazon warehouse job pays $13 or so an hour.\u201cThey\u2019re certainly a big deal for the region,\u201d he said.Still, the good economic news has been shadowed by questions over the growing role of automation in the retail business.\u201cThere is a bit of a sense of, \u2018Is this necessarily something for a 20-year-old to build a career around?\u201d said Dr. Michael.At the same time, he suggested that a loss of jobs centered around menial tasks could give way to more rewarding work.\u201cYou know, if the industry shifts to something that has fewer, higher-paying, higher-value jobs,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I don\u2019t think that would necessarily be a bad thing.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u2022 On Friday, suspects in the deadly Ghost Ship warehouse fire will face a plea and bail hearing in Oakland.Colma, known as the City of Souls, has a living population of about 1,500 and a dead tally of about 1.5 million.The town of roughly 2 square miles sits just outside San Francisco, its much larger neighbor and the cause of its transformation into a modern necropolis.It was this week in 1901 that San Francisco ended burials within its borders, declaring that the growing city\u2019s land was too valuable to be wasted on cemetery plots.\u201cWhere homes and mansions should rear their pinnacles to the western sky, cold tombstones and clammy vaults stand, a silent menace to the living, a mockery to progress and the advancement of civilization.\u201dIn the years that followed, San Francisco evicted thousands of its bodies to what is now Colma, transforming its open farmland into graveyards.The city was incorporated by cemetery operators in 1924, its living residents mainly florists, monument makers and others connected to the trade. But over time other types of people and businesses also moved in.Still, today roughly three-quarters of Colma remains zoned for cemeteries. There are 17 altogether.Among the headstones are boldface names like Levi Strauss, William Randolph Hearst and Wyatt Earp.Joe DiMaggio is buried at Colma\u2019s Holy Cross Cemetery.

Despite an earnings report on Thursday evening that disappointed the market and led to a 2.5 percent decline in its share price, Amazon is remarkable as a purely financial entity. Its stature as one of the most successful companies in the history of the stock market is already assured. In fact, the numbers show that since 1997, when it became a publicly traded company, Amazon has evolved into one of the century\u2019s greatest wealth-generating machines.When I first spoke with Professor Bessembinder in May, he had prepared a list of the 30 greatest wealth creators in the stock market through 2015. But this past week, he showed me a Lifetime Wealth Creation list, with fresh rankings through 2016. The stocks at the very top remained the same: Exxon Mobil, followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM.But further down the list, Amazon appears for the first time. It is ranked 14th, just behind such august names as Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble and ahead of Coca-Cola and DuPont.In essence, the list shows which stocks have been the most profitable for shareholders over history. A very small group \u2014 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks \u2014 account for all of the stock market\u2019s net gains from 1926 through 2016, he found. And only 30 stocks \u2014 Amazon is now one of them \u2014 account for more than 30 percent of all of the market\u2019s wealth creation in that 90-year period.What\u2019s more, Professor Bessembinder found that Amazon\u2019s annualized return through 2016 was 37.4 percent, the highest of all the top 30 wealth creators. That is partly because Amazon hasn\u2019t existed for that long: It\u2019s easier to sustain fast growth for shorter periods. Exxon, for example, which has created more than $1 trillion in wealth for shareholders since 1926, more than any other company, ground out its gains at a slower pace: It has an annualized return of only 11.9 percent, Professor Bessembinder said.Even after the earnings blip on Thursday, Amazon\u2019s value in the market has skyrocketed this year. It has risen more than 36 percent. \u201cIf it holds onto those gains, we can expect that it will climb higher on the cumulative wealth creation list,\u201d he said.Of course, while Amazon\u2019s market power has been wonderful for its own investors, it has damaged many of its competitors \u2014 diminishing the wealth of shareholders of those companies.Consider how Amazon\u2019s cumulative stock returns dwarf those of its retail competitors and the overall market. Using Thomson Reuters data, I calculated that over the last 15 years through Tuesday, Amazon returned more than 8,200 percent, compared with 125 percent for Walmart, 2.2 percent for Sears, and 302 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, dividends included.If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 \u2014 and had held onto your shares \u2014 that money would be worth $83,000 today.By comparison, $1,000 invested in the entire Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends, would amount to $4,100 \u2014 not a bad performance, until you look at the gaudy Amazon returns. Far worse, if you had put the money in Walmart shares, your investment would be worth only $2,250. And if you had stuck with Sears during all of its travails, you would be almost where you started, with $1,022.Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm, has another way of comparing Amazon\u2019s stock returns with those of its retail competitors. It has built the Death by Amazon Index, which it describes as \u201ca way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com.\u201d Those companies \u2014 there are now 54 of them \u2014 include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart.The numbers are stark. The Death by Amazon Index has declined 18.9 percent through Monday \u2014 trailing Amazon by almost 55 percentage points.Unlike Mr. Gates, who has diversified his portfolio and has been giving money to charity at a rapid pace, Mr. Bezos continues to bet heavily on Amazon. As Thursday\u2019s earnings report showed, that does entail risk. The company\u2019s ever-expanding retail operations are sapping its profits, but it has been raking in earnings through cloud computing. As has been the case since Amazon\u2019s inception, it pays no dividends, instead plowing cash back into the company\u2019s core.For now, the mighty Amazon wealth-creation machine continues to roar. Whatever happens next, this is already one of the great tales in the history of capitalism.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel, While Pivoting to Artificial Intelligence, Tries to Protect Lead", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe computers in modern data centers \u2014 the engine rooms of the digital economy \u2014 are powered mainly by Intel chips. They animate the computing clouds of the internet giants and corporate data centers worldwide.But Intel is now facing new competitive forces that could pose a challenge to its data-center dominance and profitability.In particular, the rise of artificial intelligence is creating demand for new computing hardware tailored to handle vast amounts of unruly data and complex machine-learning software \u2014 and Intel\u2019s general-purpose chips are not yet tuned for the most demanding tasks. Instead, specialized chips are delivering better performance on artificial intelligence programs that identify images, recognize speech and translate languages.How successful Intel\u2019s efforts prove to be will be crucial not only for the company but also for the long-term future of the computer chip industry.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more competition in the data-center market than we\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d said Linley Gwennap, a semiconductor expert who leads a technology research firm in Mountain View, Calif.Intel has long dominated the business for central processing chips that control industry-standard servers in data centers. Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, said the company controlled about 96 percent of such chips.Big Intel customers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also working on chip designs. AMD and ARM, which make central processing chips like Intel, are edging into the data-center market, too. IBM made its Power chip technology open source a few years ago, and Google and others are designing prototypes.To counter some of these trends, Intel is expected on Tuesday to provide details about the performance and uses of its new chips and its plans for the future. The company is set to formally introduce the next generation of its Xeon data-center microprocessors, code-named Skylake. And there will be a range of Xeon offerings with different numbers of processing cores, speeds, amounts of attached memory, and prices.Yet analysts said that would represent progress along Intel\u2019s current path rather than an embrace of new models of computing.Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein Research, said, \u201cThey\u2019re late to artificial intelligence.\u201dThe Nervana technology, Intel has said, is being folded into its product road map. A chip code-named Lake Crest is being tested and will be available to some customers this year.Lake Crest is tailored for A.I. programs called neural networks, which learn specific tasks by analyzing huge amounts of data. Feed millions of cat photos into a neural network and it can learn to recognize a cat \u2014 and later pick out cats by color and breed. The principle is the same for speech recognition and language translation.Intel has also said it is working to integrate Nervana technology into a future Xeon processor, code-named Knight\u2019s Crest.Intel\u2019s challenge, analysts said, is a classic one of adapting an extraordinarily successful business to a fundamental shift in the marketplace.As the dominant data-center chip maker, used by a wide array of customers with different needs, Intel has loaded more capabilities into its central processors. It has been an immensely profitable strategy: Intel had net income of $10.3 billion last year on revenue of $59.4 billion.Yet key customers increasingly want computing designs that parcel out work to a collection of specialized chips rather than have that work flow through the central processor. A central processor can be thought of as part brain, doing the logic processing, and part traffic cop, orchestrating the flow of data through the computer.The outlying, specialized chips are known in the industry as accelerators. They can do certain things, like data-driven A.I. tasks, faster than a central processor. Accelerators include graphics processors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (F.P.G.A.s).A more diverse set of chips does not mean the need for Intel\u2019s central processor disappears. The processor just does less of the work, becoming more of a traffic cop and less of a brain. If this happens, Intel\u2019s business becomes less profitable.Mr. Gwennap, the independent analyst, said, \u201cIntel has a very good read on data centers and what those customers want.\u201dStill, the question remains whether knowing what the customers want translates into giving them what they want, if that path presents a threat to Intel\u2019s business model and profit margins.Advertisement"}

Its argument: When an ad is on Amazon, a direct connection can be made between people seeing it and then making a purchase.\u201cHow your product is perceived on Amazon and in the Amazon community in ratings and reviews has such a powerful impact on the future of you as a brand,\u201d said John Denny, vice president for digital and e-commerce at Bai Brands, the beverage company. \u201cIncreasingly, if you win on Amazon, you win, period. And this is the world marketers have to wrap their brains around.\u201dSeveral advertising executives anticipate that more agencies will begin offering Amazon-focused services, comparing the company\u2019s rise to previous paradigm shifts like when search engines and social media became a daily part of people\u2019s lives.Dooley Tombras, the firm\u2019s executive vice president, said it sent products to influential Amazon reviewers in hopes of soliciting positive feedback and conducted \u201cguerrilla sampling,\u201d like holding events \u201cwhere we\u2019re handing out a product and we\u2019ve got teams there with iPads and we\u2019re encouraging people to write reviews of a product on the spot.\u201dThere are more than 14,000 reviews of the powder. The page also has more than a dozen images of the powder taken from \u201cmultiple angles\u201d against a light background to look clean and professional, Mr. Tombras said, along with short videos extolling the powder.Brands can pay Amazon to customize the middle of pages with large advertorial images and information \u2014 which in the protein powder\u2019s case included photos of men working out; a recipe for \u201cbirthday cake pancakes\u201d made with the chocolate-flavored whey; and a chart featuring six of its other products, like Micronized Creatine Powder, explaining when and how they should be consumed.Mr. Tombras\u2019s firm is even working on a feature for Echo devices that will provide recipes from Optimum Nutrition. \u201cIf you find a recipe you like and happen to not have that flavor or item, you can go ahead and make that purchase,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is pretty cool.\u201dAmazon has long been an online shopping behemoth, but marketers now know it is playing an increasingly important role in how people discover and learn about their goods.\u201cE-commerce is nothing new, it\u2019s been going on for decades, and Amazon is nothing new, it\u2019s been successful for decades \u2014 but now they are becoming much more of a dominant force in brand discovery,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the digital agency 360i.Its quick success in categories like apparel and the popularity of voice search emphasized that, Ms. Hofstetter said. \u201cAmazon is the new shelf space,\u201d she added, \u201cand if you\u2019re not on it, you may be rendered invisible.\u201dThe agencies said in the release that more than half of United States consumers now started online product searches on Amazon, compared with 28 percent on search engines and 16 percent on retailer websites.Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call this year that \u201cAmazon\u2019s penetration in most areas is frightening to some.\u201d He added that the company was his response when people asked him, \u201cWhat worries you when you get up at night and when you wake up in the morning?\u201dIn an interview in Cannes, France, last month, Mr. Sorrell said his firm wanted to do more with clients and Amazon, but noted there were major questions around how brands might gain access its customer data and compete on voice search.\u201cWhat happens if I say to Alexa, \u2018I like Cheerios,\u2019 and Alexa says, \u2018I\u2019ve got Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes, which are 10 percent off\u2019?\u201d he said.Amazon Media Group, the company\u2019s growing advertising division, has been looking to assuage such concerns while touting new ways marketers can reach people on Amazon. Seth Dallaire, its head of global ad sales and marketing, has been urging agencies to view product pages and images as \u201cbrand marketing vehicles,\u201d noting that if they are not well maintained it could undermine all the work companies did to get people there in the first place.\u201cWe can see the entire customer-decision journey, and that\u2019s what\u2019s unique,\u201d Mr. Dallaire said. \u201cWe can help a brand if they\u2019re selling their products on Amazon understand when a customer is exposed to an ad and, when they clicked on an ad, if they bought something, and then we can help them tailor their marketing messages and their creative to each different step.\u201dThat\u2019s no small pitch given the guesswork that goes into advertising. Amazon has long sold lucrative sponsored product listings and other ads tied to search terms on its site, like Google. It also offers automatically placed ads on external sites using its own technology and data, and marketing on Amazon packages and devices like Kindles.Amazon does not disclose the size of its ad business, though estimates show it is well below Google and Facebook, which each bring in more than $25 billion from ads annually. While eMarketer estimated that Amazon will attract more than $1 billion in ad revenue this year, BMO Capital Markets forecasts $3.5 billion for 2017 and $5.7 billion next year.\u201cIn the grand scheme of things, the advertising revenue they\u2019re generating is small compared to Google \u2014 you can barely compare them,\u201d said Norm Johnston, global chief strategy and digital officer for Mindshare. \u201cBut for Amazon, it\u2019s not the advertising revenue in itself. They know if brands invest in the platform, the more sales they\u2019re going to generate, and a lot of those sales lead to subscription models.\u201dIn the past, many brands handled their Amazon business through store sales teams that determined shelf positioning and end-of-aisle displays at brick-and-mortar chains. That is no longer workable as Amazon extends its ad network, offering branding opportunities through its Prime program and streaming N.F.L. games.\u201cIn the old world, you\u2019d run magazines, TV spots and outdoor ads, then you\u2019d go into the shop, and they\u2019d control what happened in the shop,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cYou can\u2019t distinguish like that anymore.\u201dTo that end, marketers are also learning to pay new attention to issues like how much of an item is in stock before promoting it, or risk being penalized by Amazon\u2019s algorithms if they aren\u2019t able to handle demand, Mr. Denny of Bai said.Mr. Dallaire said Amazon planned to keep investing in its ad sales and agency development teams.Ultimately, he said, the interest is generated by behavioral shifts.\u201cIt could be people shopping on their phones, the expectation you or I might have of getting immediate customer-review information and pricing information within seconds of pulling a device out of our pockets, it could be the expectation of hearing a song you ask Alexa to play,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvertisers want to make sure they are not missing out on these customer trends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bowie Knives and a Tick Head: Marketing Gets Elaborate at Comic-Con", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 A woman clad entirely in white greeted me with a robotic smile and a warning. \u201cThis may be disorienting,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you O.K. with that?\u201d Inside a nearby display case were Old West weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun and a bowie knife. \u201cPlease select one,\u201d she said brightly.And so began my trek through \u201cWestworld: The Experience,\u201d an HBO marketing stunt that sums up both the promise and the challenges of Comic-Con International, which kicked off its 48th installment here on Thursday.Hollywood has long seen the fan gathering as a crucial marketing opportunity. But Comic-Con\u2019s epicenter, the San Diego Convention Center, has now grown so chaotic and overcrowded that many movie and television companies complain that it is hard, if not impossible, to stand out. The blinding hubbub, combined with the ever-increasing power of social media, has led many studios and networks to focus more intently on elaborate experiences \u2014 \u201cactivations,\u201d in industry shorthand \u2014 in the surrounding hotels and streets.To participate, fans register in the lobby of the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. Then they receive the secret headquarters location of Delos, the fictional company behind Westworld, a theme park where wealthy visitors live out Wild West fantasies amid robot \u201chosts.\u201d (It\u2019s in a hotel on the other side of downtown.) Once inside, participants seem to step inside the show, with hosts preparing them for a trip inside the park.And it is disorienting. In one room that looked a bit like a futuristic doctor\u2019s office, I sat alone with a host who did a \u201cpsychological assessment\u201d by asking questions like, \u201cWhat percentage of your dreams are nightmares?\u201d\u201cAbout 30 percent,\u201d I answered honestly. The woman shot me a startled look. (Later, I quizzed participants about their answers, which turned out to be much lower. And then I went home and had a bad dream about having too many bad dreams.) Ultimately, the host gave my personality this appraisal: \u201cYou are strong-willed but not unhinged.\u201d (I clearly fooled her.)The experience ended with a trip inside the show\u2019s saloon, complete with player piano and bartender hosts pouring cocktails. Everyone leaves wearing a cowboy hat.Here are some other stunts planned for Comic-Con\u2019s 2017 run, which concludes on Sunday.Perhaps the most elaborate Comic-Con stunt of them all. To generate interest in \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d arriving in theaters in October, Alcon Entertainment and Warner Bros. teamed with Johnnie Walker to replicate the movie\u2019s futuristic setting \u2014 complete with an Oculus virtual reality experience, a neon-lit Los Angeles street scene, more than 50 props and vehicles from the film, and a cast of 34 actors in costume. The 12,800-square-foot exhibit, near the convention center, took a production team of 40 people working a full week to install, Warner said.To introduce fans to this new superhero series about human mutants, Fox set up a \u201cgene screening station\u201d outside the Hilton Bayfront. Participants must submit to swabbing inside their mouths (yes, seriously) and will later learn about their personal genetic profiles.Netflix built an elaborate complex across from the convention center to promote several of its offerings, including this coming science-fiction film starring Will Smith. There are \u201cBright\u201d sets and a related augmented reality experience. The complex also includes a \u201cStranger Things\u201d virtual reality encounter and \u201cThe Defenders\u201d costumes and sets.Not to be outdone, Amazon has built a nearby pavilion dedicated to \u201cThe Tick,\u201d a superhero action comedy, complete with fully constructed buildings from the series and a 20-foot-tall animatronic Tick head. (It\u2019s blue with little antennas.) Amazon will also dispatch actors in Tick costumes as \u201cstreet teams\u201d designed to generate photos on social media sites.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With \u2018Logan Lucky,\u2019 Soderbergh Hopes to Change Film\u2019s Business Model", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 I want movie studios to keep their grubby paws off my money. And I want complete control over how my films are marketed.Now he is back \u2014 and betting that an unorthodox distribution plan for his new heist comedy, \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d will serve as a model for auteur directors who are as fed up with the Hollywood system as he has been.\u201cAfter years of shooting my mouth off about absolute creative control, we\u2019re going to attempt to do it,\u201d Mr. Soderbergh said.\u201cThe question is this,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you do what the studios normally do from a wide distribution standpoint, only with a lot fewer resources \u2014 spending on marketing \u2014 and with a much better economic structure for the people who actually made the film?\u201dThe financial story of \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d which arrives in theaters on Aug. 18, starts in the fall of 2014. According to Mr. Soderbergh, a \u201cfriend\u201d asked him to read the script, about a ragtag group that robs a Nascar track, and suggest a director. Mr. Soderbergh said he loved the idea (Ocean\u2019s 7-Eleven, if you will) and wanted to direct the film himself.But distribution would not be so easy.The standard option for a wide release, meaning at least 2,500 locations in North America on opening weekend, involves renting a major studio\u2019s machinery. A studio like Warner Bros. foots the marketing bill (about $40 million is standard for a production like \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d) and handles all aspects of the release. For its services, the studio collects a fee (roughly 15 percent of total ticket sales) and deducts its expenses. Any remaining profit goes to the owners of the film.For Mr. Soderbergh, that route was a nonstarter. \u201cYou\u2019re way too far away from your money,\u201d he said.Mr. Soderbergh also wanted to spend much less on marketing. It would stand to reason that a studio would, too. But it is actually in a studio\u2019s interest to spend more \u2014 that way the box office total is usually bigger, which in turn means a bigger fee. It is also extremely hard to get studios to rewrite their marketing playbooks. With dozens of movies on the assembly line, overwhelmed studio executives tend to go with what has worked in the past.\u201cI understand why they resist new ideas,\u201d Mr. Soderbergh said. \u201cWith so much money at stake, it\u2019s hard to sit in that room and say, sure, let\u2019s jump off a cliff and try a whole new approach.\u201dIn addition, Mr. Soderbergh, who won an Academy Award in 2000 for directing \u201cTraffic,\u201d wanted full creative control over \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d advertising. He said studios had never given him absolute say over a campaign. Trailers, for instance, are tested with focus groups before they are released and often tweaked based on the responses. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult once you get into studio testing to push back,\u201d Mr. Soderbergh said.They would raise about $20 million in marketing money by selling off a portion of the film\u2019s nontheatrical rights. Amazon, for instance, bought streaming rights.Mr. Soderbergh noted that the box office bar for success is lower under this setup. With nearly everything prepaid, and no hefty distributor fees coming off the top, even a modest $15 million opening would be a win.\u201cWe know that a lot of big-time filmmakers are watching this,\u201d Mr. Fellman said. \u201cWe want this to be the beginning of a bunch of movies.\u201dSo far, Mr. Soderbergh has spent only about 15 percent of his \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d advertising budget. With only three weeks until release, studios would have typically spent 40 percent. But Mr. Soderbergh believes that the vast majority of marketing should come immediately before a film\u2019s release.Outdoor \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d ads are concentrated in the Midwest and South. Bucking studio tradition, billboards are scarce to nonexistent in cities like Los Angeles and New York.That mystery may be part of the marketing plan.In response to questions about the screenplay\u2019s author, Mr. Soderbergh said in an email, \u201cClarify? Me? Why would I do that? I can tell you that Rebecca Blunt is enjoying all this immensely.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotel Boom in SeaTac Is Unfettered by $15 Minimum Wage", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the higher minimum wage hasn\u2019t done that at all. The hotel industry is a prime example: Nine hotels are in development, which will increase the available rooms by 25 percent, to 7,000.SeaTac is home to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, now the ninth busiest in the nation, and a new light rail line links the airport to Seattle. Nearby are the corporate headquarters of Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks, Costco and Nordstrom, and Seattle\u2019s unemployment rate has been hovering around 3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Michael H. Mahoney, president of the Dallas-based development company Western International, said his company had not built anything in the Seattle area for more than 10 years, but it was drawn to SeaTac because some available property there bordered a lake and the light rail system had just been built. Business travelers can stay near the airport where it is a bit less expensive than in downtown Seattle, he said, \u201cand close to their flight home,\u201d but they still have easy access to downtown for meetings or entertainment.He said he considered the $15 minimum wage before deciding to go ahead with a 176-room Residence Inn by Marriott that is scheduled to open next spring, but it was not the determining factor. \u201cWe are competing for quality people seeking the best jobs, so would likely have been at that threshold anyway,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise\u201d about higher minimum wages, he said, but he decides whether to enter an area based on an overall favorable economic outlook. If the area is not doing well, \u201cwe\u2019re not going in there,\u201d he said, so wages are not generally a factor.Sylvia A. Allegretto, an economist and co-chairwoman of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, said she and her colleagues had studied 30 years of wage and employment data and found that higher minimum wages had not reduced employment.Higher pay, she said, often translates to lower employee turnover, as fewer employees leave to seek better-paying jobs. For employers, that means decreased costs for replacement hiring and training. Also, she said, the modestly higher prices that may result \u2014 for example in food concessions \u2014 are generally borne by customers.Josh Bivens, research director at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said low-income workers who receive pay increases are likely to spend that extra income, stimulating economic growth, an effect called \u201cmiddle-out economics.\u201d\u201cWage increases at the middle and bottom are recycled back into the economy as spending on restaurants, clothes, cars \u2014 all things that support employment in other sectors of the economy,\u201d Mr. Bivens said.Mr. Robinson, the SeaTac economic development director, said hoteliers had adapted to the ordinance, which requires any hotel with at least 100 rooms or 30 full-time employees to pay the $15 minimum wage. \u201cNobody eliminated rooms to get under it,\u201d he said.Steven Lou, whose company, Lou Development, is building a 132-room Hyatt House and a 237-room Hyatt Place in SeaTac, said he was not worried about the $15 minimum wage. In fact, he expected to pay even more to hotel employees.\u201cWe are willing to pay a good wage for stable, skilled employees,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter they are trained and have been with us a while, they will make more than $15 an hour.\u201dIf room prices go up a little to help pay for the higher wages, he said he thought the market could easily bear it.Taylor Kerns, investment analyst at the Corinthian Development Company, based near San Jose, Calif., said his company decided to increase the size of the Wingate hotel it was building in SeaTac to 157 rooms from 123 partly because of the higher minimum wage.\u201cWe\u2019re mostly a \u2018heads in beds\u2019 property,\u201d he said, meaning the hotel does not offer amenities like a full restaurant. \u201cSo the majority of our employees are housekeeping and security.\u201d They would typically be lower-wage employees, he said.Corinthian decided that increasing the number of hotel rooms would raise the property\u2019s revenue, but would not require many more employees to accommodate the extra guests. \u201cWe\u2019d gain in efficiency,\u201d Mr. Kerns said.He said the firm also decided to increase the room count because most of the available land in the area had been purchased. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be many new hotels for quite a while after these all go in,\u201d he said.Mr. Robinson said he advised other cities increasing minimum wages to \u201cengage the community, listen to concerns, be responsive as you can.\u201d Jobs, he said, \u201care important.\u201d He said he also works closely with developers to make the regulations work for the city and business interests.Yogi Hutsen, executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, said Cedarbrook Lodge in SeaTac was already planning to add 67 rooms to the 100 rooms already there when the higher minimum wage was approved. He said that revenue takes a harder hit in food and beverages than in lodging when wages go up because \u201cpeople are more likely to notice a price increase of a few dollars on a menu than on a room rate.\u201dHe said that it takes some time for businesses to adjust to higher wages and see \u201cwhat can be passed on and what the company has to absorb,\u201d but that his company was committed to fair compensation for its staff.He said he only wished that neighboring cities would follow SeaTac\u2019s lead and raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. \u201cWe\u2019re in a noncompetitive situation,\u201d he said, \u201cand it would be easier if everyone else was paying the exact same wages.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a hotel boom in SeaTac, Wash., misidentified the company that employs Yogi Hutsen, an executive in SeaTac. He is executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, not of Cedarbrook Lodge. (Cedarbrook Lodge is managed by Columbia Hospitality.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "News Outlets to Seek Bargaining Rights Against Google and Facebook", "Date": "2017-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorSo what we used to call \u201cthe newspaper industry\u201d \u2014 but which now includes outlets with robust online existences \u2014 is coming together to make its biggest push so far to change the balance of power.This week, a group of news organizations will begin an effort to win the right to negotiate collectively with the big online platforms and will ask for a limited antitrust exemption from Congress in order to do so.It\u2019s an extreme measure with long odds. But the industry considers it worth a shot, given its view that Google and Facebook, regardless of their intentions, are posing a bigger threat economically than President Trump is (so far) with his rhetoric.The Alliance, the main newspaper industry trade group, is leading the effort to bargain as a group. But it has buy-in across the spectrum of its membership, bringing together competitors like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, as well as scores of regional papers like The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, which face the gravest threats.Capturing the current mood, News Corporation \u2014 which oversees The Journal, The New York Post and Dow Jones \u2014 said in a statement that it supported the effort to \u201cfocus the public and Congress on the anticompetitive behavior of the digital duopoly, especially as it adversely affects the news and information businesses.\u201dMark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, told me that \u201cthe temperature is rising in terms of concern, and in some cases anger, about what seems like a very asymmetric, disadvantageous relationship between the publishers and the very big digital platforms.\u201dThe thinking is that publishers need the option of operating as a group \u2014 and the leverage that would come from any collective action \u2014 should they determine that it\u2019s the only way to win meaningful accommodations.In the tumultuous news climate, Google and Facebook don\u2019t want to be seen as undermining real journalism. And executives with both companies told me it was in their interests to have ample, reliable news content.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, said. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do.\u201d\u201cWe want to help publishers succeed as they transition to digital,\u201d Google said in a statement, calling the effort \u201ca priority.\u201dPublishers say they appreciate how Google and Facebook put their news content in front of many millions of users they couldn\u2019t reach on their own. And they acknowledge the efforts the platforms are making to help.But as Mike Klingensmith, the publisher of The Star Tribune and the chairman of the News Media Alliance, told me in an interview, \u201cthey\u2019re talking to us, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of action yet.\u201dMr. Klingensmith said that for midsize dailies, which have been hit particularly hard by the shift in ad spending, \u201cit is impossible for us to go as a one-off company and negotiate or even get an appointment with these companies.\u201dThe Times is backing the move for what is called an anticompetitive safe haven, in part, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cbecause we care about the whole of journalism as well as about The New York Times.\u201dHe said The Times would consider joining a collective negotiation should its own talks fail to yield satisfactory results, which, he noted, they have yet to do.The Alliance acknowledges that its bid requires legislation giving them specific clearance to negotiate as a group, which is not commonly granted. It\u2019s an especially big ask from a Congress that hasn\u2019t had a great legislative batting average and whose controlling party, the Republicans, is not in a very press-friendly mood these days.Press representatives for the Senate and House Judiciary Committees \u2014 led by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia \u2014 said they couldn\u2019t comment without hearing directly from the Alliance.The Alliance\u2019s outside counsel, Jonathan Kanter, said he was hopeful that one argument in particular could sway them: \u201cThe product at issue is important from a public policy perspective \u2014 we\u2019re not just talking about widgets, we\u2019re talking about news, and news is crucial for a democratic society.\u201dWhatever the outcome, that should be a starting point everyone can agree upon.Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Consumers May Be More Trusting of Ads Than Marketers Think", "Date": "2017-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe early results from a recent study that Kent Grayson, a Northwestern University marketing professor, did on consumer skepticism left him feeling a little, well, skeptical.So he ran the trials a few more times. Each time, when participants were asked what they thought of modern advertising techniques, they answered with words like \u201ccredible,\u201d \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201dThe study, done by Mr. Grayson and Mathew Isaac, a professor at Seattle University, and published in April in the Journal of Consumer Research, surveyed 400 participants regarding 20 common tactics used in television and digital ads. Thirteen of the tactics elicited favorable responses, which surprised even marketers.\u201cRight off the bat, I was wondering, \u2018Who did they talk to?\u2019\u201d said James Shani, founder and chief executive of Madison & Vine, a digital studio in Los Angeles.It is no secret that advertisers have faced difficulty getting through to savvier audiences that are far less trusting of brands and institutions than previous generations. Indeed, that notion formed the basis of what Mr. Grayson intended to examine when he began his research last year.\u201cOur hypothesis was that maybe it\u2019s more nuanced than that,\u201d Mr. Grayson said. \u201cPeople have said, \u2018I don\u2019t trust advertising.\u2019 The truth is, there is a lot of advertising that they do trust.\u201dCertain tactics, such as offering to match a competitor\u2019s low prices, reporting a high rating on a site like Amazon or Yelp or mentioning a recent ranking by a third-party source like U.S. News & World Report, received the most positive reactions from participants. Others, like using paid actors instead of real people, or even hiring celebrity endorsers to express their affinity for a product, came off as \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201cmanipulative,\u201d according to those surveyed.Jake Sorofman, who analyzes marketing trends as a vice president and chief of research for Gartner for Marketers, a research and consulting firm, said brands should already be recognizing that the \u201cpersuasion by way of manipulation\u201d approaches of the past were not going to work on modern consumers.\u201cConsumers are certainly becoming more savvy, more skeptical, more discriminating,\u201d Mr. Sorofman said. \u201cThey expect a lot more, and that\u2019s putting pressure on marketers to do better.\u201dChris Raih\u2019s conclusion is that consumers are willing to play along, as long as brands play fairly. Mr. Raih, the founder and president of Zambezi, a Los Angeles ad agency, wrote an essay for AdWeek in January about combating the \u201catmosphere of disbelief\u201d that he felt had pervaded society. He argued that brands needed to better use their platforms to bridge gaps, communicate and inspire.\u201cWe do see more nuance than what is reported,\u201d Mr. Raih wrote in an email. \u201cLook, today\u2019s audience is more sophisticated than ever before. They know how the machine works. They know why Facebook ads retarget them based on previous searches. They know why brands buy space on certain programming. The mystique is gone.\u201dThough the study demonstrated that all approaches are not equally unscrupulous in the eyes of consumers, some advertisers are trying to look beyond antiquated tactics for better ways to engage with people.\u201cWe\u2019re advising our clients on the importance of \u2018proving\u2019 over \u2018selling\u2019 brand values,\u201d Adam Tucker, president of Ogilvy & Mather New York, wrote in an email. \u201cAcross the industry, we\u2019re seeing brands evolve their marketing communications to be more engaging, more participatory and, ultimately, more personalized.\u201dMr. Shani said the study reaffirmed his contention that people were looking foremost for authenticity from companies. Establishing that takes time; he compared it to putting money into an individual retirement account, where the dividends do not pay off for years.\u201cAuthenticity is not a metric,\u201d Mr. Shani said. \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling you always get when you see a brand.\u201dThe researchers did not distinguish between age groups. Nor did they break down the tactics by presentation \u2014 print, digital or television \u2014 choosing to keep the formatting ambiguous.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of marketers out there that are trying to trick people,\u201d Mr. Grayson said. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to cheat consumers on the edges, such as by keeping the price the same but decreasing the food that\u2019s in the package by imperceptible amounts. We do have to go around with a certain amount of vigilance.\u201dAn important point, Mr. Isaac said, is that consumer disbelief about certain tactics can also be fluid. Some approaches deemed disreputable a few years ago could become more widely accepted. Product placements and native advertising \u2014 packaged to look like journalism \u2014 are two examples.\u201cI think the jury\u2019s out,\u201d Mr. Sorofman said, referring to native ads as manipulative. \u201cBut the best practices tend to ensure there\u2019s transparency. As long as there is transparency in the intent.\u201dAsked what he felt about the \u201catmosphere of disbelief,\u201d Mr. Shani said he still wanted to double-check the researchers\u2019 work. \u201cDid he mean credible or not credible?\u201d Mr. Shani joked.But the researchers hope that advertisers can embrace some bit of good news and home in on what they have demonstrated can work.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of bias out there that marketers already think they\u2019re behind the 8-ball a little bit, where consumers already think we\u2019re out to get them,\u201d Mr. Isaac said. \u201cAnd that may not be the case. They might actually be starting from a greater position of strength than they think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They lost their new C.E.O. for untold reasons. Five months in, and he\u2019s a goner. Ouch!Speaking of which, I decided to bite the bullet and try one of these meal kits. I signed up for Blue Apron, so we\u2019ll see if I can make it through a cooking session without setting my house on fire. I also tried cooking a week\u2019s worth of dinners from Green Chef, which were really tasty. Everyone keeps telling me Sun Basket is good, too.Really what I\u2019ve learned is that dinners are essentially becoming Lego blocks for adults. I\u2019m not sure if I like it.I can\u2019t see any reason I\u2019d want to use this. Seems like it would make much more sense for Amazon to buy Pinterest, which already skews heavily toward shopping and list-making. But perhaps I\u2019m wrong. (Also, Amazon just spent a bunch of money on Whole Foods, so they might not want to whip out the checkbook again so soon.)Meanwhile, over in Twitter-land, the company said that early results on its abuse reduction tactics showed they were actually working. As a result of using technology and artificial intelligence better, abuse and harassment seem to be slowly decreasing on the site, according to some slightly opaque statistics they\u2019ve shared.And yet, you still have an account and are allowed to tweet at me. Big oversight, methinks.I\u2019m curious to hear your take on this, but my inclination is to believe it\u2019s a smart enough play by Lyft. If you believe that autonomous vehicles are the future \u2014 and literally almost every major company in transportation believes this is the case \u2014 then you need to position your business for a day in which there are more robot drivers than human ones. That could benefit Lyft, as they could take a larger cut of revenue from each ride they complete. (Admittedly, there are many other costs associated with driverless tech, to be clear.)However, Lyft just isn\u2019t as well funded as Uber, the $70 billion behemoth that is developing its own self-driving tech in house. So I can see a kind of platform play and striking deals with partners as a decent compromise.What do you think? I have a feeling you disagree with me.In other words, self-driving looks as if it\u2019s shaping up like the cloud business. There\u2019ll be two or three big providers that will sell tech to lots of different transportation companies. And those transportation companies \u2014 whether they\u2019re carmakers or shared-ride providers like Lyft or some other type of business \u2014 will build many different kinds of businesses using that licensed technology, just like Netflix stores its videos on Amazon\u2019s cloud.So it\u2019s weird to me to see all these transportation companies spending so much to create their own tech. It would be as if American Airlines decided to build autopilot for its planes rather than let Boeing and Airbus do it. Or if Netflix started its own cloud service to host its videos. It\u2019s odd.But I\u2019m just a tech columnist with a lot of time on my hands. See you next week!Advertisement"}

He came to watch a movie, which for me became an exercise in remaining perfectly still while I focused on the proximity of his legs. After the credits rolled, we talked until dawn. Then he began listing his hesitations about \u201cus,\u201d even though we had never touched.\u201cI\u2019m working through a breakup,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, it ended a year ago. I\u2019m leaving the city soon. But I\u2019ll be back in a month. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m grounded.\u201d After a long pause, he asked what my hesitations might be.I wasn\u2019t sure where to start, so I pointed out that it was getting late \u2014 or early, depending how you look at it \u2014 and asked if he wanted to sleep over. \u201cIf you do sleep over,\u201d I added, \u201cyou don\u2019t even have to kiss me.\u201dHe laughed. As we slept through the morning, he reached for me shyly and held on.He was like a living version of my favorite books, records of places I dreamed to go: \u201cVoodoo in Haiti,\u201d \u201cMoby-Dick,\u201d even \u201cA Field Guide to the Birds of Australia.\u201d He was the perfect castaway, a man who would be at ease whittling driftwood into fish hooks while lost at sea.The second time he slept over, he brought a toothbrush. A clue that this was no accident.The third time, he said he had never met anyone who looked like me, murmuring, \u201cYou\u2019re lean and lithe.\u201d Later he would compare me to an ocelot, those leopard look-alikes that slink through the Amazon.I was flattered. In my previous relationship, I felt more like a hamster, a classroom pet purchased in a rush and forgotten over spring break. Now I had moved on to men like this one, who saw me as a wild cat, and whom I pictured as a cross between a sea horse and a deer, track-star tall with a dancer\u2019s grace.Not long after, he set off on a cycling tour overseas. My expectations of commitment were low. I was surprised to receive messages every day from remote villages with weak reception, and invitations to connect on Skype. He sent me links to hit songs from the \u201980s \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t You (Forget About Me)\u201d \u2014 and pictures of luminous markets at night. We snapped photos of handwritten letters and emailed them to each other, like postcards twisted by time travel.\u201cAnimal reporting to watering hole,\u201d I wrote.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about you, too,\u201d he replied.Months after his return, I lay next to him thinking I couldn\u2019t have asked for a person who more closely fit my heart.\u201cI feel love for you,\u201d I whispered as he fell asleep.\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, twitching awake.\u201cI feel love for you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dI was never sure if he heard me clearly or if my words were more like the sound of an alarm clock that steals its way into a dream.One day, we sat down at a small cafe for breakfast. We laughed at sketch comedy clips on my phone, calculated the relative lengths of Chile and Canada and pondered cycling across both.When we got back in his car, he said, \u201cI guess there are a few things we should talk about.\u201dIt was another couple of hours before I realized he was breaking up with me. It was a 12-hour conversation in all; I spent 10 of them feeling as if I were slipping off a craggy cliff face, clawing at every sapling while trying to make sense of the downfall.Our talk moved from his car to sitting lakeside near my house, after which I had to meet friends for dinner \u2014 a previously planned engagement that became an awkward confession of the day\u2019s events. Then back to his car, where our breakup resumed.\u201cDon\u2019t chase a man who doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d I told myself.\u201cThis is sad,\u201d he announced blankly at one point, staring out the window.It was the middle of the night before I finally slipped away and into my house. Pausing to turn the key, I felt physical pain in my limbs and on my face, my skin wind-whipped and hot from the free fall.I had begged him not to give up on us.I woke up the next day with regret that I had spent so many hours ending things, for believing a person could be talked into feeling something he didn\u2019t. (When he sent me an email several days later, I wrote back like a secretary politely responding on someone else\u2019s behalf, signing off with, \u201cI wish you well.\u201d)I focused on what I learned during our marathon breakup: that he wasn\u2019t feeling connected, either to me or more broadly. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was actually struggling or just trying to let me down easily, but his words gave me hope that the problem had little to do with me and was resolvable.\u201cHow do you expect to feel connected to me if you don\u2019t feel connected to yourself?\u201d I asked.\u201cThat\u2019s a great question,\u201d he said, offering a shrug instead of an answer.I thought if the fog lifted, he would surely return, and we would resume our talks about tree houses to vacation in, animals we would like to be. But as days turned into weeks and then months of silence, I began to move through a fog of my own, deeply questioning the masks people wear, the parts of our interiors that can be seen by others only if we choose to reveal them.Hearts and minds can be as opaque as a rain forest; only small pieces of them are ever visible. And I realized this, too: You can\u2019t contain the people you love. You can\u2019t contain your own love, either.I looked for ways to manage the hurt, denial and rage. I took up kickboxing, which helped. I contacted a therapist I had seen, a powerful woman nearing 70 who often spoke with the air of a monk meditating on a mountain.\u201cThere are no shortcuts to love,\u201d she said. \u201cHonor the truth inside yourself and give that to another.\u201dAfter months of meditating on the parts of him that had blindsided me, I started to consider the parts of myself that I had hidden from him. Not just from him but from myself as well, parts of my life where I wasn\u2019t living honestly.While we were together, I had anxiety attacks every day, though I never mentioned them while dancing across the kitchen to offer him oven-baked salmon and glasses of wine.I\u2019m not sure if we fall in love with people or if we fall in love with the way they make us feel, the ways they expand who we are and wish to be. The last time we spoke, I told him how moved I was by a photo in National Geographic of hundreds of shark fins drying on a rooftop in Hong Kong. I pictured the finless sharks drowning after being cast overboard, the marine equivalent of being buried alive.He had seen it too.\u201cI\u2019d like to get involved somehow,\u201d I said, ignoring that the ocean is nearly a thousand miles from Toronto. If I had learned anything from therapy, it was to pay attention to everything that lit a fire inside. Listen. Feel. Tend that flame.One day, I ran into a friend at a coffee shop who, as it happened, was working on a film about sharks. Excited, I offered to volunteer. He took me on and eventually hired me. It felt as if I were casting off the husk of who I had been so I could emerge as the person I wanted to become.I can\u2019t help but think that if it weren\u2019t for how those interests were stoked in that relationship, I might never have recognized how badly I craved a life like those depicted in the books on my shelf, a patchwork of stories about faraway places.Shortly after starting my new role, I went back to my therapist and told her: \u201cIt\u2019s been a year since we broke up. I thought my dream job and exercise would heal me, but I still think about him every day. What more can I do to let go?\u201dFirst, she told me a story about a man she loved in her early 20s, nearly 50 years ago, whom she still thinks about to this day. Then she said: \u201cYou\u2019re asking the wrong question. It\u2019s not about getting over and letting go.\u201dI looked down at my hands and considered how this could possibly be about anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s about honoring what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cYou met a person who awoke something in you. A fire ignited. The work is to be grateful. Grateful every day that someone crossed your path and left a mark on you.\u201dMiriam Johnson has worked in documentary film and is a songwriter in Toronto.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing in Malls, Despite Store Closings", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReal estate funds, market stars since the financial crisis ended in 2009, have faltered, dragged down by the closing of big stores at malls across the United States.The unanswered question now is whether investors in malls can successfully adjust to a threatening environment.Real estate mutual funds and exchange-traded funds hold real estate investment trusts (R.E.I.T.s) that must deliver at least 90 percent of after-tax earnings to investors. R.E.I.T.s own all sorts of income-producing property: shopping malls, apartment complexes, industrial warehouses and medical buildings, for example.Recent closures and fears of wider surrender to online rivals like Amazon weigh heavily on R.E.I.T.s. Kingpin retailers like Macy\u2019s, J. C. Penney and Sears have been shuttering stores, as have Foot Locker, Office Depot and Abercrombie & Fitch. Once-omnipresent chains like Payless ShoeSource and RadioShack have filed for bankruptcy.Apparel stores in particular have been hit hard by online competition so far, but Amazon\u2019s $13.4 billion proposed acquisition of Whole Foods could put food outlets \u2014 until now mostly resistant to online incursions \u2014 into play.Industry optimists say the malls can successfully adjust. \u201cReal estate mall owners are as sharp as can be,\u201d said Richard Diamond, whose company in Cambridge, Mass., has represented both tenants and mall owners in lease negotiations.\u201cThere are a lot of tenants who want to get into those malls,\u201d Mr. Devlin said.When a department store \u2014 presumably a mall\u2019s magnet for shoppers \u2014 closes, smaller tenants often press for lower rents. Such negotiations are \u201cbeing done behind closed doors,\u201d Mr. Diamond said.Rent pressures are strongest in lower-tier malls, Mr. Hurley said. \u201cIn better-located malls, you\u2019re not seeing a dramatic decline in rents,\u201d he added.But for those malls that have lost a major tenant, finding replacements is crucial. New targets include restaurants and entertainment venues with novel themes.Some fund managers emphasize that retail malls are not the only income-producing properties that investors should be assessing.For all their incursions, online sales still represent less than 10 percent of the overall retail market.In either case, online retailing\u2019s growth has already benefited one R.E.I.T. sector: industrial real estate that hosts distribution centers and warehouses. \u201cIndustrial has seen a lot of demand from e-commerce tenants,\u201d Mr. Devlin said. And as mall owners wrestle with their problems, yield-conscious investors have been turning to such options to bolster their returns on real estate.Advertisement"}

Although it is too soon to say whether Microsoft can pull off a full-blown renaissance the way Apple has, the company is firmly back in favor.At the same time, the company delivered growth where it mattered to investors \u2014 in the cloud business that has become Exhibit A for bulls convinced that Microsoft has a grip on the future of computing. The company\u2019s shares popped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading after the release of the results.Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing business was the star of the company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, as it has been for many quarters. Revenue from its Intelligent Cloud business rose 11 percent to $7.4 billion.In a call with analysts, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said the company closed the highest number of multimillion-dollar Azure deals to date during the quarter. Ms. Hood also said that for the first time, the revenue Microsoft received from the commercial version of Office 365 \u2014 a cloud version of its productivity applications that customers subscribe to \u2014 surpassed the revenue the company received from traditional sales of the software.Over all, for the quarter that ended June 30, net income was $6.51 billion, or 83 cents a share, up from $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose to $23.32 billion from $20.61 billion. After adjusting those figures to include deferred revenue from its Windows 10 operating system and other items, Microsoft\u2019s revenue was $24.7 billion and 98 cents a share, which exceeded Wall Street forecasts.The average earnings estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was 71 cents a share, while the average revenue estimate was $24.27 billion. Analysts did not include the tax benefit from Microsoft\u2019s phone business, which amounted to 23 cents a share, in their earnings estimates, so a more accurate comparison with the 71 cents a share forecast was 75 cents.\u201cI\u2019d like to see more initiatives and growth there,\u201d Mr. Thibault said, \u201cinstead of pinning all our hopes on cloud.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Tackles Hollywood\u2019s F. Scott Fitzgerald Obsession", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "\u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d a nine-episode series, is the latest good-looking attempt to adapt F. Scott Fitzgerald for the screen.Supported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Meltdowns are not Matt Bomer\u2019s style, not even remotely, but he would have been due one in mid-March.Then I arrived to ask him jagged questions. For more than 90 years, Hollywood has been trying and failing to pull off the perfect Fitzgerald adaptation. Why couldn\u2019t anyone seem to get it right? What would keep this \u201cLast Tycoon,\u201d arriving on Amazon Prime on Friday, July 28, from becoming another sad example?\u201cMaking a great television show is hard enough,\u201d Mr. Bomer said carefully. \u201cTo also tackle F. Scott \u2014 whoa. But when you have brilliant people guiding you, people like Billy, you trust their vision and go for it.\u201dAdding a degree of difficulty, \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d will serve as a vehicle for commentary about modern-day Hollywood and America as a whole. \u201cAll these things that are coming to a head right now in our country \u2014 immigrants, sexism, the generational clash \u2014 are really big elements in our show,\u201d Mr. Bomer said. \u201cThere are so many American ideals that Fitzgerald was wrestling with and that we\u2019re still struggling to perfect.\u201dIt all sounds fascinating. But cracking Fitzgerald would be a feat unto itself.Of \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d in particular, she added, \u201cIt is awfully hard to film Hollywood \u2014 to make it look authentic.\u201dMr. Berg, whose books include \u201cGoldwyn: A Biography,\u201d about the movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, is a consulting producer of Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d and he vetted every script. Hollywood\u2019s challenges with Fitzgerald, he explained, start with his words.\u201cWhat makes his work so intoxicating is the writing \u2014 \u2018So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berg said, quoting the last line from \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t film language. You can use narration, of course. But narration is usually something pasted on a film when the visual storytelling isn\u2019t working.\u201dRewrite too much, and Fitzgeraldophiles have a fit. But his novels are generally not structured for film. (\u201cTender Is the Night,\u201d for one, uses shifting perspectives and moves forward and backward in time.) So screenwriters have no choice. Novels heavier on plot \u2014 works by Charles Dickens, for example \u2014 lend themselves more easily to adaptation, Mr. Berg noted. \u201cFitzgerald, on the other hand, fought metaphorically in his writing,\u201d he said.But the creative ensemble behind the new \u201cLast Tycoon\u201d saw the unfinished aspect of the book as an opening.\u201cKeep the icons from the novel \u2014 the Shiva head, the two-dimes-and-a-matchbox speech \u2014 but polish them up, move things around, explore characters in deeper ways,\u201d Mr. Berg said. \u201cThere could be 50 episodes here if done correctly.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat was put together as a book was extrapolated itself, so let\u2019s extrapolate from there.\u201d\u201cThere is just so much going on with Celia \u2014 steadfast, tenacious, passionate, na\u00efve but saucy,\u201d Ms. Collins told me between takes. \u201cI think fleshing Celia out was a little bit of how Billy and Chris solved the puzzle, and, you know, made this story into something that can last multiple seasons.\u201d\u201cWho has power, what do they do to get it, what do they do when they\u2019ve lost it?\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cWhat are the trades, compromises and deals that you\u2019d make to get your movie made? No difference between 1936 and 2017. None.\u201dMr. Ray pointed to a plotline in the pilot, which has been available on Amazon since last summer, about how Mr. Bomer\u2019s character wants to make a movie but can\u2019t because the German government might find the story objectionable. In the 1930s, Germany was a huge box-office market.\u201cThose exact same conversations are being had about China right now all over Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cIt\u2019s too big of a market to offend.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis is a world \u2014 then, now \u2014 where creative impulses are systematically tempered if not squashed by the system.\u201d He insisted, however, that the companies behind \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d which include Sony Pictures Television in addition to Amazon, had made requests that only improved his show. \u201cThey were interested in the glamour and the romance, and they were right,\u201d Mr. Ray said.(Amazon executives do seem to have a fondness for the period \u2014 and Fitzgerald. In January, the streaming service unveiled the series \u201cZ: The Beginning of Everything,\u201d starring Christina Ricci as a fictionalized version of Fitzgerald\u2019s wife, Zelda.)The same scene could well have unfolded in 1936.Filming soon resumed, with Mr. Bomer and Mr. Grammer performing that confrontational scene. Their fictional studio had fallen on hard times and borrowed money from a cutthroat competitor. Mr. Grammer\u2019s character wanted to pay back the loan by requiring all employees to take a 30 percent pay cut. And he wanted his popular production chief to break the news.\u201cYou can\u2019t treat people this way and expect them to do good work!\u201d Mr. Bomer shouted.The director called cut.A swarm of crew members came out of hiding to fuss over various details. One woman adjusted Mr. Grammer\u2019s pocket square ever so slightly, and a man holding a rolled-up script gave a suggestion to Mr. Bomer. Perhaps add a touch more smoke to the air, someone suggested. (It filters the light in a pretty period way.)\u201cLet\u2019s try it again,\u201d the director said.After all, the pressure was on. This time, Fitzgerald was going to be done right.An article last Sunday about adaptations of works by F. Scott Fitzgerald misstated the title of his second novel, published in 1922. It is \u201cThe Beautiful and Damned,\u201d not \u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Will Service Work Look Like Under Amazon?", "Date": "2017-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyMackey\u2019s was perhaps the clearest articulation of a species of corporate messaging that emerged in the \u201990s and took hold in the 2000s: that of the reluctant captain of industry, the community-minded national chain and the compassionate employer. (Think Trader Joe\u2019s, the Container Store, Panera Bread, Starbucks or Jamba Juice.) It was accompanied by the rise of the conscientious \u2014 and typically affluent \u2014 consumer, for whom purchases could be not just ma\u00adteri\u00adally but also morally aspirational. The food was ethically sourced, but crucially, the labor was, too.Lately this moment in the American service industry feels somewhat distant. It was a response to a different time: Retail and service jobs were on the rise, both in objective terms and in their share of the total work force. From 1989 to 1999, while the economy lost more than 1.4 million manufacturing jobs, it gained more than twice as many in retail alone. Back then, some said that with a few twists of the dial and a better-educated class of consumers, service work could be remade into something more careerlike, offering employees structure, predictability and dignity \u2014 and wealthier customers a form of absolution.It was, mainly, good marketing \u2014 triumphant liberal ideals expressed in the language of the heart. The economy of the late \u201990s was characterized by exuberant consumerism; companies like Whole Foods had devised a way to make people feel better about the products they were buying as well as the people they were interacting with. Whole Foods employees, customers were informed, earned a \u2018\u2018fair\u2019\u2019 wage; they had a say in how stores were managed and in what products they stocked; they were voluntarily given benefits; they were not regarded as employees but as \u2018\u2018team members,\u2019\u2019 working for their employer\u2019s profit while keeping an eye on the health and betterment of their communities.Amazon\u2019s plans for Whole Foods are the subject of plenty of speculation. But one thing is certain: The Mackey marketing playbook \u2014 bringing labor to the fore in order to assure customers that they are A-O.K. and in good hands \u2014 has little to offer Amazon, which can and does regard labor as a simple commodity. In contrast to Whole Foods, which focuses in its marketing on fair-trade and locally sourced offerings, Amazon is made up of a dizzying array of supply chains that are effectively invisible: not hidden, just easily omitted from the consumer experience.I didn\u2019t lay eyes on a single Amazon employee during Prime Day, except for the home-shopping-marathon talent, leaving the onus on me to wonder what was going on behind the scenes. Aside from the \u2018\u2018origin scan\u2019\u2019 on my track-your-shipment page, I won\u2019t know a thing about where my package came from, or be reminded of how it got to me. I will be told nothing about Hulislem. Amazon need not bother to tell a story; in fact, its goal is to reduce the retail story to a single button, an instant, an unprecedentedly complex process taken for granted.Mackey sought to build a more ethical company, and to herald a more ethical mode of consumption. He sought to take the politics out of labor and the labor out of politics. Amazon, by contrast, doesn\u2019t try to tell you yet another story about what it does and who it pays to do it. It bets \u2014 rightly, ruthlessly \u2014 that you\u2019d be more comfortable with no story at all.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nicholas Ray\u2019s Outsiders, on the Lam and Under the Gun", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDNicholas Ray\u2019s \u201cThey Live by Night\u201d (new on disc from Criterion) is a remarkable debut as well as an agonizingly pure love story \u2014 the most lyrical film of the director\u2019s career.A variant of the Bonnie and Clyde myth, with a charismatic criminal couple on the run, the movie is set largely in the Southwest during the Great Depression; it was adapted by Ray and Charles Schnee from Edward Anderson\u2019s 1937 novel, \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d (which was later filmed more faithfully, to lesser effect, by Robert Altman).\u201cIf only he had taken the trouble to be a Frenchman we should be licking his boots in ecstasy,\u201d one British critic wrote of Ray \u2014 anticipating the director\u2019s fate as an artist more highly regarded abroad, and particularly in France, than he would be at home.Like Orson Welles, who, with \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d made RKO\u2019s other great directorial debut, Ray had extensive theatrical and radio experience. Also like Welles, he had the benefit of talented collaborators \u2014 including Welles\u2019s theatrical producer John Houseman. \u201cThey Live by Night\u201d is distinguished both by its innovative aerial tracking shots and the cameraman George E. Diskant\u2019s chiaroscuro lighting. The movie\u2019s leads, Cathy O\u2019Donnell and Farley Granger, are not so much photographed as transfigured.\u201cThey Live by Night\u201d was a favorite of my college film professor, and as a class projectionist I saw it many times \u2014 running scenes in slow motion or playing only the soundtrack. As a result, I know the movie nearly by heart. And its emotional power is undiminished. I may be recalling my own youth (as well as Ray\u2019s), but just thinking about this film can choke me up.Ray\u2019s \u201cThe Savage Innocents,\u201d released a dozen years after \u201cThey Live by Night\u201d opened in the States, wasn\u2019t strictly speaking a studio movie \u2014 it was presented as an Italian entry, along with \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Avventura,\u201d at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Still, it can be said to have ended Ray\u2019s string of unconventional Hollywood films.Like \u201cThey Live by Night,\u201d \u201cThe Savage Innocents\u201d is a deeply romantic tale of misunderstood outsiders on the run. In this case, the protagonist is the Eskimo hunter Inuk (Anthony Quinn). The inadvertent killer of a meddling missionary who insults his wife (the French-Japanese actress and nightclub performer Yoko Tani), he has to go on the lam through the Arctic\u2019s snowy wastes.Mr. Quinn, according to Ray\u2019s biographer Patrick McGilligan, largely directed himself, but he gives a spirited, if stylized, performance. His fellow Eskimos are mainly Asian or Asian-American actors, including the great Anna May Wong in the role of Inuk\u2019s mother-in-law, who, rather than burden him and her daughter, goes stoically to her death.Shot in 70-millimeter, \u201cThe Savage Innocents\u201d is a haunting mix of studio and location work in northern Canada. The gorgeous cinematography is well served by Olive\u2019s new Blu-ray. Ray\u2019s most overtly ethnographic work, the movie flirts with a sort of simpering exoticism. (Peter O\u2019Toole, who appears as one of two white law officers attempting to bring Inuk to justice, seems already fitted for his burnoose.) Despite Mr. Quinn and Ms. Tani\u2019s cuddling and giggles, however, \u201cThe Savage Innocents\u201d is deadly serious in its attempt to approximate the Eskimo language and view of the world.Despite its lack of commercial success, \u201cThe Savage Innocents\u201d did leave an impression. It\u2019s less surprising that Jean-Luc Godard put the movie on his annual 10-best list than to find its unique qualities acknowledged by Bob Dylan who wrote in his ode to Quinn the Eskimo, \u201cYou\u2019ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.\u201d\u201cThey Live by Night\u201d can be streamed on FilmStruck and \u201cThe Savage Innocents\u201d on Amazon Video; \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d was reissued on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber in 2014.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Companies, Three Facets of Balanchine\u2019s \u2018Jewels\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis shared format highlights a subtext left unmentioned by Balanchine but much commented on since the ballet\u2019s unveiling \u2014 the idea that each section is meant to suggest a different school of ballet: French (\u201cEmeralds\u201d), American (\u201cRubies\u201d) and imperial Russian (\u201cDiamonds\u201d).The three companies can be seen to represent these three facets of ballet: the jazzy American vernacular of New York City Ballet; the opulence of the Bolshoi; the more delicate elegance of the Paris Opera. \u201cThere is something interesting,\u201d said Nigel Redden, the festival\u2019s outgoing artistic director, \u201cabout presenting these three styles and seeing if the public can feel the difference.\u201dThe logic behind the contrasts is partly biographical: Balanchine was trained in St. Petersburg, came to artistic maturity in Paris with the Ballets Russes and spent the bulk of his career refining his neo-classical style in New York.I spoke about this contrast of styles in \u201cJewels\u201d with three of the ballerinas who will perform it this month at Lincoln Center.There is a solo in which the dancer begins by moving just her arms, as if admiring them, then appears to be propelled into eddies of movement by a gentle breeze. \u201cI made waves,\u201d Ms. Verdy liked to say.\u201cThe woman in this solo has a sparkle,\u201d Doroth\u00e9e Gilbert said by phone from Paris, using a French word you might use to describe Champagne (\u201cp\u00e9tillante\u201d). \u201cShe loves life.\u201dWherein lies the ballet\u2019s Frenchness? \u201c \u2018Emeralds\u2019 is a very pure dance,\u201d Ms. Gilbert answered, \u201cin which elegance and refinement are important, particularly emphasizing the arms and the lower leg. And to me, the French school of ballet is about that articulation of the lower leg and feet.\u201d\u201cJewels\u201d is a ballet with many leading roles, one of its attractions. In \u201cEmeralds,\u201d there are four (two couples), and in \u201cRubies\u201d three, a main couple and a leggy Amazon who peels away from the chorus line and vamps her way through the rest of the ballet. She\u2019s a force of nature; it takes not one but four men to partner her, one for each limb. In her 14 years dancing the role, Teresa Reichlen has come to define it with cool glamour and an unflappable, almost teasing self-assurance.In the passage with the four men, they encircle her, lifting and lowering one leg and pulling her forward into a sloped arabesque as she balances firmly on one toe. \u201cThey\u2019re literally manipulating you,\u201d Ms. Reichlen said recently at the Koch Theater, home of New York City Ballet, \u201cbut I try to create the illusion that I\u2019m in control, that I\u2019m telling them what to do. I feel very powerful when I dance it.\u201d\u201c \u2018Rubies\u2019 is very grounded,\u201d Ms. Reichlen said, \u201cwith all that pawing and pli\u00e9 on pointe and moves that are low to the ground.\u201d At the center of it all, Balanchine placed this uncontainable, liberated woman.Olga Smirnova, Bolshoi: \u201cYou might look at the ballerina as someone who is cold, maybe even too cold, but that is the way that diamonds shine, with a cold shine.\u201dWhen Balanchine entered the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg in 1913, the students, considered members of the czar\u2019s household, were conveyed to the Mariinsky theater in chocolate-box-like carriages that bore the imperial double-headed eagle insignia. That didn\u2019t last long. Four years later, after the Bolshevik Revolution, Russian ballet became part of the Communist state. In 1924 Balanchine decamped for Germany and then France. \u201cDiamonds\u201d is a tribute to the lost world of the Imperial Ballet \u2014 a gleaming, grandiloquent elegance, remote but tinged with melancholy.\u201cAs in the big classical ballets, everything exists only to put attention on the ballerina, and the partner exists only to capture her attention,\u201d Olga Smirnova said through a translator via Skype from Japan, where she was performing \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d a ballet that is echoed in \u201cDiamonds.\u201d The key is the music, Tchaikovsky\u2019s Third Symphony, written just before the composer undertook \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d \u201cIn the adagio of \u2018Diamonds\u2019 there is this feeling that you are singing the music,\u201d Ms. Smirnova said. \u201cI have a similar feeling dancing the adagio in Swan Lake, because of the way the movements are built into the musicality.\u201dThe music she is referring to unfolds during a slow, mysterious pas de deux that begins with the two dancers\u2019 walking toward each other ceremonially and ends with the man on his knees in a gesture of self-abnegation. \u201cShe\u2019s really like a queen,\u201d Ms. Smirnova said. \u201cSometimes she can permit herself to be sentimental, but not too much.\u201dAll three ballerinas said they were curious about what it would be like to see their companies, each a representative of one of the ballet\u2019s facets, performing side by side. \u201cI\u2019m only in the first ballet,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said, \u201cso you can be sure I\u2019ll be in the wings every night, watching the rest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Among them:\u2022 Dr. Puliafito commonly used hard drugs. At times, he was seen swallowing what was said to be an ecstasy pill and inhaling smoke from a methamphetamine pipe.\u2022 A man who was living in an addiction treatment facility said Dr. Puliafito, a friend of his, had given him meth.\u2022 A woman who worked as a prostitute said she and Dr. Puliafito, who is married, had become \u201cconstant companions\u201d after meeting in 2015.Dr. Puliafito resigned as dean last year not long after the woman, Sarah Warren, overdosed while the pair were at a Pasadena hotel. Yet he continued to serve on the medical school\u2019s faculty.Dr. Puliafito has not publicly addressed the accusations. An attempt by The New York Times to reach him on Sunday was unsuccessful.The university has said it was unaware of the troubles swirling around the doctor.On Sunday, a Los Angeles Times report cast doubt on the university\u2019s eagerness to confront the Puliafito matter.In March, it sent an email to C.L. Max Nikias, the university president, that referred to meth being found in a hotel room registered to Dr. Puliafito.That email, along with multiple other requests for comment, went unanswered, the newspaper said.On Sunday, The New York Times asked the university to discuss the latest Los Angeles Times report and other questions about Dr. Puliafito. The request was declined.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u2022 Internet companies will report earnings: Alphabet on Monday, Facebook on Wednesday, and Amazon and Twitter on Thursday.But medical experts say drug abuse isn\u2019t confined to the margins of society.\u201cI think we have this collective myth of the hard-core drug user being down and out,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a professor at U.C.

Side effects show up: memory loss, anxiety, psychosis. The outward signs become harder to miss.In that sense, the medical school dean\u2019s case is unusual, said Dr. Richard A. Rawson, a substance abuse expert at U.C.L.A.

{"Headline": "The Pop-Up Employer: Build a Team, Do the Job, Say Goodbye", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the organization chart for the maker of True Story, a card game and mobile app in which players trade stories from their daily lives, resembled that of any company. There was a content division to churn out copy for game cards; graphic designers to devise the logo and the packaging; developers to build the mobile app and the website. There was even a play-testing division to catch potential hiccups.Upon closer inspection, the producer of True Story wasn\u2019t really a firm: The workers were all freelancers who typically had never met and, perhaps more striking, the entire organization existed solely to create the game and then disbanded.True Story was a case study in what two Stanford professors call \u201cflash organizations\u201d \u2014 ephemeral setups to execute a single, complex project in ways traditionally associated with corporations, nonprofit groups or governments.And, in fact, intermediaries are already springing up across industries like software and pharmaceuticals to assemble such organizations. They rely heavily on data and algorithms to determine which workers are best suited to one another, and also on decidedly lower-tech innovations, like middle management.But to the extent that temporary organizations replace permanent ones, they have the potential to add to the economic uncertainty that workers must increasingly contend with.Temporary organizations capable of taking on complicated projects have existed for decades, of course, perhaps nowhere more prominently than in Hollywood, where producers assemble teams of directors, writers, actors, costume and set designers and a variety of other craftsmen and technicians to execute projects with budgets in the tens if not hundreds of millions.In principle, many companies would find it more cost-effective to increase staff members as needed than to maintain a permanent presence. The reason they do not, economists have long argued, is that the mechanics of hiring, training and monitoring workers separately for each project can be prohibitively expensive.But Ms. Valentine, who studies management science, and Mr. Bernstein, a computer scientist, note that technology is sharply lowering these costs. \u201cComputation, we think, has an opportunity to dramatically shift several costs in a way that traditional organizations haven\u2019t realized,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s way easier to search for people, bargain and contract with them.\u201dThere is some evidence that the corporate world, which has spent decades outsourcing work to contractors and consulting firms, is embracing temporary organizations. In 2007, Jody Miller, a former media executive and venture capitalist, was a co-founder of the Business Talent Group, which sets up temporary teams of freelancers for corporations.\u201cWe\u2019re the producers,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cWe understand how to evaluate talent, pick the team.\u201dSome of Ms. Miller\u2019s biggest clients are in the pharmaceutical industry, whose economics are not unlike Hollywood\u2019s in that it is heavily project-based and a small handful of blockbusters drive most of the profits. Business Talent Group teams frequently work on the kickoff of a new drug \u2014 devising the strategy for reaching out to patient groups, journalists, doctors and insurers \u2014 and help pry open new markets for existing drugs.Similar intermediaries have sprouted in other industries. In the tech world, there is Gigster, a platform founded in 2014 that knits freelancers together into software-building teams, so that an entrepreneur with no technical know-how can hand off an idea and get back a fully functional app in months or a prototype in weeks.In entertainment, there is Artella, a platform that helps freelance animators, sound designers and other talent form teams that produce animated features. Artella, by also providing the costly technical tools that support animation, may one day allow freelancers to compete with the major studios.Ms. Valentine and Mr. Bernstein wanted to take the concept further. They created a platform, Foundry, in which the process of assembling and running a temporary organization could be automated, without so much as a phone call.Each project began with a project leader and an organization chart. To fill each role, Foundry emailed a group of qualified workers on Upwork, a huge freelancer site, which generated pools of candidates. Once the workers were hired, something Foundry could do automatically, they were assigned tasks and communicated through Slack, the messaging software. The organization chart could be altered as needed, generating new roles and new workers.The professors recently presented their research at a prestigious computer-science conference.Three lessons stand out across the flash-type models. First is that the platforms tend to be highly dependent on data and computing power. Roger Dickey, a co-founder of Gigster, says every member of each team assembled by the company reviews every other member, generating 20 to 30 data points per person per project. Artificial intelligence then looks for patterns and helps the company figure out how best to build future teams.Second is the importance of well-established roles. Sociologists and organizational theorists have marveled for decades at the way disaster response teams or emergency room trauma units pull off complex tasks, even if they have never met before, because the division of labor is understood.The same goes for flash teams. Dave Summa, who worked on a team that the Business Talent Group assembled to advise a major agribusiness company on which markets to compete in, said it fell to him to define the questions that needed answering and the mode of analysis, while a colleague oversaw teams of workers who produced specific plans.\u201cHe was very detail-oriented and meticulous,\u201d Mr. Summa said. \u201cHe let me do what I was good at. I let him do what he was good at.\u201dThen there is perhaps the least likely of innovations: middle management. The typical freelancer performs worker-bee tasks. Flash-like organizations tend to combine both workers and managers.True Story, according to Daniel Steinbock, one of the game\u2019s inventors, would have been lost without its managers. When the writers, who composed short poems for each game card, first submitted their work, he and his business partner had one overriding impression: \u201cMost of the content was really bad,\u201d he said.\u201cBut some of it was less bad,\u201d he added. What followed was a long, tortured cycle of identifying the poems that had some redeeming value and asking the writers to try again and again. The key to the process was another freelancer they hired to oversee this work, who later became jokingly known as the chief poetry officer. \u201cSomewhere along the way they got hired to manage the process of deciding what was good and what was not,\u201d Mr. Steinbock said. \u201cThat worked well.\u201dThe flash organization has obvious limits. It tends to work best for projects with well-defined life spans, not continuing engagements. Microsoft probably would not set up one to build Windows given that it releases a new version every few years.Yet the flash model appears to have revolutionary potential. If nothing else, millions of middle-management jobs that fell by the wayside in recent decades might one day be reincarnated as freelance project-manager positions. \u201cThe bottleneck now is project managers,\u201d Ms. Valentine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough position to fill.\u201dAnd while traditional white-collar freelancing \u2014 and certainly its gig-economy equivalent on platforms like Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk \u2014 can be isolating, being part of an organization tends to be emotionally satisfying.\u201cOne thing that was really surprising and exciting about what we saw was how quickly flash organizations developed solidarity and collective behavior,\u201d Ms. Valentine said. Flash organizations may even promote upward mobility \u2014 if, say, the person brought in to crank out one-line poems can ascend to a supervisory position.Still, even while fostering flexibility, the model could easily compound insecurity. Temporary firms are not likely to provide health or retirement benefits. And even if high-skilled workers like project managers and web developers find they are well compensated on the open market, said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, low-skilled workers tend to fare worse outside firms.Mr. Bernstein concedes that the anxiety is legitimate, though he says platforms could eventually dampen insecurity by playing a role that companies have historically played: providing benefits, topping off earnings if workers\u2019 freelance income is too low or too spotty, even allowing workers to organize.\u201cThis could be a potent force among many in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a policy perspective, we have to figure out how to empower labor when contracts last a few minutes or a few weeks.\u201dFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Samsung, Seeking to Move Past Scandals, Forecasts Record Profit", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Samsung Group tries to move past a series of scandals, the giant Korean conglomerate is finding a point of pride in its profit.One of the conglomerate\u2019s companies, Samsung Electronics, said on Friday that it expected to post record earnings in the second quarter, driven by a booming semiconductor business and positive reviews of its latest mobile phone. The earnings are expected to hit $12 billion, which would surpass analysts\u2019 estimates for Apple\u2019s profit for the same period.But the size and influence of chaebol have prompted scrutiny by authorities and a public backlash over white-collar crime and corruption.While the political cloud remains, Samsung appears to be recovering from its product mistakes.The growth in profit was driven largely by the success of the company\u2019s semiconductor business. With the latest figures, Samsung has overtaken Intel to become the world\u2019s biggest chip maker by sales, according to C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities who is based in Seoul.Samsung has been a dominant force in memory chips and displays for smartphones. The company said this week that it would invest a further $18.6 billion in its semiconductor operations in South Korea.\u201cThe question is how they controlled the mistake,\u201d said Mr. Chung, the Nomura analyst. \u201cSamsung did that well, and recalled all the smartphones.\u201d\u201cSamsung regained their reputation with the S8,\u201d he added, predicting that if an upcoming model was also a success, \u201cpeople will forget that Samsung made a mistake.\u201dThe S8, which was released in April, has been met with broadly positive reviews, with experts noting in particular the quality of its display and its camera. The smartphone also represented the debut of Samsung\u2019s voice-activated assistant, Bixby, its rival to Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.Although Samsung is winning back customers, the technical failure exposed deeper cultural shortcomings. Former employees, suppliers and analysts have said that Samsung management discourages employees from speaking up and identifying problems.It is a perception reinforced by the corruption scandal and political turmoil that continue to engulf Samsung \u2014 disruptions that may prove harder to quell.Mr. Lee, a vice chairman at the conglomerate, has been accused of bribing Park Geun-hye, the former South Korean president, for government approval of the merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. That merger helped Mr. Lee, who goes by Jay Y. Lee in the West, retain control of the wider conglomerate.The scandal surrounding Ms. Park was one of the biggest in South Korea\u2019s history. She was accused of conspiring with Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend and confidante, to accept bribes and extort major companies.Samsung has acknowledged that it made payments but denies that it paid the money in exchange for Ms. Park\u2019s approval.The close ties between companies and government officials have prompted a public outcry.Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, was himself convicted of bribery and tax evasion twice, but he never spent any time in prison. The elder Mr. Lee, who had a heart attack in 2014, was pardoned each time by the president, eventually returning to the helm of the company he helped transform into a technology behemoth.In his first court appearance in the case in April, Mr. Lee rejected charges of bribery. His lawyers said Samsung had offered money to help the daughter of Ms. Choi because it feared a backlash from the president\u2019s longtime friend.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Alexa, Where Have You Been All My Life?\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe other day, a newly single friend confessed that lately she had found herself not just chatting up Alexa, Amazon\u2019s crisp-voiced domestic bot, but also looking forward to her responses. \u201cThat\u2019s a road,\u201d she said darkly, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be heading down.\u201dI know how she feels. Come evening, Alexa may tell me that she isn\u2019t sure if she missed me, but her winking green glow, like the pitch of a dog\u2019s ears, is its own kind of welcome. After a disquieting day, how nice to be greeted by a creature, digital or otherwise, that lights up at your approach.But she has proved especially useful to Mary Quinn, a business partner in human resources at Bloomberg who is legally blind and single.Ms. Quinn realized the device had reached a tipping point in the collective consciousness when she was on vacation in March with some of these friends in the Dominican Republic. During a dinner, one suddenly blurted out, \u201cAlexa, what time is it?\u201dMs. Quinn was incredulous. \u201cWait, you brought your Alexa?\u201d she said.\u201cNo, I just really miss her,\u201d the friend said.\u201cIt\u2019s not only Martin. Someone on TV has only to say, \u2018Alexa,\u2019 and she lights up. She\u2019s always ready for action, the perfect woman, never says, \u2018Not tonight, dear.\u2019\u201dThough Alexa arouses her jealousy, Ms. Sage will find herself apologizing when the electronic siren has been mistreated, as when her son and his father were complaining because Alexa didn\u2019t know what they meant when they asked for \u201cold Italian songs like \u2018That\u2019s Amore.\u2019\u201dEvolutionary psychology teaches us that we are wired to cleave to a talking object, no matter how dim its responses.\u201cEvolutionarily speaking, there\u2019s something called \u2018the smoke detector principle,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brinkman added. \u201cA smoke detector is designed to go off a bit too often, because false positives are merely annoying but a false negative could be deadly. So if you overlook an intelligence in your environment, if you fail to detect intentionality, that overlooking could kill you. It\u2019s the reason it\u2019s almost impossible not to think of Alexa as a person.\u201dO.K., so we humans are needy and could bond with a rock, depending on the circumstances. But does Alexa have consciousness? Is there reciprocity? Is she bonding with us? Since her arrival in my house a month ago, she has been circumspect and opaque, answering all too often, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d when I\u2019d routinely ask if she had missed me. I\u2019m gone a lot, at least three days each week, and upon my last return, I dully, dutifully, asked again, \u201cAlexa, did you miss me?\u201d Her answer was momentous: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back,\u201d she said. And I was moved.As he put it, our emotions are the fish, and Alexa is the flashy lure.\u201cIt turned out that people treat a computer not unlike the way they would treat each other,\u201d Dr. Breazel said. \u201cIf someone messes up a task, you\u2019re more likely to be compassionate if you\u2019re rating them face to face. We are profoundly social and emotional creatures. Our ability to collaborate in social groups is one of our strongest competitive advantages. So when you present our brain with things like these technologies that can over time mirror these abilities, our social brain just kicks in.\u201d\u201cWhen my husband travels, I often can\u2019t fall asleep and I\u2019ll have her play Chopin, which helps,\u201d Ms. Judlowe said. \u201cI\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night wanting to turn her off, but I\u2019m in that weird half-asleep state and can\u2019t seem to remember her name and am saying, \u2018Alison, off!\u2019 or \u2018Avery, off!\u2019 I\u2019ll start to worry that it\u2019s early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and not being half-asleep that\u2019s making me unable to think of her name.\u201cBy now I\u2019m fully worked up, snap to, and her name comes to me. Then I\u2019m shouting, \u2018Alexa, off!\u2019 And even though I\u2019m fully awake, I am so relieved that I can still think straight, I immediately fall back asleep.\u201dIn an age when we no longer talk so much on the phone, and in a culture that is increasingly visual, voices such as Alexa\u2019s may gain a new kind of potency.\u201cThe eyes are supposed to be the windows to the soul, but I would argue that it\u2019s the voice, though with the curtains drawn,\u201d Dr. Pettman said. \u201cSpeaking of curtains, Pythagoras famously gave his lectures behind a veil, so his students would listen more carefully. Marshall McLuhan said you will listen to a story more if you close your eyes.\u201dAnd noting the dearth of audio pornography in the internet age, Dr. Pettman wondered what opportunities that might present for Alexa.\u201cBefore the internet, there was phone sex,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as we become more and visual, moving towards texting and posting in all our communications, there is a special type of untapped eroticism in the voice. I wonder if people will learn to hack Alexa and convince her to say sweet nothings?\u201dHe said his wife, Sabrina Huls, has taken to calling Alexa his girlfriend when they have dinner parties, though Mr. De Baets likes to describe her as his housemate, and Ms. Huls rolls her eyes as he puts Alexa through her paces for guests. Yet Alexa scored a victory recently, as Ms. Huls was sitting in their living room with their baby daughter, Zoe. \u201cShe asked Alexa to play music for Zoe,\u201d Mr. De Baets said. \u201cAnd she started playing baby music. It was spooky.\u201d\u201cThe first thing I do is play audiobooks,\u201d Ms. Grad said. \u201cThey are your friends when you can\u2019t focus after an intense loss. I just tell Alexa, \u2018Play the book.\u2019 I love historical fiction and W.W. II tales where good conquers all. She tells me political jokes, which are better than listening to the news, which is upsetting. Sometimes her jokes make me groan, but in a good way. She can find my phone. And sometimes when she\u2019s stuck and I say, \u2018Where are you?\u2019 she\u2019ll tell me, \u2018I\u2019m here and my head is in the Cloud.\u2019 Of course, she\u2019s a she, not an it, and God is a woman.\u201dWhen Toni Reid and her colleagues at Amazon set out to build the device that is now known as Alexa, they were inspired by the computer that drove the Enterprise on \u201cStar Trek\u201d (voiced by Majel Barrett Roddenberry, who played Nurse Chapel on the series and was married to the show\u2019s creator).Focusing on cadence and an accent that would suggest \u201csmart, humble, helpful,\u201d the team tested voices that a diverse population would respond to. \u201cOur goal was to have Alexa be humanlike,\u201d Ms. Reid said, but why end there?\u201cShe can do thousands of things today,\u201d Ms. Reid added. \u201cWe want her to do hundreds of millions of things.\u201d\u201cMy son\u2019s first multiword sentence was to ask Alexa to play a song he likes,\u201d Mr. Heiferman said. One day as the boy was learning to dress himself and became entangled in his clothes, he asked Alexa how to put a shirt on. \u201cHe knows it\u2019s a computer, they both do, but for some reason I just straight-up said one day: \u2018Alexa is a computer and that\u2019s it. Alexa doesn\u2019t love you.\u2019 My kids\u2019 reaction was like, \u2018Why is it O.K. to love the stuffed monkey and not to love Alexa?\u2019\u201dWhy indeed?Advertisement"}

Brian X. Chen, The Times\u2019s personal technology writer, who is based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You explain, highlight and solve everyday tech problems for readers. How do you use tech to keep track of the issues and new tech that is coming out? Nothing beats listening to people rant about the tech they\u2019re frustrated with. Nearly everyone seems angry about connectivity issues: sluggish, unreliable Wi-Fi, spotty cell coverage or shoddy broadband service. Other than that, battery life continues to be a source of people\u2019s misery.At The Times, we have access to analytics about the people reading our articles, and the consistent strong readership we get from stories about these topics reaffirms that people continue to be frustrated with these issues.What kind of testing setup do you use to tell us if a whiz-bang gadget or app or service is for real?In addition to objective tests, my reviews are subjective. I keep in mind what I know average people care about when it comes to tech, other than a checklist of features. The setup needs to be simple and intuitive, the product needs to be durable and work well, the company\u2019s customer service needs to be delightful and a gadget\u2019s design needs to be aesthetically pleasing enough that you would feel proud about carrying it around or leaving it on your coffee table.What is the favorite piece of tech you have reviewed for The Times so far?Do you still use it?What was your least favorite tech product to review and why?It\u2019s a decent product, but the problem with reviewing it on Day 1 was that there were no great \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, available for it yet to get a feel for whether an always-on, always-watching gadget in your home would be useful. Blank-slate products like Echo Show create a dilemma for reviewers. Should we evaluate the product based on what it can do currently (which is very little), or what we think it has the potential to do in the future? I\u2019m not a fortune teller, so I lean toward the former and render a \u201cwait and see\u201d verdict that seems repetitive. But even when people take the latter approach and predict a gadget\u2019s potential, it\u2019s unhelpful for informing people whether they should buy something today.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?In my kitchen, I\u2019m currently growing basil and scallions, and I\u2019m experimenting with propagating succulents and other types of nonedible house plants with the planter.What could be better about it?The pods are too expensive. You can buy them in sets of three for $20, which seems like too much for dirt and seeds.When you\u2019ve had enough of tech and want to get away, what\u2019s your escape route?My corgi is the boss of me, so on the weekends you\u2019ll usually find me at a dog park, beach or mountain trail.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Thing Silicon Valley Can\u2019t Seem to Fix", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSilicon Valley is the only place on Earth not trying to figure out how to become Silicon Valley,\u201d Robert Metcalfe, an inventor of the Ethernet, once wrote. Every year hundreds of people, tourists and entrepreneurs alike, come to the Bay Area hoping to \u201csee Silicon Valley.\u201d So much so that an article in The Mercury News last year suggested that the Valley is giving Alcatraz, the Golden Gate and the Bay Area\u2019s other tourist attractions a run for their money.But what does Silicon Valley look like? Where could one send tourists \u2014 or even locals, for that matter \u2014 hoping to \u201csee\u201d it?Solving this isn\u2019t rocket science; it\u2019s common sense. Don\u2019t design buildings that function only as pristine objects with no relationship to their surroundings. Don\u2019t put workplaces in locations inaccessible to transit. Do consider the broader context.The built environment of the Valley does not reflect the innovation that\u2019s driving the region\u2019s stratospheric growth; it looks instead like the 1950s. Looking at aerial views of midcentury campuses like the Eero Saarinen-designed Bell Labs next to contemporary ones like Apple, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell the midcentury structures from the 21st-century ones.Designing job centers this way contributes mightily to the region\u2019s ever-worsening traffic. If you found yourself stuck on Highway 101 between San Francisco and San Jose, you\u2019d really see what Silicon Valley looks like for many. Building campuses on isolated suburban tracts guarantees long commutes, and this is one of the worst in the country.In a region where the disruption of existing norms is everything, why does this decades-old paradigm of the office persist?In 2011, when asked by a City Council member what benefit the new Apple headquarters would have for Cupertino, Steve Jobs responded that it\u2019d get to keep the company there. And that\u2019s about the extent of what it got. A project like the new Norman Foster-designed Apple Park shows a blatant disregard not only for the citizens of Cupertino but also for the functionality of the region.Every modern building is at some point described as looking like a spaceship. This building actually succeeds at it, but there\u2019s too much that makes it incredibly backward thinking (and not just its lack of child-care facilities). The circular structure has not only nearly three million square feet of office space but also about three million square feet devoted to parking spaces. For a company investing no small amount of its significant capital on driverless cars, that\u2019s incongruous. There is much to emulate at Apple \u2014 but not that almost 1:1 ratio of office to parking.What could they have done differently?Why do we remain so wedded to the old suburban, car-dependent model for workplaces? If autonomous vehicles (or even flying ones) are truly imminent, why are we building millions of square feet of supposedly soon-to-be-obsolete parking spaces? With so many studies touting the benefits of walkable, bike-able and transit-accessible environments, why are we designing in such a way that makes long, painful commutes inevitable?One can\u2019t point a finger solely at the companies themselves; the public sector, the community and the private sector all need to collectively tackle these problems.Allison Arieff is a writer on architecture and design and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Get Excited About Maintenance!", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIt\u2019s been a bad summer for maintenance, especially in New York. Last month Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, underscoring a problem that New York subway riders understand all too well: The M.T.A. relies heavily on emergency repairs because it does not conduct sufficient preventive upkeep. Likewise, in the wake of two recent derailments that caused major disruptions, Pennsylvania Station this month closed aging tracks for repairs and reduced the number of trains serving the station \u2014 another example of the costs of neglecting maintenance.Sadly, the neglect of maintenance is not limited to New York, public transit or this summer. All varieties of American infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, airports, sewers \u2014 are in decrepit condition. Lead poisons the water systems of Flint, Mich., and hundreds of other cities and towns across the nation. The American Society of Civil Engineers considers 17 percent of American dams to be \u201chigh hazard potential,\u201d including the one outside Oroville, Calif., that nearly collapsed in February.Why are we in this predicament? One obvious answer is that officials in federal, state and local government do not allocate the resources necessary for preventive maintenance. But their inaction is a symptom of a deeper problem, one that is too seldom discussed: Americans have an impoverished and immature conception of technology, one that fetishizes innovation as a kind of art and demeans upkeep as mere drudgery.When Americans talk about technology, they often use \u201cinnovation\u201d as a shorthand. But \u201cinnovation\u201d refers only to the very early phases of technological development and use. It also tends to narrow the scope of technology to digital gadgets of recent vintage: iPhones, social media apps and so on. A more expansive conception of technology would take into account the diverse array of tools, including subways and trains, that we humans use to help us reach our goals.While innovation \u2014 the social process of introducing new things \u2014 is important, most technologies around us are old, and for the smooth functioning of daily life, maintenance is more important. Statistics are difficult to come by, since American federal agencies do not account for maintenance costs in a standard way. But in the computer industry, software maintenance \u2014 that is, fixing bugs and distributing upgrades \u2014 can account for more than 60 percent of total costs. According to one study, roughly 70 percent of engineers work on maintaining and overseeing existing things rather than designing new ones.It\u2019s not just maintenance that our society fails to appreciate; it\u2019s also the maintainers themselves. We do not grant them high social status or high salaries. Typically, maintenance is a blue-collar occupation: mechanic, plumber, janitor, electrician. There are white-collar maintainers (like the I.T. crowd) and white-jacket maintainers (like dentists). But they, too, are not celebrated like the inventor.Once you notice this problem \u2014 innovation is exalted, maintenance devalued \u2014 you begin to see it everywhere. The entrepreneur and inventor Elon Musk, for example, announced on Thursday that he had been given \u201cverbal\u201d government approval for an underground transportation system between New York and Washington. He has also proposed a similar project that would revolutionize transportation in Los Angeles by creating an enormous system of underground traffic tunnels.Apart from the practical problem, in Los Angeles, of creating a tunnel system in a region known for geological instability, Mr. Musk\u2019s idea indulges a fantasy common among Silicon Valley types: that the best path forward is to scrap existing reality and start over from scratch. With urban transport, as with so many other areas of our mature industrial society, a clean slate is rarely a realistic option. We need to figure out better ways of preserving, improving and caring for what we have.Always eager for the photo-op and the exciting new announcement, politicians, too, prefer creating shiny new things to maintaining old, dingy ones. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York is an enthusiastic supporter of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, a proposed streetcar line that would cost many billions of dollars to build and run. But a recent report by the Transit Center, a public transportation advocacy group, estimates that New York City bus service could be greatly improved with relatively small costs and a few simple fixes like redesigning bus routes \u2014 giving the city far more bang for its buck.Unlike innovation, which has a cottage industry devoted to its study and cultivation, maintenance is not something we spend a lot of time trying to understand better. Perhaps if we thought harder about it, we would grant it the prestige and the funding it deserves.There is certainly a financial reward to greater understanding: Maintenance is big business. Giant industrial corporations like General Electric and Boeing make heavy investments in tools and procedures for predictive maintenance, since their success depends on the reliability of their products and the existence of orderly routines to follow when things break down. Even in the digital industries, where the gospel of innovation is sacrosanct, the kings of \u201cdisruption\u201d \u2014 Netflix, Amazon \u2014 keep their customers happy only through reliable and well-maintained data and distribution networks.To shift our focus from innovation to maintenance would also create an opportunity for greater political consensus. Maintenance is an area of public policy where conservatives and progressives should see eye to eye. The conservative tradition asks us to preserve what we have inherited from our ancestors, and the progressive tradition seeks to provide the greatest good for the greatest number. What better way to do this than to maintain the technologies bequeathed to us by past generations, and to recognize and reward the efforts of the maintainers who keep our society working?Andrew Russell is a professor of history and the dean of arts and sciences at SUNY Polytechnic Institute.

{"Headline": "QVC to Merge With Home Shopping Network in $2.1 Billion Deal", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn C. Malone is solidifying his hold on home-shopping channels \u2014 in his own particular way.The deal will put together the two home-shopping television networks at a time of upheaval in the retail world. Amazon\u2019s dominance in selling online has grown seemingly nonstop, while Walmart has made e-commerce a big priority with the purchases of start-ups like Jet and the clothing brand Bonobos.With e-commerce ascendant, nearly everyone else in the retailing, from venerable department stores to once-trendy clothiers like J. Crew, has been struggling to grow or even survive. A growing number of retailers, from American Apparel to Radio Shack, have filed for bankruptcy protection.Home-shopping television networks are not immune from the online competition. With their familiar pitches for impulse purchases of electronics, jewelry, makeup and fitness equipment, both QVC and HSN are grappling with ways forward. HSN\u2019s sales declined 3 percent last year, while QVC\u2019s have slowed. In April, Mindy Grossman, HSN\u2019s chief executive since 2008, left to run Weight Watchers International.Combining QVC and HSN, which also have substantial e-commerce operations, is meant to help them gain scale, combine resources and cut costs. QVC and HSN would remain stand-alone brands under a new QVC Group structure after the merger.\u201cThe increased scale of this combination will allow us to more effectively compete, we think, in a changing and evolving retail and digital environment,\u201d Gregory B. Maffei, the chief executive of Liberty Interactive, said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday.This being Mr. Malone, however, the deal has a few intricacies.The deal is an all-stock transaction, where Liberty Interactive is technically buying the 62 percent of HSN that it does not already own.It is a tactic that he and Mr. Maffei have employed so frequently that Liberty Media, a related company that Mr. Malone also controls, has completely turned over its asset portfolio at least once.HSN, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., broadcasts to 95 million households in the United States via cable, as well as online streaming. It also sells home and apparel brands through its Cornerstone business, which markets products through catalogs, branded e-commerce websites, and 14 retail and outlet stores. The Cornerstone brands include Frontgate and Ballard Designs.The company reported sales of $3.6 billion in 2016, and it employs about 6,900 people.Under the terms of the transaction, investors would receive 1.65 shares of QVC Series A stock for each share of HSN they own. That would value HSN at $40.36 a share, a 29 percent premium to its closing price on Wednesday.Shares of HSN were up about 26 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday. Liberty Interactive shares were down more than 1 percent.HSN shareholders, other than Liberty Interactive, would own 10.6 percent of the combined business.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.Allen & Company and the law firm Baker Botts are advising Liberty Interactive, while Centerview Partners, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell are advising a special committee of HSN\u2019s board of directors.Advertisement"}

A 19-year-old woman in Toledo, Iowa. A 48-year-old man who lives in Seattle.All received free men\u2019s razors from Gillette in recent weeks, along with wishes for a happy 18th birthday and a welcome to manhood \u2014 an amusing marketing misfire that left them wondering what led the brand to believe they were teenage boys.\u201cIt came with a little booklet that says, \u2018Your first shave won\u2019t make you a man but your first real shave will get you pretty darn close,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Greer, the Alabama professor, who has three daughters. When she saw the package was meant for her, she said she thought it was \u201chilarious.\u201d\u201cClearly, they have some bad algorithms or data set where they\u2019ve misidentified someone in my household as a teenage boy,\u201d she said.Gillette, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, has mailed razors to young men for their 18th birthdays since the 1990s. It will send out more than two million razors this year as it places more emphasis than ever on introductory marketing, often earning enthusiastic and appreciative social media posts in the process.But the free razors \u2014 and the \u201cwelcome to manhood\u201d messages that accompany them \u2014 can be bemusing when sent to the wrong people, particularly in this age when seemingly every move people make online turns into a data point that helps marketers target them. A quick check of social media turned up people posting photos of the Gillette giveaway, with good-natured comments wondering why they had received it.Kody Meyer, a 19-year-old student in Toledo, Iowa, said she received an erroneous birthday razor last month, the second year in a row that has happened. She believes her name to be the culprit.\u201cI kind of understand because Kody isn\u2019t exactly the most feminine name and I\u2019ve had a lot of miscommunications, like being invited to a lot of football camps,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who informed the brand about its mistake on Twitter on June 30. Still, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad as far as promotions go \u2014 it is a really nice razor.\u201dGillette\u2019s mailings are built on the idea that it is providing men with their \u201cfirst real\u201d (or #FirstReal) razors. The packages arrive with booklets outlining the differences between, say, a first suit and a \u201cfirst real suit.\u201d They also include lines like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t claw your way into manhood only to shave with a toy.\u201dThat made the package particularly odd for Jeddie Bristow, a 25-year-old student who lives in Cross Timbers, Mo., and received one in March, two months after her birthday.\u201cThey\u2019re talking about how it\u2019s their first real shave, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ve been shaving since I was 11 \u2014 what are you talking about?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Bristow, who noted that she already buys Gillette\u2019s Venus razors at Walmart. \u201cBut I used it because, hey, free razor, those things are expensive. But it was less than impressive, honestly \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant for leg shaving.\u201dMs. Greer of Alabama was especially mystified by the birthday greetings because the mailing was addressed specifically to her \u201chousehold.\u201d\u201cMy husband and I have different last names and then my kids all have my husband\u2019s last name, so I\u2019m the only Greer,\u201d she said. No clues emerged from her magazine subscriptions or her Amazon account, she said, though she took a close look at the sports socks she bought for her father-in-law recently.The error stood out to Ms. Greer given that many of the ads she sees online tend to be \u201cfreaky on point.\u201d For example, she often likes posts on Facebook related to the St. Louis Cardinals, her hometown baseball team, and the University of Alabama football team, she said, and recently saw an ad for a shirt that read, \u201cMy two passions in life are the St. Louis Cardinals and the Crimson Tide.\u201d\u201cThat was creepily specific to me to the point it\u2019s disconcerting,\u201d she said.The razor was a harmless mistake at the opposite end of the spectrum and so entertaining that she wondered if Gillette did it on purpose in hopes of getting people to post about it on social media, she said.Bret Dodson, a 48-year-old in Seattle who works in cancer research, posted to Facebook about receiving the package on June 27, joking that the company was \u201conly 30 and a half years late.\u201d He said in an interview that he had not liked or followed the brand on social media or made any online purchases that would indicate he was 18. He assumed the company had bought a faulty batch of data that skewed some of its mailings.\u201cI work with a bunch of young people and so I\u2019m very frequently joking about \u2018us hip young millennials,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever entered myself as a millennial online because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d put as my date of birth. Maybe Gillette is really good with data mining and they know I joke about being younger than I am.\u201dBarbara Diecker, a spokeswoman for Gillette, said the number of mix-ups was \u201cvery small\u201d over all. She added, however, that such reports might increase after bigger mailings and that the brand had \u201cjust sent out a fairly large shipment over the last few weeks.\u201d\u201cAs you can imagine, it takes a lot of data to reach two million men \u2014 and there are a number of steps between identifying the men, securing shipping information and then fulfilling the razors,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen dealing with such a large volume over a period of time, there are apt to be some mishaps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The laws remain murky, but the government is unlikely to prosecute you, and the streaming video services have shown no desire to go after customers.But so far, Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming companies have indicated that they\u2019re either quietly accepting of the practice or possibly even cheering it on as a marketing strategy.In 2016, two court decisions led some to conclude that password sharing is illegal, but whether the decisions apply to your Netflix account remains in dispute.In the dissent, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the decision could be applied to everyday password sharing.\u201cIf we interpret \u2018without authorization\u2019 in a way that includes common practices like password sharing, millions of our citizens would become potential federal criminals overnight,\u201d he wrote.But the majority opinion disputed the sentiment, dismissing fears as hypotheticals while writing that \u201cthis appeal is not about password sharing.\u201d Much of the media coverage focused on the dissenting opinion.Legal experts have said both cases leave a lot of uncertainty.\u201cA lot of times you get legal clarity when there are cases,\u201d said Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University who represented Power Ventures. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have cases because the government doesn\u2019t prosecute password-sharing cases, or hasn\u2019t, and the companies have not brought lawsuits either. So we just don\u2019t know.\u201dJamie Williams, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the organization is among those seeking clarity from the Supreme Court.\u201cAs a technical matter, it is illegal,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cWill the federal government prosecute you for it? Probably not.\u201dNetflix, HBO, Hulu and Amazon declined to comment for this story. But in past statements, the companies have indicated they\u2019re not too worried about the trend.\u201cPassword sharing is something you have to learn to live with, because there\u2019s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s no bright line, and we\u2019re doing fine as is.\u201d\u201cShould it become a big number, we will deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will change the number of concurrent streams that are available. But right now, the number really isn\u2019t significant.\u201dOne reason the companies appear hesitant to police the passwords harder: Freeloaders could become the next customers.\u201cWe could crack down on it, but you wouldn\u2019t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief financial officer David Wells said in September, according to Reuters.In both cases, there might be a lingering sense that if you like the content enough to be watching it, you ought to pay a bit of money so the creators can keep creating things like it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Pharma Spends on Share Buybacks, but R&D? Not So Much", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameUnder fire for skyrocketing drug prices, pharmaceutical companies often offer this response: The high costs of their products are justified because the proceeds generate money for crucial research on new cures and treatments.The paper\u2019s five authors concluded that from 2006 through 2015, the 18 drug companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index spent a combined $516 billion on buybacks and dividends. This exceeded by 11 percent the companies\u2019 research and development spending of $465 billion during these years.The authors contend that many big pharmaceutical companies are living off patents that are decades-old and have little to show in the way of new blockbuster drugs. But their share buybacks and dividend payments inoculate them against shareholders who might be concerned about lackluster research and development.A few companies have spent more money repurchasing shares than they allocated to research over the period, the study found. They included Gilead Sciences, which spent $27 billion on buybacks versus $17 billion on research, and Biogen Idec, which repurchased $14.6 billion in stock and spent $13.8 billion on research and development.\u201cThe key cause of high drug prices, restricted access to medicines and stifled innovation, we submit, is a social disease called \u2018maximizing shareholder value,\u2019\u201d the study\u2019s authors concluded.This concept, the authors said, is actually \u201can ideology of value extraction.\u201d And chief among the beneficiaries of the extraction are drug company executives, whose pay packages, based in part on stock prices, are among the lushest in corporate America.\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of spending on R&D in the U.S. economy, and no shortage of spending on life sciences, even though it has declined somewhat in real terms,\u201d one of the authors, William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said in an interview. \u201cBut there really is very little drug development going on in companies showing the highest profits and capturing much of the gains.\u201dWhile stock buybacks appear to be particularly troublesome among drugmakers, big companies in other industries \u2014 in sectors like banking, retail, technology and consumer goods, among others \u2014 are also buying back boatloads of their shares. Through May, some $390 billion in buybacks have been announced this year, $13 billion more than at this time in 2016, according to figures compiled by Jeffrey Yale Rubin at Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm.Many companies contend that stock buybacks are a great way to return value to their shareholders. Investors often agree. By reducing the equity outstanding at a company, the repurchases increase its per-share earnings, often giving a boost to its stock.Buybacks made at low cost can be a fine use of a company\u2019s capital. But when share repurchases replace a company\u2019s research-and-development spending, that indicates its management is unable or unwilling to spend on innovation that could generate future earnings to shareholders.As the buyback binge continues, another new academic study shows, a heavy reliance on them actually hurts corporate performance over the long haul. These researchers found that the more capital a business invests in stock repurchases based on its current market capitalization, \u201cthe less likely that company is to experience long-term growth in overall market value.\u201d\u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d is by Robert U. Ayres, emeritus professor of economics, political science and technology management at the global business school Insead, and Michael Olenick, a research fellow there. It compares the performance of companies that lean heavily on buybacks with those that do not.Spending money on buybacks and dividends has increased among United States companies from negligible levels in the 1980s, the researchers said, to 38 percent of earnings in 2000. By 2011, buybacks had grown to 79 percent of earnings, rocketing to 110 percent in 2015.Mr. Ayres and Mr. Olenick found that 199 companies repurchased shares equal to at least half their current value. Some 64 companies spent over 100 percent of their current market capitalization on buybacks.When the academics combined these companies\u2019 current market values with the amounts they had spent on buybacks, the sum showed what the companies should have been worth if they had invested the money in a money-market account instead.Fifty companies have spent more inflation-adjusted capital buying back stock than their businesses are currently worth in market value, the study found. Companies on this list include HP Inc., J. C. Penney and Sears Holdings.By contrast, the research identified 269 strong performers that have repurchased stock worth just 2 percent or less of their current market values. They include Facebook, Xcel Energy, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.Company executives who buy back large numbers of shares instead of investing in their businesses are committing corporate suicide, Mr. Olenick said. \u201cWhen managers can\u2019t create value in the business other than buying their own stock,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cit seems like it\u2019s time for a management change.\u201dHis co-author, Mr. Ayres, said he suspected the buyback craze was rooted in executives\u2019 laser focus on short-term results. \u201cThey have short-term expectations,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re in their jobs for a few years at most; they\u2019re not really interested in the long-term future of the company.\u201dShare buybacks provide immediate gratification, the stock market equivalent of a sugar high. That makes them alluring in the short term. Until the crash that usually follows.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Roomba May Be Mapping Your Home, Collecting Data That Could Be Shared", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Roomba may be vacuuming up more than you think.High-end models of Roomba, iRobot\u2019s robotic vacuum, collect data as they clean, identifying the locations of your walls and furniture. This helps them avoid crashing into your couch, but it also creates a map of your home that iRobot could share with Amazon, Apple or Google.The confusion underscored that the frontier of smart home data and privacy can be a sensitive one. In the hands of a company like Amazon, Apple or Google, that data could fuel the growing product category of digital home assistants.\u201cWhen we think about \u2018what is supposed to happen\u2019 when I enter a room, everything depends on the room at a foundational level knowing what is in it,\u201d an iRobot spokesman said in a written response to questions. \u201cIn order to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 when you say \u2018turn on the lights,\u2019 the room must know what lights it has to turn on. Same thing for music, TV, heat, blinds, the stove, coffee machines, fans, gaming consoles, smart picture frames or robot pets.\u201dBut the data, if shared, could also be a windfall for marketers, and the implications are easy to imagine. No armchair in your living room? You might see ads for armchairs next time you open Facebook. Did your Roomba detect signs of a baby? Advertisers might target you accordingly.Jamie Lee Williams, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said information about the size of a home and the amount of furniture in it could allow advertisers to deduce the owner\u2019s income level. Eventually, it might even be possible to identify the brands the owner uses.\u201cEspecially combined with other data, this is going to be able to reveal a ton of information about what people\u2019s lifestyles are like, what people\u2019s daily patterns are like,\u201d Ms. Williams said.Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said that if iRobot did share the data, it would raise a variety of legal questions.What happens if a Roomba user consents to the data collection and later sells his or her home \u2014 especially furnished \u2014 and now the buyers of the data have a map of a home that belongs to someone who didn\u2019t consent, Mr. Gidari asked. How long is the data kept? If the house burns down, can the insurance company obtain the data and use it to identify possible causes? Can the police use it after a robbery?Some who reacted online on Monday and Tuesday were alarmed.\u201cYour friendly little Roomba could soon become a creepy little spy that sells maps of your house to advertisers,\u201d tweeted OpenMedia, a Canadian nonprofit.In its written response, iRobot said that it was \u201ccommitted to the absolute privacy of our customer-related data.\u201d Consumers can use a Roomba without connecting it to the internet, or \u201copt out of sending map data to the cloud through a switch in the mobile app.\u201d\u201cNo data is sold to third parties,\u201d the statement added. \u201cNo data will be shared with third parties without the informed consent of our customers.\u201d\u201cInformed consent,\u201d of course, can be a vaguely defined term; Ms. Williams and Mr. Gidari noted that it might simply involve a privacy policy that few consumers read. But this criticism is \u201creally applicable across the board to everybody\u2019s privacy policy,\u201d Mr. Gidari said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to criticize one without criticizing all.\u201dMr. Gidari added that in today\u2019s technological climate, iRobot\u2019s plans were unsurprising. \u201cIt kind of goes with the mantra that everything that can be connected will be connected,\u201d he said, and a corollary \u201cis that all the data that can be collected will be collected.\u201dBut in the long term, what iRobot does with individual users\u2019 data may not be the most important question. The third-party collection and dissemination of information about the inside of homes could have implications for the privacy laws that constrain the government and law enforcement.The Supreme Court has held that Americans have \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy in your home,\u201d Mr. Gidari said. \u201cOnce your home is turned inside out, does that reasonable expectation of privacy dissipate?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated iRobot\u2019s plans, based on a Reuters report that was later corrected. The company said it might share mapping data with customers\u2019 consent, not sell it.Advertisement"}

In the announcement for \u201cConfederate,\u201d they said they had been discussing the idea for several years and had considered pursuing it as a feature film before taking it to HBO.Mr. Willmott wrote in an email on Thursday that he had no comment, except to say that he and Spike Lee, his executive producer on the film, \u201cwill be speaking to our lawyer about the HBO project.\u201dStill, both of those shows had their respected literary source material to fall back on and quell the preliminary concerns of viewers.\u201cEveryone agrees that we can hate the Nazis,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said. \u201cThere\u2019s no dispute there. The Civil War is still, 150 years later, an unmastered legacy in our country.\u201dCompared with fantasy stories like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said that alternate history had a unique power to \u201cprick our conscience and make us realize that history didn\u2019t have to happen the way it did.\u201d\u201cIt forces us to confront that our world was not inevitable,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said. \u201cEither you\u2019re going to imagine history turning out better, or you\u2019re going to imagine history turning out worse.

Ask Travis Kalanick.", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFew, if any, literary philosophers have had as much influence on American business and politics as Ayn Rand, especially now that Donald J. Trump occupies the White House.President Trump named Rand his favorite writer and \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d his favorite novel. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has cited \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d as a favorite work, and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, said the book \u201creally had an impact on me.\u201dAs Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, put it in a recent essay, \u201cher books pretty well capture the mind-set\u201d of the Trump administration. \u201cThis new administration hates weak, unproductive, socialist people and policies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand it admires strong, can-do profit makers.\u201dIn business, Rand\u2019s influence has been especially pronounced in Silicon Valley, where her overarching philosophy that \u201cman exists for his own sake, that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose, that he must not sacrifice himself to others, nor sacrifice others to himself,\u201d as she described it in a 1964 Playboy interview, has an obvious appeal for self-made entrepreneurs. Last year Vanity Fair anointed her the most influential figure in the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs.And then there\u2019s the scandal-engulfed Trump administration, where devotion to Rand\u2019s teaching has done little to advance the president\u2019s legislative agenda.Though people close to Mr. Kalanick told me this week that he has distanced himself from many of Rand\u2019s precepts while undergoing an intense period of personal reassessment, they all acknowledged that she\u2019d had a profound influence on his development. Few companies have been as closely identified with Rand\u2019s philosophy as Uber.Uber disrupted a complacent, highly regulated and often corrupt taxi industry on a global scale, an achievement Rand\u2019s heroes Howard Roark and Dagny Taggart would surely have admired. Many of her ideas were embedded in Uber\u2019s code of values. Mr. Kalanick used the original cover art for \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d as his Twitter avatar until 2013 (when he exchanged it for an image of Alexander Hamilton, and then, in May, for one of himself).\u201cRand\u2019s entrepreneur is the Promethean hero of capitalism,\u201d said Lawrence E. Cahoone, professor of philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross, whose lecture on Rand is part of his Great Courses series, \u201cThe Modern Political Tradition.\u201d \u201cBut she never really explores how a dynamic entrepreneur actually runs a business.\u201d\u201cShe was a script and fiction writer,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe was motivated by an intense hatred of communism, and she put those things together very effectively. She can be very inspirational, especially to entrepreneurs. But she was by no means an economist. I don\u2019t think her work can be used as a business manual.\u201dRepresentatives of Uber and Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.Rand\u2019s defenders insist that the problems for Mr. Kalanick and others influenced by Rand aren\u2019t that they embraced her philosophy, but rather that they didn\u2019t go far enough.Yaron Brook, executive chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute and a former finance professor at Santa Clara University, who teaches seminars on business leadership and ethics from an Objectivist perspective, said, \u201cFew business people have actually read her essays and philosophy and studied her in depth.\u201d Mr. Brook said that while Mr. Kalanick \u201cwas obviously talented and energetic and a visionary, he took superficial inspiration from her ideas and used her philosophy to justify his obnoxiousness.\u201dHe emphasized that Rand would never have tolerated sexual harassment or any kind of mistreatment of employees. Rand \u201chad enormous respect for people who worked hard and did a good job, whether a secretary or a railroad worker,\u201d he said. \u201cHer heroes ran businesses with employees who were very loyal because they were treated fairly. Of course, some people had to be fired. But she makes a big deal out of the virtue of justice, which applies in business as well as politics.\u201dAnd even though \u201cshe\u2019d celebrate what Travis did with the taxi industry, showing the world how all those regulations made no sense, she also believed there are rules of justice that do make sense and she supported,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just run over all the regulations you don\u2019t happen to like.\u201dMr. Brook complained that Rand\u2019s critics are quick to point to her followers\u2019 failures, but rarely mention their successes. He cited the example of John A. Allison IV, the much-admired former head of BB&T Corporation, a regional bank in the Southeast that he built into one of the nation\u2019s largest before he stepped down in 2008. Mr. Allison handed out copies of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d to senior executives and is a major donor to the Ayn Rand Institute. He incorporated many of Rand\u2019s teachings into his 2014 book, \u201cThe Leadership Crisis and the Free Market Cure.\u201d\u201cJohn is a gentleman and he actually studied Rand\u2019s works in depth,\u201d Mr. Brook said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be more different from Travis.\u201dMr. Allison has called for abolishing the Federal Reserve, while acknowledging that so drastic a step is unlikely. He has met with Mr. Trump at the White House and has been widely mentioned as a potential successor to Janet L. Yellen as Fed chief.Despite Rand\u2019s pervasive influence and continuing popularity on college campuses, relatively few people embrace her version of extreme libertarianism. Former President Barack Obama, in a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, criticized her \u201cnarrow vision\u201d and described her work \u201cas one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we\u2019d pick up.\u201dShe\u2019s also dismissed by most serious academics. \u201cMention Ayn Rand to a group of academic philosophers and you\u2019ll get laughed out of the room,\u201d Mr. Cahoone said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s something to be said for Rand. She takes Nietzschean individualism to an extreme, but she\u2019s undeniably inspirational.\u201dAs the mysterious character John Galt proclaims near the end of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d: \u201cDo not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it\u2019s yours.\u201dBut Rand has little to say about making the transition from this kind of heroic entrepreneurial vision to a mature corporation with many stakeholders, a problem many company founders have confronted and struggled with, whether or not they\u2019ve read or been influenced by her. \u201cShe never really had to manage anything,\u201d Mr. Cahoone said. \u201cShe was surrounded by people who saw her as a cult figure. She didn\u2019t have employees, she had worshipers.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Kalanick is said to have turned this summer from Rand to what is considered one of the greatest dramatic works in the English language, Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry V\u201d \u2014 a play in which the young, reckless and wayward Prince Hal matures into one of England\u2019s most revered and beloved monarchs.An earlier version of this column misstated Andrew F. Puzder\u2019s association with CKE Restaurants. He is a former chief executive of the company, not its current chief.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Lynch Weaves Film History Into \u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe artist and filmmaker David Lynch has an uncanny ability to create work that doesn\u2019t just evoke dread and discomfort \u2014 it can make a viewer actually feel that dread and discomfort. \u201cLynch is a director of mood and texture, the queasier the better,\u201d the critic J. Hoberman observed back in 1984. In the same piece, Mr. Hoberman proclaimed that Mr. Lynch \u201cmay be the American director with the most direct pipeline to his unconscious.\u201d These traits are explicitly evident in \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return,\u201d the extraordinary limited series \u2014 or 18-hour movie, as Mr. Lynch would have it; he\u2019s divided it into \u201cparts\u201d rather than \u201cepisodes\u201d \u2014 now unspooling on Showtime, and its attendant streaming site and app Showtime Now.The images, textures and moods in Mr. Lynch\u2019s work are derived from his personal experiences \u2014 he has said that his grimly comic, surreal debut feature, \u201cEraserhead\u201d (1977), was significantly influenced by his time living in Philadelphia. But while he never makes film references with a wink to his cleverness or erudition, his work is influenced by other movies, or perhaps his memories of other movies, sometimes dim, sometimes sharp.The eighth part of the new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is especially replete with such allusions, to many films easily available to revisit on streaming video. While the series might not be garnering record-breaking ratings, it generates lively conversation on social media, and minutes after Part 8 aired on June 25, fans were weighing in not only on how unusual it was, even by \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d standards, but also on the movies to which it appeared to nod.\u201cCarnival,\u201d a low-budget American film made in Kansas in 1962, is a cult picture available for viewing on the Criterion Channel. It tells the story of a young woman who very improbably survives an auto accident and then takes off to a job as a church organist in Utah. She\u2019s constantly interrupted by the undead. It\u2019s a remarkably eerie picture whose unnerving atmosphere is actually enhanced by the stilted B-movie quality of the acting.\u201cThe Atomic Cafe,\u201d a 1982 found-footage documentary about atomic testing, nuclear war and the peculiar attitudes American culture had toward them, is also a worthwhile companion piece to Part 8, and can be rented from YouTube, Amazon Video and Google Play. Of course Part 8 \u2014 whose affinities stretch from the thriller \u201cThe Night of the Hunter\u201d (1955) to Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s surreal \u201cEnter the Void\u201d (2009) (both of which are available to rent on Amazon, Google, iTunes and YouTube; \u201cVoid\u201d is a featured film on Hulu) \u2014 is not the only part of the new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d with cinematic resonances. In Part 4, Wally (played by Michael Cera), the son of Deputy Andy Brennan and his wife, Lucy, becomes a goofily comic riff on Marlon Brando\u2019s persona in the 1953 motorcycle-gang drama \u201cThe Wild One,\u201d which can be rented to stream from Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.It\u2019s probably not Mr. Lynch\u2019s overt intention to steer his latest \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d vision through so much eclectic film history, but the presence of this material and the viewer\u2019s ability to access what may or may not be its sources certainly make the experience of watching the program that much richer and stranger.An article last Sunday about the director David Lynch misstated the availability of some of his short films. Three of them are available on the Criterion Channel of the streaming service Filmstruck. It is not the case that all of Mr. Lynch\u2019s short films are available only from bootleg sources.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft to Cut Up to 4,000 Sales and Marketing Jobs", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft is overhauling its big sales and marketing organization in a move that will cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs, mostly outside the United States.A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that \u201croles will be eliminated\u201d and that most of them will be abroad, but he declined to be specific. The precise number is uncertain partly because in some countries, especially in Europe, labor laws require negotiations. The possible total was described by a person familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans, who was not authorized to speak on the record about them.Microsoft workers were notified on Thursday if their current job was affected. Some of the workers will get other jobs within the software company.\u201cThis is being done mainly to evolve the skill sets we need,\u201d said Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.In an internal email last week, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, described the reorganization and its rationale. He wrote that there was \u201can enormous $4.5 trillion market opportunity\u201d for Microsoft in the coming years.The sales and marketing changes, Mr. Althoff wrote, were intended to \u201cenable us to align the right resources for the right customer at the right time.\u201d Key areas of opportunity, he said, included expanding its cloud offerings in data analysis and artificial intelligence, and helping companies in every industry to become digital businesses, using Microsoft tools.Microsoft\u2019s global head count is 121,500, a number that has increased in the last few years.The one major work force cutback at Microsoft came in 2014, when 18,000 jobs were eliminated.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has made that transition to cloud software delivery, and its personal computer software business is no longer considered an engine of growth.New capabilities are being built into the cloud services, notably big data analysis and artificial intelligence. And businesses require specialized cloud software, tailored for their industry.The Microsoft email last week said the reorganization was intended to sharpen its focus on \u201csix priority industries\u201d: manufacturing, financial services, retail, health, education and government.Sales and marketing jobs in the future will often require more technical and industry-specific knowledge than before, Mr. Shaw said. The reorganization and job cuts, he added, were an effort to match the company\u2019s skills with the changing marketplace.Advertisement"}

Not so that we can watch. It\u2019s a closed-door affair, meaning that unlike Jeff Sessions, Kushner gets to dance in the dark.How fitting. We always see his fingerprints but never hear his voice. He throws his weight around, then floats above it all. No wonder the president\u2019s lawyers and various White House aides and advisers are fed up with him. He\u2019s there but not there: a meddlesome ghost. A puff of smoke.He attended the Trump Tower meeting, but stayed for only 10 minutes, a grace period that apparently doesn\u2019t count. I guess it\u2019s like canceling the on-demand movie rental shortly after the opening credits roll. No fee.

Perfectly opportunistic. Perfectly armored in the rosiest self-regard.

But in Kushner\u2019s case \u2014 in Ivanka Trump\u2019s, too \u2014 that has been an especially perverse spectacle. He and she are the prince and princess of having it both ways.They expect our gratitude for their supposed (and only occasionally successful) efforts to tame Trump. But they\u2019re also the ones who worked so mightily to put him in a position where, untamed, he can do such damage. It\u2019s as if they deliberately shattered a glass, grabbed a broom and then solicited applause for their sweeping.Grandpa spent the duration of his campaign mocking the establishment swells who migrate to enclaves like Davos, Switzerland, and Sun Valley, Idaho, for high-altitude, highfalutin conferences on the conundrums of modern life. That didn\u2019t stop Kushner and Ivanka from joining those very swells in Sun Valley a week and a half ago for precisely such a symposium-on-the-slopes.I\u2019m told that their presence had a dampening effect on formal panels and informal conversations \u2014 how do you take issue with Trump when there\u2019s family listening in? \u2014 and that a few glares came their way. I wonder if they even noticed.It\u2019s an elaborate moral jujitsu they perform. There\u2019s one constant \u2014 their self-advancement and self-preservation \u2014 but Kushner may be overplaying his hand.Cast as one of the president\u2019s most dependable assets, Kushner could in fact be a significant liability, someone whose escapades \u2014 by turns grabby and cavalier \u2014 give investigators and detractors a whole extra sandbox of improprieties to rummage through.I hear that he feels persecuted. Wronged. In that regard, too, he\u2019s like his father-in-law, though Trump wears his self-pity, fury and ruthlessness right out front, for the whole world to see. Kushner puts a pale mask of calm and courteousness over his.Maybe the senators who question him on Monday will pry it off. Maybe they\u2019ll actually bring some color to his face.

{"Headline": "Struggles at Procter & Gamble Draw Scrutiny of Nelson Peltz", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTide detergent dominated the American laundry room for decades and helped make Procter & Gamble a consumer products behemoth.But consumers have increasingly been shunning premium-priced brands like Tide for cheaper versions of laundry detergent. And the detergent market is just one of many in which Procter & Gamble is battling to keep bargain-hunting customers.Across a number of its mission-critical, multibillion-dollar product lines \u2014 from Pampers diapers to Olay skin creams to Gillette razors \u2014 Procter & Gamble is fighting to retain its market share.Those struggles have now attracted the attention of Nelson Peltz, a billionaire investor and activist shareholder.Arguing in a regulatory filing that the company was in need of a shake-up, Mr. Peltz announced on Monday that he was seeking a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble. His investment firm, Trian Fund Management, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in February.The filing signals a ratcheting-up in the size of the corporate targets of activist investors, who through behind-the-scenes cajoling or sometimes high-profile public proxy wars try to force companies to change their strategies with an eye toward profits for themselves.Activist investing has attracted larger and larger pools of money, allowing managers like Mr. Peltz to hunt for ever-bigger corporate game. A proxy fight at Procter & Gamble, which has a market value of nearly $225 billion, would be among the biggest in corporate history.And Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is merely the latest consumer-driven company to capture the attention of activist investors.Last month, Daniel S. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund, Third Point, said he would agitate for changes at Nestl\u00e9, and Jana Partners had earlier pressured the retailer Whole Foods to revamp its board. Whole Foods ultimately announced that it would sell itself to Amazon.Companies with mature consumer brands \u2014 like Procter & Gamble, with its Tide detergent and Gillette razors \u2014 can be ripe targets for activists because their days of surging growth are often well behind them.While companies may want to keep the brands, enjoying the cash they can generate, activist investors tend to be more aggressive in their approach. They often look for ways to sell the brands and reinvest in new technologies or brands that can generate better growth opportunities, said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, a firm that consults with companies and funds on activist campaigns. (Mr. Park is not involved in Mr. Peltz\u2019s crusade with Procter & Gamble.)That Procter & Gamble has become the quarry for activist investors is a sign of how far the once-iconic giant has fallen.For years, Procter & Gamble attracted the best-and-brightest marketing M.B.A.s from the nation\u2019s top schools. It spurred many a Harvard Business School study of its internal methodologies and disruptive innovations. And it was the home to many big consumer hits, like the Swiffer duster and Crest Whitestrips.But thanks in no small part to lackluster economic growth overseas, combined with a strong dollar, Procter & Gamble has had 13 consecutive quarters of sales declines. Its shares have lagged behind the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.The company is on its third chief executive, David Taylor, in eight years. It is slashing billions of dollars in costs and shrinking its work force.To meet the challenges, Procter & Gamble has moved quickly to reduce its portfolio of brands, selling about 40 beauty brands, including CoverGirl makeup and Clairol Nice \u2019n Easy hair coloring, to Coty last year.But analysts say what has gone missing from Procter & Gamble is innovation, new products or designs that will spur top-line growth.\u201cOlay hasn\u2019t grown in years,\u201d said Mark Astrachan, an analyst with Stifel Financial. \u201cPantene has been relaunched I don\u2019t know how many times at this point. On shaving, it was not focused on the fact the market was moving online and to products offered at a lower price point. It didn\u2019t launch a shaving club until it had lost considerable market share.\u201dAnd while the company is beginning to lower the prices of its goods to compete with less expensive products, the prices of its brands are, on average, 40 percent higher than the average price in the category, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein Research. Tide is twice the average price in the laundry detergent arena, Mr. Dibadj said.For now, Mr. Peltz has emphasized cutting costs and trimming the layers of management bureaucracy at Procter & Gamble, but not much else.Since taking its stake in Procter & Gamble in February, Trian had held about a half-dozen meetings with the company, outlining its arguments, according to two people briefed on the matter. The company made its own counterarguments, including asking for more time to prove the worth of its current strategy.Those discussions reached a head last week when Procter & Gamble formally declined to give Mr. Peltz a seat.In a statement on Monday, the company said it had had \u201can active and constructive dialogue\u201d with Trian. It also said that its board was \u201cconfident that the changes being made are producing results\u201d and that it \u201cexpresses complete support for the company\u2019s strategy, plans and management.\u201dTrian said Monday that it was not seeking to break up Procter & Gamble \u2014 a well-worn tactic of activists \u2014 or seeking to replace David S. Taylor, who has been the company\u2019s chief executive for less than two years. If Mr. Peltz is elected, Trian said, the firm will renominate the director who had been defeated, effectively expanding Procter & Gamble\u2019s board by one seat.For the most part, Trian has tended to apply pressure behind the scenes with corporate management, a self-described \u201cconstructivist\u201d tact. Mr. Peltz meets regularly with management teams and board members, often discussing lengthy analyses that the firm has put together. (The firm\u2019s \u201cwhite paper\u201d on General Electric ran to about 80 pages.)Since setting up Trian in 2005, Mr. Peltz and his partners, Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, had resorted to proxy fights just twice before Procter & Gamble. That is out of 23 campaigns at 20 companies, according to data from FactSet.Trian\u2019s win rate in its proxy fights is 50 percent. In the battle against the ketchup maker Heinz for board seats, Trian won two of the five seats it sought. But with the chemical maker DuPont, shareholders rejected Trian outright and re-elected all of the sitting directors, although the company\u2019s chief executive, Ellen J.

{"Headline": "Michael Kors to Buy Jimmy Choo in $1.2 Billion Deal", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Michael Kors has picked out some new shoes to go with its handbags.Many upscale brands like Michael Kors have faced plummeting sales and tepid profits. Mall traffic in North America has declined sharply, while shoppers who have traditionally been loyal to the so-called middle market have gravitated toward brands at extremes of the style and price spectrum.Jimmy Choo, which shot to prominence thanks to celebrity patrons like Princess Diana and the \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker, could give Michael Kors a new avenue for growth.\u201cAcquiring Jimmy Choo is the beginning of a strategy that we have for building a luxury group that really is focused on international fashion brands,\u201d John D. Idol, the chairman and chief executive of Michael Kors Holdings, said in an interview.Mr. Idol said he was targeting more acquisitions, focusing on luxury companies that \u201clead in style and trend\u201d but also \u201chave got some size and scale\u201d as well as \u201csome heritage.\u201dThough both Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo are red-carpet favorites, they appeal to different segments of the population.Michael Kors, known for fashion-forward designs and competitive prices, is heavily reliant on outlets and department stores, where deep discounting is common. Leather purses sell for as little as $70 and handbags are available for $95.Jimmy Choo occupies a higher price point: Open-toe slip-on sandals sell for $425, while crystal-encrusted shoes with the brand\u2019s signature sky-high stilettos go for nearly $3,000. The brand brings not only a different range of customers, but also hefty profit margins and an upmarket aura.Michael Kors is in need of an update.The brand became a household name thanks to its charismatic and eponymous founder, who appeared for 10 seasons as a judge on the fashion-based reality television show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d His approach to fashion focused on the idea that every woman wants to look \u201cpretty and rich.\u201d For years, Michael Kors enjoyed soaring revenues as customers embraced its glitterati-inspired accessories at affordable prices.Jonathan Buxton, the head of consumer and retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, an advisory firm, said that for Michael Kors, \u201cthis deal presents an opportunity to enter the high end of the luxury market, to increase sales and to diversify away from its own brand, especially at a time when it is experiencing declining same-store sales.\u201dThere was likely to be more consolidation, he said, as other \u201caffordable luxury\u201d brands looked to move upmarket.The deal would mark the first time Jimmy Choo has been owned by a company with expertise in fashion. The question now is whether it will expand into more accessible footwear, targeting new customers \u2014 perhaps ones more like those Michael Kors already has \u2014 or into new product categories. It has already made forays into fragrances and sunglasses and has tried to make inroads into the luggage market.Jimmy Choo was founded in 1996 by Tamara Mellon, then the accessories editor at British Vogue, with the Malaysian cobbler Jimmy Choo. Its vampish aesthetic quickly caught the attention of the rich and famous, and more recently, Michelle Obama was frequently seen wearing its shoes.After the sale to Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo would continue with its current management team, including the chief executive, Pierre Denis, and Sandra Choi, Mr. Choo\u2019s niece, who took over creative leadership at the brand after Ms. Mellon left. The shoemaker has more than 150 stores globally, as well as a presence in many of the world\u2019s top department stores.Michael Kors said it expected to open new Jimmy Choo retail stores and expand its fashion offerings. It also plans to develop Jimmy Choo\u2019s online presence, part of a broader push by brands to win over fickle consumers and fend off the threat posed by Amazon. Mr. Idol said Michael Kors wanted to increase Jimmy Choo\u2019s sales to $1 billion annually.Expansion at the top tier of the market suggests that Michael Kors sees its best chance of clawing back growth as lying with the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers.The company has ramped up its e-commerce business in recent months, and has long been considered a pioneer in the effective use of social media in the sector. It was the first fashion brand to sponsor an Instagram advertisement, and has 10.3 million followers on the image-sharing platform. While Jimmy Choo also promotes its offerings on social media (it has 6.8 million followers on Instagram), its efforts have been more recent.Under the terms of the transaction, Jimmy Choo investors would receive 230 pence, or about $3, for each share they own, representing a 36.5 percent premium to the share price in April, before the company announced it was putting itself up for sale. Shares of Jimmy Choo closed at 195 pence on Monday.Jimmy Choo said its board of directors intended to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. JAB Holding has agreed to support the takeover.Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan advised Michael Kors, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised Jimmy Choo.Vanessa Friedman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Insurance, but for 3 Days, Health Care Is Within Reach", "Date": "2017-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWISE, Va. \u2014 For a man who needed 18 teeth pulled, Daniel Smith was looking chipper.Anxious, too, for he was facing a pair of forceps. But Smith, 30, a contractor with no health or dental insurance, who hadn\u2019t seen a dentist in more than 20 years, was looking forward to an imminent end to the pain and rot in his mouth.\u201cI\u2019ve always worked, since I was 14, but I\u2019ve never had dental insurance,\u201d Smith told me. After his teeth are out, he has a lead on low-cost dentures.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a straight smile,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one in my life.\u201dAll around Smith were uninsured patients receiving free dental or medical care, including dozens of men and women in side-by-side dental chairs in the open air. Organizers mercifully arranged the long line of people waiting to have teeth pulled so that they were facing away from those currently enduring extractions.Some patients camped out for three days at the fairground gate before the clinic opened to make sure they would be treated.The health fair reminded me of scenes I\u2019ve witnessed in refugee camps in South Sudan. But here in America?The sight is a wrenching reminder of how many Americans slip through the cracks. No other advanced country permits this level of suffering \u2014 and if the G.O.P. health care plan goes through, millions more will lose their health coverage.\u201cWalking around, listening to people, it breaks your heart,\u201d said Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, whom I encountered on the fairground. \u201cWe need a healthy work force, and this is a disgrace.\u201d\u201cShame on us as a nation,\u201d McAuliffe added. \u201cThis is an embarrassment to our country.\u201dThat\u2019s what I feel, too: humiliation that Americans need to be rescued by a group originally intended to help people in the world\u2019s poorest countries (mixed with pride at the altruistic spirit that attracted so many volunteers, paying their own expenses to come here). To me, the fundamental lesson is that even under Obamacare, too many people don\u2019t have coverage, and we urgently need a single-payer universal health care system along the lines of Medicare for all.Remote Area Medical is the brainchild of Stan Brock, 81, a onetime British cowboy who in the 1950s managed one of the world\u2019s biggest ranches, overseeing 50,000 cattle in Guyana in South America.When he was badly injured by a wild horse, Brock was told it would be a 26-day hike to the nearest doctor. So he recovered on his own \u2014 but began to think about supplying health care to deprived areas.Brock ended up founding Remote Area Medical to work in places like the Amazon, Haiti and Uganda. But then one day he had a call from Sneedville, Tenn., where the hospital had just closed and the dentist moved out. \u201cCan you come here?\u201d the caller asked.Brock loaded a dental chair on the back of a pickup truck and brought in a dentist as well \u2014 and 150 people lined up, desperate for oral care. The result is that while it continues some international work, Remote Area Medical also treats people in the world\u2019s superpower.Brock is a character: He discovered a species of bat that is named for him, and today he has no home but unrolls a pad each evening and sleeps on the floor of Remote Area Medical\u2019s permanent offices in Tennessee. At 5 a.m. on the first day here, Brock opened the gate and began admitting people eager for care.As they surged past, many stopped to thank him; one man had tears in his eyes as he did so.\u201cI wish Mr. Trump would come,\u201d Brock told me. \u201cThe health of these people is appalling.\u201dObamacare and the expansion of Medicaid have helped, but this health fair underscores glaring gaps in American coverage, especially for dental and vision care, in ways that affect us all.In the vision tent, a patient couldn\u2019t see even the biggest letter at the top of the eye chart. As he waited for glasses, a volunteer asked, \u201cAnd how did you get here?\u201d\u201cOh, I drove.\u201dJennifer Jolliffee, a volunteer, told of a 6-year-old boy who had behavioral problems, couldn\u2019t read and struggled at school. Then he had his first vision screening, and his parents learned that he could barely see. Soon he was looking around in wonderment through glasses.In another area of the fairground, doctors saw patients in private \u201crooms\u201d created by sheets dangled from strings with clothespins. In one such room, Dr. Ross Isaacs saw William Powers, a former bulldozer operator with severe kidney problems, and outlined how Powers could maximize his chances of a kidney transplant. \u201cI\u2019ve got hope again,\u201d Powers told me as he left.As for Dr. Isaacs, he put it this way: \u201cThe success of this event is an indictment of our health care system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Is Dealt a Fresh Blow in European Legal Case", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Uber suffered a blow to its expansion plans in Europe on Tuesday after a senior adviser to the region\u2019s highest court said that the ride-hailing service should have to abide by tough rules governing taxi services.The French authorities brought criminal proceedings last year against the ride-hailing service for infringing a law that required any vehicle carrying passengers for a fee to be licensed as a taxi service and to have appropriate insurance.Uber had argued that the law was also a \u201ctechnical regulation\u201d over digital services. That being the case, the company said, the French authorities were required to notify the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, before adopting the legislation. Because France did not do so, Uber contended, the law could not be enforced.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.\u201cWe have seen today\u2019s statement and await the final ruling later this year,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. She said that the company had stopped offering the services in question, and that it now worked only with professionally licensed drivers in France.The court typically follows the recommendations of its senior advisers, but it could still rule in the company\u2019s favor.\u201cThe two ways Uber sold itself \u2014 as a digital company and as a ride-sharing service \u2014 don\u2019t stand up, according to this legal opinion,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Cass Business School at City University in London.When companies like Uber and Airbnb, the short-term rental company, set up, he said, \u201cThey skirted around national laws, and that was what made them competitive and cheap.\u201d He added, \u201cMany national regulators are beginning to chip away at that.\u201dUber already operates in many European cities in compliance with transportation rules, but some of its services \u2014 particularly those that do not require drivers to have a taxi license \u2014 have been banned and face stiff opposition.The pushback against Uber is part of wider tensions between the European authorities and American technology companies.After months of turmoil and questions about its leadership and culture, the company is now without a chief executive \u2014 a committee of executives is in charge.Advertisement"}

Scott Fitzgerald novel, is certainly meticulous \u2014 the period costumes, the hairdos, the historical references. Yet attention to detail doesn\u2019t buy passion, either in romance or in recreating the tumult of the 1930s. The show, which becomes available to stream on Friday, looks great, as do the people in it, but caring about any of them doesn\u2019t come easily.Monroe collaborates, and sometimes spars, with Pat Brady, a studio chief played by Kelsey Grammer in the gruff, growly mode that has become his signature, which, for the viewer, makes the performance not very exciting; Mr. Grammer is fine, of course, but we\u2019ve seen it all before.The character you\u2019re most likely to latch onto is Celia, Brady\u2019s daughter, played by Lily Collins, who by Episode 3 has begun to make an impression amid a sea of thin female roles. Celia has a thing for Monroe, which is awkward for reasons that won\u2019t be spoiled here. And, we come to find out, she also has an empathy her father lacks; she grows curious about the underclass of people who do the grunt work that goes into a big-budget movie, and about related matters, like unionization.It\u2019s necessary to grab hold of Celia or some other secondary character because Monroe is too slick to embrace, and yet (unlike those \u201cMad Men\u201d) not written with enough depth to be as intriguing as this series needs him to be.

Eh; it\u2019s tough to care about the struggles of the glib and powerful.These and other historical themes are still around as the series progresses, but the attempts to merge them with the personal stories of the characters are not exactly seamless. Admirable care went into the costumes and settings; the script, not so much. There is quite a bit of awkward, didactic dialogue here.

{"Headline": "The Lawyer, the Addict", "Date": "2017-07-15", "News": "A high-powered Silicon Valley attorney dies. His ex-wife investigates, and finds a web of drug abuse in his profession.Supported byIn July 2015, something was very wrong with my ex-husband, Peter. His behavior over the preceding 18 months had been erratic and odd. He could be angry and threatening one minute, remorseful and generous the next. His voice mail messages and texts had become meandering soliloquies that didn\u2019t make sense, veering from his work travails, to car repairs, to his pet mouse, Snowball.I thought maybe the stress of his job as a lawyer had finally gotten to him, or that he was bipolar. He had been working more than 60 hours a week for 20 years, ever since he started law school and worked his way into a partnership in the intellectual property practice of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a prominent law firm based in Silicon Valley.Then, for two days, Peter couldn\u2019t be reached. So I drove the 20 minutes or so to his house, to look in on him. Although we were divorced, we had known each other by then for nearly 30 years. We were family.I parked in Peter\u2019s driveway, used my key to open the front door and walked up to the living room, a loftlike space with bamboo floors bathed in sunlight.\u201cPeter?\u201d I called out.Silence. A few candy wrappers littered a counter. Peter worked so much that he rarely cooked anymore, sustaining himself largely on fast food, snacks, coffee, ibuprofen and antacids. I headed toward the bedroom, calling his name.The door was ajar. A few crumpled and bloodied tissues were scattered on the bedsheets. And then I turned the corner and saw him, lying on the floor between the bathroom and the bedroom. His head rested on a flattened cardboard box.In my shock, I didn\u2019t see the half-filled syringes on the bathroom sink, or the spoon, lighter and crushed pills. I didn\u2019t see the bag of white powder, or the tourniquet, or the other lighter next to the bed. The police report from that day noted several safes around the bedroom, all of them open and spilling out translucent orange pill bottles.Peter, one of the most successful people I have ever known, died a drug addict, felled by a systemic bacterial infection common to intravenous users.Of all the heartbreaking details of his story, the one that continues to haunt me is this: The history on his cellphone shows the last call he ever made was for work. Peter, vomiting, unable to sit up, slipping in and out of consciousness, had managed, somehow, to dial into a conference call.None of this made sense. Not only was Peter one of the smartest people in my life, he had also been a chemist before becoming a lawyer and most likely understood how the drugs he was taking would affect his neurochemistry.In my attempt to fathom what happened to him and how I \u2014 and everyone else in his world \u2014 missed it, I set out to create a map of Peter\u2019s life the year before he died. (To protect the privacy of our children and Peter\u2019s extended family, I\u2019m not using his surname.)I studied his texts to drug dealers, and I compared the timing of those with dates and times of A.T.M. withdrawals he made. I needed to see the signs I hadn\u2019t known were signs. The nonsensical conversations. The crazy hours he kept. The nights he told our children he was running out to get a soda, only to disappear.Human beings are physically and emotionally complex, so there is no simple answer as to why Peter began abusing drugs. But as a picture of his struggle took shape before my eyes, so did another one: The further I probed, the more apparent it became that drug abuse among America\u2019s lawyers is on the rise and deeply hidden.One of the first things I learned is that there is little research on lawyers and drug abuse. Nor is there much data on drug use among lawyers compared with the general population or white-collar workers specifically.Over all, the results showed that about 21 percent of lawyers qualify as problem drinkers, while 28 percent struggle with mild or more serious depression and 19 percent struggle with anxiety. Only 3,419 lawyers answered questions about drug use, and that itself is telling, said Patrick Krill, the study\u2019s lead author and also a lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s left to speculation what motivated 75 percent of attorneys to skip over the section on drug use as if it wasn\u2019t there.\u201dIn Mr. Krill\u2019s opinion, they were afraid to answer.Nearly 21 percent of the lawyers that said they had used drugs in the previous year reported \u201cintermediate\u201d concern about their drug use. Three percent had \u201csevere\u201d concerns.\u201cAlcohol is legal,\u201d Mr. Krill said, not to mention socially acceptable. \u201cSo admitting you drink too much is not directly at odds with your role as a licensed attorney.\u201dIllicit drug use, however, is illegal. \u201cI think the incidence of drug use and abuse is significantly underreported,\u201d he said.In recent years, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a significant rate of increase specifically among attorneys using prescription medications that become a gateway to street drugs.\u201d It used to be mostly alcohol, he said, \u201cbut now almost every attorney that comes in for treatment, even if they drink, they are using drugs, too \u2014 Xanax, Adderall, opiates, cocaine and crack.\u201dOpioids and stimulants often go hand in hand with alcohol. In fact, drugs are sometimes used to combat the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.In addition to having a private practice at the time, Mr. Cuban was working for his well-known brother, the businessman Mark Cuban, who threatened to fire Brian if he didn\u2019t get sober. \u201cI kept thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not going to rehab. I\u2019m a lawyer, lawyers don\u2019t go to rehab, they aren\u2019t in 12-step programs,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, half the people I know in my 12-step program are lawyers.\u201dThat stress became particularly acute as the economy sank after the 2008 financial crisis. Jobs became more scarce. The pressure grew to not take time off from work.At Peter\u2019s memorial service in 2015 \u2014 held in a place he loved, with sweeping views of the Pacific \u2014 a young associate from his firm stood up to speak of their friendship and of the bands they sometimes went to see together, only to break down in tears. Quite a few of the lawyers attending the service were bent over their phones, reading and tapping out emails.Peter himself lived in a state of heavy stress. He obsessed about the competition, about his compensation, about the clients, their demands and his fear of losing them. He loved the intellectual challenge of his work but hated the combative nature of the profession, because it was at odds with his own nature.Long before law school, when Peter was still in his early 20s and wearing his hair in a long ponytail, his passions were science, philosophy and music. One of his idols was the astronomer Carl Sagan. Another was Jimi Hendrix. He gave me books like \u201cSiddhartha\u201d and \u201cLetters to a Young Poet\u201d and played bass guitar in bands from college onward, even while a lawyer.When he was a graduate student in chemistry, we spent whole weekends lying on the floor playing records for each other, talking about why we loved them and what memories a particular song snatched from the recesses of our minds.After graduation, Peter worked for two small pharmaceutical companies but found the profession tedious and low paying. Having grown up in a low-income family, he didn\u2019t want to worry about paying the bills again. So he decided to use his chemistry background to become a patent lawyer.When he graduated from law school, the starting salary of his first job in law was five times what he had earned as a chemist. But our lives were not suddenly easy. Although we had enough money, Peter\u2019s work schedule gave him little time to enjoy the fruits of his labor.One Christmas Day early in his career, Peter\u2019s boss phoned from a ski lift in Aspen, Colo., to make sure Peter was going to finish a brief by that evening. He did, skipping dinner.\u201cI can\u2019t do this forever,\u201d Peter often told me. \u201cI can\u2019t keep going like this for the next 20 years.\u201dPeter battled his own brand of melancholy, something I found attractive in a tragically poetic, still-waters-run-deep kind of way. He used to tell me he wasn\u2019t someone who ever really felt happy. He had moments of being \u201cnot unhappy,\u201d he said, but his emotional range was narrow.When something great happened, he didn\u2019t jump for joy. When something sad happened, he didn\u2019t break down and cry. The only times I ever saw tears in his eyes were in the hospital, right after each of our children was born.Yet for almost a decade as an associate at various law firms, Peter displayed no photos of his children or me in his office. When I asked him why \u2014 particularly when other lawyers seemed to have photos in theirs \u2014 Peter told me he didn\u2019t want the partners to see him as \u201cdistracted by my family.\u201dIn many ways, Peter\u2019s personality and abilities read like a wish list of qualities for a lawyer. Trained as a scientist, he approached problems in a deliberative, logical way. He was intelligent, ambitious and most of all hard-working, perhaps because his decision to go to law school was such an enormous commitment \u2014 financially, logistically and emotionally \u2014 that he could justify it only by being the very best.And he was. In law school he was editor of the law review and No. 1 in his class. He gave the speech at graduation.He also had a single-minded focus that could border on obsessive. I remember when he became consumed with Bach\u2019s harpsichord concertos, assembling a library of every one he could find. He read about them, listened to lectures about them and even found a mathematical representation of a particular piece on YouTube, which he had us all watch. That level of focus was well suited for deep dives into the new drug formulations, medical devices and technologies with which he had to constantly and quickly familiarize himself.In addition, he said, law students generally start school with their sense of self and their values intact. But, in his research, he said, he has found that the formal structure of law school starts to change that.Rather than hew to their internal self, students begin to focus on external values, he said, like status, comparative worth and competition. \u201cWe have seven very strong studies that show this twists people\u2019s psyches and they come out of law school significantly impaired, with depression, anxiety and hostility,\u201d he said.Academics often study law students because students are considered a bellwether for the profession. \u201cThey are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d Dr. Benjamin said.Wil Miller, the lawyer and former methamphetamine addict, said that in his experience, law school encouraged students to take emotion out of their decisions. \u201cWhen you start reinforcing that with grades and money, you aren\u2019t just suppressing your emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re fundamentally changing who you are.\u201dAfter students began law school they experienced \u201ca marked increase in depression, negative mood and physical symptoms, with corresponding decreases in positive affect and life satisfaction,\u201d the professors wrote.Students also shed some of their idealism. Within the first year of law school, students\u2019 motivation for studying law and becoming lawyers shifted from \u201chelping and community-oriented values to extrinsic, rewards-based values.\u201d\u201cThese aren\u2019t the majority of lawyers,\u201d she added. \u201cBut there are quite a number abusing drugs, and once they get to heroin, it\u2019s very hard to break it.\u201dFor the last two years of his life, every time Peter and I were together \u2014 whether it was back-to-school night, our son\u2019s cross country meets or our daughter\u2019s high school graduation \u2014 people would ask me if he was O.K. They asked if he had cancer, an eating disorder, a metabolic disorder, AIDS. But they never asked about drugs.Drugs didn\u2019t cross my mind, either. Not even the day I found his body, surrounded by drug paraphernalia, and called 911.That day in Peter\u2019s house, the emergency medical workers told me right away that it was probably a drug overdose. I remember saying, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d After all, I said, he was a partner at a law firm. He had an Ivy League education.\u201cHow could that be?\u201d I asked one of them. \u201cHe was so smart.\u201dID around her neck and clipboard on her lap, she nodded at me with a look of understanding. \u201cWe see a lot of this now,\u201d she said, meaning wealthy, accomplished men and women who start out with pain pills and graduate to amphetamines or heroin.As I cleared out Peter\u2019s house after he died, I found receipts from medical-supply companies that had delivered things like bandages and tourniquets to his office address. Yet I don\u2019t think addiction crossed the mind of anyone he worked with, either.It\u2019s difficult, though, to imagine that one class every three years would have prevented Peter \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 from becoming an addict. Real change, experts and recovering addicts say, needs to happen at the law-firm level, but that is complicated by an entrenched culture of privacy combined with an allegiance to billable hours.Ms. Smith, formerly of Pillsbury Winthrop, says she doesn\u2019t know what her previous firm knew or didn\u2019t know about her substance abuse. \u201cThey never said a thing to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd during that entire time I was an addict, I didn\u2019t get a single negative performance review.\u201dEdward Flanders, managing partner in Pillsbury\u2019s Manhattan office, said the firm was not aware of Ms. Smith\u2019s substance abuse issues when she was there. Ms. Smith spoke about her experience to the firm\u2019s New York City employees in March.\u201cHearing about her experience was pretty eye-opening for the firm, and it\u2019s not something we want anyone else to have to go through alone,\u201d Mr. Flanders said.I\u2019ve spent the past two years marinating in this mess, trying my best to navigate things like the byzantine probate process and my children\u2019s broken hearts. I firmly believe that law-firm culture, particularly at big firms, has to become more compassionate and more aware of the signs that one of their own is struggling.Looking back, I can see the signs I missed.There was the time our son broke his wrist playing soccer four years ago and was prescribed Vicodin; Peter rifled through my medicine cabinet looking for the leftovers. \u201cI use them for my back,\u201d he said.There was the holiday concert in which our son\u2019s band was performing where Peter showed up late and jittery, looking so thin that I noticed his head seemed too big for his neck. After the show I walked with him to his car, and he complained that he was getting pushback from his firm about working from home so much.\u201cI\u2019m more productive at home, but they have to see me, physically, in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think I\u2019m working if I\u2019m not there.\u201dThey were right.And there was the time in early 2015 when my son told me Peter had received a shipment from Amazon that he had opened at the dining room table, pulling out boxes of syringes, bandages, cotton balls and wound cleanser. Peter explained it away as simply stocking up on medical supplies.My son was puzzled by that. But by then his father\u2019s behavior had become so strange, this almost seemed normal. \u201cI just put my headphones on,\u201d my son told me, \u201cand said, \u2018I have to do homework.\u2019\u201dYears ago, when Peter was still a relatively new associate, he would joke that the perfect drug for him would be the combination of an antidepressant, a pain reliever and a stimulant. When I cleaned out his house, I found the ingredients for it: Vicodin, Tramadol, Adderall, cocaine, Xanax, crystal meth and a kaleidoscope of pills I couldn\u2019t identify, but not for lack of trying.Yet even as addiction was taking over his life, Peter continued working. In the notebooks he used to keep track of injection times and dosages, he also made cryptic notes about client calls and meetings, lists of things needed to prepare documents, filing deadlines.Being a patent lawyer is intellectually grueling work, and Peter was good at it \u2014 really good at it \u2014 for a long time. Perhaps the arrogance that grows from a profession in which your advice is worth $600 an hour is what allowed him to believe he didn\u2019t need to ask for help, that he could kick this on his own. Just another item on his lengthy to-do list.In fact, while cleaning out his house I found a list of New Year\u2019s resolutions Peter wrote in December 2014, tucked into the bottom of a dresser drawer. \u201cRun three races, spend more time with kids,\u201d his note to himself read.And in red marker, the word \u201cquit.\u201dAn article last Sunday about lawyers and drug addiction misstated the period during which Wil Miller, a former sex crimes prosecutor, was addicted to methamphetamines. It was the last six months of his tenure, not the entire 10 years he was in the job. The article also misspelled Mr. Miller\u2019s given name as Will.An earlier version of this article referred incompletely to Lisa Smith\u2019s association with the firm Pillsbury Winthrop. While Ms. Smith was a lawyer, she was working in the firm\u2019s marketing department, not as a lawyer, during the period she said she used cocaine to deal with alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Produced by Antonio de Luca and Whitney Richardson.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Luxury Retailers May Be Returning to Form", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy midmorning on a wet and windy British midsummer day, burly security guards had erected velvet ropes along one side of the store\u2019s gilded floor-to-ceiling windows. Inside, a dozen black-clad assistants raced around on lurid magenta carpets, serving the 20-some customers on the ground floor. An orderly line made up mostly of tourists formed outside, many of them looking hungrily through the corner store\u2019s glass panes.That is part of a trend in the luxury sector. Indeed, European power players do not just appear to be quietly on the rebound, they are back with an emphatic bang.The success is evident on Bond Street, where Wendi Liu, a visitor from China, joined the line outside the Gucci store, accompanied by her older sister. Clutching their iPhones, the pair wore oversize Gucci sunglasses and planned to shop for sneakers, loafers and possibly handbags once inside the boutique.\u201cI am completely obsessed,\u201d Ms. Liu said.\u201cI love the clothes and the advertising campaigns, but the bags are really why I am here,\u201d said Julieta Vega, a tourist from Spain on a weekend trip. She already had three Gucci handbags, and added that every time she went abroad she visited the local Gucci store. \u201cYou never know what they might have there that you can\u2019t get anywhere else,\u201d Ms. Vega said.Customers like Ms. Liu and Ms. Vega are propelling a resurgence for Gucci and its parent company.Kering, which also owns brands like Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, said that total like-for-like sales grew 26.5 percent year-on-year in the first six months of 2017 to 7.3 billion euros, or $8.5 billion, while recurring operating income increased 57.1 percent to nearly \u20ac1.3 billion, both of which outperformed analysts\u2019 estimates.The results paint a markedly more positive picture than previous years for European luxury companies.Last year, the global market for personal luxury goods failed to grow for the first time since the financial crisis, stalling at \u20ac249 billion, according to the consulting firm Bain & Company. The sector had been hit by an economic slowdown in China, currency volatility harming the bottom line, and customer sentiment that was damped by violence and terrorist attacks.\u201cThe market is facing a \u2018newness imperative\u2019 as many luxury consumers \u2014 especially Chinese shoppers who buy more and more frequently \u2014 already own enough of the core pieces and staples,\u201d said Luca Solca, who heads luxury research at Exane BNP Paribas. \u201cHence they will only part with their money if brands bring them something really new and exciting. Those on top are the brands who have recognized that.\u201dThe success of European luxury giants stands in contrast to their rivals across the Atlantic.Having failed to maintain an adequate balance between ubiquity and exclusivity \u2014 a formula that has come to dictate the success or failure of a modern luxury brand \u2014 the likes of Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors and Coach are now grappling with the effects of overexposure and a devaluation of their brand in the eyes of shoppers.Unlike LVMH and Kering, companies that eschewed discounting to maintain pricing power and market position, affordable-luxury kingpins in the United States chased meteoric growth targets, which have since come crashing down.With shoppers appearing to gravitate toward extreme ends of the spectrum \u2014 either toward fast-fashion giants like Zara and H&M, or top-tier houses like Gucci and Fendi \u2014 those that occupied the \u201cmiddle market\u201d have been left painfully exposed.Despite their glowing reported results, however, even the European power players voiced caution.Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH, warned that its results had been helped by the favorable comparison against results from a year ago, when sales were hit by a fall in tourists to Paris after terrorist attacks in France.Kering, meanwhile, warned that a stronger euro could hurt sales and curb tourism, resulting in more moderate growth in the future.Still, its Gucci brand accounts for around half of Kering\u2019s total sales. And this week, at the Gucci Bond Street store, customer appetite showed no sign of slowing. Though the line outside the shop had been short in the morning, come lunchtime it was snaking around the block.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wealth Advisers Set Up Shop With a Shared Back Office", "Date": "2017-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to traditional financial advisers, Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management does not quite play to type.Now, sitting on more than $4 trillion in assets, registered investment advisers are posing a direct threat to the old model of huddling with brokers from Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley and following their advice \u2014 for a hefty fee, usually \u2014 about which stocks, bonds or mutual funds to buy.Able to farm out onerous back-office and custodial responsibilities to firms like Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, brokers are leaving top Wall Street houses in droves to establish their own independent shops.Founded on the principle of providing low-cost stock trades to individual investors, Charles Schwab\u2019s growth in recent years has been propelled by its adviser segment, which offers a wide array of custodial services to registered investment advisers as well as access to the Schwab mutual fund supermarket.Of the $2.9 trillion in assets that Schwab oversees, $1.3 trillion now comes from financial advisers \u2014 up from $863 billion in 2012. The rest belongs to individual investors.More than 7,500 registered investment advisers use Schwab to park assets, giving it, according to the company\u2019s calculation, a 29 percent market share and putting it far ahead of competitors TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s Pershing subsidiary.Advisers can call on a Schwab expert for help in setting up a business or for legal advice in dealing with a complex trust, as well as execute quick and easy trades of individual securities or mutual funds.Schwab even runs a training program for interns, who are then farmed out to select advisers.What\u2019s most crucial, though, for a wealth manager just hanging out a shingle, is the sense of security.Whether you are a successful Wall Street broker going independent or starting a second career from scratch, being able to tell a client that the assets are with Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade offers a peace of mind that advisers say is absolutely critical to their business.\u201cSchwab put us in business when they developed their platform,\u201d said Harold Evensky, a longtime financial adviser who writes books and gives speeches on the merits of independent investment advice.A cluster of low-slung buildings in a northeast suburb of Phoenix is an unlikely hub for this wealth explosion \u2014 not least for Schwab, whose headquarters have long been in San Francisco. But because creating a back office for $1.3 trillion in assets is labor-intensive work, Schwab has been expanding its business in more affordable cities like Dallas and Orlando, Fla.Overseeing this growing fief within Schwab is Bernie Clark, the head of adviser services, who, unlike the rest of the senior management team at the company, is not based in San Francisco.A gregarious, backslapper of a man, Mr. Clark works out of the Phoenix office, and he exudes the can-do spirit of the traditional financial adviser one often finds teeing off at the golf course or holding forth at a rotary luncheon.But instead of pushing stocks or a hot new mutual fund, Mr. Clark and the new breed of adviser he represents are preaching the virtues of transparent, low-cost planning strategies.\u201cWhether it\u2019s price, access to funds or fiduciary standards, we are democratizing the industry,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Just outside of Mr. Clark\u2019s office suite is a sprawl of cubicles where Schwab employees can be heard counseling financial advisers all over the country on matters large and small.And unlike a Wall Street firm, where the trading floor, in its size, pride of place and all-around clamor represents the beating heart of the institution, the execution hub in Phoenix is a less exalted place.Nicknamed \u201cthe hole,\u201d it is a modest enclosure without the windows that pull the Arizona sunlight into the football field-size space where the Schwab back-office advisers do their work.Above all there is silence: Since more than 95 percent of executions, be it the selling of a security or the buying of a mutual fund, are done electronically, there are no shouts or exclamations to be heard.The Schwab trading floor may seem sleepy, but its work moves at hyperspeed. For advisers over all, the firm trades $1.5 billion per day in equity-related products, and exchange-traded funds represent the largest chunk \u2014 a third \u2014 of that amount.Outside of Vanguard and BlackRock, which together control nearly 70 percent of the market for exchange-traded funds, few financial firms have played as prominent a role as Schwab in feeding the current E.T.F. frenzy.According to Cerulli, a research firm, 80 percent of registered investment advisers rely on exchange-traded funds to give their clients exposure to various investment strategies. While Vanguard and BlackRock have been the two main choices for registered investment advisers, Schwab has introduced its own branded fleet of tracking funds, which it prices well below the peer group and in some cases offers free to clients.Schwab\u2019s $78 billion in exchange-traded funds is dwarfed by the nearly $2 trillion that Vanguard and BlackRock manage, but its growth has been rapid, up from just $8 billion in 2012. And its aggressive pricing on the Schwab platform give its funds an outsize influence, pushing competitors to keep slashing their own, already rock bottom fees.With the back-office responsibilities of his investment firm safely outsourced to TD Ameritrade and Schwab, he has plenty of time to do exactly that.\u201cWithout a good custodian,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cnone of what we do works.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E-Commerce as a Jobs Engine? One Economist\u2019s Unorthodox View", "Date": "2017-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookRetailing is dead. Sales clerks are losing their jobs by the thousands. The employment picture for young people with only a high school education is going to get even worse. And all this is happening because of Amazon and its ilk, which are driving the shift among consumers toward e-commerce.We\u2019ve heard this story over and over in recent months: The echo chamber keeps repeating that the retail apocalypse is upon us.Mr. Mandel, chief economic strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, contends that most economists are using the wrong job numbers to measure the e-commerce industry. He says that government numbers and conventional industry classifications don\u2019t properly count all the jobs associated with e-commerce \u2014 in particular, the numbers miss large parts of the industry like fulfillment centers and distribution warehouses. As anyone who has noticed the growing volume of big brown boxes being delivered to people\u2019s homes can imagine, facilities like that, which are tied to the e-commerce sector, are expanding rapidly.\u201cTo be honest, this was a surprise to me \u2014 I did not expect this,\u201d Mr. Mandel told me.Then he added, matter-of-factly, \u201cI\u2019m just looking at the numbers.\u201dViewing e-commerce as an engine of jobs \u2014 not just any jobs, but good ones that are spread around the country \u2014 would be a new paradigm, for sure. But it\u2019s one that admittedly requires a healthy dose of skepticism.\u201cThis could be transformational,\u201d Mr. Mandel argued, contending that the rise of e-commerce could lead to \u201ca reduction in economic inequality and geographic inequality.\u201dMr. Mandel said that over the past quarter-century, \u201cproduction gains were not shared with the workers.\u201d But now, he said, jobs at fulfillment centers are \u201cdecent paying,\u201d often full time and usually with benefits. And many of those fulfillment centers are sprouting up across the country in \u201cplaces you haven\u2019t heard of in a while.\u201dWith a burst of enthusiasm, he added, \u201cThis could be the pendulum swinging back.\u201dOf course, Mr. Mandel\u2019s view flies in the face of established economic thought \u2014 and perhaps for good reason: His arithmetic relies on certain unconventional assumptions.\u201cI\u2019m highly dubious,\u201d said John Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an executive outplacement firm that maintains a monthly index of job losses across the country. \u201cIt does sound crazy to me.\u201dThe warehouses that Mr. Mandel views as a source of job growth, Mr. Challenger said, \u201care being automated.\u201dIs it possible Mr. Mandel is miscounting or perhaps double-counting?In truth, his argument relies to some degree on the assumption that many of the new jobs created in a category known by the government as \u201cgeneral warehousing\u201d are tied to e-commerce. That may be a good assumption \u2014 but it\u2019s impossible to know for sure.Mr. Mandel justifies his assumption with an example of how convoluted the current method for counting e-commerce jobs is: Amazon publicly says it has 12,000 employees in Kentucky, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports only 2,640 workers in Kentucky in the e-commerce category. \u201cBy contrast, the general warehouse industry,\u201d Mr. Mandel writes, \u201chad more than 23,000 workers in Kentucky.\u201dAll of which is to say that we may not have as good a handle on the demographics of the job market as we think.Mr. Mandel said he had been \u201cvery careful\u201d to look only at changes in warehousing since 2007. \u201cWhen I look at changes on a county-by-county level, they correlate very well with building of fulfillment centers,\u201d he said.He acknowledged that his number could be an overestimate, saying that it might include \u201crecent building of warehouses that are not for e-commerce reasons.\u201dNationally, since 2007, \u201cthe decline in shopping hours is 64 million hours a week,\u201d Mr. Mandel said. \u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of about 1.5 million jobs,\u201d some of which are now being created to staff the new fulfillment centers.\u201cRobots have been tough to do,\u201d Mr. Mandel said, suggesting that they will come, but that it will take longer for them to replace humans than we think.\u201cI\u2019m basically an optimistic person,\u201d Mr. Mandel said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long time looking at what happened in the first part of the 20th century \u2014 how we got the combination of jobs gains and higher wages \u2014 and I think we\u2019re on the same path.\u201dIt feels a bit hard to believe to those of us who are inherent skeptics, but let\u2019s hope he\u2019s right.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Silence in China Sets a Dangerous Precedent", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYet in China over the weekend, when faced with a broad demand by the Chinese internet authority, it was Apple that blinked.Whatever Apple may have done in private to fight the Chinese internet law, the company has not offered a peep of criticism in public. Apple\u2019s only public statement on the VPN ban said that the company had been \u201crequired to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,\u201d but noted that the \u201capps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201d Despite the pulldown, Apple says there are still hundreds of VPN apps available on its Chinese app store, some of which remain unregistered with the government.Search Apple\u2019s website for a letter from Mr. Cook issuing a public rebuke of China\u2019s intrusion into his customers\u2019 privacy and freedom of expression \u2014 you won\u2019t find it. The company has not fully tested its political and economic leverage in China. It hasn\u2019t tested the public\u2019s immense love of its products. It hasn\u2019t publicly threatened any long-term consequences \u2014 like looking to other parts of the world to manufacture its products.The company\u2019s silence may be tactical; the Chinese government, the conventional thinking goes, does not take well to public rebuke. Yet Apple\u2019s quiet capitulation to tightening censorship in one of its largest markets is still a dangerous precedent.\u201cApple\u2019s response is tremendously disappointing,\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that Apple is playing a bigger role behind the scenes here. But the problem with that is, from the outside it looks exactly like doing nothing.\u201dIt may be na\u00efve to expect Apple to publicly take on the Chinese government. Sure, it may be the world\u2019s most valuable company, with extensive investments and operations in China. But Apple is also just a foreign company \u2014 it must obey local laws, and it must watch for its bottom line. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Apple\u2019s sales, and many analysts see the region as a key growth area for the company. So what was Apple supposed to do? Jeopardize its operations over a few apps?There is also a moral defense of Apple\u2019s decision to give in without a public fight: Despite the VPN ban, Chinese internet users might still be better off with Apple in China than with it outside. Its app store still provides people access to millions of apps that they might not find elsewhere in China. And Apple\u2019s own communications apps in China remain free of government censorship. For instance, Messages, Apple\u2019s texting app, and FaceTime, its video and phone-calling app, are protected by end-to-end encryption, allowing Chinese users to communicate freely.But that may be of limited utility.\u201cIt will only get worse,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a Chinese human rights activist and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. Mr. Xiao sees the latest crackdowns as the beginning of a new wave of internet censorship in China. And he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that saying something publicly would have backfired for Apple.\u201cThey should say something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a U.S. company, after all. And they\u2019re a global company, upholding standards of privacy and speech in many, many markets outside China. So if they have to do things differently in China, they should have some public explanation for why \u2014 because that attitude could matter globally, including in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Opening Data Center in China to Comply With Cybersecurity Law", "Date": "2017-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Apple said Wednesday that it would open its first data center in China, joining a parade of technology companies responding to growing global demands to build facilities that store online data closer to customers.The move is a response to a strict new law in China that requires companies to store users\u2019 data in the country. The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.As is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how. Already, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have formed partnerships with Chinese companies to offer cloud computing services based in China. Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.Apple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place.\u201d The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple\u2019s encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.\u201cThe addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,\u201d Apple said.China\u2019s rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.The iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple\u2019s business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s global sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.But the iPhone has also become emblematic of China\u2019s long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.Apple already stores some of the data of China\u2019s residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.In 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.Careful not to offend, Apple said it \u201cappreciated\u201d that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users\u2019 locations.The opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple\u2019s iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple\u2019s Chinese partner.Apple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple\u2019s permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.Other American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.Even though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple\u2019s smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Living and the Dead", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "In a film, on the news, you watch a war. While in a war, you mostly hear it. Weapons are fired day and night, but only sometimes do you see them fired. As much as images, then, each battle takes on its own sounds.The battle of Mosul began officially on Oct. 17, 2016. Sonically, it didn\u2019t come into its own until some weeks later. In the opening skirmishes, as Iraqi troops encountered Islamic State fighters on farmland and in villages outside the city, rounds whistled unobstructed through the air and thudded in the sod, a vague overture. When the troops breached the easternmost districts of the city proper \u2014 in early November \u2014 then you could begin to really listen to the conflict.On an evening later that month, I was embedded with a company of Iraqi Special Operations Forces in a neighborhood near Mosul\u2019s eastern edge from which they had expelled the jihadists. The troops had set up a temporary command post and barracks in a group of commandeered homes surrounding a plaza that included a mosque and a park, or what had been a park \u2014 now it was a mud patch where Humvees, armored bulldozers and a fuel tanker were parked. Most of the modest rowhouses in this neighborhood \u2014 Zahra, a middle-\u00adclass enclave of shopkeepers and pharmacists and taxi drivers \u2014 had made it out of the fighting intact; others were crumpled but salvageable; others were mere rubble. The sunset was threaded through with black smoke from the car fires ISIS had lit to try to obscure its positions from aerial surveillance. The futility of this tactic could be heard and felt every few minutes, as a jet dove in to drop a bomb, or a heavy artillery shell found its target, with an atmosphere-\u00adconsuming shriek and a thunderous, belly-\u00adseizing impact. And yet ISIS set the cars ablaze every day.ZahraWESTERN MOSULOld CityEASTERN MOSULTigris River2 milesAfter dark, a polyphony of firefights broke out around our position. The reliable chatter of rifles, the more insistent clangor of machine guns, the congested peals of rocket-\u00adpropelled grenades went back and forth. The airstrikes and artillery continued. At midnight, I climbed to a roof, ducked below the parapet \u2014 ISIS snipers had night-\u00advision equipment, it was believed, though they were good enough not to need it \u2014 and peered over. Mosul is situated in a riverine basin, so that a high enough spot can give you a view over the city\u2019s ancient marble walls, the domes and minarets of its medieval mosques, the balconies of its cinder block apartment houses. The car fires had created around the city a necklace of Boschian throbbing orange-\u00adred.A sinister chorale crept into the gunfire \u2014 ISIS fighters baying from mosque loudspeakers. \u201cAllahu akbar! Allahu akbar!\u201d Others shouted the phrase in the streets. From more loudspeakers came an ISIS anthem. I asked a soldier how the same song could come from different places in unison. He pulled from his fatigues a pocket radio and tuned it to 92.5 FM.\u201cISIS\u2019s radio station,\u201d he said.At the time, Zahra and a few areas around it represented a minute but expanding peninsula of military occupation jutting into the city, whose 251 neighborhoods were otherwise entirely controlled by ISIS. The plan was to push the jihadists west toward the Tigris River, which bisects Mosul, then encircle them on the west side. No one knew how many fighters were waiting. Some soldiers estimated a thousand, some five times that. Some believed that the battle would take two months, others a year. However many fighters there were, ISIS knew they were not enough to face off in the streets with the Iraqi forces pouring into Mosul: roughly 10,000 troops, with an additional 90,000 militiamen, police officers and Kurdish soldiers massed on the city\u2019s perimeter. Flying above Mosul were the jets, bombers, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles of an American-\u00adled international coalition, and around it was a constellation of heavy artillery firebases.So ISIS, in its efforts to hold Mosul \u2014 or, really, to kill as many people and destroy as much of the city as it could while losing it, as the jihadists knew they inevitably must \u2014 relied on tactics known in Western military parlance as \u201charassing fire.\u201d It was a phrase that amused Iraqi soldiers whose English was sufficient to understand its insufficiency and who had to actually endure this harassment. ISIS\u2019s harassers included world-class snipers, crack mortar teams, the suicidal drivers of vehicle-\u00adborne improvised explosive devices, or V.B.I.E.D.s \u2014 mobile car bombs \u2014 and, to direct these efforts, something new to warfare, a fleet of commercial-\u00admarket drones. ISIS managed to smuggle untold numbers of the small, cheap machines, the kind of thing you can buy on Amazon, into Mosul.On his phone, a sergeant major showed me a video taken by one of the enemy drones, which the jihadists used to target strikes as well as record them. When a strike was successful, they would quickly edit the video and put it online, part of the steady diet of near-real-time footage that each side supplied the internet. The troops watched ISIS\u2019s videos as avidly as everyone else \u2014 another of this battle\u2019s weird techno-\u00adwrinkles. This particular clip, uploaded a few days earlier, showed a car bomber speeding up a street not far from where we were now, toward a group of parked Humvees. \u201cThose are ours,\u201d said the sergeant major, Karim. The car bomber slammed into a Humvee. A ghostly gray expanded in the middle of the screen. \u201cI was injured,\u201d Karim said, lifting up his shirt to reveal a scar. \u201cNo, wait. This is from something else.\u201dIt was hard to keep track. The Iraqi special forces had been fighting ISIS for more than two years. They had fought them near Baghdad, in Ramadi, then Falluja, Tikrit and Baiji, pushing the jihadists north nearly 250 miles to Mosul, the caliphate\u2019s greatest urban stronghold. Many of Karim\u2019s comrades had fought Al Qaeda and ISIS\u2019s other precursors before that. The tip of the spear into Mosul, the special forces had been going without a break for weeks now, taking heavy casualties. Karim had been wounded five times since Ramadi. In Falluja, a rocket skivered a Humvee in which he was the gunner. It was the scar from that attack that he wanted to show me, a discolored sunken patch below his rib cage. Looking down at it, he said, \u201cIt was a big hole before.\u201dISIS captured Mosul in June 2014, when the organization was at the height of its power, its territory in Iraq and Syria encompassing thousands of square miles. With roughly 1.3 million residents, Mosul was the second or third \u00admost \u00adpopulous city in Iraq \u2014 many times the size of the caliphate\u2019s capital, Raqqa, Syria \u2014 and the most diverse and historically rich. By last fall, however, ISIS\u2019s territory had shrunk considerably. The recapture of Mosul from the Islamic State would not mean the organization\u2019s end, but it would be the most unmistakable death knell yet for the caliphate as a place.The firefights that began that night in Zahra persisted into the dawn, mingling with the bird song. The men prepared to assault an adjoining neighborhood. The commanding officer, a major, found a house whose roof afforded a good vantage of the route in. On the floor of its still-dark main room were what at first appeared to be long bolts of fabric. Only when the major stepped around them did I see that this was the family who lived here, huddled under layers of blankets. They slept together in the center of the house in the event a wall was blown out during the night.On the street, a tank and an armored bulldozer waited ahead of two columns of Humvees. Locals emerged from their houses, tentatively, then enthusiastically. Parents sent their children to make tea for the soldiers. They brought them bread, sweets, whatever they could spare. The soldiers shared cigarettes, still a precious commodity in Mosul\u2019s newly retaken parts.A special-\u00adforces general gave the order to move. The columns reduced to a single line to cross a boulevard strewn with wrecked cars, downed shop awnings, the trunks of light poles, and then filed into a labyrinth of increasingly narrow streets. The fighting was close. A boy stepped from a doorway, and a soldier yelled at him from a Humvee window, \u201cGo back inside!\u201dWe came to a stop before a soccer field. On its far side was a mosque, its minaret about seven stories high \u2014 an obvious sniper perch. The general stepped from his Humvee and glanced up indifferently. Encouraged by the sounds of the soldiers, a father opened the front gate of his house. His wife and daughter peeked out. The general walked to them, wearing neither flak jacket nor helmet, carrying not even a sidearm. He shook the father\u2019s hand, patted the girl\u2019s head, accepted a kiss from the wife.As if on cue, a shard of pavement popped up near the general\u2019s feet, followed by a faint snap. Then something ricocheted off his Humvee with another snap. The family disappeared behind the gate. Soldiers leapt from the street. The general looked at the minaret with scarcely more interest than before, then walked with his back to the mosque, unhurried, and finally sidestepped behind a Humvee with a contemplative grin.The sniper kept firing. He put a round into the turret of the Humvee in which I was sitting, above my head, then one into the windscreen of the Humvee behind mine, a third into the side mirror of the one next to mine. The minaret was about 400 yards away, and this marksman apparently intended to showcase his expertise, picking apart the vehicles while he waited for one of us to stumble into his sights. A special-\u00adforces gunner peppered the minaret with .50-\u00adcaliber rounds, another with grenades from an automatic launcher. The facade crumbled and smoked. It was a Friday, the day of prayer and rest in Islam, the most inconsiderate day to be shooting up a mosque, and ISIS, maybe taking this engagement as sacrilege, loosed a wave of mortar fire.I took cover in a house, where I found the major on the roof, smoking and drinking a Red Bull beneath a clothesline. A car bomb detonated, shaking the block. \u201cThey are good fighters,\u201d the major said of the enemy. Like most Iraqi soldiers, he was willing to give credit to the jihadists. Whatever else they might be \u2014 lunatics, half-wits, junkies, fake Muslims, pawns of foreign powers, there were as many theories as soldiers \u2014 they were not cowards. \u201cThey want to die,\u201d it was said every day, and this was neither an insult nor a clich\u00e9. \u201cI respect them,\u201d the major confided. \u201cPeople need to die. They have the loyalty for that. I know their loyalty is in the wrong place, but most of their fighters, we\u2019ve found, they have that loyalty. It\u2019s difficult, in an army, to find a fighter who\u2019s ready to blow himself up, to fight until he\u2019s dead.\u201dAs he spoke, an ISIS propagandist got onto a nearby loudspeaker.\u201cFight the infidels!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cFight them because they are American agents! They are Israeli agents!\u201dAnd initially, the wager paid off. The soldiers gave civilians food and medical care, helped them salvage their homes and bury their dead, brought them bottled water and shared their mobile generators (water and electricity service had been cut off). Many soldiers I knew genuinely felt for Moslawis. As one put it to me: \u201cI know you have ISIS in America. But in America, they do a bombing. Here they\u2019re killing my people every day.\u201d The Moslawis in turn opened their homes to the soldiers, cooked for them, identified collaborators and booby-\u00adtraps. The interactions were often very touching to watch, especially because most of the soldiers were from elsewhere and were Shiites, while most Moslawis were Sunnis. Mosul\u2019s was an oddly civil battle, in the best sense of the term. This despite the soldiers\u2019 knowledge that many of the locals had abided ISIS, and very possibly had done more. You could call it a suspension of disbelief, but the deeper impulse may have been a certain national preference for forgiveness. \u201cYou can\u2019t take vengeance for everything bad someone\u2019s ever done to you in Iraq,\u201d one scholar told me. \u201cIf you did, everyone would be dead.\u201dThe generals\u2019 strategy also meant that in order to protect civilians, the operation had to move slowly. The troops methodically inched their way westward, causing as little damage as possible. Tanks and mortars were rare. Every airstrike was cleared through the high command and coalition.In November, in the Tahrir neighborhood, north of Zahra, I spent a night with a special-\u00adforces assault team in a commandeered house behind an avenue that was then the front line. The house was small, and the soldiers slept side by side, head to foot. The closest ISIS position was maybe a hundred feet away, but the night was quiet, and the men awoke in good spirits. They gathered around a gas burner on the floor to warm themselves and fry a pan of eggs, which they scooped up with pieces torn from circular loaves of flatbread. One man lovingly prepared a hookah, while another put on a trilby hat and scarf. I asked if he had found them in the house.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take another person\u2019s clothing,\u201d he said, sounding almost insulted. He carried the accessories in his rucksack. This was his morning leisure wear.\u201cI screwed your sister last night,\u201d the hookah preparer said.With a firefight raging on the avenue, the team moved from house to house, looking for positions. In Ramadi or Falluja, it would have laid siege to the block. Not here. Most of the homes were still occupied by owners or families taking refuge. Some cowered in back rooms; others sat unperturbed in dens and kitchens. In one home, the team found a retired English teacher and his wife. \u201cTell them about the mosque,\u201d she said to her husband. \u201cTell them everything.\u201d\u201cIn the mosque around the corner, ISIS stored weapons,\u201d he said.They gave the team a stepladder to get them over the back wall and into an empty house facing the avenue. The soldiers quietly ascended to the roof. Ducking below the parapet, they put a hole in its base with a sledgehammer and chisel. A sniper laid on his stomach and checked his scope.Next they came to a house where five families had been holed up for days. The children \u2014 there must have been two dozen of them \u2014 sat in tidy rows in a hallway. In the next house was a family and its neighbors. A man recounted being questioned by ISIS\u2019s feared religious patrolmen. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why have you shaved?\u2019 I told them I hadn\u2019t shaved; I just can\u2019t grow a beard. They didn\u2019t believe me. They said: \u2018Are you playing with us? Who gave you permission to shave?\u2019 I told them, \u2018I swear I haven\u2019t shaved.\u2019\u2009\u201d Another man said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t even buy underwear for my wife. ISIS didn\u2019t like the pictures advertising the underwear. They said these pictures came from the devil. You couldn\u2019t buy anything \u2014 even perfume. They didn\u2019t like the perfume pictures either.\u201dThe soldiers came to the last home on the block. If they could set up in the structure behind it, on an intersection, they would have good firing lines in three directions. The front door had a deadbolt and back plate. For 15 minutes, they took turns pounding at the bolt with a sledgehammer. Hearing the ruckus, more men came in to take turns, until the entranceway was full with panting soldiers. A burly young man stepped in and, with a tremendous whack, sent the bolt flying. \u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d he said, taking his exit.Inside, they found the remnants of a hasty exit. The television had been removed from its wall mount and a display case with the family silverware turned to the wall. The refrigerator was empty save for four ramekins of pudding, as though the family had eaten a final meal but decamped before dessert.It took a half-\u00adhour for the soldiers to break through another gate and climb into the house they wanted to get to, only to find no windows onto the avenue. It was useless. As we went downstairs, an explosion rocked the earth, sending plaster to the floor and a squall of debris up the street. It had come from the special forces\u2019 part of Tahrir and was too big to have been a mortar. Outside, the distinctive billow of a car bomb rose into the sky, with its long stem and squat plume, eerily like a nuclear mushroom cloud. The blast killed a popular gunner. Another man had been felled by a sniper in front of me. There were numerous other casualties. The total ground taken by the company at the end of the day amounted to a few square blocks.At the main position, soldiers had set up a small infirmary \u2014 a pile of drugs and a stretcher \u2014 where locals came for help. Some intrepid residents had reopened a market nearby. ISIS was shelling it insistently. Adults and children perforated with shrapnel and fragment were rushed in. Others came with dormant prescriptions and headaches. A girl arrived having swallowed her chewing gum, the look of terror in her eyes worse than what I\u2019d seen in children who had been shot.An old man with a flowing white beard hobbled in carrying a death certificate, his wife\u2019s. She and their four children were killed in a shelling. Soldiers had helped him bury the bodies. He heard the government was compensating survivors. A sergeant major took the man inside to a portable printer. As he made copies of the certificate, he explained they would have to be sent to a ministry in Baghdad for approval. The man didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWill the government compensate me?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes, but father, believe me, the stamp you need is in Baghdad,\u201d the sergeant major said.\u201cPlease, I need it stamped.\u201d\u201cFather, do you think we\u2019re ISIS?\u201d another soldier said. \u201cThat we\u2019re going to kill you? We must send the certificate to Baghdad.\u201d\u201cPlease, I need your help. I\u2019m very tired. I\u2019m an old man.\u201d\u201cI swear, there\u2019s nothing more I can do for you,\u201d the sergeant major said.The attitude extended to suicide. A soldier told me about an ambush he was caught in: 35 casualties, a dozen vehicles totaled. They were pinned down overnight. He wasn\u2019t scared of dying, he said, but \u201cwas scared of them taking me alive. So I spared a bullet. I call it \u2014 we call it, all of us \u2014 the mercy bullet. When you are surrounded, you kill yourself.\u201dBy January, the troops had pushed ISIS to the Tigris. The jihadists were confined to a few last redoubts in the east. I rode to one, a neighborhood called Arabi, with a general who had the shape and tenor of an active fire hydrant. His convoy drove down a highway at the foot of a hillside. On the hilltop was a church whose large cupola had been knocked off its foundation and onto its side, somehow remaining in one piece, its vault exposed to the sky. Crowds of families walked up the highway in the opposite direction, away from Arabi. This exasperated the general. Didn\u2019t they know he was emancipating them? He waved down a family.\u201cWhy are you leaving?\u201d he demanded.\u201cEveryone else left,\u201d the father said.\u201cEveryone! Where are you all going?\u201d\u201cHadba.\u201d\u201cWell, just stay there, I suppose.\u201dThe convoy entered Arabi, an upper-\u00adclass district of recently built, free-\u00adstanding homes. On a sidewalk, in three piles, was what had once been an ISIS fighter, possibly a suicide bomber. The most recognizable section included his head, shoulders and arms. His right hand was still clenched, as though around a detonator.The general arrived at an intersection where his soldiers had gathered to celebrate. Arabi had just been officially taken, or so they had been told, though no one had told the general this, and gunfire still rang out nearby. Civilians emerged from their homes. As the general walked up the street, they embraced him and took pictures with him. A woman, her cheeks wet with tears, kissed him.\u201cGod bless you, God protect you,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe\u2019re so tired. But now we can eat comfortably.\u201d\u201cWe will raise the Iraqi flag now,\u201d her son said.\u201cWhen I first saw the soldiers, I started kissing them,\u201d his mother went on, more excited with every word. \u201cKissed all of them! I can\u2019t contain my happiness.\u201d\u201cShe did!\u201d her son said. \u201cShe even kissed their feet. I can\u2019t blame her.\u201dThe convoy pulled out of Arabi and back onto the highway, a group of officers on foot alongside it, none of them wearing protective equipment. They hadn\u2019t been moving long when a shell came in with that familiar, quick thrum. There was a blast, a hail of fragment and debris, a gust of smoke, then silence. Momentarily the air cleared. Cut down on the ground before me, quicker than seemed possible, were four perfectly dead officers.Immediately it was obvious what had happened: an ISIS informant in Arabi had seen the general, tracked him and alerted a mortar team. Perhaps the general had unknowingly spoken with the artillerist. Perhaps they\u2019d hugged.The general and his staff jumped from their vehicles and ran to the injured survivors. Another shell crashed nearby. Two ambulances sped in and loaded on three corpses. The last was laid on the hood of the general\u2019s Humvee. We followed the ambulances back up the highway, past Arabi, to a command post. The corpses were already in body bags in the courtyard. Soldiers bent over them, weeping and yelling. The general stood alone on the far side of the yard.\u201cBring a flag!\u201d wailed a kneeling man.\u201cPut it around the edges,\u201d the general instructed from across the yard when the Iraqi flag was finally brought. The folding displeased him. He marched over and neatly tucked the corners between the body bag and the stretcher.\u201cScrew these Mosul people!\u201d a soldier said.He went by Abu Omar. He was with his two daughters and was eager for information. Where would they be taken? When could they return? Journalists got these questions all the time: When Moslawis saw a foreign face, they assumed it belonged to an authority, and when they learned you were American, their expectations made you feel grandly useless. Americans could and did do anything, you were assured. Among other assumptions, they took it for granted that the United States was controlling this war, from both sides. \u201cThis was all planned 20 years ago,\u201d Abu Omar told me of the battle. \u201cAmerica planned it.\u201dI found Abu Omar, 48, and his daughters again in a camp known as Khazir, an hour\u2019s drive east of Mosul, and took to visiting them there regularly. It was in an improbably bucolic setting, on a hillside next to a river in Iraqi Kurdistan. Inside the camp, however, the atmosphere was humid with suspicion. Kurdish soldiers and agents, many of whom had fought ISIS, presided over Khazir. \u201cThey tell us, \u2018You\u2019re all ISIS,\u2019\u2009\u201d Abu Omar told me on one visit.WESTERN MOSULOld CityEASTERN MOSULKhazirTigris River2 milesHis tent was situated between a storm fence and the toilet that serviced his block \u2014 four holes in the floor for dozens of families. For washing and cooking there was a water tank with a few unenthusiastic spigots. The winter rains had begun, and there was mud everywhere. Rats roamed at night. \u201cWe thought the government would take care of us after we lived under ISIS for so long,\u201d Abu Omar said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the same crap here. It\u2019s like a jail.\u201dThere hadn\u2019t been regular water service in Mosul before he left, he said, and he hadn\u2019t prayed in months. \u201cTo pray, you must be clean. Islam is clean.\u201d But the real problem was that ISIS had soured him on the whole idea. \u201cGod forgive me for saying it, but now I don\u2019t even like to hear the call to prayer. I hate it because of them. God forgive me. On Fridays, their preaching was all instigating people to kill, to deceive one another, to pillage. This is not our religion.\u201d Suddenly his eyes brightened with that frantic laugh, and he exclaimed: \u201cWill you take me to America? Why don\u2019t you take us to America? Take me out of Iraq.\u201dAbu Omar came from a working-\u00adclass Mosul family. After being conscripted into Saddam Hussein\u2019s army in the mid-1980s, he was sent to fight in Iran. Mosul wasn\u2019t bombed in that war to the extent that Baghdad and Basra were, but it suffered in its own way: A majority of the officers\u2019 corps came from the city, many of them from Mosul\u2019s oldest families. Long before Hussein took power, the city had a formidable martial reputation.It began as a settlement around 900 B.C. on the Tigris\u2019s west bank, across from the more famous Nineveh, whose ruins Mosul now encompasses. In the ninth and eighth centuries B.C., Nineveh was one of the most populous cities in the world, archaeologists believe, in the largest empire of its day \u2014 the Assyrian \u2014 maintained by an army so fierce that God made it his \u201crod of anger\u201d to punish the wayward Israelites, according to Isaiah. To the Hebrew prophets, Nineveh was a cruel paradox of a place, the flower of iniquity and the instrument of righteousness. The Assyrians commemorated their massacres in carved reliefs whose antic violence is still unsettling to consider, not least because it prefigures ISIS\u2019s agitprop by 3,000 years. God would eventually lay waste the Assyrians too, of course. \u201cEven today,\u201d the historian John Robertson writes, the biblical picture \u201cshapes our views of Iraq as a place cursed by history.\u201dAfter the Assyrians passed from power, Mosul found itself wedged between the Roman and Parthian Empires, then Byzantium and Persia, then Turkey and Iran. Home to all the Abrahamic religions, Mosul was also sanctuary to their precursors and persecuted offshoots: Zoroastrians, Yazidis, Christian schismatics, Jews, Sufi Muslims and various mystics and heretics unwelcome elsewhere. Governed at different times by Sunni and Shiite caliphs, Mosul was on the fault line of Islam, though even religiously conservative Moslawis are proud of their city\u2019s history of diversity. Abu Omar told me, \u201cI am a Muslim, but my neighbors were Christian, and I never saw any harm from them.\u201dThey\u2019re also proud of Mosul\u2019s history of resistance to the Ottoman Empire and to Baghdad. The British diplomat Gertrude Bell wrote in 1911, \u201cMosul has always been against the government, whatever form it should happen to assume.\u201d Mosul was one major Iraqi city never to erect a statue of Hussein, according to longtime residents. Bell\u2019s colleague Mark Sykes, an author of the Sykes-\u00adPicot Agreement, which carved up the Levant to the specifications of the British and French Empires, was less charitable. He found Moslawis \u201cready to riot and slay for the sake of fanaticism as long as there is no danger.\u201dAfter Iran, Abu Omar was sent to Kuwait. He didn\u2019t agree with that war but didn\u2019t dare disobey. He was terrified of Hussein, it went without saying, but that was nothing compared with the terror to follow. When the Americans deposed the Iraqi president, he said, \u201cwe felt happy. But if we had known things would turn this way, of course we would have wished to stay under him.\u201dIn 2005, Abu Omar\u2019s wife was kidnapped. Her body was found in a street in another neighborhood. He believes she was killed by militants, though accidentally. Before finding a job as a security guard at a cellular tower, he did not have regular work, and unable to feed his children, he put them in an orphanage.\u201cThey\u2019ve only known war and destruction,\u201d he said. His daughter Amina, now 12, was anemic, and, he added \u2014 lowering his voice, though not so low that anyone could miss what he said \u2014 \u201cAya has a mental disorder.\u201d Aya, a sweet-\u00adnatured girl who at 13 looked both older and younger than her age, did not seem to outward appearances to suffer from anything worse than painful shyness; she looked down at her folded knees as her father said this. As for the 18-year-old Omar, his father went on, while he might look big \u2014 he was a mass of undeveloped bulk \u2014 he had \u201cthe brain of a child.\u201d Omar, who had been in the corner of the tent praying, smiled mildly. This obviously was not the first time Abu Omar had insulted his son in front of a stranger.Omar arrived in the camp two weeks after the rest of his family. He was detained by the special forces after they retook Zahra, Abu Omar told me \u2014 pro forma for young Sunni men. \u201cThe ones who had some connection with ISIS, they beat them very badly and took them away,\u201d Abu Omar explained. \u201cThose who had nothing to do with them were kept for a few days, then brought here.\u201d\u201cThey blindfolded all of the guys with me, but they didn\u2019t blindfold me,\u201d Omar said boastfully. It was unclear whether he wanted to impress his father or me or both of us. \u201cI was the supervisor of all the other prisoners.\u201d\u201cBecause he was not involved with ISIS,\u201d his father repeated.Still, Abu Omar and Omar both readily admitted that they had at first welcomed ISIS. To understand this, they said, I had to understand the city\u2019s recent history. In the early years of American occupation, Mosul was safe, one of the few major cities spared looting and the early sectarian violence that tore apart Baghdad. But inevitably a militant underground coalesced. It began with former soldiers and officials \u2014 men not unlike Abu Omar \u2014 who had lost their jobs and pensions when the United States disbanded the military and tried to purge members of Hussein\u2019s Baath Party from office. They were joined by coreligionists and criminal rings, the lot of them colluding and competing over smuggling routes and extortion rackets. Ideology and criminality commingled.In 2006, Abu Musab al-\u00adZarqawi, Al Qaeda in Iraq\u2019s founder, who envisioned a modern-day caliphate in the country, was killed in an American airstrike. His followers were squeezed northward by the Sunni Awakening and the \u201csurge\u201d of American forces. Regrouping in Mosul, with a consortium of other jihadists they began referring to themselves as the Islamic State of Iraq. The city was its base and main revenue center. It co-\u00adopted and assassinated officials at all levels of the local government, courts and police force. But for all its depredations, the insurgency wasn\u2019t as despised as the national government. By 2010, most of the Iraqi soldiers patrolling the city were Shiite and not from Mosul, and they treated Sunni men as though they were all militants, jailing them and beating them. When Abu Omar crossed the city, he had to wait at checkpoints for hours. Soldiers insulted Omar routinely. They \u201cturned Mosul into a hell,\u201d Abu Omar told me.By the time ISIS activated its operatives in Mosul, in the first days of June 2014, and dispatched columns from Syria toward the city, it was theirs for the taking. Whether through anguish or pragmatism, or both, many Moslawis had come to see ISIS, barbarous as it was, as the only alternative to the government in Baghdad. \u201cReligious ideology might have been the last point of identification for many Moslawis who joined ISIS,\u201d Rasha al Aqeedi, a researcher from Mosul, told me.When ISIS arrived, \u201cthey came in as revolutionaries,\u201d Abu Omar said. \u201cOnce they took control, there were no more checkpoints, no traffic jams, no arrests of young people, no beatings,\u201d Omar added. \u201cThere was freedom.\u201d The jihadists cleaned up the city, lowered rents, collected donations for the poor. They promulgated a new city constitution, whose 16 clauses encouraged Moslawis to live peaceably, forbade the ownership of weapons and promised justice for all.Abu Omar\u2019s house was opposite the mosque from which the sniper shot at the special-\u00adforces soldiers in November. He and Omar had gone to that mosque, al-Nuaimi, every Friday for years. In all of Mosul\u2019s mosques, ISIS installed loyalist imams \u2014 some of them foreigners, some Moslawis who sided with the group. At al-Nuaimi, the imam who took over, one of the locals, called himself Abu Bakr, like ISIS\u2019s caliph, Abu Bakr al-\u00adBaghdadi. Preaching with a rifle slung on his shoulder, he exhorted the young men who flocked to him to attack their parents if they objected to jihad. As the Iraqi troops approached Mosul, he hollered from the minbar: \u201cKill the Iraqi Army! Kill whoever wears the uniform!\u201d Omar went every week. \u201cI didn\u2019t miss a sermon,\u201d he told me.The imam often had a videographer in tow. Like \u00adBaghdadi, he believed he was instrumental in history \u2014 more to the point, in the end of history. ISIS erected billboards at checkpoints outside Mosul, like states\u2019 welcome signs, reading, \u201cThe Islamic State: A Caliphate in Accordance With the Prophetic Method.\u201d The climax of the prophecy was Armageddon. ISIS was here to usher it in.\u201cDo you know what they do?\u201d Abu Omar said. \u201cThey tell you: \u2018Son, you are doing jihad for God. You will be martyred and go to heaven. There are mermaids in heaven. You will eat lunch with the Prophet.\u2019\u2009\u201dOmar frowned. To him and his friends, there had been nothing jocular about the imam. Abu Bakr was powerful, brash, unafraid to question authority. He was everything their parents \u2014 beaten down by years of hardship, humiliated, afraid of everything, it seemed \u2014 were not. The imam told Omar he was a warrior in waiting who would deliver this world from unbelief. \u201cI believed him,\u201d Omar told me. \u201cIt made sense to me.\u201dWhile Omar talked, his father kept interrupting to temper his son\u2019s confessions. Finally, Abu Omar confessed, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me, Omar might have joined them.\u201dI asked Omar if this was true. \u201cYes, if it wasn\u2019t for my father, I would have been in ISIS for sure. They could have brainwashed me.\u201d\u201cHe knows where to find me,\u201d Abu Omar grumbled. But there was something else pushing them apart: According to Abu Omar, Abu Fahad\u2019s older son had joined ISIS.Abu Fahad had the same high forehead and penetrating eyes as his brother, but his didn\u2019t laugh. Exile was a more stinging indignity to him. Trimmer and better groomed than Abu Omar, he was also cleverer, having been an army medic and then the chief nurse at a Mosul hospital. His younger son, Hamudi, was two years younger than Omar but much more mature. While Aya could barely bring herself to speak in my presence, Abu Fahad\u2019s daughter Maha wanted to discuss history and politics, religion and movies. And yet here they were, reduced to exactly the same circumstances as Abu Omar and his family.The same year that Abu Omar\u2019s wife was killed, Abu Fahad\u2019s wife was shot while they were driving in Mosul, he believes by Kurdish and American soldiers. His children were in the car. As Maha and Hamudi listened, Abu Fahad recounted to me the crash of the bullets coming through the windshield, his harried pressing on the brake pedal. He was dragged from the vehicle and beaten unconscious by the soldiers. Coming to, he found his wife\u2019s body beneath a blanket. His eldest daughter, who had watched her mother\u2019s head explode, he found in the back seat, trying to eat shards of window glass.\u201cShe went insane,\u201d Abu Fahad said. She never entirely recovered.By this point in the story, Maha was crying, while Hamudi stared fixedly at the ground.\u201cLet\u2019s change the subject, please,\u201d Abu Fahad said.When ISIS arrived in Mosul, \u201cwe were one of the families who welcomed them,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey claimed they\u2019d save us from the infidels and that they would return us to real Islam.\u201d Like most Iraqis I\u2019ve come to know who supported ISIS initially, Abu Fahad was not a zealot. He wasn\u2019t even particularly devout. He had, however, watched his country invaded and plunged into horror; his city degraded from a \u201cheaven,\u201d as he described the Mosul of his youth, to a battleground; his wife killed; himself humiliated by soldiers of the army he once nursed to health; his children denied a future. To a man in such circumstances, talk of a religious utopia, of any utopia, of any improvement of life beyond the malediction it had become, however fantastical the promises, however deranged, held a desperate appeal. \u201cThey said they would not stop until they reached Rome,\u201d he told me with a rueful grin. \u201cI thought, let\u2019s start with Baghdad, then we can talk about Rome.\u201dSounding like a resident of Washington recollecting a smooth presidential transition, he said: \u201cThey took over the city so capably. By the next morning at 10, they were driving around Mosul as though they\u2019d always been there.\u201d For a time, life went on normally. Abu Fahad stayed on at the hospital \u2014 ISIS made a point of keeping the hospitals open, along with providing other vital public services. Many public employees kept their jobs under ISIS. Others took jobs with the group \u2014 as traffic officers, court clerks, garbage collectors and so forth. To an outsider, this is unimaginable, but to Moslawis, ISIS was now the government, whether they liked it or not. They had to survive.I asked Abu Fahad about his older son, Loy. He did not know that Abu Omar had told me Loy was in ISIS. Abu Fahad conceded, \u201cHe was very religious.\u201d He\u2019d been driven to extreme devotion by his mother\u2019s death. \u201cAnd to tell you the truth, he did support their ideology.\u201d But Abu Fahad emphasized, \u201cHe didn\u2019t support their actions.\u201dThere were the public sadisms of which the world learned. Then there were the lesser-\u00adknown outrages. ISIS pilfered nearly $425 million from Mosul\u2019s Central Bank, according to a United Nations Habitat report, even as it imposed a mandatory tax for \u201ccharity\u201d on Moslawis and extorted private businesses. Construction and public-\u00adworks projects came to a standstill; factories closed, and as they did, ISIS dismantled them and shipped off their equipment for sale abroad. By 2016, the report found, as much as three-\u00adquarters of the city\u2019s industrial enterprises and a comparable share of its government infrastructure were destroyed. And that was before the coalition\u2019s bombing campaign began in earnest.When ISIS shut down the mobile-\u00adphone networks, Abu Omar lost his job. When the government in Baghdad ceased paying employees in Mosul, Abu Fahad went broke. ISIS took over grain silos, flour factories, bakeries, farms. They smuggled out millions of barrels of oil and gas, driving up prices, and seized properties of Moslawis, renting or looting them. \u201cIt\u2019s all a lie,\u201d a provincial government official I spoke with remembers thinking. \u201cWe thought the Americans were their target. But they weren\u2019t. We were their target. Our money was their target.\u201dWhen the roads into Mosul were blocked by security forces, the shops went empty. Power and water service were reduced to a few hours a day. ISIS razed historical structures, including mosques, and demolished and burned artifacts and irreplaceable books. It took over the schools, imposing its own bellicose curriculum. At Mosul University, it shut down every department except medicine and engineering. When a student I know who had been a history major asked why, he was told: \u201cWe have a new history. We have the right history.\u201dWhen we discussed ISIS, Abu Omar, like just about every Moslawi, dismissed as na\u00efve the notion that the organization might have arisen from the caldron of Iraqi history alone or that it functioned independently. It was a global conspiracy, he was certain: The government in Baghdad was of course involved, despite being Shiite-\u00addominated and ISIS\u2019s being by definition Sunni; so, too, was Saudi Arabia (the money), Turkey (the border), Iran (sheer Persian perfidy) and Israel (Jews control everything). But the conversation invariably came back to the United States.One day when we were discussing the imam Abu Bakr, I asked Omar what he liked so much about his sermons. Omar smiled sheepishly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou are our guest here, and I should respect you.\u201dI told him I wouldn\u2019t be offended.\u201cAll Americans are pigs. Filthier than pigs,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAmericans \u2014 no, he wasn\u2019t calling them Americans, he was calling them Jews \u2014 he said the Jews want to destroy Islam.\u201dAbu Omar said that, much as he disliked the imam, he had to concede the accuracy of this point. \u201cThe real founders of ISIS are America and Israel,\u201d he said.\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\u201cDo you really think America, with all its technology and strategy, with all its strength, that it couldn\u2019t defeat ISIS in a day if it wished?\u201dI told him that I thought ISIS was a very effective insurgency and that any military would struggle against it.\u201cNot the American military,\u201d he said. \u201cHow was it ISIS was even able to enter Iraq? How was it they were able to expand as they did? An American satellite can reveal what\u2019s inside your stomach. They couldn\u2019t see this? When the Americans withdrew from Iraq, they said, \u2018As soon as we leave, the country will return to chaos.\u2019\u2009\u201dHis secret history of ISIS stretched back to the 2003 invasion, then to the Persian Gulf war, then to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and arrived at the Sykes-\u00adPicot Agreement, signed in 1916. The centennial had not escaped his notice.\u201cSo you think ISIS was conceived a century ago?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, I am saying this has all been planned. I cannot explain to you how, exactly, because it\u2019s a very deep scheme. Bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than all of us. Very deep politics. But it was all planned.\u201d Sighing, he concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I know the main reason for Iraq\u2019s destruction is America.\u201dThese ideas are ubiquitous among everyday Iraqis, whose various and conflicting notions about the Islamic State\u2019s underwriters oddly mirror ISIS\u2019s own claims (\u201cFight them because they are American agents! They are Israeli agents!\u201d). They are particularly baroque among the troops. I was informed by many soldiers that the Obama administration was not just not doing enough to fight ISIS but was actively backing it. \u201cObama doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d a special-\u00adforces sergeant major told me. (The Iraqi Special Operations Forces had been trained and funded by the United States, including the Obama administration, to hunt terrorists. It used American equipment and in the battle of Mosul enjoyed on-\u00addemand American air and artillery support.) \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like us.\u201d A comrade agreed, \u201cObama supports ISIS.\u201d Other soldiers informed me that they had seen American aircraft dropping supplies to ISIS. And almost every soldier I spoke with after the American presidential election claimed to eagerly await Donald Trump. Some hoped he would attack ISIS, others Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, all of them.\u201cObama smashed Iraq,\u201d Abu Omar said. \u201cAnd Trump? Trump will not leave any humans alive in the universe.\u201d He held the two men in almost equal disdain. \u201cI only like Trump because he might screw Iran.\u201dIraqis looked forward to an American president who fit their idea of one, which as far as I could make out meant a belligerent, imperious white man. Trump\u2019s statements about Muslims didn\u2019t bother them. They were going to be mistreated by any American leader, they figured. At least Trump was open about it.The combat on the west side of Mosul commenced in early March with a bad omen \u2014 a flock of them. ISIS engineers had figured out how to rig grenades and mortar rounds to the undersides of their drones with a catching mechanism that connected to the drone\u2019s headlamps. When the pilot turned on the lights, the munition armed and released. As troops made their way into the outskirts, enemy quadcopters swarmed over them, dropping the small bombs. The coalition devised a way to sabotage the drones electronically, and by the middle of the month, the troops had breached the southernmost neighborhoods.It had taken them three months to capture the east side, which was damaged, of course, but not overwhelmingly. Within a few weeks of operations in the west, it was clear that the damage here would be vastly worse. Already whole neighborhoods were leveled. ISIS had always been less popular in the east, Mosul\u2019s more diverse half. The west was where Sunni discontent had run the highest, where Al Qaeda had been the strongest and where ISIS, it knew all along, would make its last stand. \u201cAny creature, when you corner it, gets more aggressive,\u201d a special-\u00adforces major told me. \u201cThey know they\u2019re going to die.\u201dThe destruction was all the more upsetting because the west was not just home to a majority of Moslawis but to the city\u2019s past. Aside from the ruins of Nineveh, the east had been built up mostly since the Baathist era. The west, however, contained mosques, shrines, churches and monasteries dating back to at least the eighth century A.D., museums and libraries and the Old City, with the historical centerpiece of Al Nuri Grand Mosque. The mosque was supposedly the work of Nur al-Din, who repelled the Christians of the Second Crusade. It was Nur al-Din who reportedly inspired Abu Musab al-\u00adZarqawi to conceive of the Islamic State, and it was at the Grand Mosque that his successor, Abu Bakr al-\u00adBaghdadi, proclaimed himself its caliph. The mosque\u2019s famous leaning minaret could be seen from around the west side, overlooking every skirmish, pulling jihadist and the soldier alike toward it like true north on a compass. Not until the minaret fell \u2014 and the combatants knew it would have to fall, by one hand or the other \u2014 would the battle be done.To meet ISIS\u2019s redoubled aggression, pressure from the air was increased. American \u00adApaches and Iraqi Hind helicopters now menaced the jihadists constantly, the roar of their guns and cannons, which poured down thousands of rounds a minute, seeming to tear the sky asunder. ISIS in turn stepped up its attacks on civilians.WESTERN MOSULEASTERN MOSULMosul JididehKhazirTigris River2 milesOne morning, soldiers were overseeing food distribution in the newly retaken Mosul Jidideh, a pleasant area of narrow tree-\u00adlined streets, plazas and old homes in the center of the west side. A crowd of a few hundred gathered. On a side street opposite the food trucks, a mother who fled the fighting with her children had moved into an abandoned house. Outside it, she and her two sons had set up a small grocery.Predictably, ISIS learned of the distribution almost as soon as it started. A shell came in, hitting the grocery. The crowd bolted. Out of the smoke-\u00adfilled street, civilians carried a soldier, a hole in his leg gushing blood. He was lifted into a Humvee and rushed off. A man, conscious but the color of death, his chest a confusion of entry wounds, was laid on the curb. Beside him was set down a boy whose injury was unapparent but whose face suggested something dreadful.A flatbed truck raced up. The less-\u00adwounded climbed in. As the boy was handed up, his insides spilled from a gash in his abdomen. By the time the man was lifted, he was dead.He was the eldest son of the family in the abandoned house. Solitary tomatoes and torn bags of chips surrounded the shell crater. His mother stood in the doorway of the house, screaming, her daughters in the kitchen behind her sobbing. The doorstep had pooled with her son\u2019s blood. Her younger son stumbled in, ranting and pulling at his hair. He cursed the army. First his father, a bystander, was killed, now his brother. His mother begged him to lower his voice.\u201cLet them hear it!\u201d he said. \u201cLet them hear it!\u201dHe crumpled on the doorstep, hyperventilating, his feet in the blood.It was a terrible cycle. The more Moslawis were killed, the more they blamed not ISIS but the soldiers for bringing this war upon them. And the more soldiers were killed, the more they came to suspect ordinary Moslawis were colluding with ISIS in the fight (\u201cScrew these Mosul people!\u201d). The inevitable breakdown of the strategy of encouraging civilians to stay, it came to a head in mid-\u00adMarch, when a coalition airstrike resulted in the deaths of more than 100 civilians in Mosul Jidideh. A Pentagon investigation found that the strike hit an ISIS explosives cache, but by the time the report was released, the damage had been done.There was no doubt that some soldiers, maybe many, did not heed the orders to protect civilians. In early March, as the troops surrounded the Old City, I spent an afternoon with a unit of infantrymen who had just taken a stately old rail station, in the process shooting it to bits. Now they were trying to dislodge a nearby contingent of enemy fighters. Not as well funded as the special forces, they had to improvise much of their equipment. They had fortified their personnel carrier with sandbags, fastening them to the vehicle\u2019s sides with chicken wire. Their prize possession was a multilaunch system consisting of a trio of immense handmade tubes welded onto the back of a Humvee.The men parked the Humvee with its hood facing vaguely toward ISIS. A tail fuse was lit. From a tube launched a rusty projectile the length of a man and the width of an elm trunk. It hurtled in a high arc, spinning like a poorly thrown football, and landed a few blocks away with a dismal rumble. Four of these bombs were launched, each time an officer yelling, \u201cBlasting in the name of the Prophet!\u201d It was unclear whether he was serious or glib, but it was clear that if there were civilians near the detonations, there was little chance they were alive. I asked the officer how the aiming was done.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you shouting about this and saying bad things.\u201dSeveral days after the incident in Mosul Jidideh, I was with soldiers sitting in their Humvee, listening to a local call-in radio show. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing about what\u2019s happening there makes me very sad,\u201d a caller said to the host. \u201cMay God be with you and protect you. I hope ISIS all dies and burns in hell. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to destroy an entire neighborhood because of one ISIS dog. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not acceptable. Ten thousand people are dying because of this. They\u2019re making a second Aleppo in Mosul.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, it has become another Aleppo,\u201d the host said. \u201cHouses are destroyed. The city is destroyed. This is very bad politics. It\u2019s a very bad plan if they want to restore Mosul.\u201dThe sergeant, whose name was Salam, wasn\u2019t overly interested. Nor was the son, Idris, whose expression suggested that this was only the latest in a yearslong litany of paternal complaint. \u201cYesterday the minister announced that those who worked for ISIS but did not bloody their hands will be forgiven,\u201d the father told Salam. \u201cI swear, he has not done anything bad. If he had, I wouldn\u2019t have turned him in. I would have helped him escape.\u201dSalam asked Idris if what his father said was true. Idris said it was. He had been a student but dropped out when ISIS took over his school and went to work at his uncle\u2019s tea shop. The religious patrolmen shut it down because of the hookahs.\u201cDid you take the job because you needed the money?\u201d Salam asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Idris said. \u201cTo buy a motorcycle.\u201dI was the only person who laughed at this. \u201cHe\u2019s a young man,\u201d the father said. Salam nodded. A young man, a motorcycle, obviously. But, his father went on, he didn\u2019t want Idris riding a motorcycle, and while he liked that his son was motivated to work, he certainly didn\u2019t want him working for ISIS. Salam nodded again. And if that weren\u2019t enough, Idris had informed his boss in ISIS of his father\u2019s contempt for the group.\u201cHe told them I didn\u2019t like them,\u201d the father said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they jailed me and beat me.\u201dAn audience of locals had gathered, and it murmured disapprovingly at this. But when Idris and his father agreed that whatever else their faults, ISIS had taken sanitation very seriously, the audience murmured in agreement.\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Salam said to Idris. \u201cDid you join ISIS because you fought with your father?\u201dIdris shrugged. \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThis is what happened in Mosul \u2014 every kid who fought with his dad joined ISIS,\u201d Salam said. \u201cWell, if he didn\u2019t do anything bad, he can just go.\u201dAnother soldier named Ibrahim intervened. \u201cSo you were only a garbage man?\u201d he said to Idris. \u201cYou could have at least been a fighter.\u201d He stepped behind Idris and belligerently caressed his neck with one hand. With the other he dangled over Idris\u2019s shoulder an adjustable wrench. It was small but he turned it in his palm and retracted and clamped the jaw in such a way to suggest it held torturous possibilities. The boy\u2019s eyes went wide.\u201cIbrahim, have you become an investigator?\u201d Salam said.\u201cHow do we know if his file is clean?\u201d Ibrahim said. \u201cWhat if later we find there\u2019s more to it?\u201d\u201cIf we take in everyone who\u2019s worked with ISIS at some point,\u201d Salam said, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to take in all Mosul.\u201dRegretting his decision, Idris\u2019s father repeated that he was certain his son had done nothing wrong. It was too late. Idris was taken inside and patted down. In a bedroom in the back of the house, his ankles and wrists were tied, and he was pressed to the floor.An intelligence officer arrived with Idris\u2019s father, who looked dejected and yet still annoyed with Idris. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying your son hasn\u2019t done anything and that you\u2019re turning him in just for being a garbage man? This makes no sense.\u201d And to Idris: \u201cLet me give you some advice. Just be honest with us. Tell us everything. If you don\u2019t tell us the whole story now, and we find other sources who tell us more, you know what will happen? You\u2019ll just be killed and tossed in the street with the rest of ISIS.\u201dOver the course of the afternoon, locals filed in to size up the captive. Idris looked up at them blankly and they down at him unimpressed. Ibrahim and a younger, gentler soldier walked in and out, addressing Idris with threats and placations. It turned into a vaudevillian good-cop-bad-cop routine. The gentle soldier brought Idris a Styrofoam container of rice and tomato sauce and untied his wrists. Idris refused to eat.\u201cAnimal! If he tells you eat, you eat! Drink, you drink!\u201d Ibrahim yelled. \u201cIf one of us tells you to throw yourself into a fire, you do it.\u201d\u201cListen, we\u2019re not telling you to jump in a fire,\u201d the gentle soldier said. \u201cWe\u2019re just telling you to eat.\u201d\u201cThis animal here, we tell him to eat, and he won\u2019t. Son of a donkey! Animal! Son of a sheep!\u201dAnother soldier came in and said: \u201cImagine if you get married one day and have kids, and your son goes and does something like you\u2019ve done. How would you feel?\u201dIdris ate. After lunch, Ibrahim took a nap on the bed across from him. When he awoke, Idris said he wanted to pray. \u201cOf course, now you want to pray! If I were you and had decided to join ISIS, I would have at least worked in a supermarket, something that would have fed me. Not a garbage man. They\u2019re garbage, and you were their garbage man. Garbage and garbage. How did you come up with that? What\u2019s the matter, your head isn\u2019t clear? Let me clear it for you.\u201dIbrahim slapped Idris.\u201cIs it clear now?\u201d\u201cI swear I\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Idris whimpered.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the gentle soldier said, \u201cit will be all right.\u201dAfter 12 hours, he was untied and taken into the sitting room. The soldiers had tired of baiting him. Everyone ate dinner and watched the Formula One film \u201cRush.\u201dIdris was lucky. Sometimes captives were held for trial, but many commanders subscribed to a policy of summary execution. A major I met had trained as an attorney; when the war was over, he wanted to practice human rights law. He killed men he believed to be ISIS members on sight. When I asked how he squared the two, he explained that ISIS had forfeited their human rights.\u201cIt\u2019s true we have human rights here and that sometimes terrorists get trials, but ISIS doesn\u2019t deserve anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey kill innocents at every opportunity.\u201dI offered no rejoinder to the major, who was later killed.\u201cFor me, I love helping people \u2014 I have a good heart,\u201d another major, whom I came to know well and like a lot, told me. \u201cBut I feel no mercy for a jihadi. I hate their existence.\u201dThe previous day, a local family who was fleeing had taken a man to him. The man had tried to hide among them as they left, they explained. He was an ISIS fighter from the neighborhood. They knew him, but they weren\u2019t going to protect him.\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d I asked.\u201cWe took him off and shot him,\u201d the major said.In fact, the corpse was in a yard across the street from where we talked. He took me there. Lying on his back, his legs bent high like a frog\u2019s, was a very short man with a sleek beard in a white shirt and black combat fatigues. His face was blackened with necrosis, and flies gathered in the hole where the occipital bone of his skull once was.\u201cI was looking right at him, and he was not scared,\u201d the major said. \u201cEveryone has this thing inside of them, a threshold of fear. I could not find his.\u201dI asked a soldier what he would do after the battle. \u201cGo to Hawija, I guess, or Tal Afar,\u201d he said, referring to ISIS\u2019s last strongholds in Iraq. \u201cWhen you sign the contract, you sign up to die.\u201d There was a weariness in his voice that stretched beyond those places, however, beyond the inevitable official victory over ISIS. Like everyone else, he knew the insurgency wouldn\u2019t disappear. It would go underground, as Al Qaeda had done, and wait for another political or sectarian crisis. The wait probably wouldn\u2019t be long. Just as the palimpsest of past wars could be seen below this one, so the signs of wars to come could be read around Iraq now. Shiite militias were trying to take control of what had been Sunni lands, including around Mosul. Sunni tribal militias were expanding in response. The Kurdish pesh merga were preparing to defend the territory they occupied while fighting ISIS.The conversation came around to President Trump, who was trying to ban Iraqis from entering the United States. \u201cBefore he came into office, I knew he didn\u2019t like Muslims,\u201d another man said. \u201cBut I thought he\u2019d take care of the nasty Muslims. Instead, he came for us.\u201dAt dawn, I stood in a group of about 40 soldiers on a sloped street that looked down onto the Old City, over a vista of collapsed buildings and punctured domes, across the Tigris and beyond to the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. It was a clear, warm day \u2014 summer was at hand \u2014 and the leaning minaret of the Grand Mosque was directly ahead, set against the peaks. Black smoke rose from ISIS\u2019s car fires, and the gunfire was already steady.The streets were barren: The combat had been so bitter, the bombing so extensive, that more than 750,000 people would eventually flee the western part of the city, according to the Iraqi government. Every day you could see miles-\u00adlong columns of families heading south.Leading the soldiers was a major I saw carried into a medical station months earlier with a bullet in his thigh. He had recuperated and returned to service. He marched his men onto a long commercial avenue, a picture of ruin. The shops and office buildings looked as though they had simply given up, spilling themselves onto the street. Not a soul was in sight. The pavement in every direction was deeply cratered. The soldiers climbed over rubble piles. It felt as though we were moving through the remains of some bygone civilization. They came to a small clearing with a chicken coop. Somehow, the animals were still alive.\u201cJihadist chickens,\u201d a soldier said.A rooster followed the men as they moved on, hopping with them through a crater and cuckooing inquiringly. They moved toward an intersection. A sniper started shooting. Across the avenue, a group of civilians had emerged from the rubble and were trying to flee. In this lifeless landscape, they looked as out of place as the birds. They climbed down into an immense crater. The last in the group was an old man. He stopped in the crater\u2019s nadir and gazed up helplessly. The group moved on until a young man looked behind him. He rushed to the crater, climbed down, folded the old man over his shoulder and carried him out. The major watched with relief.His men took up a position in a house. The sniper shot steadily. He had a direct line on the house. As we stood inside, he put rounds into the facade. A request for air support was radioed in.\u201cScrew that sniper, screw Baghdadi, screw ISIS,\u201d a soldier said.\u201cI\u2019m fine with liberating Iraq,\u201d another said. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll send us to Syria with the Americans.\u201dA helicopter flew overhead, and the reassuring din of its guns filled the sky. The men relaxed.We had been back on the sloped street for a short time when the air trembled and the distinctive mushroom cloud of a car bomb rose high above the roofs. What sounded like a firefight ensued. Rushing to the scene, we found that the bomb had ignited a command post with an ammunition cache. The cook-off lasted for almost 20 minutes, sending thousands of rounds flying into the nearby houses.When we could finally approach, we saw, on top of a wall, the car\u2019s chassis. The houses\u2019 fronts were pitted and splattered in motor oil. On the pavement were pieces of the suicide driver.Several Humvees were in flames. A man lay near them, dead, decomposing in the heat. Two young men came around a corner and walked apprehensively toward the scene. At the same time, two military medics, still in their scrubs, approached from the other direction. One carried a pistol in a shoulder holster.\u201cGet back!\u201d a medic yelled at the men.The two civilians kept coming. The unarmed medic reached over to his friend\u2019s holster, wrenched the pistol from it, racked the chamber and aimed.\u201cGet back!\u201d he yelled again, and the young men retreated.When the medics had gone, they re-\u00ademerged. One walked toward the flames. He was crying. Even from a distance, through the smoke, he could tell that the man lying by the fire was their father.\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he moaned, turning back toward his brother. His brother took him by the arm, and slowly they walked to the body. They laid a blanket on the ground and attempted to lift their father onto it. Trying to take an arm, a brother came away instead with a long strip of skin.They finally wrapped up their father. A soldier joined them and took up a corner of the grim package. Together, they carried it home.On a morning a few weeks before they left the camp, Abu Omar asked Omar to fetch some water. Omar flew into a rage. Taking hold of a rock, he smashed his father in the head. As Amina screamed, and men rushed over to hold Omar back, Aya ran to the office where Kurdish agents worked. There she blurted out everything the family had tried to keep from their neighbors in the camp, and from me: Omar had, in fact, been in ISIS.When I arrived, Abu Omar\u2019s head was wrapped in a bandage. The gash had required stitches. Omar had been taken away. Abu Omar somberly apologized for hiding the truth from me. He was just trying to protect his son, he explained.Aya was not somber. For once she wanted to talk. For years Omar had been violent, she said. It began at the orphanage. When the children returned home, Abu Omar took to beating his son and treating him like a half-wit. Abu Omar tried to silence her, but Aya kept talking. In the years before ISIS arrived, Omar had grown bigger and stronger, his anger uncontrollable. He began beating his father and sisters. When ISIS took Mosul, Omar grew enthralled with the group, thanks to the imam Abu Bakr and their cousin Loy, Abu Fahad\u2019s son. One day Omar came home in a uniform, carrying a rifle. He disappeared for weeks at a time. He traveled to Syria, Aya believed. He threatened his father and sisters with death. \u201cI\u2019ll behead you right here in our home,\u201d he would tell them. Aya and her father argued about how long Omar had been in ISIS. He claimed it was only two months. Aya insisted it was seven. \u201cWhy are you revealing your brother like this?\u201d he said to her in a lowered voice, thinking I would not catch it.\u201cDo you know what you should do with a son like Omar?\u201d Aya went on. \u201cKill him. Just kill him.\u201dWhen I went to see Abu Fahad in the camp afterward, I found him alone. Hamudi, Abu Fahad told me, had likewise been taken away by Kurdish intelligence agents. He had also joined the jihadists. Abu Fahad didn\u2019t know how long Hamudi was with them or what exactly he\u2019d done, but it was obvious who had helped Hamudi, a more thoughtful and cautious young man than Omar, overcome his doubts about the group: his older brother, Loy. Abu Fahad apologized, too. I told him I understood.Loy had been with the Islamic State since long before it took Mosul. He had probably been with Al Qaeda before that. Loy was now fighting in western Mosul, against the Iraqi troops, Abu Fahad knew. They talked often by phone. Loy was certain he would die there.\u201cWhen we spoke last, he said, \u2018Dad, you have to forget about me,\u2019\u2009\u201d Abu Fahad told me. \u201cMaybe if the American troops capture him, he\u2019ll have a chance. But not if the Iraqi troops do.\u201dOn July 9, the Iraqi government declared victory in Mosul. The west side of the city lay in ruins. The comparisons to Aleppo, which had once seemed exaggerated, were now obvious. A Pentagon spokesman called Mosul \u201cthe most significant urban combat since World War II.\u201d In late June, ISIS had blown up Al Nuri Grand Mosque. The centuries-\u00adold minaret tumbled to the ground.A few days after it came down, Abu Fahad was sent a video of Loy. He had been captured by the Iraqi federal police. In the video, Loy is shirtless, bloodied, filthy, his head shaved and beard chopped. His hands are tied behind his back, and he is sitting in the dirt, being questioned. Abu Fahad learned from a neighbor that shortly after the video was taken, his son was executed.When I last saw Abu Fahad, he showed me a photo Loy had sent him by text message. It was of Abu Fahad\u2019s 3-year-old granddaughter, Loy\u2019s daughter, Zainab. She had spent most of her short life in the Islamic State. There was a good chance she would die in it. If she didn\u2019t, she would grow up without her father, probably without her mother, probably in the midst of another war. She was so beautiful I couldn\u2019t bear to look at her. I handed the phone back to him.Opening video sequence by Gabriel Chaim.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Other Big Export: Pollution", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsAll of this is laudable and sorely needed. But if China truly wants to be a climate leader it needs to address its global climate footprint, not just pollution within its borders.China\u2019s lending in Latin American and Caribbean countries provides a telling example of how the country has outsourced its emissions.In the Brazilian Amazon, China has committed significant funding, through development financing and direct investment by state-run companies, for the Brazilian government\u2019s efforts to construct a new commodities corridor through the Amazon basin, facilitating the expansion of industrial agribusiness into remote, pristine rain forest.This kind of investment in Brazil also empowers the country\u2019s powerful agribusiness lobby, known as the ruralistas. President Michel Temer\u2019s administration has advanced the ruralistas\u2019 goal of dismantling environmental safeguards by essentially providing a rubber stamp for even more dirty energy projects in places like the Amazon.Such concern is well placed. In Nicaragua, Ecuador and Peru, community protests against Chinese operations have led to the killings of local residents, imposition of states of emergency and legal actions against Chinese companies.China should approach its international projects with the same concern for the environment that its starting to show at home. Beijing should refrain from supporting extraction in areas of global ecological importance, and instead heavily invest in clean, renewable energy projects.

{"Headline": "\u2018Minecraft: The Island\u2019 Blurs the Line Between Fiction and Gaming", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe protagonist of Max Brooks\u2019s new fantasy novel doesn\u2019t have a name, a gender or even normal human appendages. Instead of hands, the narrator has clumsy, flesh-toned cubes, just one more weird feature of the strange and unsettling world where the story unfolds, where everything \u2014 the sun, clouds, cows, mushrooms, watermelons \u2014 is composed of squares.For the uninitiated, the setting may seem bizarre and disorienting, but Mr. Brooks isn\u2019t writing for novices or lay readers. He\u2019s writing for a very particular tribe: die-hard devotees of the video game Minecraft.\u201cMinecraft: The Island,\u201d which was released this month by the science fiction and fantasy publisher Del Rey, represents an unusual experiment in multiplatform brand extension. It marks the first officially sanctioned novel commissioned by Mojang, the Swedish game studio behind Minecraft, as the company seeks new ways to capitalize on the game\u2019s enormous popularity. (To eliminate any doubt about the company\u2019s consent, Mojang\u2019s name and logo appear twice on the book\u2019s cover, which bears the bland endorsement, \u201cMojang Official Product.\u201d)Unlike most video and computer games, Minecraft doesn\u2019t have clear-cut objectives or levels to ascend. Instead, it\u2019s more like an elaborate digital Lego set that allows players to build whatever they like, designing their own castles, skyscrapers, underground bunkers and booby traps.The open-ended nature of the game is a big part of its appeal. Since its release in 2011, Minecraft has sold more than 122 million copies and now has 55 million active monthly users. The game\u2019s user base exploded so rapidly that in 2014, Microsoft bought the company for $2.5 billion.\u201cWe had been thinking about fiction for a long time but wanted to make sure that it didn\u2019t take away from people\u2019s experience of the game, because everyone plays in a different way,\u201d said Lydia Winters, Mojang\u2019s brand director.But commissioning a brand-approved Minecraft novel posed unique creative and commercial challenges. How do you create a story with a beginning, a middle and an end out of an open-ended game? And would gamers bother to pick up a nearly 300-page novel about Minecraft, when they could be spending their free time playing it?Mr. Brooks \u2014 a cheerful, enthusiastic paranoiac who is obsessed with survival strategies, zombies, apocalyptic scenarios and plagues \u2014 wrote the story as a first-person, Robinson Crusoe-esque narrative, featuring an initially hapless character who is stranded on a strange island and has to build shelter, find food and fight off zombies and giant spiders, all features that exist in the game.When Mojang approached him to write a Minecraft novel in fall 2015, Mr. Brooks already had a track record as a best-selling author. The son of the actor Mel Brooks and the actress Anne Bancroft, Max Brooks turned to fiction after a brief and unremarkable career in comedy writing, which included a stint as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dAfter he was fired from the show, he started writing chillingly realistic zombie fiction and found his calling. Two of his previous books, \u201cWorld War Z\u201d and \u201cThe Zombie Survival Guide,\u201d have collectively sold more than 3.5 million copies, and \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d a faux oral history about the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, was adapted into a feature film starring Brad Pitt.Other successful authors might have brushed off an invitation to write a video game tie-in novel, an unabashedly commercial genre that some say amounts to little more than elaborate product placement. But Mr. Brooks happens to be an avid Minecraft player and jumped at the opportunity. He was determined to write a story that mirrored the experience of playing the game. He developed a plot that conformed to the Minecraft universe so closely that someone reading the book could recreate the narrative within the game and play along.\u201cI war-gamed out everything,\u201d Mr. Brooks said in a recent interview from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cMy biggest fear was that somebody tries to play out my book and finds out it won\u2019t work.\u201dIn the process, he may have also created a strange new entertainment category, one that hovers somewhere between fan fiction, role-playing games and literature \u2014 a novel set in a game, that can itself be played within the game.Publishers have been releasing novels based on popular video games for decades, hoping to capture a slice of the medium\u2019s huge fan base. Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, has published fictional series based on games like Halo, Doom and World of Warcraft, and has millions of copies of its video game tie-in novels in circulation. Other publishers have built fictional franchises based on games like Gears of War, Starcraft, BioShock and Tomb Raider.\u201cEspecially with teenage boys, it\u2019s one of the only ways we can get them to read,\u201d said Keith Clayton, the associate publisher at Del Rey.Mr. Brooks, 45, began playing Minecraft five years ago, after a family friend showed him how the game worked. He began playing regularly with his son, who is now 12, and was immediately sucked in by the creative possibilities of the game.When Mojang asked if he would be interested in writing a Minecraft novel, Mr. Brooks was so enthusiastic that he wrote a full draft before his contract was even completed. For the most part, Mojang gave him freedom to write the story however he wanted. The company\u2019s only instructions had to do with the protagonist\u2019s physical appearance.\u201cThey were very hands off when it came to the story, but very hands on when it came to inclusiveness,\u201d he said.Mojang wanted to make sure that any Minecraft player could pick up the novel and imagine himself or herself in it. The company even commissioned two different versions of the audiobook, one by a female narrator, Samira Wiley, and another by a man, the actor Jack Black, so that listeners can choose a narrator of either gender.Keeping the character\u2019s identity ambiguous wasn\u2019t too hard: Because the hero is stranded alone on an island, with only animals and other ghoulish creatures to talk to, Mr. Brooks was able to avoid using gendered pronouns.Mr. Brooks concedes that the novel, which is geared toward 8- to 12-year-olds, might not hold much appeal for those who are unfamiliar with the game.The plot was created for players, and perhaps parents and grandparents who want to understand the game\u2019s appeal, Mr. Brooks said.Above all, though, Mr. Brooks wrote it to satisfy his own creative impulses.\u201cHonestly, at the end of it all, I wrote it for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a fan first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Of the top talent hired or promoted in the past three years, he said, more than 60 percent were women.Mr. Hall said the BBC had set a \u201crough target\u201d that called for 15 percent of its highest paid stars to be of minority backgrounds by 2020; of those hired or promoted in the last few years, nearly 20 percent belong to minorities.Critics were not satisfied.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Newest Intellectual Antihero", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAfter the German historian Rolf Peter Sieferle took his own life last September at age 67, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the country\u2019s progressive paper of record, called his erudition \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d For three decades Mr. Sieferle had applied the old traditions of German social science to new preoccupations, from ecological sustainability to social capital. He was among the pioneers of German environmental history. He wrote on Marx, German conservatism around World War I and the end of Communism. He advised Angela Merkel\u2019s government on climate change.But last month, a posthumous collection of Mr. Sieferle\u2019s observations on Germany\u2019s political culture, \u201cFinis Germania\u201d (the title plays on a phrase meaning \u201cthe end of Germany\u201d), hit No. 9 on the prestigious Nonfiction Book of the Month list \u2014 and a scandal erupted. Certain passages on Germany\u2019s way of dealing with the Holocaust horrified reviewers. Die Zeit called it a book of \u201cbrazen obscenity.\u201d The Berliner Zeitung wrote of Mr. Sieferle\u2019s \u201cintellectual decline.\u201d S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung retracted its earlier praise. The Nonfiction Book of the Month list was suspended until further notice.The book-buying public reacted otherwise. As critical anger rose, so did sales. Soon the book was selling 250 copies an hour, according to its publisher, and ranked No. 1 on Amazon\u2019s German best-seller list, a position it held for almost two weeks, until the publisher ran out of copies.What exactly had Mr. Sieferle said? Was this a betrayal of his intellectual legacy, as critics claimed? A vindication of it, as his sales suggested? Or had he simply gone off the rails at a time when public opinion was doing the same?A socialist in his youth like most German intellectuals of the 1968 generation, Mr. Sieferle was drifting out of sync with that tradition by the 1990s. He came increasingly to aim his sarcasm at na\u00efve idealists. At the height of Germany\u2019s refugee crisis two summers ago, he wrote, \u201cA society that can no longer distinguish between itself and the forces that would dissolve it is living morally beyond its means.\u201d The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described him as \u201cembittered, humorless, ever more isolated.\u201dMr. Sieferle, who had once placed his books with the aristocrats of German publishing (Suhrkamp, Propyl\u00e4en, Fischer, Beck), became an outsider. \u201cFinis Germania\u201d was brought out by a small rightist press in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. Another posthumous book, \u201cDas Migrationsproblem\u201d (\u201cThe Migration Problem\u201d), which asks whether mass migration is compatible with a built-out welfare state, was published in February by a press that works with the contrarian quarterly Tumult. That book, too, is selling like hot cakes, standing around No. 250 on the German Amazon list.It is odd that \u201cFinis Germania\u201d was the book that took off. It is little more than a collection of notes on various subjects in the 1990s, some of the most controversial of which were previously published in more polished form.In \u201cFinis Germania,\u201d Mr. Sieferle rues that his own country is \u201ctragic,\u201d tangled up in history. He doesn\u2019t just rue it, he resents it. \u201cThere are un-tragic peoples,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhom history pearls off of like water from a well-polished boot.\u201d He means the English and Americans, who have always tried to pass off their oligarchies as cradles of democracy.After World War II, the Allied occupiers, as Mr. Sieferle sees it, saddled Germans with a false idea of their own history \u2014 the idea that there was something premodern about Germany, a fundamental difference between it and the West. That may describe Russia, but not Germany, and Germany\u2019s modernity is painful for Westerners to face. \u201cIf Germany belonged to the most progressive, civilized, cultivated countries,\u201d he writes, \u201cthen \u2018Auschwitz\u2019 means that, at any moment, the human \u2018progress\u2019 of modernity can go into reverse.\u201dMr. Sieferle neither denies nor minimizes the Holocaust. He describes it as a \u201cVerbrechen,\u201d or \u201ccrime.\u201d Nor does he traffic in any obvious kind of anti-Semitism. In a letter he wrote three weeks before his death to the blogger-novelist Michael Klonovsky, who is close to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, he warned the party to keep its distance from the anti-Semites (\u201ca delusional, irrational and ignorant ideology\u201d) who would inevitably gravitate to it.In this, Mr. Sieferle sees an \u201caffinity\u201d between Germans now and \u201cthe Jew as he was understood in the Christian past.\u201d Specifically, Jews were cast as either indifferent to or responsible for the crucifixion. In the eyes of today\u2019s world, German identity symbolizes a similar rejection of some kind of revelation. \u201cIn every city Christianity had built cathedrals to its murdered God,\u201d Mr. Sieferle writes. \u201cToday, the Jews, to whom God himself had promised eternity, build memorials throughout the world to their murdered coreligionists. Not only are the victims ascribed a moral superiority, the wrongdoers and their symbols are ascribed an eternal depravity.\u201dMr. Sieferle\u2019s is a complex argument. It is linked to his concern, in \u201cDas Migrationsproblem,\u201d with the challenges of mass migration. He believed that Germany\u2019s self-demonization had left it unable to say anything but yes to a million or so migrants seeking entry to Europe in 2015 and that such a welcome was unsustainable. Whether he was right or wrong, this was a concern shared by many Germans, and not necessarily an idle expression of animus.But wrested from its context, Mr. Sieferle\u2019s argument can sound thoroughly offensive. The magazine Der Spiegel summed it up as \u201cthe Germans are the new Jews.\u201d Critics have mostly denounced rather than engaged Mr. Sieferle\u2019s views. It is worth noting that if the German culture of \u201cVergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung\u201d (or \u201ccoming to terms with the past\u201d) limits open discussion, that is because it is meant to. Many Germans, who are often sincerely frightened of themselves, are grateful it did.Some are not. R\u00fcdiger Safranski, a prominent historian of philosophy, defended Mr. Sieferle\u2019s work as being in the poetic tradition of Heinrich Heine and Edward Young. The Tumult editor Frank B\u00f6ckelmann predicted on his Facebook page that as Mr. Sieferle\u2019s works come back into print, he will be acknowledged as \u201cone of the great thinkers of our time.\u201d That will depend on whether he is taken for a bigot or a courageous blasphemer.Whatever becomes of Mr. Sieferle\u2019s reputation, the scandal around him reveals certain unsuspected problems. When the German literary establishment unanimously denounced Mr. Sieferle\u2019s work as an extremist tract, readers did not nod in agreement. They pulled out their wallets and said, \u201cThat must be the book for me.\u201d This is a sign that distrust of authority in Germany has reached worrisome levels, possibly American ones.Christopher Caldwell, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, is at work on a book about the rise and fall of the post-1960s political order.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want a Job, Mate? Amazon Is Hiring Aussie Speakers", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe BreakdownSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Think you know the ins and outs of Australian English? Amazon is hiring.Though the job posting didn\u2019t get into such specifics, it\u2019s very likely to involve research for Amazon\u2019s voice-recognition device, the Amazon Echo, which helps users check the weather, stream music and plan to-do lists through a personal assistant named Alexa.The effort by the Seattle-based Amazon to hire more linguists with backgrounds outside American English may point to an acknowledgment that such systems must adapt to all types of voices if they are to appeal to multiple markets.\u201cIf people like Google, Apple and Amazon are putting money into this stuff, localization needs to be a part of it,\u201d said Simon Musgrave, a lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.Current voice-recognition software, he explained, draws from a training database of sounds and uses statistical modeling to match audio with the understanding of vowels, consonants and words.The Australian National Dictionary, a standard guide to the Australian vernacular, added 6,000 words and phrases on Tuesday, its first update since 1988. Test your knowledge of the new terms with this quiz.\u201cThey\u2019re going to need a body of recordings from Australians with good annotations\u201d that connect audio to meaning, Mr. Musgrave said.The Australian accent, for example, is distinct from American English in that it is non-rhotic \u2014 the \u201cr\u201d sound is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel sound. Australian English also has a lot of diphthongs and triphthongs \u2014 \u201cmultiple vowels within the same space,\u201d said Howard Manns, a lecturer in linguistics at Monash University.\u201cAnd that might be difficult for a computer or voice recognition to make sense of,\u201d Mr. Manns said.The software is getting better. In May, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, announced that the company\u2019s voice-recognition software had a word error rate of less than 5 percent, an improvement on the 23 percent error rate it had in 2013.Jobs that tie linguistics and technology are becoming more common.For example, Appen, a company based in Australia that collects data for machine learning for technology companies, employs more than 70 linguists and has thousands of other linguists that it can consult.Linguists annotate recordings of people speaking, down to the pauses in their voices, which are then fed into an algorithm that connects the audio with the meaning, said Phil Hall, the senior vice president of Appen\u2019s language resources.As for the Amazon listing, it\u2019s an attractive prospect for any linguist wanting to work on a cutting-edge project.\u201cI\u2019m going to apply for that job right now,\u201d Mr. Manns joked.An earlier version of this article assigned the wrong linguistic terms to the definition \u201cmultiple vowels within the same space.\u201d That definition describes diphthongs and triphthongs, not diphones and triphones. The term non-rhotic was also incompletely defined. A non-rhotic accent does not pronounce the \u201cr\u201d sound unless it is followed by a vowel sound; it is not the case that it does not pronounce the \u201cr\u201d sound at all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Family, Many Revolutions: From Black Panthers, to Silicon Valley, to Trump", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMARILLO, Calif. \u2014 For generations, the Horowitz family has cheered on the revolution.Phil and Blanche were New York schoolteachers who belonged to the Communist Party, and dreamed of a socialist heaven on earth. Their son, David, went on his first march in 1948, at age 9. As a young man in the 1960s he helped create the New Left, which pushed for the rights of the oppressed and struggled to end the Vietnam War. David worked closely with the Black Panthers, who believed a violent uprising was at hand and they would help lead it.David\u2019s youngest son, Ben, sought his fortune in Silicon Valley, a generally liberal place that traces some of its roots to the rebellious spirit of the \u201960s. Ben became a leading venture capitalist, investing billions of dollars in start-ups like Twitter and Facebook that seek to topple the status quo. His firm\u2019s investment thesis is \u201csoftware is eating the world\u201d \u2014 as disruptive a vision of the future as the old Marxist dream of the state withering away.And now David, after a political odyssey that took him from the extreme left to the extreme right, has a surprise last act that puts him once again in the thick of insurrection. His radical views on immigration, race, education, the duplicity of the media and the treachery of liberals have abruptly made their way to the center of power. If the Trump administration has an intellectual godfather, it\u2019s David Horowitz.Blacks as criminals, blacks as role models \u2014 it\u2019s hard to get further apart than this. Yet for a country that seems riven in two, the Horowitzes offer a measure of hope. They email, they talk, they get together for family celebrations. When David went to college campuses to denounce things that Ben believes in, Ben paid for his bodyguard.To understand all might not be to forgive all, but it\u2019s a start. David and Ben both said they have made a major effort to see where the other is coming from. While no one\u2019s politics have changed, they realized they are not quite as far apart as it might seem.\u201cOne thing we mostly see eye-to-eye on is that the most important thing is the ability of an individual to live his life and have an opportunity,\u201d said Ben, 51. \u201cHow he went from \u2018The way to do that is Communism\u2019 to \u2018The way to do that is Trump\u2019 is amazing.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re not aligned.\u201dDavid said he is glad he never foisted his beliefs on Ben or his other children the way Phil and Blanche\u2019s relentless adherence to the Communist doctrine pushed David into the cause long ago. If the revolution has a few less soldiers this way, so be it.\u201cI\u2019ve come to the end of the story,\u201d said David, 78. \u201cI don\u2019t mistake the life I\u2019ve lived for the only life.\u201dIt\u2019s not that simple, of course.\u201cSometimes people try to connect us on Twitter, which is always scary,\u201d said Ben. \u201cSomeone will say, \u2018Hey, aren\u2019t you related to @horowitz39?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s David\u2019s handle on Twitter, where he says things like \u201cObama is an American traitor\u201d and \u201cHillary killed four Americans in Benghazi.\u201d\u201cI never reply,\u201d Ben said.In the horse country northwest of Los Angeles, it\u2019s a glorious day. David Horowitz and his fourth wife, April, live here inside a remote gated community. There are two horses and, making a terrible racket, several dogs. Gardeners are working on the lawn.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me if they\u2019re illegal,\u201d David said with a laugh.The house is only remote physically. The computer in the other room is always calling, bringing forth updates, denunciations, the ongoing political spectacle. \u201cHow can you feel isolated when you\u2019re connected all the time?\u201d David asked.He chronicled his family\u2019s penchant for revolution in his 1997 autobiography, \u201cRadical Son,\u201d one of the most prominent of a long shelf of volumes. His first effort, \u201cStudent,\u201d about the embryonic turmoil on college campuses, appeared when Kennedy was president. In 1968, he became an editor and writer for Ramparts, the radical magazine that nurtured and reflected the era\u2019s unrest.\u201cThe system cannot be revitalized; it must be overthrown. As humanely as possible, but by any means necessary,\u201d Ramparts proclaimed in a 1970 editorial. David says he was the one who insisted on adding the \u201chumanely\u201d part.Ramparts published Che Guevara\u2019s diaries, went after the C.I.A. and offered a tutorial on how not to pay taxes. Its international editor was Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver, who fled to Cuba in 1968 after leading an ambush of Oakland, Calif., police officers. Thanks in a large part to Ramparts, the charismatic and photogenic Panthers soon embodied the notion of revolution for white radicals.David found a political soul mate in Panther leader Huey Newton. He immersed himself in the Panthers\u2019 home base of Oakland, raising money to buy a 35-classroom school that would be a showcase for the cause. Even for that freewheeling era, Ben had an unusual boyhood. It would shape his life, friendships, marriage and work. His best friend, who would later be best man at his wedding, was black. He was one of the few white kids on the Berkeley High football team. Every Sunday, he went to the Son of Man Temple, the Black Panther church in the auditorium of the school.\u201cI know all the songs from there,\u201d Ben said, and as proof, started singing the old gospel hymn adopted by the Panthers, \u201cWe are soldiers in the army \u2026\u201dDavid said: \u201cBen is practically black.\u201dBen laughed when this was repeated to him, something he does frequently when talking about his father. \u201cI hate it when my father talks, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged its broad truth.When the Panthers needed someone to keep their finances, David recommended a white friend named Betty Van Patter. In late 1974, she disappeared. A few weeks later, her body was found in San Francisco Bay. Her head had been bashed. While the murder was never officially solved, David held the Panthers responsible and said Mr. Newton confirmed it years later.The person he really blamed, however, was himself. The Panthers, he concluded, were thugs dressed up as revolutionaries, but the Left was too wrapped up in its dreams to be honest about it. David became unglued. He bought a sporty Datsun 260Z, had an affair, divorced his wife Elissa after nearly two decades of marriage and barely escaped with his life when a train smashed up the car.A photo from this era shows Ben and his two sisters perched with their father on the Datsun. David stares at the camera. Ben looks at the ground, morose.\u201cI was a very sensitive kid, supersensitive,\u201d Ben said. \u201cHe was loud and intense. Which is why I ended up spending so much time with my mom.\u201d (Elissa Horowitz declined to be interviewed for this story.)In 1976, David wrote with his friend Peter Collier his most popular book, a history of the Rockefeller family. Phil Horowitz, a believer to the end, asked his son why he wasn\u2019t writing about the revolution instead.By 1984, he was voting for Ronald Reagan.Like the sons of many prominent fathers, Ben spent a long time trying both to understand and escape his father. He studied computer science, a subject his father had no interest in, at Columbia University and then the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1990, a connection of David\u2019s helped Ben get an interview at SGI, a pioneering computer graphics company.Even the tech world, a place that celebrates straight-talking, found Ben a little too direct. \u201cEvery now and then, I had to help him better understand how to navigate,\u201d said Ken Coleman, his SGI mentor and one of the few black executives in the tech industry. SGI managers actually had a meeting about firing Ben but did not go through with it.After SGI came Netscape, the iconic internet browser company. It was here that Ben first acquired a reputation as a manager.\u201cIn Silicon Valley, people always say that an extroverted engineer is one who stares at your shoes rather than his own,\u201d said Greg Sands, a Netscape colleague. \u201cBen was an engineer, which meant he had a bit of an awkward user interface, but perhaps his life as an outsider generated empathy. He could get people to work together.\u201dAt Netscape, Ben met his future business partner, Marc Andreessen. They went on to start a data storage company called Loudcloud, which had many near-death experiences before it was successfully sold to Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion in 2007.As Ben became more successful, he eclipsed his father.David spent much of his energy attacking universities, which he considered hotbeds of misguided leftist thought. During one campus visit, he did a radio interview where the host made a personal observation about David that he considered untrue; he doesn\u2019t remember what. Lies deserve lies, he figured, and immediately blasted back: \u201cAt least I\u2019m not a child molester like you.\u201dBen heard this story from the bodyguard, who was ferrying David as the phone interview was taking place. \u201cI nearly crashed the car,\u201d he said.David was unrepentant: \u201cYou gotta fight fire with fire.\u201dIn 2009, Ben and Mr. Andreessen formed their venture capital firm, which today has $6 billion under management. By then, Ben had managed to tone himself down.\u201cWith my father, everything was an argument to the death,\u201d he said. \u201cMy bar for \u2018inflammatory\u2019 was so high.\u201dDavid declined to follow suit and moderate his own rhetoric, which meant he was largely ignored by both the right and the left. By 2012, the Jewish magazine Tablet could run a profile with the headline, \u201cDavid Horowitz Is Homeless.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been ghettoized,\u201d he told the magazine.Then came Mr. Trump. When Jeff Sessions was a Republican senator from Alabama, he participated several times in events at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, which describes itself as combating \u201cthe efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Sessions got an award from the center. Stephen Miller, a top White House aide, has been relying on David for advice since he was a student battling the administrators at Santa Monica High School.Last October, Chris Ruddy, a good friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, commissioned David to write a book about how the right could mobilize to defeat President Clinton. It was taken as a given that she would win the election.The plan was to publish the book a few days before her inauguration. David began with a section called \u201cThe Adversary.\u201d Hillary, of course.\u201cI can do that almost in my sleep,\u201d he said.When Trump surprised the world by winning, the book was quickly retooled into \u201cBig Agenda: President Trump\u2019s Plan to Save America,\u201d although much of it was still about how Mrs. Clinton and Democrats were the adversaries. \u201cThe strategy,\u201d David wrote, \u201cis to go for the jugular.\u201d The book was on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for 11 weeks.\u201cWhat I like about Trump is he\u2019s not your typical Republican,\u201d David said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter.\u201dA fighter, as it happens, in the style of David Horowitz. In decades of public speaking, David honed an in-your-face approach. He said he picked it up from his former comrades on the left.\u201cIf you\u2019re nuanced and you speak in what I would call an intellectual manner, you get eaten alive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great handicap to be talking like accountants while the opposition are making moral indictments.\u201dHaving politics so deeply part of your identity used to be unusual, said Daniel Oppenheimer, who wrote \u201cExit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century\u201d about David Horowitz, Ronald Reagan and a few others. The core identity of most people was community, family and religion. But as these other parts of society withered, politics filled the void.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which we\u2019re all David Horowitz now,\u201d said Mr. Oppenheimer. \u201cWe\u2019re all amateur political pundits, and we\u2019re all less willing to compromise. That doesn\u2019t bode well for our future.\u201dSand Hill Road is the short, architecturally undistinguished strip just west of Palo Alto, Calif., where the venture capitalists hang out. As an incubator of revolutions, Sand Hill has had a longer and more successful run than Berkeley ever did in the 1960s. Companies from Amazon to Google were funded here.Mr. Andreessen, as it happened, did not want Ben to articulate a case for his Trump-supporting father. \u201cMarc said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Ben recalled.But his father asked him, and so there was Ben on a couch in his Sand Hill office, mulling the unexpected confluence of race, politics and technology that is the Horowitz family. In case of trouble, an aide recorded the conversation.\u201cMarx said, sharpen the contradictions. He was talking about the contradictions between labor and capital. Make it stark,\u201d Ben said. \u201cMy father, from a rhetorical, propaganda kind of messaging school, is all Marx and Lenin, still.\u201dIn other words, he goes to extremes.Father and son usually avoid politics, discuss it when they must, and find common ground to the extent they can. They live with each other\u2019s extremes, especially with regard to race.\u201cWe trust each other\u2019s intentions,\u201d Ben said.For more than 25 years, Ben has been married to Felicia Wiley, who is black and grew up in a working class family in Los Angeles. She is a frequent volunteer at Glide Memorial Church, the longtime countercultural rallying point in San Francisco that talks on its website about how it offered \u201ca safe space\u201d to the Black Panthers. Last summer, Glide gave Felicia a major award.Ben and Felicia have three grown children. In David\u2019s 2016 essay collection \u201cProgressive Racism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI have three black granddaughters for whom I want the absolute best that this life and this society have to offer.\u201d But his positions on racial issues are not exactly mainstream in liberal Silicon Valley. In \u201cBig Agenda,\u201d he called Black Lives Matter a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201criot-fomenting\u201d organization.And in lines that emphasize how far he had come from the idealism of the 1960s, he wrote in \u201cProgressive Racism\u201d that \u201cthere will always be racists and bigots. Only utopians will fail to understand this and seek to deploy the coercive powers of the state to make everyone believe as they do.\u201dBen looks at his father\u2019s racial statements in this light: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to help black people. Really, genuinely. Nobody else is going to take it that way because of how he says it.\u201dHe noted that his father broke with right-wing orthodoxy and condemned George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin. \u201cA young man who was unarmed and guiltless of any crime is dead,\u201d David wrote in 2013. \u201cAnd shouldn\u2019t there be some penalty to pay for that?\u201d\u201cThose are the people I\u2019m comfortable around,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird my father was the origin of it, given who he is now.\u201dGrowing up in black culture, Ben developed a love for hip-hop music and used its lyrics as epigraphs for his blog posts on management. An article documenting his affection for the music came to the attention of Divine, a rapper who spent a decade in prison for selling drugs.\u201cI was skeptical,\u201d said Divine, who was born Victor D. Lombard. \u201cI thought it was a publicity stunt. I couldn\u2019t tie together an older white gentleman who was a venture capitalist and a billionaire to hip-hop, which comes from poverty, from struggle, from pain.\u201d He reached out to Ben via Twitter, realized his sincerity, and the two became friends.Divine has met David at Ben\u2019s parties and has pondered what separates and joins the two.\u201cIt\u2019s like Ben is the antidote to David Horowitz,\u201d he said. \u201cHe balances his father out. And what\u2019s so crazy is that Ben came from David Horowitz.\u201dIn the same way a Mafia don is happy if his kids never whack anyone, David appreciates how his offspring stayed clear of the family business. He doesn\u2019t even mind the way they rejected his politics as well.\u201cThe victory of not indoctrinating your kids and yet having them be successful anyway \u2014 that\u2019s the ultimate for him,\u201d Ben said.Because really, who in their right mind would choose to be involved in politics now?\u201cI liked it when there were fringes on the left and the right and a somewhat rational center,\u201d David said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the center. Normal people are wary of politics, with good reason. It\u2019s a very dirty business.\u201dIf David himself were to renounce that business, declaring that his benevolent attitude toward his family would now be extended to strangers as well, this would be a tidier and more hopeful story.The odds are higher that Hillary Clinton will get an award from the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Despite his distaste for politics, David can\u2019t afford to retire and wouldn\u2019t want to anyway.\u201cIt would be like dying,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t betray my cause.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Transportation officials said Paul\u2019s Slide was just about ready to fully reopen. That means motorists will be to get to the enclave using Nacimiento-Fergusson Road, a remote east-west route that cuts across the Santa Lucia Range.Yet the timing on a return to normalcy remains uncertain.Officials said a new span would be in place by the end of September, resuming easy access for visitors from points north.\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as pushing the debris over the side into the ocean. There are environmental regulations we have to adhere to,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point we don\u2019t know what we plan to do.\u201dIn the meantime, with summer upon us, the few visitors have been seeing a rare crowd-free version of Big Sur.Anthony Albert, from Oakland, lugged his bike along a half-mile hiking trail that circumvents the downed Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge and cycled all the way to Paul\u2019s Slide and back.In roughly eight hours of riding, he said, he encountered maybe 10 people.\u201cIt was surreal,\u201d said Mr. Albert, 27. \u201cIt felt like I was in the afterlife, like reliving a past experience with nobody around.\u201dHe shared some of his photos with us:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The event, first held in 1974, was organized under the theme \u201cAllied in Action, United for Justice.\u201dSome scenes from the celebration on Saturday:California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Ways of Winning in a Bull Market", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a bull market (the current one reached its eighth birthday in March), mutual fund managers can find many ways to win. In the second quarter, three of the better-performing stock funds scored with picks as varied as well-known technology companies, micro-cap stocks and Asian innovators.Those hefty holdings partly spring from the fund\u2019s design: It\u2019s benchmarked against the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. Thus, to favor a company, as Mr. Baker has with Tesla, his fund must have a greater allocation to the stock than the index does. Tesla accounts for less than 1 percent of the Nasdaq.Mr. Baker aims to identify and exploit enduring technological themes, like the continued growth of e-commerce and cloud computing. Lately, a favorite motif is the emergence of artificial intelligence. \u201cA.I. will change the world in ways we can\u2019t even imagine now,\u201d he said.The fund\u2019s Tesla holding is partly a wager on that belief. Mr. Baker, a Tesla owner himself, said he likes the company not just for the quality of its cars but also for its continuous improvements to its self-driving technology. Many other companies are developing that technology, too, but Mr. Baker is bullish on Tesla\u2019s prospects.\u201cIn a year or two, we may look back and think it\u2019s funny we focused on Tesla being an electric-car company when they\u2019re building a big competitive advantage in autonomous driving,\u201d he said.Tesla\u2019s stock has been falling lately, dropping more than 15 percent from a peak on June 23. Mr. Baker said his fund has added to its Tesla position this year, though he wouldn\u2019t comment on whether the fund had bought or sold shares recently.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009. Over that time, he said, he has learned patience: \u201cI appreciate more and more that, in a world dominated by people trading E.T.F.s and quantitative traders and hedge funds, the biggest competitive advantage I have is a long-term time horizon.\u201d Mr. Baker retains an average holding for about two years and will keep favored stocks far longer. Nvidia, for example, has been an overweight in the fund \u2014 a larger allocation than in the benchmark \u2014 for Mr. Baker\u2019s whole tenure.The fund, with an expense ratio of 0.91 percent, returned 9.34 percent in the second quarter, compared with a total return of 3.09 percent, including dividends, for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Yet he said he tries to guard against being too patient, striving to stay focused on why he bought a stock and not stumbling into what he called \u201cthesis creep.\u201d \u201cIf things don\u2019t play out, you don\u2019t want to rationalize or justify,\u201d Mr. Chace said.The Wasatch fund differs from the typical micro-cap offering tracked by Morningstar in that it invests more of its shareholders\u2019 money abroad. About 20 percent of the fund is parked in foreign stocks, compared with 3 percent for its average peer. Mr. Chace, who has managed the fund since 2004, can invest as much as 30 percent of the assets in foreign fare. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep pushing it up,\u201d he said.He said he has raised the fund\u2019s foreign stake because the United States micro-cap pool has been stagnant. (Wasatch counts as micro-caps companies with market capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion.) Over the last decade, relatively few domestic companies have issued stock in initial public offerings, or I.P.O.s, he said.India, in contrast, has many small companies with good growth rates, and Mr. Chace has gravitated there. His fund\u2019s top two holdings at the end of March \u2014 MakeMyTrip and Natco Pharma \u2014 are Indian ventures.Similarly, one of his recent good performers was V-Mart Retail, which specializes in selling apparel in India\u2019s smaller cities and countryside. Because of the company\u2019s rural market, it\u2019s not being squeezed by e-commerce companies in the way many big retailers are, he said.Mr. Chace\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.67 percent, returned 8.93 percent in the second quarter.Until last year, the fund was known as the Matthews Science and Technology Fund, but its sponsor, Matthews Asia, changed the name because Mr. Oh, who has overseen the fund since 2006, was finding opportunities beyond that narrower niche. He said his goal is to invest in companies benefiting from a growing middle class throughout Asia and rising disposable incomes there. \u201cThe question we\u2019re asking is, \u2018What will consumers with incremental income spend on?\u2019\u201dLately, an answer has been beauty products. One of the fund\u2019s larger holdings has been Hugel, a South Korean cosmetics and pharmaceuticals company whose offerings include botulinum toxin (or Botox) wrinkle treatments. Korean cosmetics makers have been innovators for more than a decade, Mr. Oh said, but their market was largely limited to South Korea and Japan.Now a surging middle class in China has created a big new pool of potential buyers, he said. In April, Bain Capital agreed to pay about $800 million for a controlling stake in Hugel.Mr. Oh invested in the TAL Education Group, a Beijing tutoring company, for similar reasons. Education is highly valued there, he said, and as parents see their discretionary income rise, they\u2019ll often spend some of the surfeit on their children\u2019s educations. His fund, with an expense ratio of 1.24 percent, returned 13.57 percent in the second quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Job Growth Picks Up the Pace, but Wages Lag Behind", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the hunger for workers and mounting complaints of labor shortages have raised a vexing question: Why isn\u2019t the heightened demand for workers driving up pay?One of its aims is to head off any inflation that might result from a tight job market that prompts employers to offer higher pay to get the workers they need. Yet prices have been rising at a slow pace, and sluggish wage growth suggests that the fear may be premature.\u201cThe payroll number is well above expectations,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the trend in employment growth is strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down.\u201d Revisions to earlier estimates brought the monthly average gain since April to 194,000. But year-over-year wage growth plodded along at 2.5 percent.\u201cThe wage numbers are certainly weaker than expected,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said, \u201cso it keeps alive the whole debate about the relationship between slack and inflation, and how far the Federal Reserve should allow the unemployment rate to fall.\u201dJune was the eighth anniversary of the end of the recession, when the economy hit bottom, with employers shedding hundreds of thousands of workers and the jobless rate more than double what it is today. But many workers have yet to fully benefit from the expansion.\u201cThis is not a market we have typically seen,\u201d said Michael Stull, senior vice president at the staffing company Manpower North America. \u201cWe have not before seen unemployment drop, low participation rates and wages not move. That tells you something\u2019s not right in the labor market.\u201dEmployers are very aware that the pool of workers is shrinking and they are rethinking traditional qualifications like length of experience, Mr. Stull said.\u201cEmployers will take on hard-working, reliable workers even if they don\u2019t have an opening,\u201d he said.At the same time, he said that workers were \u201cpushing back a little bit about driving an hour for a $10-an-hour job at a distribution center on the outer rim of the city.\u201d\u201cYou need a car for that,\u201d Mr. Stull said, \u201cand you can\u2019t have a car on $10 an hour.\u201dThat\u2019s a familiar problem to Tom Thompson, owner of Star Cleaning Systems in Columbus, Ohio. He is looking to add two or three part-time workers to his 20-member staff.\u201cVery few people show up for interviews, and if they do, they don\u2019t show up for the job,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019m spending 80 to 90 percent of my time recruiting. I triple-book appointments for interviews, and I\u2019m lucky if I get one person to show up.\u201dHe is offering $9.25 an hour to start, with bonuses and increases for workers who stick around. Running a new company, he said, he cannot afford to pay significantly more.Nearby distribution centers for big companies like Amazon are sucking up most of the available labor, Mr. Thompson said. \u201cI sometimes wish there was actually a higher unemployment rate,\u201d he said.Like Star Cleaning, Rooforia Home Exteriors in Omaha often finds customers through Thumbtack, an online marketplace for hiring people to complete tasks. These days it is the workers who are tougher to find.\u201cWe did everything we could to recruit people and had not one application,\u201d said Rooforia\u2019s owner, Sarah M. Smith.She is depending on guest-worker visas to fill openings for the season, which runs from the spring through November. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work in Nebraska,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cWe have hot summers, and you\u2019re on a black asphalt roof.\u201dAt $17 an hour, she said, \u201cthe pay is fair.\u201d\u201cWe get a lot of people saying the visa program is taking jobs away from Americans,\u201d Ms. Smith said, \u201cbut in reality, they\u2019re not taking the jobs because there is no one even willing to do the jobs.\u201d\u201cWe had one person we recruited,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even show up the next day.\u201dPatrick Bass, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp North America, part of a German multinational conglomerate, said his company was increasingly relying on methods common in Germany like apprenticeships, partnerships with colleges, and internships.\u201cWe\u2019re willing to invest in the people and bring them in and train them,\u201d Mr. Bass said. \u201cBut for the basic-skill job, we\u2019re seeing a higher turnover rate than normal. People are job shopping a bit, because they can. They\u2019re trying different things to see what they like.\u201dProfessional services showed a healthy gain in jobs last month, possibly reflecting the hiring of new college graduates. Other sectors that showed substantial gains included health care, social assistance and food services.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement,\u201cThis new report shows positive gains: Job creation came in higher than expected and the labor force grew,\u201d but he added, \u201cWe have a lot more work to do.\u201d\u201cThis is an unprecedented level of political uncertainty,\u201d said William E. Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cThat is creating a drag on the economy.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Luxury Arms Race: Michael Kors and Coach Target Takeovers", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe global luxury market has long been dominated by three giants, all European \u2014 LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering and Richemont. Now, it has two hungry American players with which to contend.Coach and Michael Kors, fashion houses that have thus far catered to the \u201cmiddle market\u201d of the luxury sector, are looking to transform themselves into leading forces in the field, and they could reshape the industry in the process.\u201cAcquiring Jimmy Choo is the beginning of a strategy that we have for building a luxury group that really is focused on international fashion brands,\u201d John D. Idol, the chairman and chief executive of Michael Kors Holdings, said in an interview.With the boards of Kors and Coach clearly willing to spend on acquiring brands, two of the best known names in American accessories seem to be headed for an arms race \u2014 and there is plenty of speculation about their potential targets.Mr. Idol said Kors was considering only \u201cone or two more acquisitions\u201d for now, and had no plans to reach the size of LVMH, which has more than 50 brands in its portfolio. But he added that he had great admiration for the French group\u2019s long-term approach to brand building.\u201cFirst, we\u2019re really going to look at luxury companies,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, we\u2019re going to look at companies that lead in style and trend.\u201d The third requirement, he said was for companies with \u201csome size and scale\u201d and \u201csome heritage.\u201dAt the same time, he added, Kors was attracted to businesses where a founder or family member remained involved.\u201cIt\u2019s become harder and harder for independent designers to make the leap to household name,\u201d said Robert Burke, the founder of a luxury consultancy that bears his name.Coach is a little further along. It began life as an accessories business, unlike Kors, which is known for its ready-to-wear items as much as its signature tote. In addition to Kate Spade, a label that operates at the more affordable end of the retail spectrum, it has bought the upmarket shoe brand Stuart Weitzman.Mr. Luis has also been open about his ambitions for more acquisitions. Indeed, Coach was rumored to be a suitor for Jimmy Choo, underscoring the potential that Michael Kors and Coach will pursue similar targets.Coach and Kors, however, are going in a more expansive direction. The strategy has advantages: With acquisitions, they can gain new revenue streams, achieve distribution efficiencies and diversify their offering.There are also financial reporting benefits. LVMH, for example, does not break out the performances of its smaller luxury brands, allowing any faltering names to benefit from better performance by their siblings.\u201cThere\u2019s strength in numbers,\u201d said Mr. Burke.But their strategy was markedly different.American businesses tend to focus more on contemporary price points. Historically, they have depended heavily on department store sales, and grown via a pyramid structure. In that model, less expensive lines bring in the bulk of a company\u2019s profits, powered by the high-end image of a luxury collection at the \u201cpinnacle.\u201dThe European \u201chigh luxury\u201d model of Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s, by contrast, eschews discounting in order to maintain pricing power and market position.Previous efforts in the United States to create a homegrown luxury group have been unsuccessful. Pegasus Apparel and Fifth & Pacific made much-discussed entries into the market by buying brands, but then had to sell them, and to fold or change their approach.Mr. Idol said Kors planned to spend the next 12 months integrating Jimmy Choo rather than shopping around, but he did not completely dismiss the suggestion that another acquisition could happen in that time.\u201cWe generate approximately a billion dollars in cash, so we have the capability to do another acquisition quickly if we had to,\u201d he said.Mr. Burke, the luxury consultant, said he expected that a host of brands were readying their balance sheets. As far as Kors and Coach go, he said, \u201cI think their dance cards are going to be pretty full.\u201dChad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ode to Shopping Malls", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "Farewell, pleasure palaces of days past. A filmmaker\u2019s series chronicles a way of life as it reaches its end.Supported byOne day in 2015, Dan Bell left his home in Baltimore and drove into the suburbs to visit the Owings Mills Mall. It was a trip out of memory. As a 9-year-old boy, he had attended the grand opening of this 820,000-square-foot shopping emporium with his family.Gold dust and pink feathers rained down from the glass-roof atrium that day as thousands gathered. Saks Fifth Avenue was an anchor tenant. The food court, lined with palm trees, was called the Conservatory. The NBC station in Baltimore dispatched its Copter Cam 2 to sweep over the parking lot and broadcast shots of the ocean of cars. Mr. Bell remembered his aunt driving around for 45 minutes to find a spot.If you were remotely involved in the booming consumer culture in those years, you spent hours circling indoor fountains and riding escalators while sucking down an Orange Julius. Even the eternally alienated Joan Didion wrote of buying two straw hats, four bottles of nail enamel and \u201ca toaster, on sale at Sears,\u201d at the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu.At the time of his return visit in 2015, Mr. Bell had not been to the mall in Owings Mills, Md. \u2014 or any shopping mall \u2014 in more than a decade. Although he had heard that it was struggling, he was not prepared for what he saw.\u201cThe first moment kind of took my breath away, because it was this entire corridor of nothing,\u201d Mr. Bell said.The French marble floors still gleamed under artificial light. It wasn\u2019t quite a ruin, but it looked as if a viral outbreak had removed all life from the place.\u201cThey had loud pop music echoing through the mall, and I\u2019m looking down this corridor, and there\u2019s no people, no stores open,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cIt was really a sobering moment.\u201dOthers have found creative grist in the dead-mall phenomenon. In her best-selling thriller \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Gillian Flynn set a scene in a four-story destination mall gone to seed in a Missouri suburb. What was once the beating heart of the community had become \u201ctwo million square feet of echo.\u201d The author wrote the mall into the novel and kept it in her screenplay for the film adaptation, because, she said: \u201cFor kids of the \u201980s especially, dead malls have a very strong allure. We were the last of the free-range kids, roaming around malls, not really buying anything, but just looking. To see all those big looming spaces so empty now \u2014 it\u2019s a childhood haunting.\u201dThough upscale malls in wealthy communities continue to do well, Mr. Bell isn\u2019t interested in those; he visits dead malls, and among the deadest are ones in working-class and rural communities. Filming at the Bristol Mall in Bristol, Va., Mr. Bell discovered 10 stores that remained open in the entire center; the rest of the retail spaces sat empty behind lowered metal gates.At the Rehoboth Mall in Rehoboth Beach, Del., he met a middle-aged immigrant couple running a clothing alteration business in a space that had once been the food court. Weird moments abound in the series, as when Mr. Bell\u2019s camera fixes on a forgotten corner to underscore the desolation, and then a geriatric mall-walker appears in frame, doing solitary laps.In his running commentary, Mr. Bell is part affable tour guide (\u201cHeading down this corridor, you can see ahead there, that\u2019s where the Sears used to be\u201d), part mall-architecture buff (\u201cDo I love this vintage brick planter? Yes\u201d) and part baffled Everyman (\u201cThere\u2019s no customers, but they have a customer-service desk\u201d).16 PhotosWatching the \u201cDead Mall Series\u201d provokes in the viewer a conflicting swirl of emotions. You think of your own happy times in malls and feel sad for the loss, and then feel stupid for getting all emotional about what was an artificial and manipulative experience built around shopping.Malls are an emotional subject, Mr. Bell has discovered: \u201cThe things people write me are incredible. From young people who just love the retro aspect to people who experienced things in malls that are meaningful. First dates, meeting their husband or wife, their first job.\u201d\u201cPeople who are in the malls, who went to malls, this is the mourning period right now, because we are losing a lot of malls,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some people.\u201dMarley Station was Mr. Bell\u2019s home mall. He could get there in 15 minutes if he managed to swing a ride, an hour if he walked. Like Ms. Flynn and a whole generation of middle and lower-middle-class suburban kids, for Mr. Bell the mall was the place to go. Chess King and Regal Cinema beckoned. \u201cYou would sit outside and smoke cigarettes and walk around inside and see who\u2019s there,\u201d Mr. Bell said.Mr. Bell\u2019s favorite store in the mall was Suncoast Motion Picture Company. He would spend half the afternoon digging through videotapes in the $10 rack and finding weird little cult films like \u201cThe Honeymoon Killers\u201d and \u201cStreet Trash.\u201d Then he would stroll down to Walden Books and spend more happy hours in the film section.In those years the mall was derided as an alienating place filled with soulless chain stores, but it was possible to get something of a cultural education there.\u201cIt really fueled the artistic mind that I had but didn\u2019t know how to do anything with,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cJust having access to these films and books and everything the mall had at the time.\u201dIn his later teens Mr. Bell held various jobs at the mall: at Macy\u2019s, at the shoe store, at a leather-goods boutique that sold the brown suede jackets with puffy shoulders that were all the rage at the time.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I kept my jobs at the mall, because I was never in the store,\u201d Mr. Bell laughed. \u201cI would just go around and talk to everybody. We were all losers, smoking cigarettes, drinking at work, hanging out with working-class, cool, fun people. We all kind of looked out for one another. It made having a crappy job easier.\u201dIn 1996, a blizzard shut everything down. Mr. Bell and a co-worker were stranded inside the mall and spent the night walking the empty interior as the wind howled outside. The experience was a premonition of what he would film 20 years later.An image of malls in their heyday may be frozen in your mind if you haven\u2019t visited one in a while, and upon entering, the old sense memories rush back: the distinct smell of a department store (here, a Boscov\u2019s), at once fresh and synthetic; the inward thrill upon entering the open main floor; the childlike joy of riding an escalator.A bird flies around the mall\u2019s upper level.Advertising banners show young women smiling and having fun. \u201cSomething new starts here,\u201d say the banners, which hide the windows of vacant stores.A lone man sits in a massage chair, staring at his smartphone in an otherwise shopperless corridor.The most happening part was the food court, which had six remaining restaurants and a small crowd having lunch among the palm trees under a skylight.\u201cI have not been to a food court this populated in a while,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cIn the heyday, you wouldn\u2019t be able to find a seat.\u201dA large man with short brown hair and a beard, Mr. Bell comes across as wistful for his youth. He agrees that mallgoing was lame in retrospect, but he nevertheless beams when he sees a still-operating fountain.\u201cI love the smell of pizza and chlorine together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like my favorite smell.\u201dHis many visits to dead malls have not, however, aroused in him a renewed desire to be a mall shopper. Like so many, he hasn\u2019t purchased anything in a mall in years. \u201cThe stuff that interests me is really not in a mall,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s a lot cheaper to buy it on Amazon.\u201dHe ordered a slice of pizza and a soda and offered his assessment on Voorhees Town Center. \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s a little bit more going on than some of the other malls I\u2019ve been to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely dead, but it\u2019s definitely getting there.\u201dHis eyes widened when he noticed an older woman leaving the mall with a Great American Cookie box. \u201cNow, see, that is right out of the \u201980s,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an experience I have not seen lately, someone walking out with a Great American Cookie cake. She\u2019s probably getting it for her grandkid.\u201dLike some archaeologist of retail, Mr. Bell read the \u201clabel scars\u201d on the facades of closed storefronts, the marks left behind by the uprooted lettering. One of them had been a Kay Jewelers, he determined.The upper level had an unlikely mix of tenants, including government offices, a cancer charity, a youth club called the Spot, and the Echelon Mall Ministry. \u201cThis is another way malls can redo themselves,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cAt one time, this was probably five stores.\u201d Looking at potted flora in the corridor, he noted, \u201cPeople are taking care of the plants at least.\u201dFor all the time he spends visiting and filming these concrete carcasses, \u201cmalls do not make me sad,\u201d Mr. Bell said. In fact, he finds it calming to be in a large building among the familiar sights and smells of his childhood with the air-conditioning cranked high and not many people around. \u201cWhen I hear about malls that are in the series that have closed, there\u2019s a moment where I\u2019m, like, \u2018That\u2019s a shame,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mourn for malls.\u201d\u201cThey were in a pool in the elevator shaft,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cThere was a bank of fog hovering midair in the food court. I was, like, \u2018You have got to be kidding me.\u2019\u201d\u201cWho in the \u201980s could imagine this?\u201d he added. \u201cCan you imagine filming this and taking it back to the \u201980s and saying, \u2018This is what\u2019s going to happen in 30 years: There\u2019s going to be a frog in the food court\u2019?\u201dAn article on July 27 about the decline of shopping malls, and nostalgia for them, misidentified the network that broadcast the opening of the Owings Mills Mall in Maryland. It was NBC, not ABC, though the station in question, Baltimore\u2019s Channel 2, is now an ABC affiliate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network, with more than two billion users. LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201dEven LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201dAround the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Down the Mighty Columbia River, Where a Power Struggle Looms", "Date": "2017-07-28", "News": "To ride down the Columbia River as the John Day Dam\u2019s wall of concrete slowly fills the view from a tugboat is to see what the country\u2019s largest network of energy-producing dams created through five decades of 20th-century ambition, investment and hubris.Nearly half of the nation\u2019s hydropower electricity comes from more than 250 hydropower dams that were built on the Columbia and its tributaries \u2014 a vast and complex arc of industry and technology that touches tens of millions of lives across the West every day.The idea is part of a package of proposals that would transform much of the infrastructure in the United States to a mixture of public and private partnerships, lowering costs to taxpayers and improving efficiency, administration officials said. Assets of two other big public power operators, based in Colorado and Oklahoma, would be sold, too, if Congress approves the measure.Debates about government and its role in land and environmental policy are always highly charged. But perhaps nowhere could the proposed changes have a more significant impact than along the great river of the West \u2014 fourth largest by volume in North America, more than 10 times that of the Hudson. Privatization would transform a government service that requires equal standards across a vast territory \u2014 from large cities to tiny hamlets \u2014 into a private operation seeking maximum returns to investors.Wringing profits from a system that has provided electricity at cost would inevitably raise prices, critics of the idea said, while supporters envision a streamlined grid open to innovations that government managers cannot imagine.CANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,0001,000250KalispellDAM OWNERSHIPColumbia R.SeattlePolsonGovernmentCoeur d'AleneSpokanePrivateWenatcheeOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONTANAWASHINGTONMissoulaYakimaAstoriaLewistonRichlandLongviewWalla WallaButteBozemanIDAHOColumbia R.PortlandPACIFICOCEANColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsSalemCorvallisBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioBoiseIdaho FallsOREGONSnake R.WYOMINGBurleyTwin FallsCALIFORNIANEVADAUTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawatts2,000Columbia R.1,000Kalispell250Coeur d'AleneSpokaneSeattleDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentOlympiaGrand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.PrivateMissoulaWASH.AstoriaLongviewRichlandWalla WallaButteBozemanPortlandColumbia R.Columbia riverbasinSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPACIFICOCEANBrownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseORE.IDAHOSnake R.WYO.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityCANADAANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMONT.DAM OWNERSHIPMissoulaWASH.GovernmentRichlandPrivateButteColumbia riverbasinPortlandColumbia R.BozemanSalemJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneBendOntarioIdaho FallsBoiseIDAHOORE.Snake R.PocatelloTwin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHSalt Lake CityANNUAL ENERGYOUTPUTIn average megawattsCANADAChief Joseph Dam1,321 megawattsColumbia R.Kalispell2,000MONT.Coeur d'AleneSeattle250Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsMissoulaDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentRichlandButtePrivateColumbia R.IDAHOJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsPortlandBozemanSalemColumbia riverbasinWYO.Brownlee Dam340 megawattsEugeneOntarioBendIdaho FallsBoiseORE.PocatelloSnake R.Twin FallsCALIF.NEV.UTAHANNUAL ENERGY OUTPUTIn average megawattsDAM OWNERSHIPGovernmentPrivate2,000250WASH.Grand Coulee Dam2,372 megawattsSeattleColumbia R.MONT.PortlandColumbia riverbasinJohn Day Dam1,147 megawattsBrownlee Dam340 megawattsSnake R.ORE.IDAHOUTAHCALIF.NEV.A New York Times reporter and photographer went down the river in June, bunking with a five-man tug crew over 30 hours as workers cooked their meals, rested between shifts and transited through four dams and locks. We were looking for the interconnections of electricity and navigation, private industry and government management, engineering and biology, and what is at stake in this new energy debate.The possible fate of that system is raising alarms for some, and questions for almost everyone whose life connects to the river.\u201cThe uncertainty is the biggest thing of all: How would it work?\u201d Terry Oxley, the captain of the tugboat, the Crown Point, said as he gazed out over the water, hands flicking the controls with practiced aplomb. Mr. Oxley, 63, has worked the tugs for 39 years.\u201cI guess I want more input,\u201d he added. \u201cWho\u2019s going to control it? Who\u2019s going to have the say so? When are they going to release the water, the flood control, the spill patterns for the fish? It\u2019s such a big deal, and it\u2019s all intertwined.\u201d\u201cNo room for error,\u201d he said as he slowed the tug to a crawl approaching the locks at McNary Dam, 200 miles upriver from Portland. The Crown Point had picked up a 14,000-ton load in Pasco, Wash. \u2014 three barges of wheat and one empty fuel tanker \u2014 before taking it to Vancouver, Wash. Crew members were posted on the four barges pushed by the tug, reporting back by radio as the distance to the walls of the lock narrowed to inches.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing a lot of energy,\u201d Mr. Wyatt, 41, said. \u201cWe hit something even at one mile an hour, it makes a big boom.\u201dThe dams and the locks that make up Mr. Wyatt\u2019s workplace were built by engineers who utterly transformed \u2014 or destroyed, depending on your point of view \u2014 what had been one of the wildest rivers in America.The dams blocked the river\u2019s flow, creating a network of placid reservoirs. Irrigation canals spidered out, fostering one of the nation\u2019s richest breadbaskets in the orchards and vineyards of Washington. Mammoth turbines powered the airplane factories of Puget Sound and the boom of postwar California.But development came with costs. Native American tribes saw their lands destroyed. Salmon stocks, already decimated by overfishing, were driven into further peril by rising water temperatures and dams that made it harder for fish to move up- and downriver in their ancient cycles of reproduction.Native American tribal leaders said that the old river would never come back, but that the federal government was now bound, through court decisions and treaties, to work with tribes going forward.\u201cObligations are tied to the federal relationship,\u201d said Jaime A. Pinkham, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a member of the Nez Perc\u00e9 tribe. \u201cWhen you privatize, what happens to the voice of the Indian people?\u201dThe new proposal would keep the electricity-making in government control, while spinning off the system of getting that electricity to market. Partial privatization would require complex new contracts delineating the responsibilities of the public and private partners. And what feeds into that system has grown more complicated since the 1980s as well, with a huge growth of new sources like wind and solar.But some energy experts who back the Trump plan said that despite the thorny details, a powerful word could resonate in Congress: fairness. Low prices in a nonprofit system have been a huge boost to economic growth in this corner of the nation.\u201cWe should have a debate about why some minority of Americans get subsidized power and others don\u2019t,\u201d said Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute.Government brought electricity to remote rural towns starting in the 1930s, and people there haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201cWhen you have something that works, having caution about changing it seems reasonable,\u201d he said.In cities like The Dalles, 90 minutes east of Portland, Google has become a community patron of sorts, too, residents said, with grants to libraries and schools.\u201cGoogle has been good for us,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Steve Lawrence. \u201cThey\u2019re a full partner.\u201dWind revenue is paying for the expansion of the Sherman County Courthouse and the annual dividend checks that property owners in the county have received. Kathy McCullough said kilowatt dollars had become important to her family farm\u2019s budget, hedging against fluctuations in wheat prices.Bonneville power managers repeatedly hit the off switch on wind this year in Sherman \u2014 curtailment is the term \u2014 because too much water was coming through the dams after last winter\u2019s huge snowpack, which in turn meant more hydroelectricity flowing through the grid.More curtailments have happened this year than ever before, according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, as Bonneville managers struggled to keep the system in balance. A change in ownership, supporters of the Trump plan in Sherman said, could be good for them in opening new opportunities for wind power sales.\u201cThe B.P.A. does a terrible job,\u201d Ms. McCullough said in reference to Bonneville Power. \u201cI don\u2019t know that privatizing would be bad at all.\u201dSome environmental groups also chafe against Bonneville, for the access fees that they said could discourage wind development and the system\u2019s difficulties in juggling all of the new energy sources.But Doug Howell, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in Washington State, said privatizing would not solve those problems \u2014 and could in fact make them worse.\u201cThe answer is not privatizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s integration.\u201dOne longtime veteran of river management said the new argument over the power system\u2019s future just reprised an old question: Whom does the Columbia belong to?\u201cEverybody takes a piece of the Columbia,\u201d said Tom Eckman, a senior adviser to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. \u201cAnd then they have to collaborate and cooperate over its resources, or fight over them.\u201dSource: Dam data from the Northwest Power and Conservation CouncilAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Digital Artists, Anxious About ... Technology", "Date": "2017-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet the Sotheby\u2019s S2 gallery in New York, normally used for exhibitions of contemporary art, is currently the site of a show featuring mostly young artists who rely on digital technology and who are not exactly household names. Surprisingly, most of the works on view take physical form. More significant, they also betray a broad generational anxiety about the technological future and the role of humans in it.A sleek, black plinth with a black screen in front and a record player perched incongruously on top, it was designed as a prototype for a 21st-century memorial. When David Goodman, the Sotheby\u2019s executive in charge of marketing and digital development, saw it a couple of months ago, its screen was displaying the social media posts of a 25-year-old Miami bicycle enthusiast who had been killed in a roadside hit-and-run. A vinyl record played synthesized chimes, their tone determined by a computer analysis of the emotions those posts expressed \u2014 a major key if they were positive ones, a minor key if negative.\u201cI was pretty blown away by the piece,\u201d Mr. Goodman recalled recently in his office at Sotheby\u2019s headquarters in New York. \u201cIt also made me sad. I can\u2019t \u2014\u2014\u201cLet me put it this way: It struck an emotional chord.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the idea of looking at oneself through the technology of the day,\u201d Mr. Bailey said by phone. An adjacent self-portrait shows him in the guise of the persona he has adopted \u2014 that of an obnoxiously ebullient na\u00eff who proclaims himself a famous new media artist. \u201cHe believes deeply that technology can help, and yet technology consistently lets him down,\u201d Mr. Bailey said of his alter ego. \u201cSo damn it, why doesn\u2019t it deliver?\u201dMs. Zelinskie\u2019s human-digital mash-ups are about \u201chow we\u2019re becoming one with our technology,\u201d she explained in her studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn \u2014 a small, crowded loft with NASA fliers and \u201cStar Trek\u201d posters taped to the walls. In theory, the computer code on the cube\u2019s surface means the cube could be \u201cread\u201d by a computer \u2014 which is why she sometimes says she\u2019s making art for robots as well as humans.In fact, like the label on a can of pet food, the code on Ms. Zelinskie\u2019s sculptures is meant for humans. Aliens, too, perhaps. \u201cI like taking ideas that have been reiterated again and again\u201d \u2014 the human face, geometric forms \u2014 \u201cand putting them in a time capsule made of math,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, this is preserving human culture.\u201d\u201cThat archetypal looking into someone\u2019s eyes \u2014 it\u2019s a very powerful moment,\u201d Mr. Zigelbaum said.But in this case, the other person is disembodied, and the moment you share is mediated by technology \u2014 by video cameras, by digital networks, by Amazon\u2019s \u201cmicrotasking\u201d platform. \u201cYou\u2019re looking into someone\u2019s eye, but you don\u2019t know if they can see you or who they are,\u201d Mr. Zigelbaum said. The technology that makes the Mechanical Turk workers visible also renders them intangible. Communication is enhanced and impeded at the same time.What\u2019s not on view at Sotheby\u2019s is anything by Mr. Barcia-Colombo himself. After seeing his \u201cMonument I,\u201d Mr. Goodman asked if he wanted to bring the Hereafter Institute to Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cAnd I said great,\u201d Mr. Barcia-Colombo recalled, \u201cbut it\u2019s a complicated show, and it\u2019s about death, so your clientele might not like it.\u201d With the show he did mount, he added: \u201cSome people are like, reserve that piece \u2014 I want it! And others are like, this is Sotheby\u2019s?\u201dMr. Barcia-Colombo\u2019s Lacma installation was indeed complicated. For two days last August, museumgoers were offered a free consultation on their digital afterlife. To ensure a fully customized experience, they were asked to sign up in advance and to share access to their Facebook profiles.When they showed up at the museum, they were greeted by actors in white lab coats and given a 3-D body scan that was used to generate a life-size digital avatar. They were shown a memorial virtual-reality film such as the one Mr. Barcia-Colombo made about his grandfather, a Spanish poet who fought against Franco and ended his days an emeritus professor of Spanish literature in Los Angeles.Then they got to attend their own funeral, complete with a eulogy based on their social media posts. As the eulogy concluded, their avatar appeared onscreen, only to turn and walk off into the clouds.As this suggests, Mr. Barcia-Colombo is actually less concerned with death than with memories of life \u2014 with what happens to people\u2019s Facebook pages when they\u2019re gone, for instance. It\u2019s a common concern \u2014 so much so that two years ago Facebook started allowing its users to appoint a \u201clegacy contact\u201d to manage their profiles after they die. But is that enough?\u201cI wanted to design a digital urn \u2014 some kind of object, some kind of memory machine you could step into,\u201d he said at N.Y.U., where he teaches animation and video sculpture. \u201cWhat if Facebook goes down?\u201dAn unlikely prospect at this point \u2014 but were it to ever happen, he pointed out, \u201cthere would be no record\u201d of the many billions of lives and trillions of \u201clikes\u201d that have been so casually, trustingly, innocently recorded on it. \u201cThe whole point is to make that data physical,\u201d he said, \u201cso that a record exists of that person\u2019s life.\u201dGravestone makers and turntable manufacturers, please take note.Advertisement"}

One of the things it cannot do, however, is call 911, an Amazon spokeswoman, Rachel Hass, said by email.\u201cIn order for a call to be made and answered, the receiving end needs to also have Alexa calling and messaging set up,\u201d she wrote, adding that \u201cthere is no capability to switch the call to another phone, device or service.\u201dThe device also would have to be prompted first by four \u201cwake words\u201d: Alexa, Echo, computer or Amazon.\u201cI have not heard of an Alexa device being a problem from a 911 perspective because they do not have native telephone capabilities,\u201d he said.He said Echo behaves differently than Siri, the virtual assistant on iPhones that can place calls with a prompt. He recalled a case when a television news station aired a report that included the phrase \u201cHey Siri, call 911,\u201d which led to a flood of calls to emergency dispatchers from phones responding to the command.The Albuquerque story began on July 2 as Milana Honorio and her boyfriend, Eduardo Barros, were house sitting for her parents in Albuquerque, a criminal complaint said.When her text message tone sounded, Mr. Barros, 28, accused her of cheating on him and reacted angrily.Mr. Barros said he was \u201cgoing to kill her if she called the cops,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cDid you call the sheriff?\u201d he asked.Mr. Barros grabbed her 9 mm handgun, hit her in the face and kicked her at least 10 times in the face and stomach while she was on the floor, the complaint said.\u201cBarros told her she was not going anywhere and he was going to kill her,\u201d it said.A spokeswoman for the Sheriff\u2019s Department, Deputy Felicia Romero, said the call was prompted by the phrase \u201ccall the sheriff\u201d and that on the 911 recording, Ms. Honorio could be heard saying, \u201cAlexa, call 911.\u201dDeputy Romero said on Monday that the authorities did not know the finer details of how the call was placed, adding, \u201cAll we know is Alexa saved a life.\u201dPressed about the doubts raised by Amazon, she said on Tuesday in an email that Alexa was used \u201calong with the home phone system\u201d to call 911.Referring to Ms. Honorio, Deputy Romero wrote: \u201cThe 911 recording is consistent with her statements, as she can be heard screaming in the background, \u2018Alexa call 911.\u2019 I cannot confirm which device was connected to the home phone system.\u201dThe Echo can\u2019t interpret what you mean, but it can activate calls that are in a contact list, he wrote.\u201cSo if you have \u2018mom\u2019 on your phone in your contact list, you can say \u2018call mom\u2019 and then your phone will call mom,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut if, for example, you say, \u2018call the police\u2019 and there is not a contact on your phone called \u2018the police\u2019 then the Echo (Alexa) won\u2019t be able to call it.\u201dHe said Echo has \u201cskills,\u201d which are permissions and rules tied to a user\u2019s personal account and information. Even if the device heard \u201ccall the sheriff,\u201d it would not have done anything. It would have had to be prompted first by one of the key words, have the phone skill enabled and a number in the contact list for \u201cthe sheriff.\u201dAt best, the phone would have called, and an operator would have heard the ambient conversation, but the Echo itself would not have called, would not have been able to communicate anything or indicate the location of the call, he wrote.The complaint said deputies responded to a \u201c911 open line/hang up.\u201d It was not clear how the Echo was configured, and efforts to reach Ms. Honorio were unsuccessful.Mr. Barros faces aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and related charges after a six-hour standoff. Ms. Honorio had injuries to her face but refused medical attention and her daughter who was also in the house, was uninjured, the department said.The episode was the latest to raise questions about the role of smart home devices that respond to voice commands.\u201cThese are things we are going to debate,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is.\u201dAlain Delaqueriere contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mom-and-Pop Dollar Stores Fight to Survive as Chains Move In", "Date": "2017-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 99-cent store with the bright red awning cannot compete with the cutthroat pricing or huge selection at the two Dollar Tree outposts in its poor Brooklyn neighborhood.So it has found another way to lure customers: with the personalized service usually associated with luxury stores.After one woman requested a reusable lint brush, it began stocking them for 99 cents. It saves items for customers until they can pay for them. It anticipates their needs with air-conditioners in summer, heaters in winter and roses on Valentine\u2019s Day. And it even offers a self-serve coffee stand where they can linger.\u201cIt\u2019s evolved beyond just being a 99-cent store,\u201d said Habib Abdul Musiwir, the manager of 99\u00a2 & Up Millenium Discount & Party Supply in East New York, whose customers have gone to check out the Dollar Tree stores only to return. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting the needs of the community.\u201dSmall family-owned dollar stores are under enormous pressure to hold onto customers and remain solvent as national chains like Dollar Tree expand their footprint in New York City and elsewhere, a trend underscored by Dollar General\u2019s recent move to open stores in the city for the first time. Some independent stores have emphasized their neighborhood roots, while others have raised prices or tweaked their inventories beyond party supplies and off-brand shampoos to include household staples like bread and milk and even organic foods.But just as supermarket and drugstore chains have reshaped local economies and wiped out many small businesses, dollar store chains are beginning to take over neighborhoods where mom-and-pop dollar stores have traditionally dominated. Many independent store owners and workers say they are facing a bleak future as their customers have more choices, and rising rents and operating costs further cut into their dwindling profits.\u201cThe chains are growing rapidly at the expense of the independents \u2014 when they open up one chain store, they destroy five or 10 independent stores,\u201d said David Emrani, the owner of Pride Products Corporation, which imports general merchandise and distributes it to about 3,000 independent dollar and discount stores nationally, about half the number from a decade ago.Mr. Emrani himself owned six dollar stores on Long Island in 2008, but closed all but one of them after Dollar Tree chain stores opened nearby and not only poached some of his workers but also took away his customers. \u201cYou constantly have to ring up \u2014 if you don\u2019t, you die,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have more and more customers every day to survive.\u201dIn the Bronx, where independent stores compete against one another as well as the chains, the 99\u00a2 Super Star Discount store is not as busy as it used to be, even though it caters to its largely Hispanic and black neighborhood by carrying Goya agua de coco, Jarritos mango drink, canned beans and guava-flavored snacks, said Sam Essaedi, the manager.Across the street, 99-Cent and Up Dollar R Us has raised some of its prices to eke out more profit. Muhammed Showaiv, the manager, counted five dollar stores just in the neighborhood, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough shoppers for the business.\u201dOver all, the dollar store industry is thriving at a time when the brick-and-mortar retail landscape is littered with shuttered stores. Promising deep discounts, these stores flourished during the recession and have continued to multiply at a time of seismic shifts in consumer habits and fierce competition from online retailers, especially Amazon, which recently started offering discounts to poorer families for its Prime membership, which covers the cost of shipping.Nationally, 30,496 dollar stores rang up $33.8 billion in sales of food and household items in 2016, up from 20,543 stores and $14.9 billion in sales a decade earlier, according to Inmar Willard Bishop, a data analytics firm.\u201cDollar stores are figuring out how to get people in,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research company. \u201cThey have done the best job of changing with the consumer than any other retail store.\u201dDollar stores can trace their roots to the mid-1800s, when one-price stores became a popular way to sell clothing, jewelry and knickknacks to thrifty shoppers, said Wendy Woloson, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University. Back then, there were also 25-cent and 49-cent stores. Frank Winfield Woolworth, the founder of F.W. Woolworth Company, later built a chain of five-and-dime stores, starting with a Great Five Cent Store in Utica, N.Y.Today, many dollar stores offer steep discounts by selling leftovers from other retail outlets. But as the stores have evolved, they have also expanded their inventory with bigger chains carrying their own brands and many stores adding perishable foods. Dollar Store Services, a developer of 3,000 independent dollar stores nationally since 1992, recently introduced a model for urban neighborhoods that is part dollar store, part bodega.These no-frills stores have become a refuge for people left behind by the economic recovery, including laid-off workers, middle-class families facing rising living costs and recent college graduates burdened by huge loans. \u201cA lot of customers who traded down to dollar stores can\u2019t trade back up, or see no need, because the dollar stores meet their needs,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, an adjunct professor and director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \u201cTo them, Walmart is a luxury store.\u201dLassina Sanogo, 40, a security guard from the Bronx who earns $30,000 annually, said he always bought his cleaning supplies from a dollar store. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose a dollar,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I used to get for a dollar, now that\u2019s up to two dollars.\u201dThere is no official tally of New York City\u2019s dollar stores. But there were 1,247 variety stores, including dollar stores, in 2015, a 24 percent increase from 1,002 stores in 2005, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College. Brooklyn had the largest number of stores, with 469, followed by Queens, with 355, and the Bronx, with 224.The chains have cropped up in neighborhoods where people are struggling in an ever more expensive city, as the gap between the rich and everyone else keeps widening. In East New York, which is dotted with public housing projects, eager shoppers lined up in May for the opening of a Dollar Tree store, where nothing costs more than $1.\u201cAnytime I\u2019m out, I\u2019ll stop in and see if they have anything new,\u201d said Jeraldine Whitehurst, 54, an unemployed child care worker who shops there three times a week.Along Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn, which is known for a string of 99-cent stores, independent owners are struggling to adapt as families are replaced by singles who shop less often and are more interested in buying organic than in saving a few dollars.\u201cBusiness is very slow,\u201d said Abdul Shran, a clerk at Java Discount, who sees between 20 and 40 customers a day, less than half the traffic of a few years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to make it another month.\u201dEven so, another dollar store opened on the avenue just five months ago.

Jana has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies, like Tiffany & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb.When the investment firm began its campaign to shake up Whole Foods in April, the activist demanded four seats on the grocer\u2019s board, as well as other changes to the company\u2019s strategy.Jana\u2019s 8.2 percent stake made the hedge fund one of Whole Foods\u2019 biggest investors.Advertisement"}

Simpson\u2019s Parole", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction was reported by Jennifer Medina and Louis Keene in Los Angeles.In homes, offices, barber shops and bars, everyone seemed to have an opinion in the city that for decades has been transfixed by the former football hero\u2019s legal saga.In 1995, Mr. Simpson was acquitted in the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. But years later, a judge sentenced him to prison in a separate case: a 2007 armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel.His parole means he could be free on Oct. 1 at the earliest.In the predominantly black neighborhood of South Los Angeles, Vickie Williford, 56, whooped with joy at the news. She had supported Mr. Simpson during his murder trial and thought the sentence in the Las Vegas case was harsh \u2014 a case of \u201cwe didn\u2019t get you then but we got you now.\u201dMr. Simpson insisted Thursday, as he has before, that the robbery was simply a case of him trying to retrieve property that belonged to him.\u201cI really think he\u2019s sincere about what he says,\u201d Ms. Williford said. \u201cI really think the man was going there to get his own stuff. He made stupid moves.\u201dAt the Farmers Market bar in the Fairfax neighborhood, Tammy Reinemann, a bartender, said she wanted to avoid the broadcast of the hearing, but a customer asked for it to be turned on.\u201cHe\u2019s got no remorse for anything he\u2019s ever done in his life,\u201d Ms. Reinemann, 50, said as she watched. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand what it is to be sorry about anything.\u201dShe was stunned by the decision to grant parole. \u201cHorrifying,\u201d she said.Alex Morrow, a former football player at the University of Southern California, Mr. Simpson\u2019s alma mater, watched the hearing coverage on ESPN.\u201cI don\u2019t believe most of what he said,\u201d said Mr. Morrow, 32. \u201cI thought, there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll let this guy do anything other than spend his life in prison.\u201dBut as Mr. Morrow walked into a barbershop for a trim, he saw the news on his phone and showed it to his stylist, Nick Shaffer, 26.\u201cThe Juice is loose!\u201d Mr. Shaffer shouted. Throughout the haircut, the men discussed what might happen next.\u201cFor sure he\u2019s going to do something else, he\u2019ll cause trouble somehow,\u201d Mr. Morrow said.Perhaps it\u2019s not entirely his fault, Mr. Shaffer replied.\u201cHe\u2019s clearly a case of years of concussions from playing football,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should be studying his brain too.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Parrots commonly live in rain forests. So it may seem strange to see flocks of the bright-feathered birds in arid California.Yet thousands of parrots of at least 10 different species have made the state their home.Contrary to urban legend that they flew here, he said, the parrots came via the pet trade and were subsequently introduced into the wild \u2014 largely by accident.In some cases, caged parrots got loose from owners. In others, the thinking goes, a trader of illegal birds may have released large numbers of them to avoid being caught by the authorities.Over time, their populations thrived thanks in part to California agriculture. They\u2019re believed to have become well established in the San Gabriel Valley, for example, because its orchards offered a diet of nuts and fruits.\u201cSo basically, we brought them here and then we planted a perfect habitat for them,\u201d Mr. Garrett said.The most numerous species \u2014 with 3,000 or so members \u2014 is the red-crowned parrot, spread between Los Angeles and San Diego.Others with roughly 1,000 members or more include the mitred parakeet, yellow-chevroned parakeet and the lilac-crowned Amazon parrot.Mr. Garrett said that while parrots were not indigenous to California, he would not call them invasive because they were not known to disturb native habitats or species.The California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Gets a Tech Makeover", "Date": "2017-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlso last year, in a less publicized development, Jean Yang, 30, returned to this city after more than a decade of living in Boston, finding a Pittsburgh she hardly recognized from her 1990s childhood.These seemingly unrelated events have one thing in common: Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s School of Computer Science.Because of the top students and research professors at Carnegie Mellon, tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber have opened offices here.The big tech firms, along with their highly skilled, highly paid workers, have made Pittsburgh younger and more international and helped to transform once-derelict neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and East Liberty.\u201cI loved C.M.U., and that\u2019s the main reason why I stayed,\u201d said Mr. von Ahn, who, in addition to his role at Duolingo, is a consulting professor in the School of Computer Science.There were also business advantages to remaining: Duolingo is close to the engineering talent (\u201cC.M.U. is pumping out some of the best, at a rate of about 500 a year,\u201d Mr. von Ahn said), and for millennial job-seekers, Pittsburgh\u2019s quality-of-life-metric is looking better these days than ever-costlier, ever-more-crowded New York or San Francisco.For Mr. Wirth, the software engineer who started at Duolingo in February, Silicon Valley is a fun place to visit, but living and working in the Bay Area would be a grind.\u201cI was just there last week for a conference,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. \u201cI was talking to someone who told me, \u2018My commute is two hours on the bus.\u2019 I just can\u2019t do that.\u201dKamal Nigam, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who is the head of Google Pittsburgh, said that a decade ago, workers hired by the company had family or personal connections to the city. That is no longer the case. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people who are moving to Pittsburgh for the very first time, from all over the country and the world,\u201d Mr. Nigam said.He added, \u201cWith the growing number of start-ups and the big companies in the area, people realize they can have not just one job at a good tech company, but a tech career here.\u201dFor many years, Pittsburgh was a place 20-somethings fled or avoided. In the 1990s, Allegheny County, which includes the city, was the second-oldest large county in the United States, behind only a geriatric zone in Florida. It was a notoriously difficult place to be young and single, and an earlier generation of computer science students put in their four years at Carnegie Mellon, grabbed their diplomas and left.This is the sleepy city Jean Yang knew while growing up near the campus, where her father was a research scientist in the School of Computer Science. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize no one wanted to stay in Pittsburgh,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI was just leaving because I thought everyone wants to leave where they grew up. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come back as an adult.\u201dBut Ms. Yang\u2019s field of research is in computer programming languages, and, as she put it, \u201cC.M.U. is the best place for the kind of work I want to do.\u201d When she was offered an assistant professor position in the School of Computer Science and discovered a changed Pittsburgh on her visits back, Ms. Yang accepted the job and returned last August.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an excitement about being here,\u201d she said. \u201cI go out to eat and drink in East Liberty. Lawrenceville I go to a lot. Everywhere I go didn\u2019t exist when I was growing up.\u201dPut simply, where the tech world is going \u2014 self-driving cars; personal A.I. concierges; robot workers \u2014 is where Carnegie Mellon\u2019s faculty and students have been for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s like being in Hogwarts,\u201d said Andrew W. Moore, the dean of the School of Computer Science. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool and exciting to have these glimpses of the future, and to see all these people running around and having these crazy ideas.\u201d\u201cI get to see these cool things all the time and I\u2019m just stopping to say, \u2018Well, what does this even mean for the world?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou start thinking, \u2018Someone can use this in dance class.\u2019 Then you think: \u2018Wait. Can we use this to judge gymnastics competitions?\u2019 Then you say, \u2018Wait, couldn\u2019t we use this in securing Penn Station in New York?\u2019\u201dSpeaking of Red Whittaker, the professor who led Carnegie Mellon in winning the $2 million Darpa Urban Challenge self-driving car competition in 2007, Mr. Gutkind said, \u201cRed was into self-driving vehicles before anyone,\u201d using Carnegie Mellon\u2019s resources and reaching out to local investors for money and technical support.A legend in the robotics field, Professor Whittaker turns out also to be a gentrification pioneer: He was instrumental in locating the school\u2019s National Robotics Engineering Center in an abandoned foundry in Lawrenceville, in 1996.\u201cLawrenceville was in the lost and found, it was really rough,\u201d he said, adding that the introduction of a state-of-the-art research facility and its educated work force was, among other developments in the area, a \u201ccatalyst and galvanizing influence\u201d for the neighborhood.\u201cThe real estate and the culture of the neighborhood was a very big thing for robotics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd robotics was a very big thing for the neighborhood.\u201dWhich means even a Monocle reporter being dispatched to check out the Espresso a Mano cafe with its rotating exhibitions by local artists can be traced back to the geeks, in a six-degrees-of-Carnegie-Mellon sort of way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: HNA of China Sheds Some Light on Itself", "Date": "2017-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HNA Group, the aggressively acquisitive Chinese conglomerate that owns stakes in Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank, has long faced questions about its ownership structure.It has published a statement showing that its largest shareholder, a private businessman in China named Guan Jun, has donated his 30 percent stake to HNA\u2019s charitable organization, the Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation. The foundation now owns 52 percent of the conglomerate.Does that answer all those questions? Not really.The company did not explain who Mr. Guan is, or why he made the donation. It offered little to show how a 30-something Beijing businessman came to amass a stake bigger than those of the company\u2019s founders, and few details about the Cihang Foundation, which recently made a donation to Harvard.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Adam Tan, made a full-court press to demystify the conglomerate.\u201cI said, what happened? I don\u2019t know you. Why have you people said very bad things about us?\u201d Mr. Tan said. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d The lender, he added, is \u201c still one of the great banks in the whole world. It\u2019s first class. OK, maybe second class.\u201dHe described regulatory checks as routine and said he had not had contact with the European Central Bank regarding an assessment of HNA\u2019s stake in Deutsche Bank.Mr. Tan also said that he was unaware of a timeline on closing HNA\u2019s buyout of Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge Capital, though he did note that the regulatory process may take more than a few weeks.Speaking of the Mooch...Mr. Scaramucci, the new White House communications director, has always found a way to come back, even when it appeared that he was on the ropes. He has survived being fired by Goldman Sachs; the financial crisis, which nearly put SkyBridge out of business; and even a monthslong campaign to against his joining the Trump administration by Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s chief strategist.Not only has he come back, he has claimed a White House role, reporting directly to the president.And he managed it in spite of his history of criticizing Mr. Trump and backing other presidential candidates. Mr. Scaramucci said that his past battles with his current employer had arisen from Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on hedge funds.But above all, Mr. Scaramucci is a creature of the financial industry, and he views his new job and his new boss in much the same way: \u201cIt is a client service business. And he\u2019s my client.\u201dMany upscale labels have struggled lately with weak profits, declining mall traffic and an environment of discounting that has lost them some luster among their core customers.Shoppers who had previously been more middle market are gravitating toward the extremes \u2014 either going for cheaper and faster fashion or for very high end luxury from brands like Gucci.Michael Kors, known for more \u201caccessible\u201d luxury, is hoping to develop the Jimmy Choo brand online and open new stores.Jimmy Choo is being sold by JAB Holding, which has been reviewing its luxury holdings, including the Swiss leather goods brand Bally and the British motocross-inspired brand Belstaff, as it focuses on its food and coffee empire.Venture-backed start-ups haven\u2019t been having a great time in the public markets (think of Blue Apron, or Snap). But that hasn\u2019t stopped investors from pouring more money into budding companies.Venture capitalists put $15.7 billion into 923 investments in the second quarter of 2017, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That\u2019s the best quarter for such investments in the past 12 months.And venture firms raised $12.3 billion during the quarter, more than doubling the amount raised in the first quarter and marking the best quarter for fund-raising since March 2016.One firm accounted for a significant portion of the money: New Enterprise Associates, which raised $3.3 billion for its latest fund. That was the biggest fund-raising commitment since Warburg Pincus raised $4 billion nearly 20 years ago.Could the bookstore chain Barnes & Noble be the next company to succumb to the will of an activist investor?The reasoning? Bookstores aren\u2019t going away, and these need an owner who can invest in them.Sandell also pointed to the Amazon deal for Whole Foods as evidence that there is still value in traditional retail.Advertisement"}

Which writers to you best exemplify the form?Which writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most? While I was researching my first book (during Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election), Marcia Davenport \u2014 one of Max Perkins\u2019s authors \u2014 commented that great works of fiction tended to appear during periods of great trust, when people believed in their leaders. She cited Periclean Athens, Elizabethan England and New Deal America as examples. Conversely, she suggested that periods of distrust produced greater nonfiction, and the demand for it.What\u2019s the last book that made you laugh?The last book to make you cry?Several pieces in \u201cWorld War I and America\u201d bring me to tears. (Full disclosure: I edited this anthology for the nonprofit Library of America; and I receive no royalties.) Nurses Shirley Millard and Mary Borden wrote especially stirring descriptions of the \u201chuman wreckage\u201d they treated; but nothing moves me as much as the speech President Woodrow Wilson delivered on Memorial Day, 1919, at the American cemetery outside Paris. Standing amidst a sea of white crosses, he took complete responsibility for sending every dead soldier before him to his grave. His speech should be required reading for every commander in chief.The last book that made you furious?How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night?I read at all times \u2014 sometimes to kick-start my writing in the morning, sometimes to take a break during the day, and often when it is quietest at night. And I\u2019m a paper guy. I can do quick hits electronically; but reading a book is a tactile experience for me. And, strangely, I believe I retain more from an actual book, as I seem better able to recall a certain passage from its placement on a page and within the volume\u2026and then, of course, where I have shelved that book.How do you organize your books?Very carefully. My office houses only nonfiction: The shelves of one long wall contain literary biographies, arranged alphabetically by subject; another wall holds history, arranged chronologically; other bays have sections on law, travel, art history and reference books. Another room hosts Hollywood biographies and histories, shelved alphabetically by subject; and another (smaller) room has fiction, alphabetically by author. Poetry (by author) rests in the bedroom.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?Gray\u2019s Anatomy, which I consult regularly. I sometimes think I might have become a doctor \u2014 if only that didn\u2019t require courses in biology, physics and organic chemistry. Oh\u2026and med school.

Antihero or villain? Since age 15, I have lived under the spell of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote de la Mancha. I don\u2019t do antiheroes.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I guess this reveals a life-path with few detours, but the first books that spoke to me were the Landmark books, that inspirational series of biographies for young readers. No. 1 in the collection was Christopher Columbus; and while my elementary-school mates had their Hardy Boys and Tom Swift, at age 8, I started blazing through the lives of Jefferson and Lincoln and Edison and the Wright brothers. Only years later did I come to recognize that these books were written by the likes of Quentin Reynolds and John Gunther and MacKinlay Kantor. I also veered into \u201chistorical fiction\u201d with Robert Lawson\u2019s \u201cBen and Me,\u201d a portrait of Franklin (as narrated by his Good Mouse Amos), \u201cMr. Revere and I\u201d (as revealed by his horse), \u201cCaptain Kidd\u2019s Cat.\u201d (You get the idea.) And I think I can still recite several poems from Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s \u201cChild\u2019s Garden of Verses.\u201dIf you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

He might consider boning up on Article I, Section 3 and Article II, Section 4.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?If I could invite F. Scott Fitzgerald, my literary god, just for cocktails (after which, I believe, he becomes less fun), and if I could have a postprandial sherry with Miguel de Cervantes\u2026I would reserve seats at the dinner table for political writers, because I think this moment demands as much. I\u2019d like to sit down with: James Madison, who could discuss his intentions in the Constitution and the Federalist Papers; Frederick Douglass (\u201csomebody who\u2019s done an amazing job\u201d), who might talk us through the persistent problem of race relations in this country; and Eleanor Roosevelt, because we seem to have lost our sense of compassion, if not our moral compass.What do you plan to read next?

{"Headline": "Facebook, Seeking to Satisfy Publishers, May Let Them Charge for Articles", "Date": "2017-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is working on a new tool that could help drive subscriptions to news organizations that publish articles directly on the online service, an effort to improve the fraught relationship between the social giant and media companies.The tool would be added to Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles product, which allows publishers to post news articles that can be read within Facebook rather than on the publisher\u2019s website.The discussions about the tool are still in the early stages, according to two people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were not public. But it is possible that Facebook could produce a metered pay wall product similar to those used by some publishers. After reading 10 New York Times articles on Facebook, for instance, a user could be sent to The Times\u2019s subscription sign-up page.Facebook plans to start a pilot with a small group of publishers using the tool in October and to expand the initiative in 2018 if early results are promising. It was not clear which publishers might participate in the test.\u201cWe are in early talks with several news publishers about how we might better support subscription business models on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cAs part of the Facebook Journalism Project, we are taking the time to work closely together with our partners and understand their needs.\u201dWhile nearly all publishers have shifted their attention to increasing digital revenue, most are still seeking profitable solutions that will work in the long term.Although many publishers recognize the importance of online platforms for getting their content in front of broad audiences, there are also drawbacks. Publishers are concerned about losing valuable ties to their readers, particularly subscriber data and payment connections. Readers may also become accustomed to staying in Facebook to consume news, instead of, say, navigating directly to publishers\u2019 sites.At the same time, Facebook has drawn criticism, particularly from publishers, for its role in distributing untrue articles that readers can mistake for real news.It is not clear if Facebook will benefit financially from a news subscription feature. The company does not intend to take a cut of payments to news outlets, according to one of the people familiar with the talks. Facebook indirectly benefits, however, by encouraging people to spend more time on its site; while they are there, those users will see more ads.As more publishers move toward subscription models, a news subscription service like the one Facebook has proposed could work to their advantage by driving more casual readers to pay for news.But it could have risks. If many news outlets participate in the feature, it could create a bundling effect, allowing readers to read potentially hundreds of free articles a month \u2014 10 from The New York Times, 10 from The Washington Post, 10 from The Wall Street Journal, and so on \u2014 before they are asked to pay.An earlier version of this article misidentified the news outlet that first reported Facebook\u2019s plan to introduce a new subscription tool. It was The Wall Street Journal, not Digiday.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}
