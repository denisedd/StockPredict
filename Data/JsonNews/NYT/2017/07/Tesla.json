{"Headline": "As Party Drifts Left, Pragmatic Democratic Governors Have Eye on White House", "Date": "2017-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Many elected Democrats have drifted left since the party\u2019s shattering defeat last November, turning to a brand of progressive politics that is closer to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s democratic socialism than the more market-friendly liberalism that characterized the Obama era.But when the nation\u2019s governors gathered here over the weekend for their annual summer meeting, a group of pragmatic Democrats took center stage. And now one of them is taking the first steps toward seeking the presidency in 2020.\u201cI believe the time is right to lend my voice, the voice of someone that after getting elected has been able to govern in what\u2019s viewed as a red state,\u201d Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana said in an interview. \u201cSome of the things that I\u2019ve been able to do in Montana can also translate beyond just the state\u2019s border.\u201dMr. Bullock is creating a federal political action committee, Big Sky Values PAC, that will offer a political infrastructure to let him meet Democratic donors, contribute to the party\u2019s candidates and fund his out-of-state electoral travels.As is typical for most potential candidates this far out from the next White House campaign, he said it was premature to discuss whether he would actually run.Yet Mr. Bullock already has the makings of a national stump speech. He boasts about his progressive accomplishments with a Republican-dominated legislature: He expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, cutting the rate of the state\u2019s uninsured by over half, implemented stricter campaign finance laws and made Montana one of the few states to increase support for higher education.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks out there talking that are a lot older than middle-aged guys like me,\u201d said Mr. Bullock, 51, alluding to some of the party\u2019s best-known figures.And if the contrast with the likes of Mr. Sanders, 75, were not obvious enough, the governor held up one of his accomplishments against one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s calling cards.\u201cWe can talk free college for all all we want, but there\u2019s a whole lot of people that can get a darn good job, like in Montana, out of an apprenticeship,\u201d Mr. Bullock said, citing programs he has supported as governor. \u201cSixty-thousand-dollar average salary, and they\u2019re making money while they\u2019re getting there.\u201dHe also said he was uneasy about immediately implementing another of Mr. Sanders\u2019s signature promises, Medicare for all.He may be more overt about his ambitions, but Mr. Bullock was by no means the only Democratic governor here eyeing the White House.Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, the chairman of the National Governors Association, exuberantly led a panel that drew Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk, with an eye toward raising his profile. The host governor, Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, may also be open to a presidential run.And while each is from a decidedly more Democratic state than Mr. Bullock, both are also unapologetic, business-friendly pragmatists with a focus on economic development that borders on obsessive.Mr. McAuliffe will not retreat from his support for free trade pacts, slyly noting that he stands with \u201cthe president\u201d (as in: Barack Obama) on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.And Ms. Raimondo, noting that \u201call I\u2019m doing is jobs,\u201d recalled with a touch of incredulity how she recently gave an economic speech and was told afterward by attendees that it was \u201crisky\u201d to \u201chave that pro-growth, pro-job message as a Democrat.\u201dRecounting her efforts to promote apprenticeships in Rhode Island\u2019s shipyards, Ms. Raimondo echoed Mr. Bullock on free college for all. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they ever go and get a four-year degree or not,\u201d she said, warning her party not to be \u201csnobby\u201d about higher education.The challenge for the would-be presidential contenders on the center left, however, can be found in how Mr. Trump found success.Unlike Republican nominees before him, the president ran on a platform of racially tinged nationalism, vowing to tear up trade deals and protect entitlements while using language rarely heard from mainstream politicians about minority communities.In attempting to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, many Democrats have therefore chalked it up to his racial demagogy and rhetorical populism. They find the first of these tactics reprehensible, but many have an impulse to counter the president with their own, more robust brand of populism.This reaction does not point toward budget-balancing governors preaching pragmatism.Yet the whims of political fate can be fickle.After the 2004 election, Democrats\u2019 second consecutive presidential loss, some in the party believed that they could win in 2008 only by nominating a red-state centrist. They won with an African-American Chicagoan named Barack Hussein Obama.And after their own back-to-back presidential defeats, Republicans said after 2012 that the path back to the White House could be found in nominating a candidate better able to connect with the younger and more diverse rising American electorate. Enter Mr. Trump.So there may be hope yet for Mr. Bullock, a former state attorney general whose down-home boosterism about Montana\u2019s natural wonders belies a Columbia Law degree and stint as a Washington lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson. He has already started on the Democratic speaking circuit, appearing before a Center for American Progress forum in May. Next week, he will attend another donor-filled gathering on the \u201cDivided States of America\u201d at the Aspen Institute.To the barricades it is not.\u201cThe values folks want is for government to run its own budgets and be as careful with their money as a family is with their own,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: The Ambitions of Kamala Harris", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Matt Flegenheimer, a reporter based in Washington.Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, seems to consider herself a stickler for precision in language.A former prosecutor, she has infused the Senate hearings into possible Trump administration ties to Russia with surgical, aggressive questioning.As one of many Democrats hoping to stop the Senate health care bill, she has chafed at the euphemism that Americans would \u201close\u201d their coverage under the plan.So when Ms. Harris ducks questions about her national ambitions \u2014 she has been rumored as one of many Democrats considering a presidential run in 2020 \u2014 the implication is quite clear.A lawyer might point out that this is a few beats short of a \u201cno.\u201dShe is trying to build her profile as an opposition force to President Trump while observing at least some traditional Senate norms for newcomers. Among them: She would not agree to be interviewed for the article \u2014 in part, it seems, to avoid any suggestion that she is courting attention.The Times tried anyway, to little effect. At a congressional softball game last month, I approached Ms. Harris, identified myself and was politely informed that she would gladly discuss the game and the game only. She was persuaded to expand the dialogue to: her new Spotify playlist (\u201cThere\u2019s some good stuff in the \u201980s and then there\u2019s some stuff that just wasn\u2019t so great\u201d) and an aide\u2019s new puppy, before heading off to the lawmakers\u2019 dugout.Before she got away, I asked about the pink pom-pom in her hand. \u201cI was never a cheerleader in school,\u201d she said, \u201cso I thought, it\u2019s never too late.\u201dDemocrats do not expect her to stay on the sidelines often.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The Central Coast misses out on some of the big-name live entertainment that people might take for granted in Los Angeles and San Francisco.The nearly 15,000 available tickets sold out in a blistering 30 seconds.That led organizers to announce a second show on the same night, which also sold out in less than a minute.The summertime fair dates back to 1946 and has hosted megastars such as Justin Bieber, Britney Spears and Aerosmith.But fair organizers said none has ever sold out as swiftly as Mr. Brooks, who is also playing several shows this month in Inglewood (with tickets still remaining).\u201cBut it\u2019s definitely big here,\u201d he said of the Central Coast. \u201cCal Poly is a big agriculture school, we\u2019ve got farmland on either side of us, a big rodeo.

{"Headline": "Britain to Ban New Diesel and Gas Cars by 2040", "Date": "2017-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Scrambling to combat a growing air pollution crisis, Britain announced on Wednesday that sales of new diesel and gas cars would reach the end of the road by 2040, the latest step in Europe\u2019s battle against the damaging environmental impact of the internal combustion engine.\u201cIt is important that we all gear up for a significant change which deals not just with the problems to health caused by emissions, but the broader problems caused in terms of accelerating climate change,\u201d Michael Gove, the country\u2019s environment secretary, told the BBC.Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, promised a \u201cgreen revolution in transport,\u201d adding that the government wanted nearly every car and van on Britain\u2019s roads to have zero emissions by 2050.The strategy document was published after a protracted legal battle in which ministers were ordered by the courts to produce new plans to tackle illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.In France, the promise to end sales of traditional cars was made as part of a renewed commitment to the Paris accord.Frederik Dahlmann, assistant professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, described Wednesday\u2019s announcement as \u201can important step\u201d that set a clear long-term target, and \u201calso gives car buyers an incentive to consider the different types of engine options available in light of the long-term development of the market.\u201dStill, he said, the long-term nature of the announcement left a significant question hanging: \u201cHow does the government intend to improve air quality and reduce transport related emissions in the short term?\u201dCritics, including Ed Miliband, a former leader of the opposition Labour Party and an ex-environment secretary, argued that the government was failing to tackle the current pollution crisis.Another former environment secretary, Ed Davey of the centrist Liberal Democrats, described the government\u2019s failure to commit to a plan to compensate diesel car owners who scrap or retrofit highly polluting vehicles as a \u201cshameful betrayal.\u201dOthers also say the country\u2019s efforts are not aggressive enough \u2014 France has also set 2040 as its target, but Norway intends to sell only electric cars from 2025, and India wants to do so by 2030.Cars typically have a life span of around 15 years, so even if Britain follows through with its target, conventional engines are likely to be on the country\u2019s roads more than a decade later.Britain\u2019s decision is, however, the latest indication of how swiftly governments and the public in Europe have turned against diesel and internal combustion engines in general.Automakers, though reluctant to abandon technologies that have served them well for more than a century, are increasingly resigned to the demise of engines that run on fossil fuels. They are investing heavily in battery-powered cars as they realize their traditional business is threatened by Tesla or emerging Chinese companies, which have a lead in electric car technology.The shift away from internal combustion engines is in large part a result of growing awareness of the health hazards of diesel.Cities like Madrid, Munich and Stuttgart are considering diesel bans. Sales of diesel cars are plunging. Political leaders are under pressure to end the de facto subsidies of diesel fuel that prevail in Europe.European countries kept taxes on diesel lower than on gasoline in the belief that it was kinder to the planet. Diesel engines do spew less carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming, than gasoline engines. But they produce more nitrogen oxides, a family of gases that cause asthma and are responsible for the smog that sometimes blankets London and other major cities.Rather than encourage a shift back to gasoline cars, governments and automakers are focusing increasingly on electric cars. They are the only vehicles that emit neither nitrogen oxides like diesel nor large amounts of carbon dioxide like gasoline.But the impending shift has raised doubts about whether countries like Britain will be able to create the infrastructure, and generate the electricity, needed for such a radical change in the way people travel.Jack Cousens, a spokesman for Britain\u2019s largest motoring organization, the AA, said there would need to be \u201csignificant investment in order to install charging points across the country, especially fast-charge points,\u201d and added that it was questionable whether the electricity grid \u201ccould cope with a mass switch-on after the evening rush hour.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Wolfsburg, Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecticut Should Be Tesla Country", "Date": "2017-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorYet Connecticut is a surprising laggard when it comes to one obvious way to cut carbon emissions: Consumers are not allowed to buy electric vehicles without a costly middleman. Connecticut is one of at least six states that bans carmakers \u2014 including Tesla, the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles \u2014 from opening their own storefronts and selling their cars directly to consumers.With cities and states moving to the forefront of the climate battle as the federal government steps back, even small regulatory changes, like allowing carmakers to sell electric vehicles directly to the public, could have an outsize impact.The culprit? Heavy lobbying by the state\u2019s car dealerships.Since manipulating public policy to increase profits is hard to defend publicly, bottleneckers rely on other arguments.The failure to legalize direct sales by Tesla is a testament to how archaic laws stifle entrepreneurship and limit consumer choice. If America wants to combat climate change, it needs to take on bottleneckers and change its climate for innovation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Self-Driving Cars Near, Washington Plays Catch-Up", "Date": "2017-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSelf-driving cars are zooming at breakneck speed toward America\u2019s roadways, and Washington is finally reaching for its seatbelt.For years, the race to create fully autonomous vehicles went mostly unnoticed by federal lawmakers, who tended to speak of self-driving cars (if they spoke of them at all) as something out of \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d It was an odd blind spot, given how close companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit were to creating mass-market autonomous vehicles, and how many important industries \u2014 taxi driving, long-haul trucking and shipping among them \u2014 stood to be drastically transformed as a result.But now, lawmakers are taking cautious steps toward the driverless future.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who supports the House\u2019s self-driving car bill, told me that lawmakers had been prompted to act by concerns about economic competitiveness, in addition to the promise of safer roads.\u201cThese vehicles are going to be developed, and I want to make sure we\u2019re developing them in this country, not China, India or the European Union,\u201d said Ms. Dingell, a former auto lobbyist and General Motors executive whose district includes the headquarters of Ford Motor Company. \u201cThe challenge for this country, period, is how we stay at the forefront of innovation and technology.\u201dRegulating self-driving cars is a tricky balancing act. Crack down too hard, and you risk stalling the development of a potentially lifesaving technology. Go easy, and you risk letting unsafe vehicles onto public roads before they\u2019re adequately tested. There are cybersecurity risks to address, too, since autonomous vehicles will be connected wirelessly to the internet and could be susceptible to hacking. The House bill would require manufacturers of new autonomous systems to submit security plans for their self-driving cars, as well as meet basic safety standards.\u201cPeople want to feel like they\u2019re in control of their destiny,\u201d said Elliot Katz, a lawyer at DLA Piper who works on self-driving car issues. Mr. Katz said federal regulation could help convince consumers that autonomous vehicles are safe.\u201cWe need rules and regulations so that the driving public knows this isn\u2019t just the Wild West,\u201d he said.Right now, the benefits of self-driving cars are clear and concrete \u2014 fewer traffic deaths, easier commutes, the ability to safely use your phone while you drive \u2014 while the costs remain largely theoretical. But experts have warned that the self-driving car revolution could usher in sweeping economic changes, including the displacement of millions of workers. Roughly 1.7 million Americans drive long-haul trucks for a living, and another 1.7 million people drive taxis, buses and other commercial vehicles. When autonomous vehicles render many of those jobs obsolete, politicians will have a much bigger set of problems to contend with.\u201cGovernments have largely focused on the legality of automated driving,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. \u201cThey should also pay attention to the broader challenges and opportunities of automated driving \u2014 what it means for our lives, our governments, our land use, our cities, our social services, our jobs and how we live.\u201dThe politics of autonomous driving will almost certainly become messier as self-driving cars edge closer to widespread use. There will be safety and security worries, intra-industry squabbles and backlash from driver unions concerned about job loss. The self-driving car could become a politically polarizing symbol, with some Americans cheering it as a technological miracle and others viewing it as a nanny-state intrusion into individual liberty. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that one day a politician might run for office on a \u201cMake America Drive Again\u201d platform.But for now, as self-driving cars peek over the horizon and gridlock seizes Capitol Hill, lawmakers just seem happy to have found something \u2014 anything \u2014 to agree on.\u201cIt\u2019s sexy, and that carries issues a long way,\u201d Mr. Smith said of the self-driving car movement. \u201cA hot, potentially even bipartisan subject can be more appealing than the mundane.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The South Park Commons Fills a Hole in the Tech Landscape", "Date": "2017-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ruchi Sanghvi was the first female engineer at Facebook, where she helped create the news feed that now serves as the primary window into the world\u2019s largest social network. Then she built a start-up of her own and sold it to another rising Silicon Valley company, Dropbox, becoming one of its first female executives. But as she left Dropbox in 2014, she didn\u2019t know what she would do next.At 32, she wanted a better way of deciding where her career would go. She wanted an environment where she could freely explore new ideas among her peers without feeling the pressure to start another project immediately.As the months passed, she never quite found that kind of personal think tank, but she came to realize that many old friends and colleagues felt much the same way. Her next project became an effort to help people find their next project.The result is South Park Commons. Housed in an old townhouse on the oval park at the heart of the San Francisco tech scene, the Commons is a selected community of entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers and others. Ms. Sanghvi describes it as tech\u2019s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Junto club, a means of shaping new ideas through conversation and shared experience.It\u2019s also a way of preparing for the future.\u201cYou get a couple of shots in life to do something meaningful and impactful. Why not take the time to identify that?\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said during a recent conversation inside the Commons, a high-ceilinged space decorated by local artists. \u201cIt is very easy to fall into the traps of Silicon Valley \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s start a company,\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s invest\u2019 \u2014 without giving it a second thought.\u201dThe Commons is a bit like the hacker spaces that have long thrived in the Valley \u2014 places where coders and makers gather to build new software and hardware \u2014 but it moves beyond that familiar concept. Its founder, for one thing, is a female engineer turned entrepreneur turned executive.Today\u2019s tech industry also provides an extra degree of economic freedom, said Ms. Sanghvi, whose husband, Aditya Agarwal, also has a long history in Silicon Valley and is now the chief technology officer at Dropbox.Many tech workers were stuck with their companies for years, waiting for an initial public offering. Now they can easily sell their shares on private markets, and that means they have more opportunity to explore new ventures. At the same time, the path to the next venture is less obvious, as companies shift toward very different types of technology, most notably artificial intelligence, or A.I., which is rapidly changing the way the world builds software.The rub is that the talent needed to build and deploy these techniques is scarce, so much so that the likes of Google and Facebook are running classes to educate their employees in this new way of doing things. The Commons provides both a physical and a social environment where others can learn in similar ways.Ms. Sanghvi recruits people to the Commons solely by word of mouth, and they join merely by showing up and contributing a few hundred dollars in dues, to pay for items like coffee, snacks and paper towels and to fund regular events at the townhouse.When Cinjon Resnick arrived at the Commons last year after moving to San Francisco from New York, it was already cultivating an interest in neural networks and other A.I. techniques. He was among those who spent several months exploring the field, reading and discussing the latest research papers, and organizing lectures and workshops at the Commons.Many groups strive for this dynamic of exploration and dialogue, but for Mr. Resnick, the Commons succeeded. \u201cIt\u2019s a loosely structured place where people can come and form ideas,\u201d he said during a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all wanted.\u201dBut this arrangement has other byproducts. Ms. Qiu is one of three female founders who have emerged from the Commons. Though Ms. Sanghvi said the organization still needed more women, her presence and the group dynamic are at least a step toward that future.\u201cThis is collaborative learning,\u201d said Nilanjana Dasgupta, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studies how social environments affect career paths, particularly in science and technology. \u201cThat can feel more satisfying for women in a culture like Silicon Valley.\u201dMr. Resnick and other alumni of the Commons say this vibe exists because Ms. Sanghvi takes such a strong hand in guiding her creation. With a style both endearing and remarkably direct, she runs the community the way a good parent raises a child.She pays for the townhouse, giving the group a place to meet and work each day, and she lays down the rules. She demands regular lunches, dinners and other events, like the early lecture on A.I. from a Silicon Valley veteran, Keith Adams, who is the chief architect of Slack, or a recent presentation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable organization started by Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.\u201cEvents give you an excuse to talk to each other,\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said. \u201cThey make you feel like you\u2019re working on something together.\u201dBut she also sets limits.

{"Headline": "How to Soothe Luxury-Car Buyers: Add Perks and Subtract Haggling", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe automobile \u2014 connected to the internet, powered by electricity, driven with computer support \u2014 is evolving faster than at any point in its history.Buying one, though, remains just about the same as always.But luxury dealers are betting that technology, and a healthy dose of more personal interaction, can vastly reduce bad buying experiences.\u201cHow do I have a sustainable business when everyone laughs thinking about car salespeople?\u201d asked Peter Cooper, owner of Lexus of Lehigh Valley, in Allentown, Pa. \u201cWe\u2019re so out of touch with the consumer.\u201dAware that many buyers hate haggling, Lexus introduced a fixed-price program in May 2016, called Lexus Plus, in which the customer deals with only one person from beginning to end. Only 10 of its 238 dealers in the United States are involved so far; another three are preparing to enter.\u201cBuyers won\u2019t have to wait 45 minutes to see a finance director,\u201d said Jim Dunn, general manager for JM Lexus of Margate, Fla., the world\u2019s highest-volume Lexus dealer, which will offer Lexus Plus. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put your best price up front and live with that.\u201dAt Mr. Cooper\u2019s dealership, the program has been well received. Unit sales are up 28.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.Not getting a straight answer on price is one reason Will Kunkel, who wanted to acquire three new Audis for his family, left two dealerships in disgust.\u201cThe first dealer told me that I had to buy immediately because the car would be gone that night,\u201d Mr. Kunkel said. \u201cAnd the second would only talk about monthly payments rather than price. They may as well call you an idiot to your face.\u201dCadillac is testing a program whereby customers never buy any particular vehicle at all. Instead, they buy rights to a car and can change which one they want to drive using a mobile app.Book by Cadillac, being tested in New York City, offers the ability to switch among Cadillac models up to 18 times per year. Using the Book app, customers can reserve a vehicle that, if it is available, will be delivered the next morning to the location of their choice.The program costs $1,500 per month, which includes registration, insurance, service and repairs. All vehicles, including the Escalade, CT6, XT5, CTS-V and ATS-V, have high-end trims, plus a 4G LTE connection and hot spot, OnStar and satellite radio.About 8,000 people have asked to be part of the program, the company said. And the high-tech, no-commitment approach has attracted younger drivers: Although the average age of a Cadillac owner is 62, the average age of those signing up for Book is 34, 90 percent of them first-time Cadillac drivers.\u201cWe\u2019re a Netflix for cars,\u201d said Melody Lee, Cadillac\u2019s director of brand marketing.When customers do go to a dealership to buy, they have often done research online before leaving home, industry experts say. That makes it harder for dealers to keep the upper hand when discussing typical prices, features or available inventory.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge for dealers when customers have instant access to vehicle information,\u201d said Chris Sutton, vice president for United States automotive retail practice at the research firm J. D. Power.Alfa Romeo, trying to make a comeback in the United States, is arming its dealers\u2019 sales teams with iPads to help them communicate on more equal terms with their customers, said Pieter Hogeveen, director of Alfa Romeo North America.Lincoln Motor Company, Ford\u2019s luxury division, is approaching the problem of selling to a well-informed, focused public by reshaping a car sale as a luxury experience. Customers don\u2019t want to submit themselves to one salesperson to haggle with, then to a closer and finally to a finance manager, surrendering the better part of a day.\u201cFor affluent customers, time is the key thing; it\u2019s their ultimate luxury,\u201d said Kumar Galhotra, Lincoln\u2019s president.To reduce the time that people spend buying and servicing their vehicles, Lincoln is offering at-home test drives and service pickups and deliveries. Customers can even evaluate a vehicle over the weekend.Such convenience-based initiatives are part of Lincoln\u2019s Black Label program, a sales and service package that was first offered in 2014 and is available at 106 of the company\u2019s 800 dealers, in 29 states.Black Label models have certain levels of trim and are offered in unique color and fabric combinations. Sales representatives visit customers at their homes or businesses with a sample swatch kit to determine how the car will look inside. Once purchased, Black Label vehicles are picked up and delivered for servicing, and replaced with a loaner car.Lincoln\u2019s theory is that a good sales process continues after the sale, so the company offers additional features to keep customers coming back.One example: The company is also testing a chauffeur service in Miami and San Diego. For $30 an hour, drivers will take customers, in their own vehicles, anywhere they wish to go \u2014 a useful feature for those who can\u2019t drive after doctor\u2019s appointments or a night on the town or simply have too much to do. The chauffeur can also handle shopping trips or pick up the kids at a soccer practice.\u201cIn the Black Label program, we\u2019re getting wealthier, substantially younger customers,\u201d Mr. Galhotra said. \u201cCompared to the mid-50s age for luxury car buyers in general, our Black Label customers are mostly in their 40s.\u201dThat is the kind of program that Mr. Kunkel, creative director at Grayling, a public relations firm based in New York, would have welcomed. He walked out of two dealerships before finding an online price at a third-party website to lease two vehicles and buy a third.\u201cI told the dealer I didn\u2019t want to haggle,\u201d Mr. Kunkel said. \u201cI was not going to buy mudguards. They said they\u2019re a no-haggle dealership.\u201dHe then got the dealership to agree to his price without even stepping through the front door.Advertisement"}

Among them:\u2022 Dr. Puliafito commonly used hard drugs. At times, he was seen swallowing what was said to be an ecstasy pill and inhaling smoke from a methamphetamine pipe.\u2022 A man who was living in an addiction treatment facility said Dr. Puliafito, a friend of his, had given him meth.\u2022 A woman who worked as a prostitute said she and Dr. Puliafito, who is married, had become \u201cconstant companions\u201d after meeting in 2015.Dr. Puliafito resigned as dean last year not long after the woman, Sarah Warren, overdosed while the pair were at a Pasadena hotel.

An attempt by The New York Times to reach him on Sunday was unsuccessful.The university has said it was unaware of the troubles swirling around the doctor.On Sunday, a Los Angeles Times report cast doubt on the university\u2019s eagerness to confront the Puliafito matter.In March, it sent an email to C.L. Max Nikias, the university president, that referred to meth being found in a hotel room registered to Dr. Puliafito.That email, along with multiple other requests for comment, went unanswered, the newspaper said.On Sunday, The New York Times asked the university to discuss the latest Los Angeles Times report and other questions about Dr. Puliafito.

{"Headline": "Homelessness, Poverty and Injustice: Touring Hong Kong\u2019s Darker Side", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 Among the crowds on Kweilin Street in the run-down Hong Kong neighborhood of Sham Shui Po, Alla Lau darted between street signs, peering at the backs of them until she found what she was looking for. She beckoned a group of tourists, mostly white, in flip-flops and with American accents.\u201cThere,\u201d Ms. Lau said, pointing to a handwritten white sticker in Chinese characters that referred to the grimy building across the street. It was an advertisement for one of Hong Kong\u2019s notorious cage apartments, where, for as little as 1,200 Hong Kong dollars a month (about $154), people could rent a cage to sleep in, stacked three deep, with barely space to sit up.The group Ms. Lau led had signed up for a tour of the less glamorous underbelly of this fabulously wealthy city. Over the course of three hours, tourists learned about Hong Kong\u2019s underpaid foreign domestic workers, its freewheeling street vendors and the suicides afflicting young students pressured by their parents to succeed in school.Despite the horrid conditions in the cage apartments, Ms. Lau said, they still were not cheap. Per square foot, the monthly rent was more than that of the costlier apartments in Hong Kong, one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets, and many people living in the cages make far less than the city\u2019s monthly median income, roughly 12,000 Hong Kong dollars a month, or about $1,540.But there was already an edge to the trip.Shepherding the tourists past Filipino and Indonesian domestic servants, Ms. Lau quietly told her group that these women were not covered by Hong Kong\u2019s minimum wage; different, lower pay scales applied to them. Tourists calculated the amount into their local currencies and expressed surprise and dismay.Ms. Lau was inspired to become a tour guide in Hong Kong while backpacking around Europe; she took a tour of Sofia, Bulgaria, that highlighted the city\u2019s darker side.Determined to bring a similar experience to Hong Kong, she joined a tour company as a guide in her native city, but she was disappointed that the script she was given did not delve beneath the surface. She was not interested in telling tourists where to shop.Ms. Lau jumped ship to Hong Kong Free Tours when she was offered the chance to share with visitors the problems she and her friends faced, including the struggle to make ends meet.\u201cPeople come to Hong Kong for three or four days and see Tesla, Mercedes, skyscrapers in Central, all the things the government tries so hard to promote,\u201d she said.\u201cIf I was a tourist, I\u2019d see those things, how expensive everything is here, and think, \u2018Hong Kong people must have a really good life,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s one side of Hong Kong. It isn\u2019t telling a lot of people\u2019s stories.\u201dAs the tour wound deeper into Kowloon, the broad peninsula that points toward the sparkling towers of Hong Kong Island, Ms. Lau discussed the city\u2019s housing crisis. She stopped outside real estate agencies to explain the prices, instead of taking the group down the \u201csneaker street\u201d favored by bargain-seeking tourists.Ducking into the foyer of a landmark-listed building that houses a training school, Ms. Lau talked about the intense pressure on students, which, she said, was partly to blame for the city\u2019s youth suicide rate.She led the group through ramshackle, makeshift shelters on Tung Chau Street, a homeless community on the edge of Sham Shui Po, first warning people not to take photos.\u201cThis is their home,\u201d she said.Alessandro Dutto, 23, and Andrea Pertoldi, 24, two Italian backpackers, showed up after seeing a flier for the tour in their hostel, even though a fellow tourist told them not to bother because there was \u201cnothing to see\u201d in this part of the city.\u201cIt was one of the most interesting things we could have done here,\u201d Mr. Pertoldi said.When the three-hour walking tour ended, Ms. Lau, still smiling, collected tips; the tours are free, but customers can choose to pay. Some disappeared back into Hong Kong\u2019s subway system, where they could emerge 10 minutes later back in the heart of the island\u2019s wealthy Central shopping district, with its air-conditioned Louis Vuitton and Armani stores.Ms. Lau grew up not far from the tours she leads, in a public housing estate in Wong Tai Sin. There, her parents live in the same two-bedroom apartment where she once shared a bedroom with her sister and brother.Her life is now much easier than those of her parents at her age, but Hong Kong\u2019s high cost of living means the glittering central mecca that tourists frequent is out of her reach.\u201cNo one I know goes for lunch in Central or Admiralty,\u201d she said of the main business area on Hong Kong Island.During the next day\u2019s tour, she added a dose of the latest political developments, hoping, she said, that when Hong Kong reaches another breaking point, the tourists on her tour will see it on the news and feel a connection to the place.\u201cThis city is not going to go quietly, the way that the government wanted it to,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is anger here, and something has to happen, something big. I don\u2019t know if it will be protests, demonstrations, revolution, or something else.\u201dCheryl Dilks, originally from Boulder, Colo., and now living in Guam, took the tour while visiting Hong Kong for the first time. She said it was refreshing to hear Ms. Lau\u2019s perspective.\u201cThis side of the city would be hard to see as an outsider,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks pretty clean everywhere, and you don\u2019t see a lot of homeless people. So for her to explain the inequities to us is something I was really thankful for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Cars Offer More Models, but Find Fewer Buyers", "Date": "2017-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last several years, luxury carmakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz have added a dizzying array of variations to their model lines, in hopes of attracting buyers from rival brands.But the strategy is not working out.Fresh evidence of the auto industry\u2019s woes arrived on Monday, when automakers reported that sales of new cars and trucks declined by 3 percent in June from a year earlier, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. And luxury cars were no exception.In recent years, the industry has been riding high, with low gasoline prices pushing buyers toward bigger \u2014 and for companies, more profitable \u2014 cars like sport utility vehicles and trucks. But the luxury sector, so often a bright spot in automakers\u2019 earnings, has lost its sheen.\u201cThe luxury industry is pretty flat right now,\u201d said William Fay, senior vice president of automotive operations for Toyota North America.Among the luxury brands, BMW suffered a decline of 2.8 percent last month, while sales at Mercedes-Benz fell slightly and Toyota\u2019s Lexus division reported that its new-vehicle sales fell 5 percent.The challenges to the category have not been for lack of variety. The BMW 3 Series compact, for example, is now available as a four-door sedan, a hatchback, a station wagon, a diesel and a plug-in hybrid. Other variants made from the same basic parts but called the 4 Series include a convertible, a two-door coupe and a four-door coupe.Still, sales of BMW 3 and 4 cars plunged 24 percent in 2016 and have fallen another 8 percent this year.\u201cBMW\u2019s goal was to increase market share but it\u2019s turned out to be a little bit of cannibalization,\u201d said Shujaat Siddiqui, general manager at Dave Walter BMW in Akron, Ohio. \u201cBMW customers are just moving from one model to another,\u201d he added, but the brand has been unable to bring in new buyers and expand its market share.To a lesser extent, Mercedes has also expanded its offerings of sport utility vehicles. It enjoyed a big jump in S.U.V. sales last year, but in the first half of this year they have fallen about 2.3 percent \u2014 at a time when overall sales of S.U.V.s and lighter versions called crossovers are soaring.The proliferation of models is just one of the problems that luxury-car makers are facing. Another is that American consumers now strongly prefer S.U.V.s and crossovers and are moving away from cars, the traditional strength of the premium brands. \u201cWe are getting to a point where the market is pushing close to 65 percent trucks,\u201d once S.U.V.s and minivans are included, Mr. Fay said.Mr. Fay said Lexus would kick off new sales promotions, including increases in subsidized leases and financing offers, to push Lexus sales through the summer. Two luxury rivals, Acura and Infiniti, saw big gains in June sales after offering discounts and other deals.Luxury-car makers began to grab an increasing slice of the American car market as baby boomers reached their peak income years and splurged on upscale automobiles. In 2007, they had 11.8 percent of the market, up from about 9 percent in 2001.After the recession, they developed new models in an attempt to continue the upward trend. Cadillac added a new compact, the ATS. BMW built a small electric car, the i3. Mercedes developed an entry model, the CLA, to sell for about $30,000 and compete with mainstream cars like the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry.They had some initial success, but many models introduced in the last several years are now floundering. In June, sales of Cadillac\u2019s ATS were just 1,185, 37 percent fewer than in the same period a year ago. BMW i3 sales this year have totaled fewer than 3,000 cars, less than half the pace of two years ago. At Mercedes-Benz, sales of the CLA declined 8 percent in June \u2014 and are down 37 percent in the first six months of the year.\u201cIn some ways, their strategy has backfired on them,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com.As consumers flock to S.U.V.s, manufacturers are also finding that luxury buyers are not as enthralled with horsepower and racetrack handling anymore.\u201cThe idea of what makes a luxury brand has changed,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cA fast zero-to-60 time used to be important for any luxury car. But if you\u2019re buying an all-wheel drive S.U.V., nobody really cares about that.\u201dTesla, with its semiautonomous Autopilot technology, has become a serious competitive threat to more established premium makes, she added. \u201cLuxury doesn\u2019t have to be defined by how many cylinders or how many gears you have. For a lot of buyers, being really high tech and having this self-driving capability is luxury.\u201dBut more difficulties for the luxury brands may be on the way. Their efforts to sell new cars this year are facing increased competition from used cars that were leased two or three years ago and have been turned in to dealers. Many have been driven fewer than 40,000 miles and sell for about half the price of new models.\u201cSome of the used-car valuation has had an impact\u201d on luxury brands, Mr. Fay said.Next year, an even larger number of luxury cars will re-enter the market as used vehicles, according to industry analysts.\u201cThe cars coming off lease are a very attractive deal, and that lowers prices of new cars,\u201d said Jim Ursomarso, vice president of Union Park Automotive Group in Delaware, which operates BMW, Jaguar and Volvo franchises. \u201cSo it\u2019s not going to get easier from here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The battery should stabilize the state\u2019s renewable energy supply and provide residents with emergency backup power if needed.Mr. Rive\u2019s offer came after the state suffered a string of embarrassing power outages, first in September, and then through the summer, when South Australians were intentionally left without power because of an energy shortage.Reacting to Mr. Rive\u2019s comments, Mike Cannon-Brookes, the billionaire co-founder of the Australian software company Atlassian, asked Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on Twitter if he was \u201cserious\u201d about the 100-day claim. It turns out he was.Far from mere salesmanship, the guarantee appears to have been a factor in the contract.

China is North Korea\u2019s main ally and economic lifeline. It is also Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner.\u201cHow progressed do you want North Korea to get in the capacity to put a nuclear warhead into Darwin?\u201d he asked.Penny Wong, a Labor senator, branded the comments \u201cutterly irresponsible.\u201d A spokeswoman for Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, said, \u201cThe Australian government has no plans to introduce economic sanctions on China.\u201dDo Australians share Mr. Joyce\u2019s urgency? One South Australian does.But other Australians, evoking the country\u2019s breezy, isolationist attitude, took the news \u2014 and Australia\u2019s place in the global pecking order \u2014 far less seriously.For a business that, according to Deloitte, has added a staggering $1.6 billion to Australia\u2019s gross domestic from 2015 to 2016, it seems the windfall \u2014 $287 million in earnings \u2014 is being spread around.Where are people visiting?

Mr. Jia remains chairman of LeEco Holdings.\u201cToday LeEco faces huge challenges and I take full responsibility,\u201d Mr. Jia wrote in an open letter published Thursday morning in Beijing, asking for more time for LeEco and its electric car business. \u201cWe will fully repay our debts to financial institutions and suppliers,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Jia began his career a long way from Beijing\u2019s booming tech corridor, starting in a county tax bureau in Shanxi, a coal-rich northern province. As China\u2019s dot-com boom got underway, he moved into tech, starting a telecommunications company, and then founded Leshi Internet in 2004.In 2008, his business received investment from a private equity firm led by Ling Wancheng, a member of one of Shanxi\u2019s most powerful families and the younger brother of the top aide to Hu Jintao, then the president.Two years later, the little-known Leshi Internet received a coveted slot for a public listing. At the time of its initial public offering, Ling Wancheng\u2019s private equity firm was Leshi Internet\u2019s third-biggest shareholder, after Mr. Jia and his sister.Leshi Internet\u2019s shares soared after going public as China\u2019s retail investors got one of their first opportunities to bet on a start-up with big dreams. By 2015, the stock price propelled Mr. Jia to near the top of China\u2019s richest list, according to the Hurun Report, which tracks the country\u2019s wealthiest citizens.But Mr. Jia led his company into an array of businesses that have not panned out. He invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing LeEco\u2019s smartphone business Le Mobile, in what the new LeEco chief executive, Liang Jun, last week conceded was mistimed: Fierce competition has eroded profit for most handset makers.Last year, as Leshi Internet exhausted its credit lines at a dozen Chinese banks, Mr. Jia began pledging shares in LeEco companies as collateral for more loans, borrowing at least $2.1 billion from a variety of nontraditional lenders like security brokerage firms, trust companies and capital management firms. Today, shares Mr. Jia controls in at least six LeEco companies are pledged to lenders, according to Chinese corporate records.Those same shares were then frozen by courts this week as Mr. Jia had personally guaranteed the debt held by creditors of Le Mobile.Mr. Jia\u2019s personal guarantees bind together much of LeEco\u2019s debt, setting up a potentially messy situation that could embroil all of the LeEco companies as creditors battle for assets. No LeEco company has filed for bankruptcy, a company spokesman said, and LeEco could still receive a bailout from investors or a state-owned company.LeEco\u2019s electric car ambitions are centered on Los Angeles, where the financially troubled start-up Faraday Future, with more than 1,400 employees, is developing high-end electric cars in a bid to challenge the market leader Tesla Motors.Mr. Jia remains Faraday Future\u2019s largest shareholder and emphasized in his letter on Thursday that he would dedicate his energy to getting the company\u2019s first production-ready model, called the FF 91, into mass production.Faraday Future is in the process of raising more than $1 billion, a spokesman for the company said in an email, noting that LeEco and Faraday Future are separate companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Freezes $182 Million in Assets of Chinese Internet Tycoon", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 A court in Shanghai has frozen $182 million in assets tied to the chairman of the Chinese technology company LeEco after one of its affiliates missed loan payments.The ruling last week by the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court was the latest setback for the chairman, Jia Yueting, and for LeEco, which has piled on debt in recent years to fuel its ambitious expansion.A company spokesman confirmed that the court had frozen assets connected to a loan for LeEco\u2019s mobile phone business, Le Mobile, but said collateral was enough to cover the debt. Nie Chengzhi, LeEco\u2019s vice president for finance, said the company would work with China Merchants Bank on repayment. In a statement, the bank said it had taken legal action after many attempts to recover interest owed.Mr. Jia first admitted the cash crunch last autumn. Last week, at a shareholder meeting of LeEco\u2019s main publicly listed arm, Leshi Internet, he acknowledged that the company had made mistakes in allocating funds.\u201cThe cash problems at the nonpublicly traded businesses are more serious than when this crisis erupted,\u201d Mr. Jia told investors, according to a transcript. \u201cOur businesses are constantly using cash to repay loans, having a huge impact on their operations.\u201dAt the meeting, Mr. Jia indicated that LeEco was having difficulty securing additional loans. As of Leshi Internet\u2019s most recent filing, Mr. Jia had pledged 97 percent of his shares in the company to back loans that as of November totaled $1.7 billion.LeEco has also started selling assets to raise cash. Last week, its ride-sharing affiliate, Yidao Yongche, announced a change in control, without naming the new controlling shareholder. The company had for months delayed paying many of its drivers.And creditors are showing up in person in Beijing, asking LeEco to pay up.Last week, Zhang Jun, a supplier for Le Mobile, joined other small suppliers for a seven-day sit-in in LeEco\u2019s Beijing lobby, she said, but left with no money.\u201cI don\u2019t have any hope anymore,\u201d she said, noting that a civil suit she had filed against LeEco in Beijing courts was unlikely to produce a result until the end of the year. \u201cBy then there probably won\u2019t be any money left for us.\u201dThe overdue loan to China Merchants Bank financed LeEco\u2019s 2015 purchase of an 18 percent stake in the Hong Kong-listed Coolpad Group, the business weekly Caixin reported. Coolpad\u2019s share price has dropped this year as competition in the smartphone market has eroded its position. Hong Kong corporate records show the $324 million loan was backed by all the acquired shares of Coolpad, in addition to collateral in mainland China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volvo, Betting on Electric, Moves to Phase Out Conventional Engines", "Date": "2017-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVolvo Cars on Wednesday became the first mainstream automaker to sound the death knell of the internal combustion engine, saying that all the models it introduces starting in 2019 will be either hybrids or powered solely by batteries.While most major automakers offer hybrids and battery-powered options, none of them have been willing to forsake cars powered solely by gasoline or diesel fuel. On the contrary, United States automakers have continued to churn out S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, whose sales have surged because of relatively low fuel prices.\u201cOur customers are asking more and more about electric cars,\u201d Hakan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. While Volvo\u2019s strategy has risks, Mr. Samuelsson acknowledged, \u201ca much bigger risk would be to stick with internal combustion engines.\u201dThough based in Sweden, Volvo is owned by Geely Automobile Holdings of China, which already produces battery-powered cars for the Chinese market. The decision by Volvo to focus on electric vehicles could ultimately give it and Geely a head start if, as many analysts expect, sales of battery powered cars begin to take off. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles.Volvo\u2019s battery-powered vehicles will be produced initially in China, but eventually also in Europe and at a new factory the company is building near Charleston, S.C.Hybrids, which combine battery power with gasoline or diesel engines, accounted for about 2 percent of passenger car sales in the United States last year, a number that has been declining because gasoline prices have fallen.And cars that run solely on battery power are still rare in most countries because of high purchase prices, lengthy charging times and limited ranges.Still, most carmakers expect the share of electric cars to grow quickly as the technology improves, prices fall and public charging stations become more commonplace. Rapid advances in self-driving cars will also encourage a shift to battery power: It is simpler to link self-driving software to an electric motor than to a conventional engine.Although no other traditional carmakers have declared their intention to bury the internal combustion engine, virtually all of them are investing in hybrid and battery technology.The major American automakers are moving forward with their own electrification strategies, albeit on a much smaller scale than Tesla and now Volvo.Ford has sold electric versions of a few mainstream models, but it has not yet developed an all-electric vehicle from the ground up. That is changing, however. The company has said it will introduce a battery-powered S.U.V. by 2020 and will add other electric models thereafter.The third big domestic automaker, Fiat Chrysler, has lagged. It sells an electric version of its Fiat 500 subcompact car and a hybrid gas-electric variation of its Chrysler Pacifica minivan. But the company has yet to announce any plans to build a new vehicle that is available only as an electric model.Carmakers including Volvo have depended on diesel to provide better fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide emissions. But the Volkswagen scandal has raised awareness of the health effects of diesel exhaust.Diesel engines burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline motors, but they produce far more nitrogen oxides, which cause asthma and are considered a carcinogen. The cost of the equipment needed to neutralize diesel fumes is becoming prohibitive.\u201cThe diesel engine is getting more expensive,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson said during a news conference in Stockholm on Wednesday. \u201cWe would prefer to talk about the alternatives.\u201dThe changing political landscape in the United States has somewhat muddied the outlook for electric cars on the other side of the Atlantic. The Obama administration was highly supportive of electrified vehicles, which could help companies meet tougher federal fuel-economy standards.But, so far, President Trump has not pursued policies that encourage the development of electric vehicles.Moreover, the persistence of low gasoline prices continues to push American buyers toward bigger vehicles \u2014 trucks and S.U.V.s \u2014 and has made the fuel economy of electric or hybrid vehicles less potent as a selling point.Volvo\u2019s transition will be gradual. It plans to still produce existing models with conventional engines after 2019, but it will no longer introduce new models with the older technology. Depending on demand, Volvo will completely phase out cars powered solely by gasoline or diesel by around 2024.But by focusing on electrification, Volvo can concentrate its limited research and development resources on new technologies rather than continuing to invest in fuel-powered motors that may become obsolete. With sales of 534,000 cars last year, Volvo is dwarfed by companies like Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors, each of which sold about 10 million vehicles in 2016.Volvo will be able to draw on technology developed by its parent company, Geely. The companies can also save money by purchasing components such as batteries together.Analysts said Volvo\u2019s decision to pursue a lineup dedicated to electric and hybrid vehicles is motivated, in part, by the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion engines.\u201cChinese ownership of Swedish-based Volvo likely played a role in the automaker\u2019s announcement today,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the auto-research site Autotrader.com. \u201cChina\u2019s air pollution problems have prompted a more serious push toward cleaner automobiles.\u201dVolvo said on Wednesday that it would introduce five models from 2019 to 2021 that would run solely on electric power. That includes two models sold under Volvo\u2019s Polestar brand, which the company is marketing as a maker of high-performance electrified cars.Other models will include plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from power outlets and run for short distances solely on batteries, and so-called mild hybrids, which charge their batteries from the car\u2019s conventional engine or by recovering energy from braking. Hybrids still require gasoline or diesel fuel, but they are typically more efficient because the batteries share the load.Mr. Samuelsson said the company also wanted to encourage suppliers to invest in battery technology and charging stations.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make a clear statement,\u201d he said.Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Loses No. 1 Spot in Market Value Among U.S. Automakers", "Date": "2017-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor almost three months, Tesla reigned as the most valuable automaker in the nation, ahead of both General Motors and Ford Motor, thanks to a remarkable run-up in its stock this year. It seemed its chief executive, Elon Musk, could do no wrong.But a spate of negative news this week has brought the electric-car maker\u2019s many challenges into focus, especially its ambitious plans to ramp up production of its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, which begins rolling off the assembly line on Friday.With investors shying away, Tesla has seen its shares fall by almost 17 percent since Monday\u2019s intraday high, to $308.89, including a 5.6 percent drop on Thursday. That reduced the company\u2019s market capitalization to $50.7 billion, according to Bloomberg, and put G.M. ahead once again, at $52.6 billion.\u201cThe market is punishing them harshly for that,\u201d Mr. Whiston said.It may be harder for Tesla to pass G.M. a second time. Auto sales in the United States are slowing over all, and Tesla is not yet a significant player in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market. In the second quarter, Tesla produced more cars than it delivered to customers, causing some analysts to question whether demand for current models \u2014 the Model S sedan and the Model X, a sport-utility vehicle \u2014 is reaching a plateau.With established manufacturers expanding their electric options, \u201cTesla will face intense competition by the next decade,\u201d Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients.But by far the biggest concerns are related to the Model 3.Until now, the company has produced the Model S and Model X, which can sell for $70,000 and up, in relatively small numbers. In 2016, Tesla made about 85,000 vehicles. But the Model 3 will be priced at roughly $35,000 and is aimed at a wider range of buyers. With the Model 3 in the lineup, Tesla expects to sell about 500,000 cars a year by 2018.Last year, Mr. Musk predicted that Tesla would sell about 100,000 Model 3s this year. But late on Sunday, outlining a production plan on Twitter, he said the company expected to make 30 this month, 100 in August, and 1,500 in September. He expected production to climb to about 20,000 cars in December. That would leave it well short of 100,000.Concern over Model 3 production was compounded when the company said its giant battery plant in Nevada had struggled to produce enough battery packs.\u201cUp to now, Tesla has had little experience with volume production,\u201d Axel Schmidt, managing director of the automotive practice at Accenture, a large consulting firm, said in an email. Ramping up Model 3 production \u201cremains a huge challenge,\u201d he said.The slump in Tesla\u2019s share price halts a remarkable surge for the company, in which its stock rose from a little over $180 in November to more than twice that recently.The crash raised questions about the reliability of the technology and about whether Tesla had overstated its capability in its marketing, and even in using the name Autopilot. Federal agencies opened investigations, including one to determine if there was a safety defect in Autopilot.The stock price languished even after Mr. Musk laid out an updated \u201cmaster plan\u201d for the company, with a pledge to expand beyond electric cars into battery-powered pickups, semi-trailer trucks and buses, and to equip them with advanced self-driving systems.But this year, investors began focusing on the introduction of the Model 3 and Mr. Musk\u2019s confident prediction that Tesla would be able to increase sales fivefold next year.Tesla raised $1 billion in stock and debt offerings to bolster its coffers in advance of the Model 3 introduction. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded its investigation of the fatal crash and found no defects in Autopilot.April brought more good news: a strong jump in vehicle production in the first quarter, and a new surge in the stock price that pushed Tesla\u2019s market value to $48 billion, surpassing the market capitalization of Ford Motor. The run continued, and on April 10, the stock surged to $312.39.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Pivotal Moment, Tesla Unveils Its First Mass-Market Sedan", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 After a meteoric rise that made it, at least briefly, the most valuable car company in America, Tesla arrived at a moment of truth on Friday night as it delivered the first of its mass-market sedans to their new owners.For a decade, the company has been a manufacturer of high-end electric cars in small numbers. But now, Tesla is aiming at much loftier goals. It wants not only to become a large-scale producer in the suddenly crowded field of battery-powered vehicles but also to lure consumers away from mainstream, gasoline-powered automobiles.Yet Tesla\u2019s expansion comes with a set of risks. It plans to more than quadruple its annual production to more than a half-million vehicles, while still maintaining its image as an enlightened outlier in an industry long dominated by global giants \u2014 who are racing to develop electrified vehicles of their own.\u201cThe whole point of this company was to make a really great, affordable electric car,\u201d said Mr. Musk, a Silicon Valley billionaire and co-founder of Tesla. \u201cAnd we finally have it.\u201dThe big question is whether Tesla can grow dramatically and still retain its unique cachet.So far, investors have signaled their confidence in the company\u2019s prospects, propelling Tesla\u2019s stock market value to a level on par with General Motors and Ford, the biggest American automakers.Industry analysts view the Model 3 introduction as the pivotal event that will either confirm Tesla\u2019s vast potential as a major car company, or define its limits as a niche player in an ultracompetitive industry.\u201cElon Musk likes making history, which is good because he\u2019ll have to accomplish several unprecedented feats to pull off a successful Model 3 launch,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an executive with the auto-research firms Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader.The biggest hurdle is expanding manufacturing capacity in Fremont fast enough to begin satisfying the enormous interest in the new car. About 500,000 people have put down $1,000 deposits since last year to reserve delivery of Model 3s when they are available.The first cars off the line on Friday were sold to 30 of Tesla\u2019s employees as both an appreciation of their work and to provide the company with immediate feedback on the quality of the product.But strains are already showing in Tesla\u2019s ability to meet the expectations it has set for the Model 3.Its intricate supply chain has faltered in the past, leading to shortfalls of its current luxury offerings, the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle. The most option-laden versions of those vehicles can sell for $100,000 or more.Earlier this month, Tesla acknowledged that a shortage of battery packs had limited its production to about 25,000 vehicles in the three months that ended in June \u2014 a long way from the 600,000-a-year target it has set for 2018.And as a measure of what the company is competing with, the biggest carmakers like Volkswagen and Toyota produce an average of 25,000 vehicles a day.Mr. Musk warned employees attending Friday\u2019s Model 3 event that the company is in for \u201csix months of manufacturing hell\u201d as it accelerates production of the new car.And as the company turbocharges its growth, it is learning firsthand the pitfalls of rapid expansion.Some employees at the Fremont factory say that turnover among workers is high, and the plant is laboring to keep up with the changes that come with the installation of more robotic equipment and new technology.Moreover, the plant is in the early stages of an organizing drive by some assembly-line employees who would like to join the United Automobile Workers union.The union drive reflects Tesla\u2019s evolution from a start-up enterprise to an industry fixture.The goals of workers involved in the organizing effort are no different than those of employees at far larger automakers \u2014 better pay, safer working conditions and stable, well-defined roles on the factory floor.\u201cIt\u2019s a good company, but we want it to be a great company,\u201d said Richard Ortiz, a 51-year-old line worker who earns $20 an hour, about 30 percent less than top-paid employees at union plants operated by the Detroit automakers.The plant had been operated since the 1980s as a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota, and Tesla purchased it after G.M. backed away from the venture after its bankruptcy in 2009.Now the factory is, in Mr. Musk\u2019s words, \u201cbursting at the seams\u201d as it brings the Model 3 to production.The new car mimics the elegant look of the considerably more expensive Model S, but has features all its own \u2014 including a spare, wood-paneled dashboard devoid of instruments except a single computer touch-screen.The Model 3 is also equipped with so-called autopilot features, including an emergency braking system. Optional equipment will be available that enables the car to virtually drive itself in certain traffic conditions.The soft-spoken Mr. Musk is hardly bashful in comparing the new sedan with anything in its price range \u2014 electric or otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m really confident this will be the best car for anything close to the cost,\u201d he said.That\u2019s what Tesla fans are waiting for. While automakers occasionally produce new vehicles that require customers to reserve the first deliveries, demand for the Model 3 is off the charts.Many of the half-million people who have put down deposits for the new Tesla are patiently awaiting news from the company that their car is ready for them.Mark Lonier is one of them. On the day last year that the company began taking orders, Mr. Lonier had his wife rush out to put down a deposit at a Tesla store in Newport Beach, Calif.\u201cI figure it will be a wait, and I\u2019ll probably get it sometime next year,\u201d said Mr. Lonier, an airline pilot who already owns a Tesla Model S.Other prospective customers like Jessica Was of Belmont, Calif., have been dismayed by the potentially long delay in buying a Model 3.\u201cThe question is when are they really going to mass produce this car?\u201d said Ms. Was, who asked for her deposit back after learning that hundreds of thousands of other customers were ahead of her.At the Model 3 event held on Friday night, Mr. Musk seemed slightly awed by the challenge of meeting the demand for the new vehicle.On a brightly lighted stage set up outside behind the factory, Mr. Musk congratulated the hundreds of employees in attendance for their efforts in making the Model 3 a reality.And he urged them to be prepared for the big manufacturing push that lay ahead.\u201cThe biggest challenge for us is, how do we build a lot more cars?\u201d he told the crowd, adding that prospective buyers are constantly asking the company when they will get their Model 3.And while the company may be far from hitting its goal of making 10,000 vehicles a week, Mr. Musk is hitting the throttle as Tesla\u2019s dream scenario edges closer to reality.\u201cWe\u2019re building the cars as fast as we can,\u201d he said to the cheers of workers. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to drive this ramp-up as fast as we can.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the pricing of the Model S sedan. While options-laden versions of the car can sell for $100,000 or more, not all versions are more than $100,000.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Utility Helps Wean Vermonters From the Electric Grid", "Date": "2017-07-29", "News": "Green Mountain Power is trying to turn homes, neighborhoods and towns into virtual power plants, driven by economics as well as environmental goals.Supported byWALTHAM, Vt. \u2014 In a new low-income development that replaced a trailer park here, rooftop solar panels sparkle in the sun while backup batteries quietly hum away in utility closets.About an hour away, in Rutland, homes and businesses along a once-distressed corridor are installing the latest in energy-saving equipment, including special insulation and heat pumps.And throughout Vermont, customers are signing up for a new program that will allow them to power their homes while entirely disconnected from the grid.The projects are part of a bold experiment aimed at turning homes, neighborhoods and towns into virtual power plants, able to reduce the amount of energy they draw from the central electric system. But behind them are not green energy advocates or proponents of living off the land. Instead, it\u2019s the local electric company, Green Mountain Power.Green Mountain\u2019s chief executive, Mary Powell, sees the program here as the best way to please customers while making the system more environmentally and physically sustainable.\u201cCustomers, especially in Vermont with the energy-independence values that people have, want to move more toward self-generation,\u201d she said, seated in a bright orange modernist chair in a meeting area in the company\u2019s open-plan headquarters near Burlington.\u201cThe opportunity for us,\u201d she added, is to lead the transformation of an electric system that depends on power sent along big transmission lines \u201cto a community-, home- and business-based energy system.\u201dAs a practical matter, the less electricity the utility pulls from the regional transmission system, especially at times of peak demand, the less it has to pay in fees, producing savings it can pass on to customers. One way it does this is by remotely controlling the batteries installed through its programs, drawing upon the stored energy as needed.Recently, Ms. Powell said, Green Mountain used this method to take the low-income development here off the grid\u2019s electricity supply for two hours, saving an estimated $275 in transmission costs while the homes were powered by solar panels or battery storage. The amount saved was small, but such savings could add up over a year if they were realized in enough locations.The utility, owned by Gaz M\u00e9tro, a leading natural gas distributor in Quebec, is also working to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions as part of the effort to slow global warming. In 2014, it became a B Corporation. That is a voluntary designation, requiring executives to take into account not just how decisions will affect profit and shareholders, but also how they will affect the public, generally defined as society or the environment.The idea is that customers, especially when they have solar panels, heat pumps and electric vehicles, will be better able to monitor and manage their energy use. The utility, using Tesla\u2019s software, will be able to call upon the stored energy in the combined batteries to help meet surges in demand, or to sell it on the wholesale market to help balance or smooth out fluctuations within the region.The efforts have won plaudits from national green-energy advocates who see the utility as a leader in helping redesign the electric system, which is undergoing enormous changes as renewable sources of energy become more popular and other technologies give customers more control. Many utilities see such moves as an existential threat because their profits come mainly from getting a set rate of return that is factored into customer rates.But Green Mountain Power has \u201cfigured out a way to do well and do good in the utility business and keep its regulators, investors and customers all happy at the same time,\u201d said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford and a customer of the utility through a family home in Vermont. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal these days when the rest of the industry is talking about a death spiral.\u201dMs. Powell, 56, grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and attended a public high school focused on the arts. She came to the company in 1998 after turning down the job three times. She just couldn\u2019t see herself working for a utility, she said, especially one whose traditional corporate culture was visible in the imposing stone lobby and slate steps that led to the chief executive\u2019s office, hidden behind two private secretaries and outfitted with its own bathroom and shower.The family on her father\u2019s side \u2014 he was an actor and a model for the fisherman on Gorton\u2019s seafood packages \u2014 had roots in the state, so she had grown up spending summers there. (Her brother, Michael Powell, is a sports columnist at The New York Times.) After college, she became a technical writer for a money-market fund in New York, working her way up to associate director of operations over the next seven years.She grew disenchanted with working in finance, so when a house-sitting opportunity in Vermont came up, she and her fianc\u00e9 quit their jobs and headed north. She figured she would work as a waitress, she said, but ended up taking jobs at a couple of banks and starting a few businesses \u2014 including one selling reflective gear for dogs that her husband now runs \u2014 that ultimately led to her joining the utility.First, she tackled the company culture, moving executives from the boxy glass headquarters to the 1980s brick service center, where she works at a stand-up desk in a cluster including other executives as well as the linemen. The office, decorated with reclaimed wood, bright colors and relics of past electric systems, looks more suited to a Silicon Valley start-up than to a typical corporate utility, complete with a treadmill and table-tennis setup in one section and a cluster of fledgling entrepreneurs, winners of an incubator competition, in another.Then she began trying to make the generating system greener, which led to the move toward a more decentralized system, something few other utilities have tried with such enthusiasm. But in an industry known for caution, Green Mountain can be nimble, in part because it is so small \u2014 just 265,000 customers \u2014 and has a relatively receptive customer base.A program that helps provide energy-efficiency upgrades in Rutland, for instance, got its start with a single call. At a weekly leadership team meeting, Ms. Powell asked executives to find a way to bring several technologies together in one dwelling.One executive asked Rutland\u2019s mayor if he knew of a family that would be willing to serve as a guinea pig. He suggested Mark and Sara Borkowski, whose century-old house became the first of 161 homes and businesses to take part. Under the program, the utility provides financing for energy upgrades, which participants can pay back over time through their monthly bills.Green Mountain has still invested in large-scale renewable-power plants, like the Stafford Hill Solar Farm \u2014 11 acres of solar panels and battery banks spread over a landfill behind a town dump \u2014 and two wind farms. Those developments have come in for criticism from some residents and officials who object to living near noisy industrial machines and worry about marring the natural beauty that draws residents and visitors to the state. The critics include Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who opposes putting wind turbines along mountain ridges.But many customers say they are happy to be part of greening the area\u2019s energy supply, whether for the financial savings, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming, or just to make sure the lights stay on in a power failure.\u201cIt\u2019s not really any different than being anywhere else,\u201d said Alexis LaBerge, 27, who was one of the first to move into the low-income development in Waltham from an old house that guzzled fuel to keep the house and hot water heated.Now, when the power from the grid goes out, as it did one night this spring, she does not have to worry about food spoiling in the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely nice being brand-new and having the backup,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Elon Musk Teases a New Hyperloop", "Date": "2017-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a tweet and very little else by way of detail, the entrepreneur Elon Musk on Thursday raised the prospect of speedy, hassle-free travel along the busy section of the Eastern Seaboard between New York and Washington, D.C.Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.It takes New Yorkers longer than that just to travel from one end of Manhattan to the other by subway.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet was enticing enough, even without details, that it prompted a bombardment of follow-up questions and a great deal of skepticism. Who would pay for it? How long would it take to build? How would it be built? There were no answers.Nor was there any indication of just who in the government had given the plan the \u201cverbal\u201d green light. The Department of Transportation referred a query about the project to the White House, which said in an emailed reply through a spokesman: \u201cWe have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.\u201dIn his replies, Mr. Musk let slip a few more thoughts.\u201cCity center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Musk\u2019s planned 29-minute trip is considerably shorter than the current options.

{"Headline": "After Years of Growth, Automakers Are Cutting U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2017-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 After a prolonged recovery that culminated in two years of record sales, the American auto industry is slowing down, with fewer buyers in dealer showrooms and fewer workers on the factory floor.Automakers said this week that sales dropped in June for a sixth consecutive month, falling by 3 percent from a year ago, a trend that analysts do not see letting up anytime soon. And as demand falls, there is less work in the nation\u2019s auto-assembly plants \u2014 primarily those that build traditional passenger cars.Last year, those plants hit a peak of 211,000 workers, a 55 percent increase since the depths of the recession in 2009. That figure has dropped by more than 2 percent so far this year, to 206,000 workers in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and could shrink further as sales continue to fall.\u201cThere\u2019s been a consistent reduction in plant output in the last six months, and what is ahead in the next six months could be pretty startling,\u201d said Ron Harbour, an auto manufacturing expert at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman.Industry analysts said consumers might be pulling back on spending because of tighter credit conditions and more expensive vehicle loans. \u201cHigher interest rates and uncertainty around fiscal policies will slow economic growth, and may become headwinds for auto sales,\u201d said Charlie Chesbrough, an economist for the research firm Cox Automotive.The impact on employment is uneven, however, reflecting the evolving tastes of American car buyers.With low gas prices motivating buyers to trade in traditional cars for larger models, factories making trucks and sport utility vehicles are humming, with some producing around the clock on three shifts. Even as overall vehicle sales declined in June, sales of trucks and S.U.V.s rose about 4 percent from a year earlier.That consumer trend is playing out in the opposite direction at plants building small and midsize cars, which are scaling back or shutting down entirely while they are converted to produce trucks and S.U.V.s.What none of the automakers are doing is building new plants or adding a significant number of new jobs anytime soon.\u201cThe industry has dramatically expanded employment in the United States in the last several years, but the growth is just not there anymore,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley.The company had previously planned to move the car to a new plant in Mexico, but canceled the project after meeting stiff opposition from Mr. Trump.Ford\u2019s China move will not cost any American jobs, because Focus production in Michigan will be replaced by trucks and S.U.V.s.But the decision could inflame trade tensions. And if falling sales over all in the United States continue to cut employment in American plants, it could spur protectionist measures by the Trump administration, like imposing border taxes on imported vehicles.Scaling back jobs in car plants is part of a newfound discipline among automakers to avoid bloated payrolls and inventories when sales start slipping.That is a big change from pre-recession times, when the domestic automakers were too often awash in overproduction, or saddled with union contracts that funneled idled workers into so-called job banks with nearly full pay and benefits.That program was eliminated in subsequent labor pacts with the United Automobile Workers. Moreover, the Detroit companies have also hired large numbers of lower-wage, entry-level employees with less costly unemployment benefits.Those moves have made it easier for the companies to scale back production based on changes in the market.G.M., for example, has reduced the number of shifts at several of its domestic plants, the most recent reduction being its announcement of cutbacks at a factory in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan \u2014 a segment that is rapidly declining as more buyers gravitate to S.U.V.s.\u201cThese decisions are always tough,\u201d said Alan Batey, the president of G.M.\u2019s North American operations. \u201cBut at the end of the day we have to be disciplined about our production plans.\u201dFiat Chrysler, for its part, has eliminated production of compact and midsize cars altogether at factories in Michigan and Illinois, temporarily laying off workers as it retools the plants to produce S.U.V.s and trucks.About 4,200 employees at the company\u2019s factory in Belvidere, Ill., recently returned to work after being temporarily laid off several months ago, and will begin producing a new S.U.V. model at the plant later this month.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.And automakers are hopeful that sales of larger vehicles will get even stronger in the remaining six months of this year, as has been the case in previous years. \u201cSeasonal factors drive a much higher retail mix of trucks and utilities in the second half of the year, so it makes sense to make production adjustments on the car side,\u201d said James Cain, a spokesman for General Motors.But few in the industry expect any major job growth anytime soon. G.M., for example, recently scaled back its projections for industry sales in the second half of this year, and analysts are predicting that annual sales will fall below 17 million vehicles next year for the first time since 2014.\u201cWe are beginning to enter a period we call the post-peak,\u201d said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive, which operates the auto-research sites Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader.One factory that thrived after G.M.\u2019s bankruptcy in 2009 was its small-car plant in Orion Township, Mich., north of Detroit.The company invested more than $500 million to refurbish the factory and begin producing subcompact cars. Last year it added production of its new battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt.But demand for small, ultra-fuel-efficient cars has waned drastically with lower fuel prices. Despite its modern production technology, the Orion plant is down to one shift of workers, with little hope of expanding production soon.Workers at the plant were heartened this year when G.M. added a small operation to convert Bolts into autonomous vehicles for testing purposes.While it hardly added any new jobs, the autonomous-vehicle project was a welcome addition to a plant operating at well below capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be a part of a product launch \u2014 even if it is a small one,\u201d said Lindsi Green, one of a handful of employees working on the self-driving prototypes.An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated the number of American automobile manufacturing workers. As the article correctly stated, it was 206,000 in April, not 206 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ways of Winning in a Bull Market", "Date": "2017-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a bull market (the current one reached its eighth birthday in March), mutual fund managers can find many ways to win. In the second quarter, three of the better-performing stock funds scored with picks as varied as well-known technology companies, micro-cap stocks and Asian innovators.Those hefty holdings partly spring from the fund\u2019s design: It\u2019s benchmarked against the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. Thus, to favor a company, as Mr. Baker has with Tesla, his fund must have a greater allocation to the stock than the index does. Tesla accounts for less than 1 percent of the Nasdaq.Mr. Baker aims to identify and exploit enduring technological themes, like the continued growth of e-commerce and cloud computing. Lately, a favorite motif is the emergence of artificial intelligence. \u201cA.I. will change the world in ways we can\u2019t even imagine now,\u201d he said.The fund\u2019s Tesla holding is partly a wager on that belief. Mr. Baker, a Tesla owner himself, said he likes the company not just for the quality of its cars but also for its continuous improvements to its self-driving technology. Many other companies are developing that technology, too, but Mr. Baker is bullish on Tesla\u2019s prospects.\u201cIn a year or two, we may look back and think it\u2019s funny we focused on Tesla being an electric-car company when they\u2019re building a big competitive advantage in autonomous driving,\u201d he said.Tesla\u2019s stock has been falling lately, dropping more than 15 percent from a peak on June 23. Mr. Baker said his fund has added to its Tesla position this year, though he wouldn\u2019t comment on whether the fund had bought or sold shares recently.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009. Over that time, he said, he has learned patience: \u201cI appreciate more and more that, in a world dominated by people trading E.T.F.s and quantitative traders and hedge funds, the biggest competitive advantage I have is a long-term time horizon.\u201d Mr. Baker retains an average holding for about two years and will keep favored stocks far longer. Nvidia, for example, has been an overweight in the fund \u2014 a larger allocation than in the benchmark \u2014 for Mr. Baker\u2019s whole tenure.The fund, with an expense ratio of 0.91 percent, returned 9.34 percent in the second quarter, compared with a total return of 3.09 percent, including dividends, for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Yet he said he tries to guard against being too patient, striving to stay focused on why he bought a stock and not stumbling into what he called \u201cthesis creep.\u201d \u201cIf things don\u2019t play out, you don\u2019t want to rationalize or justify,\u201d Mr. Chace said.The Wasatch fund differs from the typical micro-cap offering tracked by Morningstar in that it invests more of its shareholders\u2019 money abroad. About 20 percent of the fund is parked in foreign stocks, compared with 3 percent for its average peer. Mr. Chace, who has managed the fund since 2004, can invest as much as 30 percent of the assets in foreign fare. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep pushing it up,\u201d he said.He said he has raised the fund\u2019s foreign stake because the United States micro-cap pool has been stagnant. (Wasatch counts as micro-caps companies with market capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion.) Over the last decade, relatively few domestic companies have issued stock in initial public offerings, or I.P.O.s, he said.India, in contrast, has many small companies with good growth rates, and Mr. Chace has gravitated there. His fund\u2019s top two holdings at the end of March \u2014 MakeMyTrip and Natco Pharma \u2014 are Indian ventures.Similarly, one of his recent good performers was V-Mart Retail, which specializes in selling apparel in India\u2019s smaller cities and countryside. Because of the company\u2019s rural market, it\u2019s not being squeezed by e-commerce companies in the way many big retailers are, he said.Mr. Chace\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.67 percent, returned 8.93 percent in the second quarter.Until last year, the fund was known as the Matthews Science and Technology Fund, but its sponsor, Matthews Asia, changed the name because Mr. Oh, who has overseen the fund since 2006, was finding opportunities beyond that narrower niche. He said his goal is to invest in companies benefiting from a growing middle class throughout Asia and rising disposable incomes there. \u201cThe question we\u2019re asking is, \u2018What will consumers with incremental income spend on?\u2019\u201dLately, an answer has been beauty products. One of the fund\u2019s larger holdings has been Hugel, a South Korean cosmetics and pharmaceuticals company whose offerings include botulinum toxin (or Botox) wrinkle treatments. Korean cosmetics makers have been innovators for more than a decade, Mr. Oh said, but their market was largely limited to South Korea and Japan.Now a surging middle class in China has created a big new pool of potential buyers, he said. In April, Bain Capital agreed to pay about $800 million for a controlling stake in Hugel.Mr. Oh invested in the TAL Education Group, a Beijing tutoring company, for similar reasons. Education is highly valued there, he said, and as parents see their discretionary income rise, they\u2019ll often spend some of the surfeit on their children\u2019s educations. His fund, with an expense ratio of 1.24 percent, returned 13.57 percent in the second quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will Electric Cars Go Mainstream? It May Be Sooner Than You Think", "Date": "2017-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the world\u2019s automakers place larger bets on electric vehicle technology, many industry analysts are debating a key question: How quickly can plug-in cars become mainstream?The conventional view holds that electric cars will remain a niche product for many years, plagued by high sticker prices and heavily dependent on government subsidies.Between 2025 and 2030, the group predicts, plug-in vehicles will become cost competitive with traditional petroleum-powered cars, even without subsidies and even before taking fuel savings into account. Once that happens, mass adoption should quickly follow.\u201cOur forecast doesn\u2019t hinge on countries adopting stringent new fuel standards or climate policies,\u201d said Colin McKerracher, the head of advanced transport analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic analysis, looking at what happens when the upfront cost of electric vehicles reaches parity. That\u2019s when the real shift occurs.\u201dIf that prediction pans out, it will have enormous consequences for the auto industry, oil markets and the world\u2019s efforts to slow global warming.The Bloomberg forecast is far more aggressive, projecting that plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles will make up 54 percent of new light-duty sales globally by 2040, outselling their combustion engine counterparts.The reason? Batteries. Since 2010, the average cost of lithium-ion battery packs has plunged by two-thirds, to around $300 per kilowatt-hour. The Bloomberg report sees that falling to $73 by 2030, without any significant technological breakthroughs, as companies like Tesla increase battery production in massive factories, optimize the design of battery packs and improve chemistries.For the next decade, the report notes, electric cars will remain reliant on government incentives and sales mandates in places like Europe, China and California. But as automakers introduce a greater variety of models and lower costs, electric cars will reach a point where they can stand on their own.\u201cBut we tried to be fairly conservative in our estimate of where battery prices are going,\u201d Mr. McKerracher said, \u201cand we don\u2019t see barriers to electric vehicles\u2019 becoming cost competitive very soon.\u201dOther experts caution that falling battery costs are not the only factor in determining whether electric cars become widespread. Sam Ori, the executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, noted, \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy cars based solely on the price tag.\u201dMany owners charge their cars overnight in their garages, but that is much harder for people living in cities who park their cars on the street.As a result, the Bloomberg report warns that plug-in vehicles may have a difficult time making inroads in dense urban areas and that infrastructure bottlenecks may slow the growth of electric vehicles after 2040.Another potential hurdle may be the automakers themselves. While most manufacturers are introducing plug-in models in the United States to comply with stricter fuel-economy standards, they do not always market them aggressively, said Chelsea Sexton, an auto industry consultant who worked on General Motors\u2019 electric vehicle program in the 1990s.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of announcements about electric vehicles, but that doesn\u2019t matter much if automakers are just building these cars for compliance and are unenthusiastic about actually marketing them,\u201d Ms. Sexton said.Yet the Bloomberg report also shows how much further countries would need to go to cut transportation emissions.Even with a sharp rise in electric vehicles, the world would still have more traditional petroleum-powered passenger vehicles on the road in 2040 than it does today, and it will take many years to retire existing fleets. And other modes of transportation, like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, will remain stubbornly difficult to electrify without drastic advances in battery technology.Which means it is still too soon to write an obituary for the internal combustion engine.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Joins the Shift to Electric Cars", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialCars powered by gasoline or diesel are major polluters. The Volkswagen emissions scandal in the United States put to rest the longstanding European faith in diesel as a more environmentally friendly fuel, not least because it generates large quantities of health-threatening nitrogen oxides. VW\u2019s extensive efforts to conceal the true extent of that pollution has now turned consumers against the fuel.Still, attractive as it sounds, switching from petroleum to electricity for cars is a formidable task. Plug-in electric vehicles are still a tiny market centered in only 10 industrially advanced countries, and even there the infrastructure is small. A huge increase in electric cars would require many thousands of new charging points, an upgrade in generating capacity, improved batteries and new sources of government income to replace lucrative fuel taxes.Yet electric cars \u2014 notably those made by Tesla, which unveiled its new, mass-market Model 3 sedans on Friday \u2014 have demonstrated that they can be every bit as comfortable, powerful and fun to drive as gasoline-powered cars. The targets set by Britain, France and others are bound to spur further innovation that will lower prices and address the greatest weaknesses of plug-in cars: relatively limited range and long charging times.In addition, putting more electric cars onto the streets is arguably a good way to raise public consciousness about steps people can take to clean the air they breathe while also reducing greenhouse gases. Most people do not spend a lot of time thinking about how their electricity is generated, but they are likely to notice a plugged-in car on their street and, eventually, improvements in air quality. Once people are aware of that, they could well support shifts to cleaner fuels in other forms of transport, like planes and trains.Bringing people around is a big challenge in the fight against climate change. That\u2019s one reason the announcements by Britain, France, India and Norway are important, and the more governments that follow suit, the better.Advertisement"}

But even as it moves ahead, the automaker is encountering challenges to its ambitious plans for growth.On Monday, it acknowledged that it had experienced a \u201csevere shortfall\u201d in production of 100-kilowatt battery packs that use new technologies and are made on new assembly lines.As a result, Tesla\u2019s output of 25,708 cars in the second quarter barely exceeded its first-quarter production, though it was a 40 percent increase from a year ago.Until June, the supply of battery packs was about 40 percent below demand, Tesla said, though supplies improved last month.The hiccup in production appeared to have unsettled investors. Tesla stock fell $8.99, or 2.5 percent, to $352.62.Tesla said production of its first midpriced car, the Model 3, would begin on Friday, two weeks earlier than planned, with the first deliveries on July 28.The Model 3 is a critical test for Mr. Musk and his ambitious plan to turn Tesla into a producer of mass-market electric cars.The Model 3 will be priced around $35,000. Mr. Musk envisions it reaching a much wider range of customers and has said he expects it to push Tesla\u2019s output to 500,000 cars a year in 2018.Mr. Musk has said Tesla is working to automate its assembly plant further to increase Model 3 output. He said at the shareholder meeting that the company was beginning to consider additional assembly plants.\u201cThere is no room at Fremont,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bursting at the seams.\u201dTo prepare for the addition of the Model 3 to its lineup, Tesla built a huge, $5 billion factory in Nevada to produce batteries for its electric cars. Tesla has also bolstered its coffers. This year, it raised $1 billion through offerings of stock and debt. A Chinese internet giant, Tencent Holdings, acquired a 5 percent stake in the company.Even with the swoon in shares Monday, investor optimism about the Model 3 has pushed Tesla shares up about 65 percent this year. The company has a market value of $58 billion, about $4 billion more than G.M. and $12 billion more than Ford Motor.Advertisement"}
