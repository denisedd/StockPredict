{"Headline": "Cisco and Google Find Mutual Interest in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Cisco Systems, two trendsetters in different eras of the internet, are joining forces as the growth of cloud computing puts new pressure on big tech companies and leads to strange corporate bedfellows.The Silicon Valley giants on Wednesday announced a collaboration to help companies manage software and technology services that may run in their own data centers or in facilities operated by external cloud services.Google, the largest unit of its parent, Alphabet, hopes to benefit from Cisco\u2019s close ties to corporate customers as the search engine giant tries to catch up to Amazon, the market leader in cloud services, and Microsoft.Cisco could also use some help. The tech giant, which in 2000 briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company when its computer networking equipment was used to build the internet, faces a serious threat from cloud services. Companies that once spent heavily on new hardware from Cisco and other suppliers increasingly rent cloud services instead, with companies like Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting in the background.\u201cEvery company that built an empire on selling equipment to companies to put in their data centers is feeling incredible pressure,\u201d said Dave Bartoletti, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, a market research firm.Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year.Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different. They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems. By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies\u2019 data centers.The idea, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those \u201csecurity gaps.\u201dGoogle has moved aggressively to catch up. In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMware\u2019s technology a mainstay at many corporations.She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features. In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.So has Cisco. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called \u201cintercloud\u201d that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage \u201chybrid\u201d cloud arrangements \u2014 industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a company\u2019s own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.\u201cWe think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world,\u201d said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco\u2019s networking and security business.The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions. On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept. Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers\u2019 premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.\u201cWe see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique,\u201d said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business.VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software. Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S. to court customers. Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a \u201cvalidation\u201d of his own company\u2019s vision.Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S. and Microsoft in cloud computing. But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.\u201cWe are both users of each other\u2019s products,\u201d said Mr. H\u00f6lzle of Google. But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: A Whole New World", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Robot\u201cMr. Robot\u201d debuted in 2015 as a captivating and uncanny reflection of not just our fractious times \u2014 all those eerie parallels with real-world events \u2014 but also of the isolating effects of technology billed and sold as a means of connection. The story was to our world as Mr. Robot was to Elliot: A darker, (somewhat) angrier version, with a mysterious agenda born of deep pain.Then it folded inside itself in Season 2, testing viewers\u2019 patience as it burrowed into Elliot\u2019s inner struggle to reconcile his splintered selves. (Unsuccessfully, as it turned out.) His overlong prison interlude and the trials of Angela and Darlene nicely broadened what had been a narrowly focused story about a troubled hacker, but they also raised a question: Could \u201cMr. Robot\u201d get far enough out of its own head to recapture some of the fun that made its first season so intoxicating?We\u2019ll get to that in a minute, but first back to the mustache. We opened on Mr. Cannavale as Irving, a used-car salesman and all-purpose Dark Army fixer who cleaned up Tyrell Wellick\u2019s shooting of Elliott, settling, it seems, any lingering mystery over whether Wellick is a figment of Elliot\u2019s damaged psyche. In a measure of how much this show messes with you, I briefly wondered if Irving, too, was somehow an Elliott projection. But it seems clear that he exists in the world, as does Wellick.More surprising: So does Mr. Robot, in a way. In Season 2, Elliot seemed to reach an understanding with Mr. Robot, only to be shot for trying to defy him in the finale. In the new season, the show seems to have synthesized the two sides of its personality more successfully than Elliot has, externalizing his existential struggle and placing Mr. Robot, as roguishly portrayed by Christian Slater, directly into the global disruption narrative.Elliot heroically dons the hoodie and descends, via a 4-plus minute Steadicam shot, into the frenetic hacker Olympics in order to close the backdoor that would enable the Stage 2 destruction of Evil Corp\u2019s hard copy archives. Then later Mr. Robot meets back up with Wellick to seemingly devise a workaround. Which is to say, last season\u2019s lackluster chess match has expanded into Elliott aiming to outmaneuver himself on a broader scale, with many lives and the fate of civilization in the balance.Will this contest also end in a stalemate? Perhaps, but whatever the resolution, it\u2019s worth taking a second to consider how audacious it is. \u201cMr. Robot\u201d was hardly the first story to hinge on a multiple personality plot \u2014 \u201cFight Club,\u201d in particular, has been a polestar for the show\u2019s unchained-id-raging-against-the-corporatocracy sensibility. But this season\u2019s apparent Jekyll-and-Hyde dynamic asks viewers to accept two different actors playing the same person interchangeably, from moment to moment, and mostly pulls it off.Elliot is still clinging to the hope that Mr. Robot is finally gone, perhaps killed by Wellick\u2019s bullet. But his doppelg\u00e4nger aside, Elliot doesn\u2019t realize how utterly alone he is. Darlene is pestering him for details \u2014 What is Stage 2? Is Wellick involved? \u2014 to an extent that points to a deal with the F.B.I. Angela, the person who knows him \u201cbetter than anyone,\u201d he says, is deceiving him in order to work with his alter ego in pursuit of Whiterose\u2019s mysterious objectives.But while the events of Season 2 left the core characters at cross purposes, one thing they share is a desire to reboot their circumstances. Elliot hopes a job at Evil Corp will allow him to undo the 5/9 hack, the mechanics of which are still a mystery, though you\u2019ll recall that in last season\u2019s finale Trenton told Mobley she\u2019s found a way to reverse the cyberattack. (How a convicted hacker could get hired by a multinational conglomerate is another question, but perhaps Angela could pull some strings.)Darlene, coming ever more unglued after the death of Cisco, her murder of Susan Jacobs and the revelation that Agent DiPerro is on to fsociety, seems keen to renounce her criminal past. Angela, meanwhile, seems determined to reset the universe.\u201cWhen we succeed, a whole new world will be born,\u201d she tells Mr. Robot.These sentiments refer back to the early scene in the premiere at the E Corp Washington Township power plant, which finds a scientist musing about parallel universes as Whiterose, in her Minister Zheng guise, and an associate walk past. After she extols Elliot\u2019s father\u2019s \u201cgreat engineering work that led to our early successes,\u201d she cryptically explains why Elliot is crucial to her agenda.\u201cWe may possess the necessary tools, but what we don\u2019t have is his unadulterated, focused rage,\u201d he says.Could Whiterose, who yearns to close the gap between who she is and who she has to be in public, be trying to unlock dimensions in which that might be possible? Recall that she told Agent DiPierro last season that contemplation of alternate realities \u201cmoves me very deeply,\u201d and she has seemingly convinced Angela that it\u2019s possible to undo the history in which her mother died. Such a notion also gibes with the show\u2019s overall obsession with duality and parallel existences.A question for viewers is, do we want them to exist? While I\u2019m sure any wild metaphysical detours would be based in actual theory, and have plenty of faith in Mr. Esmail\u2019s ability to render such themes, \u201cMr. Robot\u201d is at its best when its at least a little grounded. Even as the conflict between Elliot and his alter ego have taken on Gothic dimensions, much of the show\u2019s power comes from its dark but plausible dystopia. Its much-noted hacking authenticity is lost on most of us, but its clear-eyed depictions of how insurgences warp and falter, and how corporations smoothly turn rebellion into commerce \u2014 note the fsociety souvenir stand \u2014 give the show, at its best, a frisson few others can match.Besides, I still have pertinent questions: How did the 5/9 hack actually go down? What happened to Wellick last season? Here\u2019s hoping \u201cMr. Robot\u201d illuminates its current reality a little further before uncovering others.\u2022 I laughed out loud at Elliot\u2019s \u201cProperty of Josh Groban\u201d shirt, borrowed from Angela. It was also a fun call back to her ex Ollie\u2019s reminiscences about Josh Groban Night at the bar last season. The premiere suggested that Season 3 would have more humor than its largely grim predecessor (see also: the punch card exchange at the Red Wheelbarrow).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Executive Mentors Wanted. Only Millennials Need Apply.", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJunior office workers once had a fairly predictable set of daily tasks. Write the sales memo. Build the PowerPoint. Make the coffee.Now, many young professionals have a new mandate: Drag the boss into the 21st century.While businesses chase evanescent market trends and grapple with a fast-moving future, millennial mentors, as many companies call them, have emerged as a hot accessory for executives. Young workers, some just out of college, are being pulled into formal corporate programs to give advice to the top ranks of their companies.Millennial mentorship programs represent a formalized, mildly absurdist version of the advice junior workers have been giving their older colleagues for ages. Some executives want the views of young people on catering to new markets and developing new products, while others seek glorified tech support \u2014 Snapchat 101, Twitter tutorials and emoji lessons.These programs are not just a departure from the business world\u2019s traditional top-down management style. They are also a sign of just how perplexed some executives are by the young people in their midst.\u201cIt\u2019s like reconnecting with your lost youth,\u201d said David Watson, 38, a managing director at Deutsche Bank who has been mentored by Fernando Hernandez, 29, an engineer in the Wall Street bank\u2019s global markets technology division. He credited Mr. Hernandez with good tips for retaining young employees, like giving them more flexible work-from-home arrangements, and with helping him spot trends in the financial tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s valuable information,\u201d Mr. Watson said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making decisions about budgets, or priorities, or hiring, you can actually put into practice what you learned.\u201dIt was perhaps inevitable that older executives would turn to their young employees for advice. As technology has changed the way businesses run, it has also put power in the hands of digital natives, and left older, less tech-savvy executives angling for ways to keep up.Could these executives just ask their children for tech tips? Sure. But workplace programs allow executives to peer into the future of their industry and bond with a junior colleague simultaneously, with minimal embarrassment.Reverse mentoring \u2014 another name companies give to younger people training older workers \u2014 is not a new concept. Jack Welch, while the chief executive of General Electric in the 1990s, required 500 of his top managers to pair up with junior workers to learn how to use the internet. But executives are especially eager to learn from millennials, whose dominance in Silicon Valley has given older workers a fear of obsolescence.Compared with the prospect of shelling out thousands of dollars for one of those outside consultants, many executives prefer the alternative of using the young people already on their payroll.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty smart thing for them to do,\u201d said Malcolm Harris, the author of \u201cKids These Days,\u201d a forthcoming book about millennials and the economy. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get a 25-year-old to run your company, you can at least tell people your C.E.O. is talking to 25-year-olds.\u201dTiffany Zhong, 20, began mentoring Kara Nortman, 41, a partner at the venture capital firm Upfront Ventures, after Ms. Nortman asked her for advice on dealing with a new generation of tech entrepreneurs.Ms. Zhong now texts Ms. Nortman almost daily, doling out cultural lessons and pointers. She advised her on the proper usage of \u201cGucci\u201d \u2014 a slang term used by teens to mean \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 and gently corrected Ms. Nortman\u2019s texting etiquette.\u201cI told her, \u2018You can\u2019t send 10 emojis at once, that\u2019s not O.K.,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Zhong said.For Ms. Nortman, who invests in and advises technology companies, Ms. Zhong\u2019s lessons are not just academic.\u201cWe spend a lot of time talking about the psychology of a teen,\u201d Ms. Nortman said. \u201cIt\u2019s influenced a lot of perspectives around how to manage my own time, and how to invest.\u201dThese mentoring arrangements can be initially awkward for executives who are accustomed to dispensing advice, not receiving it. When Mr. Watson, the Deutsche Bank managing director, was first paired with Mr. Hernandez through his firm\u2019s millennial mentoring program, he was skeptical that useful advice could come from someone nearly a decade his junior. But the experience opened his mind. Recently, he said, he had spent two hours having an impromptu chat with some younger workers in his division.\u201cTo sit down with someone who\u2019s on the org chart six levels below me is educational,\u201d Mr. Watson said. \u201cYou learn about yourself, and how you differ from them.\u201dAnd the traditional mentoring benefit remains in place.\u201cI can still learn from him, obviously,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cBut I hope I can teach him some stuff.\u201dMany of the new reverse mentoring arrangements include lessons on new technology and emerging market trends. Gerald L. Hassell, 65, the chairman of Bank of New York Mellon, asked his millennial mentor, Darah Kirstein, a 32-year-old vice president at the bank, to help him streamline the information he got from the internet. She set him up on Tweetdeck, a Twitter app that allows for custom filters, and installed Flipboard, a digital magazine app, on his iPad. Eventually, Mr. Hassell began asking Ms. Kirstein for her thoughts on the direction of the company, and she became a trusted sounding board.\u201cA lot of our conversations were, how are millennials experiencing our organizational change? What advice do you have for better communicating?\u201d Mr. Hassell said.For Todd Sachse, the 53-year-old chief executive of Sachse Construction in Detroit, one appeal of the reverse-mentoring program was the potential to unite employees of multiple generations. Last year, Mr. Sachse paired 10 senior executives with 10 younger workers and assigned them to have monthly one-on-one conversations on topics like technology and stereotypes of younger workers, with a debriefing round at the end of six sessions.\u201cThe feedback was outstanding from both sides,\u201d Mr. Sachse said. \u201cIt dispelled some of the misperceptions of millennials.\u201dAs reverse mentoring programs grow in popularity, some young workers still lack the traditional, top-down mentorship meant to help them rise in their careers. According to a 2016 report by Deloitte, the consulting firm, more than half of young workers said their leadership skills were not being fully developed in the workplace.\u201cIt really is the opposite of the mentorship offer that firms have historically made to young people,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cNow it\u2019s just, \u2018We want you to come work for us, and teach us how to do our jobs.\u2019 \u201dStill, many of the young mentors seem happy to dole out advice. For Ms. Kirstein, who works at Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh offices, the extra attention from Mr. Hassell, who is based in New York, has been its own reward.\u201cI definitely get special nods here and there,\u201d Ms. Kirstein said. \u201cThe last time Gerald was here, he called me out in a town hall in front of a lot of people. That makes you feel good.\u201dMillennials, traditionally defined as those born after 1982, may not have the upper hand for long.Ms. Zhong, who started a consulting firm, Zebra Intelligence, to inform businesses about teenage attitudes, says that she\u2019s already getting inquiries from people asking to be mentored by members of Gen Z, often defined as the cohort born after 1996. She is planning to start a mutual mentorship program to connect teenagers and young 20-somethings with senior-level executives, and hopefully outsource some of the work she\u2019s been doing.\u201cI\u2019m like an on-demand Gen Z support,\u201d Ms. Zhong said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t keep all my adult friends up-to-date on everything.\u201dFollow Kevin Roose on Twitter @kevinroose.Advertisement"}

Is on Track for 2018: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. Andrew spent Sunday in Dhahran taping a television interview for CNBC at Saudi Aramco\u2019s headquarters with its C.E.O. ahead of the kingdom\u2019s Future of Finance Initiative \u2014 known informally as Davos in the Desert \u2014 that starts Tuesday morning. Throughout the week, we\u2019ll bring you all the back-room chatter and details about an Aramco I.P.O.But the question the Saudi oil giant has been careful to avoid answering is: Where will that offering take place?Amin Nasser, the oil giant\u2019s chief executive, told Andrew that the listing remained on track and denied reports that it could be delayed or shelved in favor of selling private shares.\u201cWe have always said that we will be listing in 2018, and to be more specific, in the second half of 2018. However, I think journalists and writers \u2014 they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the I.P.O. and all of that.\u201dNote that Mr. Nasser doesn\u2019t mention whether both parts of a potential Aramco I.P.O. \u2014 listings on both Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul exchange and on an international stock market like the N.Y.S.E. or the London Stock Exchange \u2014 are on track. He also denied that the company was talking with Chinese investors about a private placement. But do remember to parse those remarks: It is possible that the kingdom, not the company, would negotiate with the Chinese or others.For the betting types, here\u2019s what Mr. Trump told Maria Bartiromo: \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a number of people and most people are saying it\u2019s down to two, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Powell. I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot.\u201dThat may mean that John B. Taylor of Stanford University, who reportedly has the backing of Mike Pence, is the interest rate hawk more likely than Mr. Warsh to be nominated.For a plan that White House officials publicly hope can be passed by year\u2019s end, the proposed Republican tax overhaul still seems awfully in flux. The latest idea: creating what\u2019s essentially a fourth tax bracket by giving those who earn at least $1 million a year a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent.Don\u2019t forget about corporate taxesOn the agenda this week\u2022 Ivanka Trump is headed to a town-hall meeting in Pennsylvania today to talk tax reform, and in particular to argue for expanding the child tax credit.\u2022 Mr. Trump is scheduled to attend Senate Republicans\u2019 weekly policy lunch tomorrow to discuss taxes.\u201cHoward, at the end of the day, is a giant in the industry,\u201d Mr. Saverin told Michael in an interview. \u201cYou can gain a tremendous amount of perspective just from speaking with him for a couple of minutes.\u201dRemember what Fox is already dealing with: It\u2019s seeking approval from the British government for its takeover of the broadcaster Sky, and the Justice Department is still investigating Fox News\u2019s settlements with women who accused Roger Ailes of sexual harassment.What did the Murdochs know? From the NYT:Asked about the allegation of a nonconsensual sexual relationship, a representative for Mr. O\u2019Reilly, Mark Fabiani, said that 21st Century Fox was \u201cwell aware\u201d Ms. Wiehl had signed a sworn affidavit \u201crenouncing all allegations against him,\u201d adding that after receiving the document Fox News offered Mr. O\u2019Reilly \u201ca record-breaking contract.\u201dAnd then there was FidelityBrian Hogan, president of Fidelity\u2019s stock-picking division, held an emergency meeting to stress the firm\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy.\u201d From the WSJ:The issue of workplace conduct has been simmering within Fidelity\u2019s stock-picking unit in particular for years. A 2015 internal report warned of cultural problems particularly adverse for women, according to interviews with more than a dozen former Fidelity analysts and portfolio managers.More must-readsIn other global monetary newsM.&A.Policy and LegalBanks and BankingI.P.O.s and OfferingsBusiness and EconomyAdvertisement"}
