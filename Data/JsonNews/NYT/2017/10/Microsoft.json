{"Headline": "The Frightful Five Want to Rule Entertainment. They Are Hitting Limits.", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201dThe Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201dThis story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It\u2019s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Video Game Conventions Draw 300,000: Not in the U.S.", "Date": "2017-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNext week, 300,000 video game fans, developers and publishers like Sony, Ubisoft, Activision and Microsoft plan to congregate so they can showcase their wares and participate in a cosplay zone, an e-sports tournament and a 48-hour jam.Their destination: S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.The gathering is the Brasil Game Show, Latin America\u2019s largest gaming convention, which has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2009. The event is one of several international video game shows that have swelled in size recently. Gamescom, held in Cologne, Germany, and generally hailed as the world\u2019s biggest gaming convention, welcomed about 350,000 attendees this year, up from 275,000 five years ago. The Tokyo Game Show, which has been held annually since 1996, broke its attendance record last year with over 271,000 visitors, up from 224,000 five years ago.\u201cGames are now being designed, marketed and sold in ways that are customized for a particular country or region,\u201d said Mat Piscatella, a games industry analyst at NPD Group. \u201cGaming conventions are more common around the world, and at the same time the advent of game streaming tools like YouTube and Twitch are allowing anyone with a web browser to see these games for themselves in whatever language they choose.\u201dThe forces driving growth of video games in international markets are different from those in the United States. In Europe, developers are making games that focus on their national identities. One example is the independent video game Regional Nightclub Bouncer, which is made by a small British studio, PanicBarn, and homes in on two very British things: queuing at a nightclub, and Brexit.\u201cYou can see national identity coming through in the games, as they draw on aspects of their own cultural histories to make their work stand out in a crowded marketplace,\u201d said Matthew Handrahan, editor in chief at GamesIndustry.Biz, a website that tracks trends in international gaming markets.\u201cIf you look at lists of the most popular games from a given year in each country, you\u2019d be lucky to recognize more than a couple of games in the top 10,\u201d Mr. Handrahan said.In the North American market, the types of games that become blockbusters are comparatively homogeneous.In Latin America, there is a greater emphasis on PC games, particularly free-to-play ones, than console games. That is because people cannot pay for anything in an online game without a credit card, which Brazilian gamers typically do not use.Other challenges, like internet infrastructure and a complicated tax system that imposes high import rates on products not made in the country, have stopped Latin America from obtaining some video game systems at an affordable price. An Xbox 360 cost the equivalent of $1,450 in Latin America when it first appeared, about three times the price in the United States, Mr. Handrahan said.Marcelo Tavares, a former video game reporter, created the Brasil Game Show after attending E3 in 2006. The inaugural event, in 2009, attracted just 4,000 visitors.\u201cThe biggest challenges were to gain the trust of the public and companies to have them here,\u201d Mr. Tavares said. \u201cIn each edition of the show, we have to push expectations further in order to please everyone \u2014 visitors and exhibitors alike.\u201dThe show\u2019s popularity has helped to show the opportunity in the Brazilian market. In August, a Japanese video game designer, Hideo Kojima, creator of the highly successful Metal Gear Solid franchise, published by Konami, said he would attend the Brasil Game Show for the first time to receive a lifetime achievement award, as well as to participate in a panel about his professional career and meet fans.The Brasil Game Show also plans to have a special area for international guests, which it had not done before. Apart from Mr. Kojima, V.I.P.s coming from overseas include Ed Boon, a co-creator of the Mortal Kombat fighting game series, and Nolan Bushnell, the Atari founder and one of the so-called founding fathers of the industry.Mr. Tavares said the number of Brazilian video game studios had grown by 600 percent in the last eight years and stood at about 500. More American video game companies have also established a presence in Latin America.\u201cThe Brazilian market has enormous potential,\u201d said Bertrand Chaverot, managing director of Latin America for Ubisoft. \u201cBy the end of 2017, there will be one smartphone per citizen, representing approximately 208 million mobile devices, in addition to the 166 million PCs.\u201dHe added, \u201cAs Brazil can be considered the engine of the South American market, it is expected that its growth will push the whole region as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Apple and Facebook Chiefs Visit, Xi Jinping Vows Deeper Reform", "Date": "2017-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States.Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and China\u2019s relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive.The reception was one of Mr. Xi\u2019s first public appearances with foreign visitors since a key Chinese Communist Party congress elevated him to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong, the country\u2019s founding father, and Deng Xiaoping, who led the country from 1978 until 1989.The event \u2014 just a week before Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China \u2014 was most likely arranged to signal China\u2019s status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States.Chinese diplomats have used past business summits to promote their country\u2019s economic clout and influence with American companies before testier meetings with United States leaders and diplomats. On a 2015 trip to the United States, for example, Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle to visit American technology executives before going to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama.On Monday, Mr. Xi used his remarks to promote his credentials as a leader following Deng\u2019s footsteps as an economic reformer and defender of global trade.International investors and business groups have grown increasingly skeptical about Mr. Xi\u2019s commitment to opening up the Chinese economy. The Chinese government, citing worries that foreign technology and companies could compromise the country\u2019s security, has fed those doubts by tightening restrictions over the internet and advanced technology.And even as Mr. Xi reiterated his commitment to reform, he emphasized that China\u2019s sovereignty and security were of paramount importance.\u201cChina will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and developmental interests, and at the same time adhere to a fundamental national policy of opening up,\u201d he said.For the executives attending the event on Monday, the restrictions are hitting the bottom line. Facebook remains mostly blocked in China despite the company\u2019s lobbying efforts. Apple said this year that it would build a data center in the country to conform with a new Chinese cybersecurity law.The moves by Beijing have prompted calls in Washington for added scrutiny of Chinese companies seeking to do business in the United States or buy up American technology companies. Such issues are unlikely to be addressed in the coming meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, experts said.Mr. Xi\u2019s appeal to the executives on Monday in some ways contrasted with Mr. Trump\u2019s clashes with the leaders of some American tech companies. Other executives attending the event included Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive; Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba; Pony Ma, Tencent\u2019s chief executive; and Terry Guo, the chief executive of Foxconn.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cisco and Google Find Mutual Interest in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Cisco Systems, two trendsetters in different eras of the internet, are joining forces as the growth of cloud computing puts new pressure on big tech companies and leads to strange corporate bedfellows.The Silicon Valley giants on Wednesday announced a collaboration to help companies manage software and technology services that may run in their own data centers or in facilities operated by external cloud services.Google, the largest unit of its parent, Alphabet, hopes to benefit from Cisco\u2019s close ties to corporate customers as the search engine giant tries to catch up to Amazon, the market leader in cloud services, and Microsoft.Cisco could also use some help. The tech giant, which in 2000 briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company when its computer networking equipment was used to build the internet, faces a serious threat from cloud services. Companies that once spent heavily on new hardware from Cisco and other suppliers increasingly rent cloud services instead, with companies like Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting in the background.\u201cEvery company that built an empire on selling equipment to companies to put in their data centers is feeling incredible pressure,\u201d said Dave Bartoletti, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, a market research firm.Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year.Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different. They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems. By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies\u2019 data centers.The idea, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those \u201csecurity gaps.\u201dGoogle has moved aggressively to catch up. In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMware\u2019s technology a mainstay at many corporations.She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features. In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.So has Cisco. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called \u201cintercloud\u201d that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage \u201chybrid\u201d cloud arrangements \u2014 industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a company\u2019s own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.\u201cWe think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world,\u201d said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco\u2019s networking and security business.The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions. On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept. Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers\u2019 premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.\u201cWe see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique,\u201d said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business.VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software. Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S. to court customers. Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a \u201cvalidation\u201d of his own company\u2019s vision.Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S. and Microsoft in cloud computing. But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.\u201cWe are both users of each other\u2019s products,\u201d said Mr. H\u00f6lzle of Google. But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Amazon, Diversity Concerns Flare Up After Harassment Accusations", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon on Friday tried to quell concerns among employees about sexual harassment accusations against an executive, sending an email to its staff saying the company would review its policies to ensure that \u201cthey are doing their job to provide a harassment-free workplace.\u201dThe email is the first broad internal communication by Amazon since Roy Price, who oversaw Amazon Studios, left the company this week after details of the accusations became public. A lawyer for the woman who has made the accusations said Amazon previously investigated and knew all the details about the episode, which happened in 2015.Amazon\u2019s handling of Mr. Price has set off confusion, debate and finger-pointing inside the company, according to two employees. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies, said numerous employees were heatedly discussing the timing of Mr. Price\u2019s departure.Some current and former employees are suggesting that the scarcity of women at the upper echelons of Amazon could have made the company more lenient toward Mr. Price until his actions became a public relations embarrassment.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.The episode involving Mr. Price occurred in 2015 when he was in a car with Isa Dick Hackett, a Hollywood producer. She told investigators for Amazon shortly after the car ride that Mr. Price made unwanted sexual advances toward her.But there is confusion among some Amazon employees about why Mr. Price did not lose his job in 2015 after the company learned of Ms. Hackett\u2019s accusations. One consequence Mr. Price faced after the episode was being told to be careful how much alcohol he drank at work functions, according to a third employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies. The employee was briefed on the decision.Some of the frustration inside the company has been directed at Jeff Blackburn, the Amazon senior vice president who directly managed Mr. Price. Mr. Blackburn sent the email to Amazon\u2019s film and television employees on Friday, and it was more broadly distributed by other executives to their groups.In his email, Mr. Blackburn said Amazon was \u201ctaking this situation, and the general issue of sexual harassment, very seriously.\u201d He said it was not appropriate to share personnel details publicly, but said that Mr. Price\u2019s departure \u201cfollowed new information that surfaced last week, as well as other factors.\u201dCharles Harder, a lawyer for Mr. Price, did not respond to messages requesting comment.The pinnacle of Amazon is an elite group known as the S-team, roughly 16 senior executives, fewer than a dozen of whom report directly to Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive. Just one member of the S-team is a woman, Beth Galetti, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for human resources, according to two of the three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In August, at a staff meeting for Amazon employees held at a basketball arena, Mr. Bezos was asked about the dearth of diversity \u2014 implying gender and race \u2014 on his senior leadership team. Amazon employees applauded loudly at the question.Mr. Bezos replied that diversity was important at Amazon, according to two of the employees who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But Mr. Bezos said that adding more diversity to the leadership team would happen slowly because of low turnover in its ranks \u2014 an answer that left many employees disappointed.One of the Amazon employees, who recently looked at an organizational chart, said Amazon\u2019s S-team members and the people who report directly to them amount to roughly 90 people, about 75 of whom are men.Amazon has taken some steps in recent years to make working at the company more appealing to women. Two years ago, it instituted a more generous maternity leave policy, providing birth mothers with up to 20 weeks of paid leave.But the company\u2019s office culture still has a hard-charging reputation that could make it harder to recruit more women. Textio, a Seattle start-up that uses software to analyze language, has examined public job postings for all the major internet companies. The company found that the language in Amazon\u2019s skewed most sharply to the masculine end of the spectrum, with frequent use of words like \u201cwickedly,\u201d \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201cmaniacal.\u201dJodi Kantor contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Finds Accounts Connected to Russia Bought Election Ads", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has found evidence that Russian agents bought ads on its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign.The findings from an internal inquiry draw Google further into the growing investigation of how social networks and technology services were manipulated by the Russian government to spread misinformation and sow division during the 2016 election.Using accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government, the agents purchased $4,700 worth of search ads and more traditional display ads, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s inquiry who was not allowed to speak about it publicly. Google found the accounts through its own research and information provided by other technology companies.Google found a separate $53,000 worth of ads with political material that were purchased from Russian internet addresses, building addresses or with Russian currency. It is not clear whether any of those were connected to the Russian government, and they may have been purchased by Russian citizens, the person said.The messages of those ads spanned the political spectrum. One account spent $7,000 on ads to promote a documentary called \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Trumped,\u201d a film about Donald J. Trump\u2019s efforts to build a golf course in Scotland along an environmentally sensitive coastline. Another spent $36,000 on ads questioning whether President Barack Obama needed to resign. Yet another bought ads to promote political merchandise for Mr. Obama.The ads appeared mainly alongside Google\u2019s search results or on websites that use Google ads outside the search company\u2019s own sites. It was not clear whether such ads appeared on YouTube or the Gmail email service, the person said.There is a chance that Google may find other ads from Russian-linked accounts, the person familiar with the investigation said.Microsoft, a distant rival to Google in the internet search and advertising market, said Monday evening that it too was examining whether suspected Russian agents used its services to show political ads during the 2016 election. Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine accounts for about 23 percent of searches in the United States, compared with more than 63 percent for Google, according comScore, an internet measurement firm.Google has been called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. But it has so far escaped the intense scrutiny confronting Facebook after the social network admitted that it discovered 470 profiles and pages to the internet Research Agency, a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said on Monday that it should not be surprising that Russians were using Google as well as Facebook and Twitter. The only thing that is surprising, he said, is that it took so long for Google to find the activity.\u201cIt will take more time and length and breadth to know what Russia did on social media,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut the themes are consistent across platforms: the desire to help Donald Trump, to hurt Hillary Clinton and the desire to set Americans against each other.\u201dIn addition to the Senate committee hearing, Google and Facebook are expected to testify at another Nov. 1 hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. Twitter was also invited to the House committee hearing, but it was not clear on Monday whether officials from the company planned to attend.But Google\u2019s investigation has not found the same type of pinpoint advertising that Russian agents conducted on Facebook. The social network allows advertisers to target its audience with more specificity than Google, including users with a wide range of political leanings.The 2016 presidential election was the first time that Google allowed targeting by political leanings and it allowed just two categories \u2014 left-leaning and right-leaning.However, Google has not found any evidence that the ads from the accounts suspected of having ties to the Russian government used these political categories or geographic parameters to focus on specific groups, the person familiar with the company\u2019s investigation said. The ads were much more broad, aimed at English-language queries or any users in the United States, for example.A Google spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said the company had a policy that limited political ad targeting and prohibited targeting based on race and religion.\u201cWe are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,\u201d Ms. Faville said.On Facebook, fake Russia-linked accounts \u2014 in which fictional people posed as American activists \u2014 promoted inflammatory messages on divisive issues. Those accounts bought advertising to promote those messages and reach a bigger audience within the Facebook universe, while promoting the incendiary posts to different locations or people with established political leanings for maximum impact.The Russian-linked accounts did not target ads based on political affiliation, but it raises the question of why Google allowed such targeting for the 2016 election when it had not done so in the past. The only location where Google allows ad targeting by political affiliation is the United States.Google is working with Jigsaw, a think tank owned by its parent company, Alphabet. Jigsaw has been doing research for 18 months on fake news and misinformation campaigns and Google is applying some of those findings in the investigation into Russian election meddling, the person said. It is also working with other technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, in addition to independent researchers and law enforcement.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter @daiwakaCecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

But many new philanthropists appear less interested in naming a business school after themselves than in changing the world.\u201cThey have a problem-solving mentality rather than a stewardship mentality,\u201d said David Callahan, founder of the website Inside Philanthropy and author of \u201cThe Givers,\u201d a book about today\u2019s major donors. \u201cThey are not saving their money for a rainy day. They want to have impact now.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a real changing of the guard,\u201d said Mr. Callahan. \u201cThe top foundations, especially measured by annual giving, are more and more piloted by people who are alive.\u201dHaving made billions and shaped the world with their companies, this new guard is setting lofty goals as they prepare to give their fortunes away. Take the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. It is not looking to merely improve health in the developing world. One of its aspirations is to help \u201ccure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century.\u201dThat may sound like good news all around. If a handful of billionaires want to spend their fortunes saving lives, why not simply applaud them? But as their ambitions grow, so too does their influence, meaning that for better or worse, a few billionaires are wielding considerable influence over everything from medical research to social policy to politics.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the government collecting taxes and deciding which social problems it wants to solve through a democratic process,\u201d said Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, a nonprofit that works with foundations. \u201cThis is a small group of people, who have made way more money than they need, deciding what issues they care about. That affects us all.\u201dNearly two years later, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is taking shape. Structured as a limited liability corporation rather than a traditional foundation, a move the founders say give them more flexibility, the organization is focused on three main areas: science, education and justice.In considering how to deploy his billions, Mr. Zuckerberg was no doubt inspired by his friend and mentor, the Microsoft co-founder Mr. Gates. Since its founding 2000, the Gates Foundation has established itself as a force without peer in big philanthropy. Not only does it have the largest endowment of any foundation, some $40 billion, but it also spends more each year, nearly $5.5 billion in 2016 alone.Mr. Soros\u2019s foundation differs in important ways. Rather than try to solve discrete problems like disease, Open Society aims to promote values like democracy, tolerance and inclusion, which Mr. Soros, a Holocaust survivor, holds dear. In practice, this means that his money is less likely to fund early stage medical research, and more likely to help refugees displaced by conflict.But while the issues they address are distinct, the broad outline of these billionaires\u2019 efforts have much in common: shaping the world in their moral image. \u201cIt is not called the Soros Foundation,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, the incoming president of the Open Society Foundations. \u201cGeorge approaches this philanthropic effort without an eye toward the preservation of his reputation and legacy, but with a fierce determination around the protection of these ideas and ideals.\u201dToday, the Ford Foundation is focused on reducing inequality, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is focusing on \u201cbig bets\u201d including combating climate change. But those legacy foundations are now largely guided by stewards, not the billionaires with their names on the door. Mr. Gates, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Soros are personally engaged in their foundations, and willing to court controversy.Mr. Soros became a lightning rod for conservative criticism largely because of his own political contributions rather than his foundation\u2019s spending. He was a major donor to Hillary Clinton, and spent millions of dollars on efforts to defeat Donald J. Trump in last year\u2019s presidential election.Yet he is equally reviled in certain circles for his philanthropic work. Since the 1990s, Mr. Soros has used the Open Society Foundations to advance causes that are deeply unpopular with many Republicans, including loosening drug laws, promoting gay rights and calling attention to abuses by the police.Mr. Gaspard of the Open Society Foundations asserts that Mr. Soros is not courting controversy. Rather, he said, Mr. Soros is simply on the right side of history. \u201cThe rights of the Jewish community in 1937 in Berlin may have been deemed controversial by some in that society, but we all appreciate today the inherent value in that fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same is true today, when we are involved in safe needle transfers for drug addicts, or when we\u2019re engaged in supporting the rights of sex workers in Johannesburg, or the Rohingya in Myanmar.\u201dMichael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is also no stranger to criticism. The purpose of his foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is to \u201censure better, longer lives for the greatest number of people.\u201d In practice, this has meant Mr. Bloomberg spending hundreds of millions of dollars on issues including gun control and obesity prevention, drawing the ire of Republicans who oppose what they see as excessive regulation.\u201cJulius Rosenwald was the first social justice philanthropist,\u201d said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. \u201cHe upset all of the powers in the South.\u201dThere are equally powerful forces flexing their financial muscles on both sides of the political spectrum. And, like Mr. Soros, conservatives are using both foundations and political donations to achieve their goals.\u201cThe wealthy have become more polarized along with the rest of America,\u201d said Mr. Callahan. \u201cYou have more liberal, progressive wealthy people than ever before. Meanwhile, you have lots of conservative rich people. There\u2019s this escalating arms race among mega donors.\u201dFor the most part, previous generations of billionaires only got serious about giving away their fortunes late in life and that has been changing. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing these days is people make so much money with an I.P.O. that being a philanthropist becomes an essential part of your identity in your late 20s,\u201d said Benjamin Soskis, who studies the history of philanthropy at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington.So little time, and so much money to dispose of \u2014 that is the dilemma for today\u2019s mega philanthropists. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Chan say they are committed to giving away their fortune in their lifetime, which is why they are beginning at such a young age. \u201cGiving, like anything else, takes practice to do effectively,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. \u201cSo if we want to be good at it in 10-15 years, we should start now.\u201dBy starting sooner, Mr. Zuckerberg said his money should go further. \u201cAny good we do will hopefully compound over time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we can help children get a better education now then they can grow up and help others too in the time we might have otherwise waited to get started.\u201dMr. Gates and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, which asks wealthy people to commit to donating at least half of their fortunes to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes or upon their death. They want their fellow billionaires to act with urgency. On their own website, the Gates\u2019 describes themselves as \u201cimpatient optimists.\u201dMore than 48,000 replies flooded in. Mr. Bezos has not announced what he will do with his many billions, but his request for proposals was a reminder that there are untold fortunes that remain uncommitted to philanthropic causes. Nearly 200 people with a combined worth approaching $1 trillion have signed the Giving Pledge. New billionaires are beginning to ramp up their giving. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, recently founded the Emerson Collective, which is putting money toward issues including education and immigration.And as more people commit their fortunes to philanthropy, there will be many more organizations like the Open Society Foundations, and they may be with us for a long time. \u201cThe sun never sets on George Soros\u2019s philanthropic empire, and the money is never going to run out,\u201d said Mr. Callahan. \u201cHis money could still be affecting public policy 300 years from now.\u201dIt is the dawn of a new era of big philanthropy. As wealth is rapidly created and concentrated, new mega foundations are being born, each reflecting its founder\u2019s priorities. And much as Mr. Soros, Mr. Gates, Mr. Zuckerberg and the others in their cohort have eclipsed the titans of the Gilded Age, they are likely to one day be overtaken by an even newer crop of immensely wealthy and impatient optimists.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Mark Zuckerberg in 2015. He was 31, not 33.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When an Algorithm Helps Send You to Prison", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2013, police officers in Wisconsin arrested a man driving a car that had been used in a recent shooting. The man, Eric Loomis, pleaded guilty to attempting to flee an officer, and no contest to operating a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent. Neither of his crimes mandates prison time.At Mr. Loomis\u2019s sentencing, the judge cited, among other factors, Mr. Loomis\u2019s high risk of recidivism as predicted by a computer program called COMPAS, a risk assessment algorithm used by the state of Wisconsin. The judge denied probation and prescribed an 11-year sentence: six years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision.No one knows exactly how COMPAS works; its manufacturer refuses to disclose the proprietary algorithm. We only know the final risk assessment score it spits out, which judges may consider at sentencing.Mr. Loomis challenged the use of an algorithm as a violation of his due process rights to be sentenced individually, and without consideration of impermissible factors like gender. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected his challenge. In June, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear his case, meaning a majority of justices effectively condoned the algorithm\u2019s use. Their decision will have far-ranging effects.Something about this story is fundamentally wrong: Why are we allowing a computer program, into which no one in the criminal justice system has any insight, to play a role in sending a man to prison?At a sentencing, it is entirely a judge\u2019s prerogative to prescribe a sentence within statutory guidelines. The obvious flaw with this system is bias. Judges might abuse this unchecked power to sentence based not only on relevant factors, such as the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s offense, but also on those that are morally and constitutionally problematic \u2014 for example, gender and race.But shifting the sentencing responsibility to a computer does not necessarily eliminate bias; it delegates and often compounds it.Algorithms like COMPAS simply mimic the data with which we train them. COMPAS\u2019s authors presumably fed historical recidivism data into their system. From that, the program ascertained what factors tend to make a defendant a higher risk. It then applied the patterns it gleaned to subsequent defendants, like Mr. Loomis, to spit out sentences that comport with existing trends.Even if you think Mr. Loomis\u2019s sentencing procedure arrived at the appropriate result, the potential that the process the state took to arrive there was biased \u2014 in ways neither judges nor defendants nor prosecutors know \u2014 should alarm anyone.Algorithms also lack the human ability to individualize. A computer cannot look a defendant in the eye, account for a troubled childhood or disability, and recommend a rehabilitative sentence. This is precisely the argument against mandatory minimum sentences \u2014 they rob judges of the discretion to deliver individualized justice \u2014 and it is equally cogent against machine sentencing.For example, algorithms are often programmed to assume unidirectional causation: If A, then B. But is it truly that defendants with higher rates of recidivism warrant longer sentences or is it that defendants with longer sentences are kept out of their communities, unemployed and away from their families longer, naturally increasing their recidivism risk? A judge could investigate this nuance.For now, the only people with visibility into COMPAS\u2019s functioning are its programmers, who are in many ways less equipped than judges to deliver justice. Judges have legal training, are bound by ethical oaths, and must account for not only their decisions but also their reasoning in published opinions. Programmers lack each of these safeguards.Computers may be intelligent, but they are not wise. Everything they know, we taught them, and we taught them our biases. They are not going to un-learn them without transparency and corrective action by humans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Worries? Big Tech Companies Post Glowing Quarterly Profits", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut back on their home turfs, it is business as usual, as earnings reports from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, demonstrated on Thursday. All displayed the kinds of performances that make investors happy: profit surges, big jumps in revenue \u2014 sometimes both.If revenue growth is a good indication of giving the public what it wants, customers appear to love what the biggest technology companies are offering, whether it\u2019s cheap online storage, clothing or a social network, and the party isn\u2019t slowing down.But to a different audience \u2014 regulators, competitors, academics \u2014 the continued show of strength by big technology companies is a further sign of the risks of their getting bigger, even if there does not appear to be much of an appetite to do anything about it in the United States.\u201cI do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that it\u2019s Brussels,\u201d Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company\u2019s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazon\u2019s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazon\u2019s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Next week, Google\u2019s top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google\u2019s pending appearance before Congress.Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share \u2014 surpassing Wall Street\u2019s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue \u2014 up 24 percent \u2014 while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company\u2019s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company\u2019s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion \u2014 or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.Microsoft executives credited much of the company\u2019s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft\u2019s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.While Microsoft\u2019s attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment \u2014 its foray into making smartphones was a bomb \u2014 its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. to Limit Use of Secrecy Orders That Microsoft Challenged", "Date": "2017-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Justice Department will limit its use of secrecy orders that prevent internet providers from telling people when the government has obtained a warrant to read their email during an investigation, according to a department memo issued last week.Microsoft and other internet companies that supported its lawsuit had raised alarms that the government was using a gag order statute in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 in a way that violated the principles of the First and Fourth Amendments. The First Amendment gives companies the right to speak to their customers, and the Fourth Amendment gives people the right to know if the government has searched or seized their property.Technology companies worried that overuse of the statute could jeopardize the trust people had regarding the privacy of their online data, potentially undermining the growth of cloud computing services.Microsoft\u2019s chief complaint was that the government was using the gag orders on a routine basis and in some cases making them indefinite, in essence preventing Microsoft from ever telling its customers that their data had been retrieved. During one 18-month period, Microsoft found that 68 percent of the legal demands from the federal government that came with secrecy orders required the company to remain silent on them indefinitely.In a memorandum on Oct. 19, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, told department lawyers that the secrecy orders should \u201chave an appropriate factual basis and each should extend only as long as necessary to satisfy the government\u2019s interest.\u201d Except under exceptional circumstances, the memorandum said federal prosecutors could seek a delay in notice of one year or less to a person whose communications had been obtained.\u201cThis update further ensures that the department can protect the rights of citizens we serve, while allowing companies to maintain relationships with their customers by notifying those suspected of crimes, or believed to have information relevant to a crime, in a timely manner that information was obtained relating to their user accounts,\u201d Lauren Ehrsam, a department spokeswoman, said by email.In the blog post, Mr. Smith of Microsoft wrote: \u201cThis is an important step for both privacy and free expression. It is an unequivocal win for our customers, and we\u2019re pleased the DOJ has taken these steps to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As \u2018Unicorns\u2019 Emerge, Utah Makes a Case for Tech Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipWhen Josh James traveled to the Bay Area in 2000, seeking funding for a web analytics company he had founded, he spoke at length with a venture capitalist about his plans for growth. The conversation was going well, Mr. James recently recalled, until the investor asked where he was based. \u201cAs soon as I told him I was from Utah, he literally, without saying a word, turned around and walked away.\u201dUtah entrepreneurs no longer get that icy response.The state has a thriving technology hub in the roughly 80-mile swath from Provo to Ogden, with Salt Lake City in between. The region has given rise to at least five companies valued at more than $1 billion. The concentration of these so-called unicorns is surpassed only by California, New York and Massachusetts, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital investment.Mr. James has even helped coin the name \u201cSilicon Slopes\u201d to brand the region \u2014 a wink at the Bay Area and a nod to the renowned ski areas in the state, home to the 2002 Olympics.\u201cFounders viewed their companies like they\u2019re building the family business or a farm \u2014 they\u2019re building them to keep,\u201d said Ryan Smith, the founder of Qualtrics, a data analytics company that focuses on surveys and other research for corporate and academic clients. \u201cWith no outside funding, there\u2019s no lifeline and you have to figure it out on your own.\u201dOne reason for the growth, said Mark Gorenberg, a venture capitalist with Zetta Venture Partners in San Francisco, is the emphasis that some start-ups have placed on data analytics \u2014 a growing field that has helped put the state on the map. E-commerce companies, as well as those specializing in medical devices and cloud computing, have also flourished.As the local tech community has grown, local venture capital firms have formed in the state, providing seed money as well as participating in later funding rounds. According to CB Insights, more than $2.6 billion has been invested in the 10 most well-funded companies in Utah.\u201cThe region transformed from a recreation area with some tech companies to a full tech ecosystem,\u201d said Mr. Gorenberg, whose firm has invested in three Utah-based companies.In a state where 59 percent of residents describe themselves as active Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a presence in the start-up scene as well. Many company founders are members, and while the church does not directly invest in individual companies, said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, the emphasis on family permeates many start-ups in the area.Some say the Mormon culture fosters a collaborative spirt among the area\u2019s tech community, and the founders of unicorns regularly get together. Last month, for example, several founders worked until 3 a.m. at Mr. Smith\u2019s home, organizing a January conference meant to coincide with the Sundance Film Festival in Utah \u2014 an effort to create a tech and entertainment conference similar to the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex.Mr. Smith\u2019s father, Scott, started Qualtrics in 2002 to help businesses measure customer and client satisfaction; the younger Mr. Smith joined the nascent company while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University after doctors diagnosed cancer in his father (who has since recovered). His older brother Jared, an executive at Google, joined several years later.The company, which has received funding from Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital and Insight Venture Partners, now has a valuation of $2.5 billion. Mr. Smith said it had annual revenue above $250 million, with corporate clients including Microsoft and Marriott International.At Pluralsight, a company focusing on tech training, the trajectory was similar. Aaron Skonnard, its chief executive, founded the company with three others, each putting in $5,000 to initially develop in-person training programs.The four traveled worldwide for their programs until Mr. Skonnard realized that it would be more efficient to train clients online; by 2011, the company had begun offering only virtual training, walking away from half of its $1.5 million in revenue. But the switch paid off. Pluralsight began receiving outside funding in 2012 from venture capital firms such as Insight Venture and Iconiq Capital. The company, now valued at more than $1 billion, estimated that revenues will reach $190 million this year.Now, the start-ups are dealing with the challenges to growth that others in tech face: recruiting new engineers and programmers, as well as seasoned executives.It is one area where the companies outwardly compete, especially as they seek to improve their diversity. And the hiring needs can be significant. Pluralsight, for example, this month announced plans to add 2,400 new jobs over the next decade and move from Farmington to a new campus south of Salt Lake City, closer to the other tech companies.The local universities have played an important role in fostering homegrown talent. Brigham Young, the private university affiliated with the Mormon Church, and the public University of Utah have programs intended to develop young entrepreneurs.But as demand for talent has grown, it has also meant companies have needed to recruit outside Utah.Their pitch often involves promoting the accessibility of outdoor activities, including hiking and skiing. Jaunts to Park City, the ski town, are common, and many choose to settle in that area. Besides, the office spaces of many of these companies typify the start-up ethos: abundant food, table tennis and pool tables, and, at Qualtrics, even an indoor basketball court.The companies also talk up the growth of their competitors, to assure recruits that many opportunities exist within the state if an employee \u2014 at any level \u2014 wants to make a move. There are more than 4,000 tech companies in the state, according to figures from the governor\u2019s office; Mr. James, who employs 810 people at Domo, sometimes suggests that those interviewing speak to others in the region.\u201cI want them to know that re-deployability isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d he said.The efforts have paid off, Mr. Smith said. This year alone, his company has hired 150 people who moved from outside the state.Joy Driscoll Durling, the chief information and digital enablement officer at Vivint Smart Home, was working at Adobe in California when she had the opportunity to move to Utah, where Adobe established offices after its acquisition of Omniture.\u201cNo one in my family could believe I was even considering it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my family and I appreciate the outdoors.\u201dAnd while they briefly considered returning to the Bay Area, they have stayed because of both work-life balance and the career opportunities. In March, Ms. Durling left Adobe and joined Vivint, which provides home security and automation products.Apart from lifestyle, the potential for an initial public offering helps with recruiting \u2014 and legitimacy. Farrah Kim, a spokeswoman for CB Insights, said the best \u201cway to jump-start a start-up ecosystem is for a cluster of big exits to emerge,\u201d whether through deals or I.P.O.s.The public markets afford companies more capital for growth, whether organic or through acquisitions, Mr. James said. And, he added, an I.P.O. enhances a company\u2019s profile because it shows that the business has been vetted by bankers and lawyers.\u201cOne day, people think you\u2019re a cute entrepreneur,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re treated dramatically different once you\u2019re public.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Good Decision in the Next Big Data Privacy Case", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2013, United States agents served a warrant on Microsoft seeking the emails of a suspect in a drug case. Microsoft balked at the request, saying that the data was stored on a server in Ireland and out of the reach of United States law enforcement. To access the data, the United States would need to make a request to the Irish government through diplomatic channels \u2014 a slow and burdensome process. The government fought back, arguing that the Washington State-based company could access the emails from the United States, without ever stepping foot in Ireland, and was required to comply.Both of these positions have troubling implications. What is needed is a solution that falls between these two extremes. Because the courts can\u2019t provide this, Congress needs to step in.At issue in the case is the interpretation of a 30-year old statute, the Stored Communications Act. The Act was written before there even was a global internet, let alone anything that resembles the cloud. The statute governs when and how law enforcement can demand an internet service provider turn over data needed for a criminal investigation. But it is silent on the key issue presented by the case \u2013 whether and when United States warrants can reach data held outside the United States.If the Supreme Court backs Microsoft, law enforcement access to data will be limited based on the arbitrary fact of where the data happens to be stored. Prosecutors will have to use diplomatic channels to seek enforcement of their warrants overseas.This would require the data to be held in a relatively fixed location, and in a location known to the United States. It would put United States law enforcement investigations under the control of foreign governments, some of which have no interest in or capacity to cooperate with the United States. And it would preclude the United States from directly accessing the data of an American resident, even in the investigation of a local crime, and even if it has obtained a warrant, based simply on where the data is held.Domestic law enforcement agencies are rightly concerned. The ruling provides a blueprint for malicious actors to evade the reach of American law enforcement. It also incentivizes costly data localization mandates, pursuant to which companies are required to store data locally as a means of ensuring law enforcement access. This would undermine the growth potential of the internet and potentially price small start-ups out of the international market.But a government win would have its own costs. It would broadcast to the world that United States law enforcement can access data held by a domestically based company anywhere. This could be deeply damaging to American tech companies already reeling from the economic fallout of the Snowden revelations \u2014 lost revenue from foreign customers concerned about the scope of U.S. foreign intelligence. Rightly or wrongly, foreigners are wary about what they see as the broad reach of the American surveillance state. The unconstrained ability of domestic law enforcement to access data stored overseas threatens to push a potentially lucrative foreign customer base further away from United States-based providers, as the number of tech companies that have rallied to Microsoft\u2019s defense highlights.More critically, it would set a dangerous precedent, allowing governments to reach data across borders without regard to the sovereign interests of other states. It would make it that much harder for the United States to protect our own citizens and residents from the reach of foreign law enforcement asserting the same authority. It would, as a result, threaten privacy on a global scale.Such a shift makes sense. People have connections to the place that they live, not where their data happens to be stored. Such a system preserves democratic accountability. It focuses on a government\u2019s sovereign interest over its people \u2014 as opposed to the 0s and 1s that flow through a digital platform in its territory.How we resolve this issue will shape privacy, security, the economy and the very future of the internet for years to come. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to take the case is a clarion call for Congressional action.Jennifer Daskal is an associate professor at American University Washington College of Law and was formerly counsel to the assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Link Uniting Donors and Doers for Social Change", "Date": "2017-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersStanley Druckenmiller, the hedge fund manager, wanted his charitable dollars to do more to reduce childhood poverty. He had been deeply involved with the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone, which helps poor children and families in New York. But he said he wanted to do something to break the cycle of generational poverty, a goal seemingly beyond even a very wealthy person like himself.\u201cI\u2019m not rich enough to do it alone,\u201d said Mr. Druckenmiller, the founder of Duquesne Capital Management, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $4.7 billion. \u201cIf I was worth $50 billion or $60 billion, I\u2019d go this alone, but I\u2019m not.\u201dLikewise, Connie Ballmer, a co-founder of the Ballmer Group and the wife of Steven A. Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, had been giving money to child welfare organizations around Washington State. The Ballmers, with a net worth of more than $34 billion, wanted to find a way to team up with others to have a greater impact on the issue nationwide.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear this from me, but it\u2019s really hard to give money away\u201d to organizations focused on childhood poverty, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as picking a university or hospital to give to. You have to do a lot of research.\u201dMr. Druckenmiller and his wife, Fiona, joined the Ballmers and other wealthy philanthropists, who have each committed $50 million to $250 million, to fund initiatives focused on reducing childhood poverty. They\u2019re doing so through Blue Meridian Partners, a philanthropic fund created by the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, which aims to invest $1 billion in other nonprofit organizations working on issues affecting poor children.\u201cWe start with the belief that it\u2019s actually possible to solve significant social problems confronting the children and youth living in poverty today,\u201d said Nancy Roob, chief executive of Blue Meridian Partners and the foundation. \u201cWhat brings people together and what makes it work are the opportunities to invest in leaders and strategies. It\u2019s the opportunity to together solve problems that none of us would be able to do on our own.\u201dTaz Hussein, partner at the consultant Bridgespan Group and author of the report \u201cField Catalysts: The Unseen Agents That Galvanize Social Change,\u201d said he and his colleagues had identified 15 social change efforts \u2014 like reducing malaria deaths, bringing about same-sex marriage, reducing obesity \u2014 and asked what big change would look like. They found that each effort had a core organization providing leadership and support to other groups tackling the same issue.\u201cThese organizations would never say they were the organizations driving these changes,\u201d Mr. Hussein said. \u201cIn terms of size relative to the total investment, these organizations are relatively small, and they\u2019re nimble. They try to take that bird\u2019s-eye view and problem solve. They helped to align funders.\u201dThey were also, he said, \u201ctrying to be appropriately humble.\u201dMr. Hussein identified the Freedom to Marry campaign, led by Evan Wolfson, a visiting professor at Yale and Georgetown Law Schools, as one such field catalyst.Mr. Wolfson said he had begun working on the movement for same-sex marriage in 1983, when he wrote his law school thesis. The goal was achieved in 2015 with the Supreme Court ruling allowing marriage nationwide. He attributed the group\u2019s success to having clarity around its goals and maintaining it over three decades.\u201cThe campaign was Freedom to Marry, but it didn\u2019t do everything,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cThere were lots of organizations. What Freedom to Marry did was, it woke up everyday thinking about what the strategy should be.\u201dMr. Hussein said most field catalysts received financial backing from philanthropists who bought into the idea of the group\u2019s activist founder, who typically plays the role of intermediary. In the case of Freedom to Marry, Mr. Wolfson said, two of its biggest donors came from opposite ends of the political spectrum: Jon Stryker, heir to the Stryker medical device company, and Paul Singer, the founder of the hedge fund Elliott Management.Ms. Roob said Blue Meridian used a strategy that she called a performance-based road map to give recipients and donors markers for success that showed progress and activated additional funding. \u201cIf you just brought people together and said, \u2018What can we do together?\u2019, it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to create all the desire to get people together.\u201dMr. Druckenmiller said what made this approach work was the group\u2019s belief in Ms. Roob and what her team was doing to vet organizations.\u201cThey\u2019re the stock pickers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey bring the ideas and the organizations. We all talk together about the potential and evaluate them. So far there\u2019s been a remarkable consensus.\u201dOne such organization is Upstream USA, which aims to make birth control available to women as a means to expand economic opportunity for them. Mark Edwards, one of the founders of the nonprofit organization, said it was introduced to Blue Meridian early on in its development.\u201cWhen we started in 2014, we had a vision for going national,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have a clearly articulated plan about how we were going to get there.\u201dBefore Blue Meridian offered any funding, he said, it helped Upstream flesh out that plan.Other organizations come up with their own plans, which are often replicated.Kevin Sheekey, global head of communications, government relations and marketing for Bloomberg L.P. and a senior adviser to Michael R. Bloomberg, describes Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as someone who looks at the data and acts because it\u2019s the rational choice. Mr. Bloomberg used this approach when he decided to ban smoking in restaurants and bars early in his first term and applied it later to his campaigns against trans fats and sugar.\u201cWhen we were doing smoking, he said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s the right thing to do,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sheekey, who was running Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s re-election campaign at the time and worried that the issue would cost him votes. \u201cOnce New York did it, people said, \u2018We can do it, too.\u2019 Then Paris did it, and London did it.\u201dIn this way, the Bloomberg administration became a field catalyst for an issue that other cities quickly copied.Wealthy individual donors are motivated to work together for the opportunity to take on a big problem where their insight and resources might make a difference.Mr. Druckenmiller said he had become involved with Blue Meridian after his experience with the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone. He saw the organization\u2019s president, Geoffrey Canada, build on his initial idea and expand the number of children he helped. In doing so, Mr. Canada created a model that others have tried to emulate.The appeal of Blue Meridian to Mr. Druckenmiller was the management group that brought the donors together and guided them.\u201cWith my business, the way you make big money is, you find a great management team and a good concept and you stick to it and you add to it over time,\u201d Mr. Druckenmiller said. \u201cIn philanthropy, there was more this idea that once an idea was formulated, you moved along.\u201cIn my experience,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe more successful an idea is, the easier it is to fund it. In philanthropy, it\u2019s almost harder.\u201dThere is also less risk dealing with an experienced field catalyst. Ms. Ballmer said she liked sharing opinions with the general partners at Blue Meridian.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make bets, it\u2019s nice to be surrounded by those individuals at the table,\u201d she said. \u201cThey present the organizations that are in the pipeline. They present the upsides, downsides and the risks.\u201dHer hope, though, is that the group and others can show that these strategies work, so that larger organizations and government offices can adopt them.There are risks for donors. One is making sure the group works in a cohesive way.\u201cThere\u2019s a limit not to the amount of capital we can bring in, but there is a limit to what makes an effective decision making body,\u201d Ms. Roob said.Another is getting the size of the grant right. Mr. Druckenmiller rejected the notion that too much money could be bad for smaller social service organizations.\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to great leaders is, they don\u2019t dream big enough because they don\u2019t think the capital is available, or they\u2019re spending 75 or 80 percent of their time fund-raising,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be spending their time on their mission.\u201dThe leaders of Upstream learned to dream big. Its first budget in 2015 was $1.5 million; it\u2019s now $17 million, including the first $1 million from Blue Meridian. But it could receive as much as $60 million from the group over the next seven years.But Mr. Edwards said the motivation for expansion was not the money as much as the strategy that Blue Meridian helped Upstream develop.\u201cThey\u2019re always asking the question, \u2018Is that what you want to do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, a relatively new nonprofit operating in an area that doesn\u2019t have a lot of visibility, it\u2019s been enormously helpful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity to check in. They\u2019re in for the long haul.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Turns on the Charm Amid Criticism From Right and Left", "Date": "2017-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a sunny day in July, commuters arriving at Union Station, in the shadow of Capitol Hill, were greeted with free bananas passed out by Amazon employees. In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jay Carney \u2014 the former press secretary to President Obama.Amazon is sweeping the nation\u2019s capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.The company\u2019s more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company\u2019s overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright.The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future. Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.Amazon\u2019s strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company\u2019s push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.\u201cThe concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon\u2019s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201cThey are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that\u2019s helped it generate a lot of media attention,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University.Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism \u2014 in their cases over their platforms\u2019 potential to shape public opinion.\u201cWith Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,\u201d Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. \u201cThe people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eli Broad, Patron of Los Angeles, to Step Down From His Philanthropy", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Eli Broad, a billionaire who has been a dominant figure in this city\u2019s cultural, philanthropic, business and political world for almost 50 years, announced on Thursday that he is stepping down from public life, saying that it was \u201ctime to move on.\u201d\u201cI am retiring,\u201d Mr. Broad, 84, said as he ushered two reporters into his 30th-floor office at the Broad Foundations here in Century City. \u201cNow. Right now. I am just tired. I want to spend more time with my family. Catch up on my reading.\u201d\u201cWe have been thinking about this for a long time,\u201d he added. \u201cThe time has come.\u201dIt is difficult to overstate Mr. Broad\u2019s importance to Los Angeles. His vast fortune has shaped the city, from its arts and medical worlds to its reinvigorated downtown. He has lived here for 52 years, since coming from Detroit as a young entrepreneur. He has been a confidant of mayors and governors, an aggressive advocate for charter schools and a heavy contributor to medical causes, particularly stem-cell research. He has given away or pledged $4 billion in his life. The endowment for the Broad Foundations, his main philanthropic arm, is $2.5 billion. His current net worth is $7.3 billion, which he made in construction and insurance.Although Mr. Broad said he considered the money given to education and medical research his biggest accomplishment, his contributions to the city\u2019s art and cultural world may well prove the most enduring legacy \u2014 particularly for Los Angeles\u2019s now-thriving downtown.Mr. Broad said he reached the decision in recent weeks after long discussions with his wife, Edythe, who he said has long urged him to retire. Mr. Broad has prostate cancer, diagnosed more than a decade ago, which is in remission, and he undergoes daily physical therapy for intense back pain, though he said his health was not a factor in his decision.In an interview Thursday, Mr. Broad noted wryly that he was disclosing his decision to retire in the same week that Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is also 84, announced that she was seeking a sixth term. \u201cShe\u2019s got more energy than I have,\u201d said Mr. Broad, who attended a fund-raiser for Ms. Feinstein here earlier this week. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201dThe practical ramifications of Mr. Broad\u2019s decision may be limited; the announcement in many ways marks the end of what has been a slow-motion fade. In August 2016, he named Gerun Riley, 41, a longtime aide, as president of the Broad Foundations, which oversee his investments in art, science and educational causes. Last month, he added four new members to the board of directors of the Broad, another sign of his yielding control.And he has his longtime deputy, Joanne Heyler, as founding director of the Broad Museum and director and chief curator of the Broad Art Foundation. The Broad has been open since September 2015 and is going full throttle, having drawn 1.5 million visitors since the doors opened. Tickets for the \u201cYayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors\u201d exhibition, which opens later this month, quickly disappeared when 150,000 people swarmed onto the website the moment they were posted a few weeks ago.Mr. Broad also spearheaded the effort to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Frank Gehry-designed building that has become an anchor of downtown. His decision to locate the Broad museum just up the street from the concert hall \u2014 bypassing Santa Monica and Beverly Hills \u2014 has also been seen as crucial to downtown\u2019s emergence.He came to symbolize a Medici style of philanthropy that some of this city\u2019s biggest boosters say has been in distressingly short supply. Mr. Broad, in the interview, said he thought that was changing, noting, for example, that David Geffen, the entertainment mogul who lives in Beverly Hills, among other places, recently donated $150 million to the construction of a new building for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.He read from prepared notes as he listed other people who might fill his shoes, including Steve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft who is now the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers; Bob Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, Jeffrey Katzenberg, a former chairman at Disney, and Nicolas Berggruen, a philanthropist and investor who is building a think tank in the Santa Monica Mountains.\u201cHe\u2019s done so much and it\u2019s so permanent and it\u2019s so meaningful,\u201d Mr. Berggruen said. \u201cPeople will always look at Eli as a standard for someone who has been generous.\u201dHe added: \u201cSome cities have one patron, and if that one patron disappears, the city doesn\u2019t recover. I think L.A. is broad enough and deep enough that he will be an example \u2014 but it is not the beginning of the end.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Broad reminisced about meeting many of these artists as he and his wife traveled the world, amassing their collection at a time when many pieces were far more affordable than today. He noted that his years as a philanthropist marked the fourth career of his life: He started as an accountant and moved into insurance and construction before settling into philanthropy.\u201cEvery time I\u2019ve stepped aside in the past, I haven\u2019t missed it,\u201d he said.Mr. Broad alluded to his own reputation as being sometimes prickly, saying he found being a business executive much less challenging than working in philanthropy or dealing with political figures. In 2012, he published a memoir called \u201cThe Art of Being Unreasonable.\u201d\u201cIn business you can make decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be collegial with all sorts of outsider organizations. It\u2019s a different role in philanthropy.\u201dSince he moved to California, Mr. Broad has lived within two miles of his current home in Brentwood. \u201cWe were never excited about the glitz of Beverly Hills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe liked Brentwood.\u201d He said that Los Angeles had changed dramatically since he arrived, in no small part because of what has happened with the contemporary art scene.\u201cLos Angeles is now the contemporary art capital of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have emerged as one of the four major cultural capitals of the world, together with London, New York and Paris.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Amazon Took Seattle\u2019s Soul", "Date": "2017-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the passing of Thursday\u2019s deadline for final bids, it\u2019s been strange to watch nearly every city in the United States pimp itself out for the right to become HQ2 \u2014 and us. Tax breaks. Free land. Champagne in the drinking fountains. Anything!In this pageant for prosperity, the desperation is understandable. Amazon\u2019s offer to create 50,000 high-paying jobs and invest $5 billion in your town is a once-in-a-century, destiny-shaping event.Amazon is not mining coal or cooking chemicals or offering minimum wage to hapless \u201cassociates.\u201d The new jobs will pay $100,000 or more in salary and benefits. In Seattle, Amazon employees are the kind of young, educated, mass-transit-taking, innovative types that municipal planners dream of.So, if you\u2019re lucky enough to land HQ2 \u2014 congrats! But be careful, all you urban suitors longing for a hip, creative class. You think you can shape Amazon? Not a chance. It will shape you. Well before Amazon disrupted books, music, television, furniture \u2014 everything \u2014 it disrupted Seattle.At first, it was quirky in the Seattle way: Jeff Bezos, an oversize mailbox and his little online start-up. His thing was books, remember? How quaint. How retro. Almost any book, delivered to your doorstep, cheap. But soon, publishers came to see Amazon as the evil empire, bringing chaos to an industry that hadn\u2019t changed much since Herman Melville\u2019s day.The prosperity bomb, as it\u2019s called around here, came when Amazon took over what had been a clutter of parking lots and car dealers near downtown, and decided to build a very urban campus. This neighborhood had been proposed as a grand central city park, our own Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, with land gifted by Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder. But voters rejected it. I still remember an architect friend telling me that cities should grow \u201corganically,\u201d not by design.Cities used to be tied to geography: a river, a port, the lee side of a mountain range. Boeing grew up here, in part, because of its proximity to spruce timber used to make early airplanes. And then, water turned the industrial engines that helped to win World War II.At the bottom of the brain index was Muskegon, Mich., a place I recently visited. I found the city lovely, with its lakeside setting, fine old houses and world-class museum. When I told a handful of Muskegonites about the problems in Seattle from the metastatic growth of Amazon, they were not sympathetic.Amazon is secretive. And they haven\u2019t been the best civic neighbor, late to the charity table. Yes, the company has poured $38 billion into the city\u2019s economy. They have 40,000 employees here, who in turn attracted 50,000 other new jobs. They own or lease a fifth of all the class A office space.But median home prices have doubled in five years, to $700,000. This is not a good thing in a place where teachers and cops used to be able to afford a house with a water view.Our shiny new megalopolis has spawned the inevitable political backlash. If you think there\u2019s nothing more annoying than a Marxist with a bullhorn extolling a failed 19th-century economic theory, put that person on your City Council. So Seattle\u2019s council now includes a socialist, Kshama Sawant, who wants \u201cthe public\u201d to take over Amazon ownership. Other council members have proposed a tax on jobs. Try that proposal in Detroit.As a Seattle native, I miss the old city, the lack of pretense, and dinner parties that didn\u2019t turn into discussions of real estate porn. But I\u2019m happy that wages have risen faster here than anywhere else in the country. I like the fresh energy. To the next Amazon lottery winner I would say, enjoy the boom \u2014 but be careful what you wish for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vatican Shines Light on Child Abuse as Claims Against Priests Persist", "Date": "2017-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 For a church hierarchy excoriated for decades over the sexual abuse of children in its trust, hosting a conference this week about the spreading scourge of online child pornography was an opportunity to strike a positive note about the Vatican\u2019s role in protecting minors.It was just the latest of the abuse accusations against priests that have dogged the church around the globe for decades even as it has promised to punish predators and protect the preyed upon. Advocates for the victims have questioned the church\u2019s commitment.Cardinal Parolin, speaking to reporters on Tuesday before his address, called the case a \u201cvery painful affair, a great trial for all those who are involved.\u201d He said the priest\u2019s case was being handled with the \u201cutmost seriousness.\u201d The Vatican has also said that the Holy See\u2019s chief prosecutor was investigating and that if the monsignor was tried and convicted, he could be sentenced up to 12 years in a Vatican jail.But advocates for victims have argued that the Vatican\u2019s invocation of diplomatic immunity to recall the Italian monsignor from the United States shows that it still prioritizes protecting its own.In his speech before top Italian officials and representatives from Interpol, the United Nations, Russia, China, the United States, Facebook and Microsoft, Cardinal Parolin spoke at length about the growing threat of internet abuse on the spirit and psyches of young users. He acknowledged that when it came to the exploitation and abuse of children, \u201cover the past few decades, this tragic reality has come powerfully to the fore in the Catholic Church, and extremely grave facts have emerged.\u201dLast month, Francis said in unscripted remarks to a commission he had created to advise him on the issue that the church had \u201carrived late\u201d to the crisis. He lamented his leniency, early in his pontificate, toward an Italian priest who subsequently continued his abuse.\u201cThe old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,\u201d the pope said. He said he would limit the chances of pedophile priests to appeal their convictions by church tribunals.A commission Francis created with top cardinals, outside experts and abuse victims (the committee\u2019s only two victims have since left) has seemed stifled by Vatican bureaucracy.The Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, said he was confident that this time, the accused cleric would face justice.\u201cEveryone who commits a crime needs to be punished,\u201d he said. \u201cPeriod.\u201dThe congress, meanwhile, is seeking ways to protect children in what has been depicted as a frightening digital world, where abusers surf a dark web and child pornography proliferates.For years, top Vatican officials in Rome had dismissed the abuse crisis as a unique product of the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggested that it had been overplayed by the news media. But organizers of the congress said the majority of the experts came from countries in the global north because that is where the problem has been confronted most aggressively.In an interview, Father Zollner said that on his global travels looking into the problem, he had observed that bishops and clerics in countries such as Malawi were finally facing an issue they would not talk about as recently as a year ago. But other nations are still constrained by local cultural taboos about discussing child abuse, he said.Father Zollner he said the media focus on Monsignor Capella could have a positive side effect and put \u201cmore attention to the topic of the congress,\u201d which, he said, was to better understand the phenomenon of child pornography and how to prevent it.\u201cThat is our whole purpose,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re thinking about the implications of the decision by Ken Chenault, one of the financial world\u2019s biggest names, to retire as C.E.O. of American Express next year. More on that in a moment.We\u2019re going to get to talk with Mr. Chenault, who has agreed to speak at DealBook\u2019s sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, on Nov. 9. He\u2019s the latest addition to a lineup that already includes Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi and Laurene Powell Jobs.When Mr. Chenault was named Amex\u2019s C.E.O. in 2001, he became only the third black person to run a Fortune 500 company.And with Ursula Burns having retired as Xerox\u2019s chief executive in January, there are no black women running Fortune 500 companies.\u201cPart of the problem is a lack of good succession planning to groom African-Americans to get to the top.

{"Headline": "How Google\u2019s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYet passwords remain the primary way we log in to online accounts containing our personal and financial information. Google has a new pragmatic solution: Embrace the password, but lock it down with extra physical security.This way, even if hackers stole your password in a data breach or successfully phished for it, by tempting you to hand over your credentials on a fake login page, they couldn\u2019t do anything unless they got their hands on the keys as well. And minimizing risk with minimal effort is a boon to anyone who cares about online security.\u201cI am a big fan of this,\u201d said John Sabin, a former hacker for the National Security Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the easiest and most secure multifactor for the masses.\u201dThe physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you. Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.The idea of Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message. Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group? Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses. The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys. But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you. To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it. (The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.) This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins. That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.But there are trade-offs. Google\u2019s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys. For the time being, that means only Google\u2019s Gmail mail app, Google\u2019s Backup and Sync app, and Google\u2019s Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Google\u2019s Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser. So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you\u2019re out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don\u2019t have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google\u2019s requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google\u2019s program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.\u201cIt\u2019s something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason you shouldn\u2019t turn this on.\u201dWhile the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google\u2019s apps from Apple\u2019s and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google\u2019s mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature \u2014 Apple\u2019s V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google\u2019s iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won\u2019t work with the keys.If you decide to wait, don\u2019t procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages. While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well. When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google\u2019s keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: \u201cNo comment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tech Is Starting to Make Me Uneasy", "Date": "2017-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s gadget season in the tech world. Think of it like New York Fashion Week, untucked white-man edition.But despite the baubles and billion-dollar office parks, I\u2019m really not feeling it this year. The technology industry is still exciting; it still packs the capacity for surprise. But where the surprise once felt like Christmas morning, it\u2019s now like the entering-the-darkened-basement scene of a horror movie.Technology has crossed over to the dark side. It\u2019s coming for you; it\u2019s coming for us all, and we may not survive its advance.I\u2019ve been covering tech for nearly 20 years; for the past three, since I inherited the State of the Art column from David Pogue, I\u2019ve explored for The New York Times how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future.Not only am I lucky enough to have my dream job, but it\u2019s perfectly timed, too. In the years that I\u2019ve written the column, the technology business has swallowed the world, becoming by far the largest and most consequential industry on the globe. Silicon Valley today is like Wall Street in the 1980s, or the defense industry in the 1950s: enjoying gargantuan growth and shaping much of the rest of the rest of the economy, not to mention art, culture, politics, education and healthcare.So why am I feeling so bad about tech?Well, who isn\u2019t, right? Look around you. It\u2019s difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when smartphones and social networks might be ruining the world. The technologies we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. (See how Russian propagandists used Facebook and Twitter to inject false narratives into the news media last year.)These companies are not evil; they\u2019re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don\u2019t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.A lot of these worries aren\u2019t new. Though Silicon Valley runs on heedless optimism, much of The Times\u2019s coverage has long been properly skeptical and critical of the implications of new tech. Consider the evil of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d or the rise in accidents caused by drivers looking at their phones. I\u2019ve shared other fears: In 2008, I wrote a book predicting that the internet would lead us into a \u201cpost-fact\u201d world.Still, until this year, the problems caused by tech felt manageable \u2014 bumps on the road to a better tomorrow that we\u2019d eventually figure out. I managed to retain the capacity to be viscerally excited by tech, to instantly fall for its potential and possibilities. And I bought into it personally. You should see my house: I\u2019ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan. (Manual is better, trust me.) There\u2019s a lot about it I now can\u2019t live without; every time I want to snap a picture of my kids, which is maybe five times an hour, I\u2019m grateful for the smartphone.And yet now it all comes freighted with worry. That\u2019s what\u2019s different. In 2007, when Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone, just about everyone greeted the new device as an unalloyed good. I was one of them. Here was a genuinely new thing that would Make Your Life Better, we all thought: It would be convenient, it would be fun, it wasn\u2019t serious or dangerous or globe-shattering. That\u2019s no longer true.The State of the Art, today, is a bag of mixed emotions. Tech might improve everything. And it\u2019s probably also terrible in ways we\u2019re only just starting to understand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But so what? Hasn\u2019t that always been the case?As the men who run Silicon Valley will be the first to tell you, a company\u2019s size doesn\u2019t matter here. For every lumbering Goliath, there are always one or two smarter, faster Davids just now starting up in some fabled garage, getting ready to slay the giants when they least expect it.Well, maybe not this time.The technology industry is now a playground for giants. Where 10 or 20 years ago we looked to start-ups as a font of future wonders, today the energy and momentum have shifted almost completely to the big guys. In addition to the many platforms they own already, one or more of the Five are on their way to owning artificial intelligence, voice assistants, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, home automation, and every other cool and crazy thing that will rule tomorrow.The best start-ups keep being scooped up by the big guys (see Instagram and WhatsApp, owned by Facebook). Those that escape face merciless, sometimes unfair competition (their innovations copied, their projects litigated against). And even when the start-ups succeed, the Five still win.Because today\u2019s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don\u2019t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition \u2014 they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.The small guys won\u2019t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don\u2019t have the whole game won.They said the Five\u2019s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five\u2019s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren\u2019t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.\u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019d say it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, \u2018Why won\u2019t Microsoft do your business?\u2019 Then six years later it was, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Google do it?\u2019 Now it\u2019s a combination of why can\u2019t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?\u201dMr. Levin\u2019s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.IAC\u2019s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie\u2019s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five \u2014 both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that\u2019s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys \u2014 for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms \u2014 because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.\u201cWe think that a smart voice provider will say, \u2018If I want to win at all costs, we\u2019ll go get the very best partner\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s us,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It\u2019s not betting on their demise; rather, it\u2019s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.IAC\u2019s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. \u201cI think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,\u201d Mr. Terrill said.I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia \u2014 whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.\u201cI\u2019m mixed as it relates to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers \u2014 and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.\u201dBut like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here\u2019s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk", "Date": "2017-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst there were individual offices. Then cubicles and open floor plans. Now, there is a \u201cpalette of places.\u201dNew office designs are coming to a workplace near you, with layouts meant to cater to the variety of tasks required of modern white-collar workers. Put another way, it means people don\u2019t sit in just one place.It\u2019s partly a backlash against the one-size-fits-all mind-set, not to mention the corporate penny-pinching, embodied in the move toward pure open floor plans that packed more workers into less and less space. That idea was supposed to drive collaboration, but many experts agree it often went too far, with row upon row of desks and workbench-style seating more likely to generate ennui than efficiency.\u201cWhen used as a generic answer for work space design, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said David Lathrop, a researcher at Steelcase, a big office furniture maker.The new model is largely open, but not entirely. Under the revised thinking, breaking down walls to bring people together is good, but so are \u201cteam spaces\u201d and standing tables, comfortable couches and movable walls.Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn\u2019t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include \u201cisolation rooms,\u201d soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.And it\u2019s meant to be tweaked as needs change. \u201cThis continues to be iterated,\u201d said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM \u2014 and whose use of the word \u201citerated\u201d hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.\u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019re going stop and say, \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d he said.The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work \u2014 or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce\u2019s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.\u201cThese workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,\u201d said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology \u2014 and its hurry-up ways \u2014 into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called \u201cactivity-based workplace design,\u201d tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.\u201cOffice geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,\u201d said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.\u201cYou have to collaborate more,\u201d said Michael Ford, Microsoft\u2019s general manager of global real estate. \u201cWe absolutely have to change.\u201dFor decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to \u201cdo a turtle,\u201d researchers say, and retrench and communicate less \u2014 colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example.Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweet spot for Microsoft,\u201d Mr. Ford said.The company thinks it is working. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company\u2019s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.But companies can also save money, by using a little less space than conventional offices do.Worker space is now about 150 square feet per person, down from 225 square feet in 2010, estimates Tim Venable, senior vice president for research at CoreNet Global, a commercial real estate association. But the hybrid design saves less than entirely open designs, which usually have workbench settings and in which the amount of space can drop to as low as 60 square feet per worker.\u201cThere can be huge value to people coming together, but the real reason a lot of corporations have gone to bench seating is money falling to the bottom line,\u201d said Mr. Lathrop of Steelcase.Another space saver has been getting people to work from home, a trend for years in corporate America. But that trend is reversing, as companies recognize that offices can be creative clusters.IBM, for example, recently called 5,000 of its at-home employees back to offices, though one in five workers in North America still work from home full time, the company said.Since 2014, IBM has spent $380 million renovating its work spaces in the United States, which now bear all the hallmarks of the new hybrid design \u2014 open spaces, whiteboard walls, no offices, sit-or-stand desks, huddle rooms and phone rooms.IBM, said Mr. Cuevas, vice president for real estate strategy and operations, offers employees up to 10 different space configurations. In January, the company also remade its headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., with senior executives departing wood-paneled offices for smaller, side-by-side glass ones without doors.While G.E. executives wait for the company\u2019s new headquarters to be built in Boston, they are working in temporary offices nearby, designed according to the new principles. The contrast with the cavernous offices and silent hallways of the old headquarters in suburban Connecticut could scarcely be more striking \u2014 open spaces, sit-or-stand desks, and no parking spaces. (Workers are urged to take public transportation.)Face-to-face conversations have replaced endless email chains, so decisions are made faster, said Ann Klee, vice president for the Boston development and operations. Still, openness has its limits. Sometimes, she concedes, you do have to ask colleagues to use their \u201cindoor voices.\u201d More quiet rooms are being added to the new headquarters design.The Boston Consulting Group has also adopted the new design, with two goals in mind: prompt people to come to the office rather than avoid it, and encourage more \u201ccasual collisions\u201d that might spur workers to trade ideas and build relationships.Its old Midtown Manhattan office was a traditional space with offices housing one, two or four people each. \u201cLots of doors, lots of pillars, nowhere to really hang out, and people had lunch delivered to their desks,\u201d said Ross Love, a senior partner in New York.The new space, in the Hudson Yards development on the Far West Side of Manhattan, is a hybrid open design. Since the firm moved in last November, most consultants have been coming into the office substantially more often than they did to the old building.Two tests were conducted of about 100 employees, before and after the move. In the new space, workers spent an additional four to five hours a week in short, unplanned interactions. And they spent less time in formal meetings.In surveys, the company\u2019s workers say they are getting more done, faster in the new space. But the payoff, Mr. Love concedes, is difficult to measure so far.\u201cIt\u2019s like increasing the clock speed of a computer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you rev things up, you ought to be able to do more.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohr.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Science and History to Unlock the Secrets of Bread", "Date": "2017-10-02", "News": "Nathan Myhrvold and Francisco Migoya\u2019s myth-busting new book, \u201cModernist Bread,\u201d is a call for bakers to experiment and innovate.Supported byBELLEVUE, Wash. \u2014 Two years ago in Paris, Nathan Myhrvold wandered the Louvre on a mission, camera in hand, documenting every image of bread that he could find. \u201cSadly, art historians don\u2019t catalog paintings by whether or not there\u2019s bread in them,\u201d he said.The new book \u2014 stretching over 2,000 pages, with step-by-step images and a hefty list price of $625 \u2014 chronicles the history and science of bread-making in depth (\u201cBaking is applied microbiology,\u201d one chapter begins), breaking frequently for meticulous, textbook-style tangents on flour and fermentation. Its recipes require a commitment to close reading, and to flipping back through the books for deeper explanations. But each has useful variations that work with many kinds of mixing and cooking methods, for both professional and home kitchens.Above all, the book is a call for cooks to rethink one of the world\u2019s oldest foods \u2014 to understand how bread is made, using more than their instinct and intuition, so they can push the craft forward.\u201cYou do things one way, until you learn there\u2019s a completely different way that\u2019s even better,\u201d Mr. Migoya said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s always a better way.\u201dThe Cooking Lab\u2019s headquarters are in Bellevue, across Lake Washington from Seattle. Mr. Migoya runs a spotless kitchen on the second floor, equipped with many types of ovens, a freeze dryer, a three-dimensional scanner and an ultrasonic bath.The kitchen has become a base for low-tech investigations, too, like the authors\u2019 re-enactment of a first-century fresco that shows a man handing out bread in Pompeii.To reproduce the squat loaves, they procured a bronze Roman bread stamp from an antiquities dealer in New York (yes, he was horrified when he found out it would be put to use in a working oven) and called in a costume designer to dress a few of their bearded colleagues.What might sound like cute cosplay for bread nerds also sums up the spirit of \u201cModernist Bread,\u201d a book that demands bakers look into the past without romanticizing it.The history of bread has been ugly at times, and the wedge loaves of Pompeii, according to Mr. Migoya and Mr. Myhrvold, weren\u2019t exactly delicious. The book insists that the most exciting time to be a baker (or bread lover) isn\u2019t a golden age that has passed us all by. It wasn\u2019t Pompeii, or medieval Florence or 18th-century France, with its wheat riots. And it wasn\u2019t Northern California in the 1970s, where the American artisanal bread movement started in response to the industrialization of bread.It is right now.So Mr. Myhrvold is puzzled by the uniformity of bakeries and bread aisles, and the persistence of what he calls \u201can ethos of primitivism,\u201d or a resistance to innovation, among so many contemporary bakers.\u201cIt\u2019s led to ever more primitive techniques,\u201d Mr. Myhrvold said, noting the current preference for sourdough over yeast, for wood over gas and for grinding flours in-house. \u201cMy rhetorical question is, \u2018What\u2019s next, stone tools?\u2019\u201d\u201cModernist Bread\u201d finds inspiration in a variety of sources, industrial as well as artisanal, offering a defense of high fructose corn syrup alongside a guide to caring for wild sourdough starters, and debunking the idea that water purity affects the rise and flavor of bread.It offers fresh techniques for solving all sorts of infuriating baking puzzles. To combat the density and dryness of whole wheat bread, Mr. Migoya adds in the bran and germ later, only after the dough has developed significant gluten, to bake a more lightweight, airy loaf.To prevent the inexorable balding process in which bagels shed their toppings, a fine slurry of modified tapioca starch works like a powerful, edible glue, firmly affixing a dense, even layer of toppings to baked bagels. A little gelatin makes high-hydration doughs \u2014 those gloopy, fussy darlings of the bread world \u2014 much easier to handle, with the bonus of a browner crust.Some of the tips are dead simple: To rescue an over-proofed dough, punch it down and reshape it.He had folded in a pur\u00e9e of huitlacoche, the rich, earthy fungus that grows in corn, as well as some fresh yellow kernels. Though he had access to more equipment than most fine-dining restaurants on the planet, Mr. Migoya followed a hands-on method that relied on plenty of visual and tactile cues.\u201cThere\u2019s tech for determining flour strength, hydration, staling, all of these things,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when it comes to how to determine proper proofing, you need a finger. It\u2019s the best instrument there is.\u201dMr. Migoya had mixed the whole wheat dough with Sir Yeast a Lot, one of two four-year-old sourdough starters that are fed daily, so they\u2019re up and ready to work by 10 each morning. Every half-hour, he gave it a quick fold, until he could stretch the dough into a membrane as sheer and ephemeral as a chewing gum bubble.When Mr. Migoya lifted the lid on the wobbly sourdough, to add bran and germ, an ancient smell wafted out: fermented grain, rich with perfume, high and sweet and alcoholic.He was running his own chocolate shop in the Hudson Valley when Mr. Myhrvold, now 58, tapped him to head up the Cooking Lab\u2019s kitchen in 2014.One mystery eluded Mr. Migoya as he worked on the book: understanding the specific, glorious smell of just-baked bread. \u201cSure, there are a lot of compounds transforming during the baking process,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there isn\u2019t a complete answer as to why bread smells so darn good.\u201dHe studied academic papers, and his team did some of their own chemical analyses, trying to distill the essence of the aroma in a rotary evaporator. It wasn\u2019t possible.Neither, Mr. Myhrvold says, is predicting the future of bread. He notes that while culinary movements like nouvelle cuisine have continually shifted restaurant culture, the world of bread has been slower to change.\u201cI\u2019m not quite pompous and narcissistic enough to say, \u2018Here is where bread is going,\u2019\u201d Mr. Myhrvold said. But he hopes the book explodes some misconceptions for bakers.Mr. Migoya thinks that flour may come to be valued, like chocolate and coffee, as a product worth a premium price. \u201cI don\u2019t want bread to be an elite thing that no one can afford,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there should be some breads that are highly regarded for their ingredients, and for the craft of their bakers.\u201dSome professional bakers have wondered how Mr. Myhrvold, who hasn\u2019t been handling fermentations or mixing large amounts of bread daily, for decades, might teach the industry something new. \u201cI was skeptical at first,\u201d said Melissa Weller, formerly the head baker at Per Se in New York, and later Roberta\u2019s in Brooklyn. \u201cBut now I\u2019m curious.\u201dMs. Weller, who worked with a wood-fired oven for years (and found it inefficient for bread), also has a degree in chemical engineering. Like many bakers, she has pieced together a deep knowledge from independent reading \u2014 Nancy Silverton, Jeffrey Hamelman, Michel Suas \u2014 and many years of bread production in different kinds of kitchens.\u201cBread-baking is a hard-earned knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, I\u2019ve never seen a book that\u2019s able to express it all.\u201dEarly in the book\u2019s genesis, Mr. Migoya worked for months on a bread family tree \u2014 lean, enriched, flat, bricklike \u2014 tracing relationships in ratios and practices across the world, narrowing categories and setting down definitions for words that have often resisted them. \u201cThe history of bread is full of human folly, which is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what is beautiful about bread.\u201dWhat excited him now was the idea of someone reading the book and going her own way, of bakeries in New York, Tokyo and Paris with utterly different menus. \u201cMaybe new kinds of bread will come to light, and someone will invent a new type of bread,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be so exciting.\u201dAfter Mr. Migoya baked his huitlacoche sourdough, it had a dark, crackling crust. Sawing it open with a serrated cake knife, he revealed a tender, stretchy core, a gelatinous sheen along its wide, open crumb.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mr. Migoya said, as if he hadn\u2019t cut into thousands of similarly beautiful loaves.He had been tinkering with a huitlacoche bread for some time. For this version, the one he planned to serve on a publicity tour for the book, Mr. Migoya had charred chiles and slow-cooked a traditional red mole from Puebla, Mexico. He mixed it with butter in a Pacojet, which sent a high-speed blade spinning through, top to bottom, turning it smooth, shiny and just the right temperature to eat.He used a piping bag fitted with a flat tip to squeeze a generous amount of butter down the middle of each slice, sweeping crumbs away, keeping his cutting board pristine. The bread was the deep gray of wet pavement, and the crimped ribbon of mole butter was bright red.It had an intense, satisfying crunch and chew, and an elaborate rush of heat and tang that carried on long after the last bite. It was familiar, but also entirely new.\u201cBread and butter,\u201d Mr. Migoya said. \u201cIt\u2019s only bread and butter.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Joseph Simons, Corporate Antitrust Lawyer, to Lead F.T.C.", "Date": "2017-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe consumer protection and competition agency has been led by just two commissioners over the last 10 months. Mr. Trump\u2019s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department.The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved.Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews.Amazon\u2019s $4.3 billion purchase of Whole Foods was quickly approved by the F.T.C. in August, largely because of ample competition in the grocery foods market.But some antitrust academics and politicians criticized the fast review, saying the government needed to look more broadly at whether Amazon\u2019s ability to take losses and leverage other parts of its businesses harmed competition.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, has called on the agency to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google that was closed in 2013, saying new evidence from a parallel investigation in Europe warrants a new look. Stephen K. Bannon, the former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, has called Google a utility-like monopoly that needs antitrust scrutiny.Mr. Simons comes from the Washington offices of the law firm Paul Weiss, where he served as a partner representing big tech clients including Microsoft and Sony in a $4 billion acquisition of patents from Nortel Networks. He also represented Mastercard in antitrust class-action cases against the credit card company in federal court. But like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for corporate watchdog roles, Mr. Simons has been in and out of the private and public sector for years.Since the election, moderate Democrats and Republicans have trained their focus on corporate consolidation. The new climate, antitrust experts say, makes it difficult to predict how Mr. Simons will act.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting so long for leadership at the agencies, we are out of the speculation business until we see some enforcement under the new antitrust chiefs,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, a group that has pushed for online privacy regulations and stronger competition enforcement, said the agency was \u201cat a critical turning point about whether it can be relevant at all protecting consumers in the 21st century.\u201d\u201cIt has been unable to effectively address the dramatic loss of privacy Americans face online,\u201d he added. \u201cThe commission has also failed to effectively tackle the growing power of the major internet companies, especially Google and Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Invented \u2018Zero\u2019?", "Date": "2017-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionObviously, there were no intellectual property rights in force back then. Had there been a patent office, it might have ruled, as courts do now, that mathematical advances uncover pre-existing knowledge rather than create anything new \u2014 and are hence unpatentable. The conundrum of whether mathematics is discovered or invented is as old as Plato. Certainly, zero displays this duality: The void is as old as time, but it was a human innovation to harness it with a symbol.In recognition of this innovation, and ignoring all practicalities, suppose someone, somehow, had figured out how to put a price tag on zero. The royalties generated would be staggering \u2014 imagine the tab for just your personal use alone! This might lead to a significant redistribution of wealth, most of it going to the developing world.Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent \u2014 perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class\u2019s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn\u2019t disburse the money at all, \u201cso as not to encourage capitalism.\u201dOf course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of \u201creparations.\u201d And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they\u2019re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country \u2014 and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India\u2019s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader \u201cnet neutrality\u201d decision, the government banned Facebook\u2019s \u201cFree Basics\u201d plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company\u2019s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What\u2019s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group\u2019s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning. And yet the Bakhshali manuscript reminds us that zero wasn\u2019t always at hand. Rather, it was the intellectual product of cultures perhaps far different from our own, of peoples and regions that may have subsided but could once again rise to dominance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Russia Harvested American Rage to Reshape U.S. Politics", "Date": "2017-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of these were recorded, posted or written by Americans. Yet all ended up becoming grist for a network of Facebook pages linked to a shadowy Russian company that has carried out propaganda campaigns for the Kremlin, and which is now believed to be at the center of a far-reaching Russian program to influence the 2016 presidential election.A New York Times examination of hundreds of those posts shows that one of the most powerful weapons that Russian agents used to reshape American politics was the anger, passion and misinformation that real Americans were broadcasting across social media platforms.Other posts on the Russian pages used stilted language or phrases rarely found in American English. Yet their use of borrowed ideas and arguments from Americans, which were already resonating among conservatives and liberals, demonstrated a deft understanding of the political terrain. The Russians also paid Facebook to promote their posts in the feeds of American Facebook users, helping them test what content would circulate most widely, and among which audiences.One Russian Facebook page, the United Muslims of America, frequently posted content highlighting discrimination against Muslims. In June 2016, it posted a video originally made by Waqas Shah, 23, an online video creator from Staten Island. In the video, Mr. Shah dressed in a thobe, a traditional ankle-length gown worn by Arab men, walked through New York\u2019s Union Square, where he is shoved and harassed by another actor pretending to be a bully to see how bystanders react.The video ends with Mr. Shah pointing out New York\u2019s hypocrisy: The city claims to be a \u201cmelting pot,\u201d but no one intervened while he was getting harassed. Mr. Shah\u2019s original video, posted on YouTube in June 2016, was a viral hit that attracted more than three million views. A week after he posted it, United Muslims of America copied the video to its group page without the original YouTube link, a process known as ripping. There, Mr. Shah\u2019s video become the Russian page\u2019s most popular post, earning more than 150,000 interactions.Mr. Shah said when he noticed the ripped video, he wrote to the administrator of the United Muslims account, asking them to add the link to his original YouTube video. His main concern, Mr. Shah said, was that the page was stealing his views. Told that his video had been used by Russian accounts to sow division in the United States, Mr. Shah said there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it.\u201cThere are always going to be people who manipulate things to their agenda,\u201d he said.When Being Patriotic posted a brief message last year rallying Americans against proposals to expand refugee settlements in the United States, it was liked, shared or otherwise engaged with by more than 750,000 Facebook users. Eventually, it came across the feed of Len Swanson, 64, a Republican activist from Houston and an avid Trump supporter.\u201cI usually publish an article several times a week, to keep driving the narrative,\u201d Mr. Swanson said in an interview. He was not bothered, he said, by becoming an unwitting cog in the Russian propaganda machine. \u201cYou know we do the same damn thing over there,\u201d Mr. Swanson said. \u201cWhat do you think \u2014 we\u2019re saints?\u201dAs lawmakers debate tighter regulation for companies like Facebook, the trail of Russian digital bread crumbs underscores how difficult it will be to purge social media networks of foreign influence, or even to hamper the covert propaganda campaigns carried out on social platforms by Russia, China and other countries.Copying other people\u2019s content without proper attribution can be a violation of the social networks\u2019 rules. But the content itself \u2014 the videos, posts and Instagram memes borrowed and shared on the Russian pages \u2014 are not explicitly violent or discriminatory, so they do not violate the rules of those services. Instead, they are precisely the type of engaging content these platforms are hungry for.The Russian campaign also appears to have been tailored to exploit the companies\u2019 own strategies for keeping users engaged. Facebook, for example, pushed people to interact more in Groups like the ones set up by the Russians, where users can \u201cshare their common interests and express their opinion\u201d around a common cause. LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by Microsoft, is geared toward encouraging users like Mr. Swanson to create articles and other content.\u201cThe strategies are no mystery,\u201d said Michael Strangelove, a lecturer on internet culture at the University of Ottawa. \u201cForeign powers are playing within the rules of the game that we wrote.\u201dA spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. LinkedIn said Mr. Swanson\u2019s post did not violate the site\u2019s terms of service.\u201cThe challenges posed by the dissemination of fake news and other harmful content through technology platforms are serious,\u201d said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. \u201cWe actively address suspected violations of LinkedIn\u2019s terms of service such as harassment, fake profiles, and misinformation on our platform.\u201dThe Russians appear to have insinuated themselves across American social media platforms and used the same promotional tools that people employ to share cat videos, airline complaints and personal rants. Many of the posts on Being Patriotic also match pre-made, shareable graphics on sites like ConservativeMemes.com, nestled alongside other conservative content made for sharing on social media.Boosted by Russian accounts, the material was quickly picked up by other American users of Facebook, spreading the posts to an even bigger audience. The Russian presence appeared to be layered throughout different platforms: Some of the Facebook accounts, including Being Patriotic, had linked accounts on Instagram and Twitter, according to deleted content captured in Google\u2019s cache.John W. Kelly, the founder of Graphika, a commercial analytics company in New York, said the Russians appeared to have a consistent strategy across different platforms. Graphika has tracked thousands of social media accounts whose content closely tracks Russian information operations, promoting articles and videos about WikiLeaks dumps of stolen emails and \u201cfalse flag\u201d conspiracies about Syrian chemical weapons.The Russian accounts intermingle with real groups of Facebook or Twitter users \u2014 from white nationalists to Bernie Sanders supporters \u2014 and seek to manipulate and radicalize them, Mr. Kelly said.Rather than construct fake grass-roots support behind their ideas \u2014 the public relations strategy known as \u201cAstroturfing\u201d \u2014 the Russians sought to cultivate and influence real political movements, Mr. Kelly said.\u201cIt isn\u2019t Astroturfing \u2014 they\u2019re throwing seeds and fertilizer onto social media,\u201d said Mr. Kelly. \u201cYou want to grow it, and infiltrate it so you can shape it a little bit.\u201dNick Confessore reported from New York and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "How the Appetite for Emojis Complicates the Effort to Standardize the World\u2019s Alphabets", "Date": "2017-10-18", "News": "FeatureDo the volunteers behind Unicode, whose mission is to bring all human languages into the digital sphere, have enough bandwidth to deal with emojis too?Supported byPandey eventually identified the script as an alphabet for Rohingya, the language spoken by the stateless and persecuted Muslim people whose greatest numbers live in western Myanmar, where they\u2019ve been the victims of brutal ethnic cleansing. Pandey wasn\u2019t sure if the alphabet itself was in use anymore, until he lucked upon contemporary pictures of printed textbooks for children. That meant it wasn\u2019t a historical footnote; it was alive.An email query from Pandey bounced from expert to expert until it landed with Muhammad Noor, a Rohingya activist and television host who was living in Malaysia. He told Pandey the short history of this alphabet, which was developed in the 1980s by a group of scholars that included a man named Mohammed Hanif. It spread slowly through the 1990s in handwritten, photocopied books. After 2001, thanks to two computer fonts designed by Noor, it became possible to type the script in word-processing programs. But no email, text messages or (later) tweets could be sent or received in it, no Google searches conducted in it. The Rohingya had no digital alphabet of their own through which they could connect with one another.Billions of people around the world no longer face this plight. Whether on computers or smartphones, they can write as they write, expressing themselves in their own linguistic culture. What makes this possible is a 26-year-old international industrial standard for text data called the Unicode standard, which prescribes the digital letters, numbers and punctuation marks of more than 100 different writing systems: Greek, Cherokee, Arabic, Latin, Devanagari \u2014 a world-spanning storehouse of languages. But the alphabet that Noor described wasn\u2019t among them, and neither are more than 100 other scripts, just over half of them historical and the rest alphabets that could still be used by as many as 400 million people today.Now a computational linguist and motivated by a desire to put his historical knowledge to use, Pandey knows how to get obscure alphabets into the Unicode standard. Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he\u2019s currently working to add another eight). With Noor\u2019s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey\u2019s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode\u2019s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.As a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. \u201cThe spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,\u201d Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group\u2019s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. \u201cIt becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,\u201d Noor says.Creating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that\u2019s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.At the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like \u201cindent\u201d). The capital letter \u201cA,\u201d for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or \u201ccharacter encoding.\u201d The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.In order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. \u201cThe proliferation of character encodings was chaos,\u201d Whistler says.Joe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don\u2019t become regulations; they\u2019re conventions, \u201crecipes for reality\u201d in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.As is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.Unicode\u2019s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. \u201cThe people who really got the bug,\u201d Whistler says, \u201csaw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.\u201d No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.Unicode\u2019s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called \u201cSzekley-Hungarian Rovas\u201d instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author\u2019s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.The standard\u2019s effectiveness helped. \u201cIf standards work, they\u2019re invisible and can be ignored by the public,\u201d Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. \u201cWe used to ask ourselves, \u2018How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?\u2019\u2009\u201d Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight \u2014 at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.All that changed in October 2010, when that year\u2019s version of the Unicode standard included its first set of emojis.In the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data \u2014 as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn\u2019t translate their numerical identifiers.When a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.As the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn\u2019t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn\u2019t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.At Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. \u201cSuch a 1980s sci-fi villain name,\u201d one participant grumbled. \u201cWho put them in charge?\u201d A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Undefeated,\u201d urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. \u201cWe are the internet!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is us!\u201dOn the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium\u2019s responsibilities.Davis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they\u2019re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he\u2019d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.Not everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. \u201cNormal people can have an opinion about why there isn\u2019t a cupcake emoji,\u201d said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn\u2019t space \u2014 Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers \u2014 but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.\u201cEmoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,\u201d Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. \u201cWe can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what\u2019s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That\u2019s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.\u201dEmoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode\u2019s mission. It\u2019s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. \u201cWorking on characters used in a small province of China, even if it\u2019s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that\u2019s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,\u201d Mark Bramhill told me.Since its creation was announced in 2015, the \u201cAdopt a Character\u201d program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.One way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can\u2019t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. \u201cThere are always winners and losers in standards,\u201d Lawrence Busch says. \u201cYou might want to say, ultimately we\u2019d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.\u201dMichael Erard is writer in residence at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and the author of \u2018\u2018Babel No More: The Search for the World\u2019s Most Extraordinary Language Learners.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

Talent", "Date": "2017-10-22", "News": "Nearly all big tech companies have an artificial intelligence project, and they are willing to pay experts millions of dollars to help get it done.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s start-ups have always had a recruiting advantage over the industry\u2019s giants: Take a chance on us and we\u2019ll give you an ownership stake that could make you rich if the company is successful.Now the tech industry\u2019s race to embrace artificial intelligence may render that advantage moot \u2014 at least for the few prospective employees who know a lot about A.I.Typical A.I. specialists, including both Ph.D.s fresh out of school and people with less education and just a few years of experience, can be paid from $300,000 to $500,000 a year or more in salary and company stock, according to nine people who work for major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them. All of them requested anonymity because they did not want to damage their professional prospects.Well-known names in the A.I. field have received compensation in salary and shares in a company\u2019s stock that total single- or double-digit millions over a four- or five-year period. And at some point they renew or negotiate a new contract, much like a professional athlete.At the top end are executives with experience managing A.I. projects. In a court filing this year, Google revealed that one of the leaders of its self-driving-car division, Anthony Levandowski, a longtime employee who started with Google in 2007, took home over $120 million in incentives before joining Uber last year through the acquisition of a start-up he had co-founded that drew the two companies into a court fight over intellectual property.Salaries are spiraling so fast that some joke the tech industry needs a National Football League-style salary cap on A.I. specialists. \u201cThat would make things easier,\u201d said Christopher Fernandez, one of Microsoft\u2019s hiring managers. \u201cA lot easier.\u201dThere are a few catalysts for the huge salaries. The auto industry is competing with Silicon Valley for the same experts who can help build self-driving cars. Giant tech companies like Facebook and Google also have plenty of money to throw around and problems that they think A.I. can help solve, like building digital assistants for smartphones and home gadgets and spotting offensive content.Most of all, there is a shortage of talent, and the big companies are trying to land as much of it as they can. Solving tough A.I. problems is not like building the flavor-of-the-month smartphone app. In the entire world, fewer than 10,000 people have the skills necessary to tackle serious artificial intelligence research, according to Element AI, an independent lab in Montreal.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who previously worked at Google. \u201cThey are anxious to ensure that they\u2019ve got this small cohort of people\u201d who can work on this technology.\u201cIt is hard to compete with that, especially if you are one of the smaller companies,\u201d said Jessica Cataneo, an executive recruiter at the tech recruiting firm CyberCoders.By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques. Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft\u2019s Skype phone service.With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.\u201cThere is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.\u201cThere are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,\u201d Mr. Zettlemoyer said. \u201cThe salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.\u201dThe basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call \u201ca dark art.\u201d Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.\u201cI can\u2019t compete with Google, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. \u201cSo I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.\u201dBut the industry\u2019s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won\u2019t be alleviated for years.\u201cOf course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,\u201d Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. \u201cIt takes many years to train a Ph.D.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

Growth in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic output, slowed to 2.4 percent but is expected to rebound as the effects of the hurricanes fade. And rising inventories contributed just over 0.7 percentage point to growth, in what could be a sign that companies think consumer demand will warm up.There are other positive signs. Business investment, which had been lagging but improved in recent months, came in at a healthy 3.9 percent. Exports increased 2.3 percent in the third quarter, which added more than 0.4 percentage point to economic growth. It was aided by global expansion, with world economic growth in sync for the first time in years and Europe catching up with the United States. The International Monetary Fund projected that the global economy would increase 3.6 percent in 2017 and grow 3.7 percent the next year.President Trump has promised to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent \u2013 but whether or not he succeeds, companies are performing well.

{"Headline": "Following the (Bike) Trail to Amazon\u2019s Second Headquarters", "Date": "2017-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAmazon will probably narrow the list to a group of finalists before conducting site visits and meeting with elected officials and community leaders. It has said it expects to reach a decision next year.Still, Amazon\u2019s stated objectives and past behavior \u2014 along with interviews with people working with the company on the selection process (none of whom were willing to be named because of their Amazon ties) and corporate governance and location experts \u2014 yield some insights into what factors the retailer values most highly and where the new headquarters may end up. (An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.)This means far more than an attractive building or campus. Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle. Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macy\u2019s department store downtown \u2014 a move rich in irony, given how Macy\u2019s has struggled in competing with online retailers \u2014 and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the city\u2019s downtown area.The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon. The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle don\u2019t use motorized transport to get to work. Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation. Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work.Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office. The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.) It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers.In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada.Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the company\u2019s DNA.Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message.\u201cAmazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco. It\u2019s much different than just tapping the talent that\u2019s already there. Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that.\u201dNext on Amazon\u2019s wish list are capital and operating costs\u201d and \u201cincentives,\u201d which Amazon identifies as \u201chigh priority\u201d considerations. That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cAmazon\u2019s first obligation is to its investors,\u201d Professor Elson said, which means finding \u201cthe most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters,\u201d one that \u201cwill produce the most value for the company.\u201dMost contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark. Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so.New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots. (Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.) Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut. Washington\u2019s score is 99.4.The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austin\u2019s score is 96.2. But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline. Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreal\u2019s score is 85.2; Toronto\u2019s is 85.6. Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canada\u2019s talent-friendly immigration policies.\u201cLabor Force\u201d is third on Amazon\u2019s list. The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattle\u2019s talent pool.The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York \u2014 no surprises there. But other cities also fare well: Washington is No. 4, Toronto is No. 6, Boston is No. 9 and Baltimore is No. 11.Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders.Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive. Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants. Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there. Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact.Amazon adds that \u201ca strong university system is required.\u201dMany contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology. Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University.Amazon cites logistics as \u201ccritically important,\u201d specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco. (These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak\u2019s northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.\u201cCommunity cultural fit\u201d and \u201ccommunity quality of life\u201d are last on Amazon\u2019s list of preferences. Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions \u201ca diverse population\u201d and, again, \u201cexcellent institutions of higher education.\u201d If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit.Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives.That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force. Given Amazon\u2019s vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina\u2019s widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights.There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston.The \u201cCommon Sense\u201d column on Friday, about Amazon\u2019s search for a city to locate a second headquarters, rendered incorrectly the name of a commercial real estate firm that produces an annual ranking of cities based on what it calls \u201ctech talent.\u201d It is CBRE, not CRBE.Advertisement"}

The public adored the companies\u2019 new devices, educators embraced their tools and politicians extolled their contributions to the economy. Even traditionally powerful voices, like media and telecom businesses, found little success in criticizing the technology industry.The reviews site Yelp, which has long complained about the size and power of Google, has filed a new federal antitrust complaint against the search giant.

House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending \u2014 a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers. They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.\u201cIt is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,\u201d Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, \u201cand that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.\u201dThe tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.\u201cIn the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business,\u201d Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Google\u2019s collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles. He has struggled to get attention in the past, but that is not much of a problem now.\u201cI\u2019m getting more calls these days,\u201d Mr. Simpson said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201dPart of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201dYet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government\u2019s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company\u2019s culture \u2014 which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today\u2019s tech giants. But that\u2019s a big if.\u201cThe big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cHad we been more diligent, we wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problems we have today.\u201dFollow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Court Workers, Japanese Firms Try Being More Gay-Friendly", "Date": "2017-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Once a week, the Japanese insurance company where Shunsuke Nakamura works tries to enliven its morning staff meeting by having employees give personal presentations. The topics tend to be mostly innocuous: hobbies, pets or wine recommendations.Mr. Nakamura used his turn, though, to come out as gay.\u201cThere was silence. People were surprised,\u201d Mr. Nakamura, 33, said of his talk, which he gave to a group of about 50 colleagues last year.His company, like many in Japan, is trying to become more gay-friendly. It recently extended family benefits to employees\u2019 same-sex partners, and said it would allow its gay customers to name their partners as beneficiaries of its life insurance plans, something previously limited only to legally sanctioned, opposite-sex spouses. Such changes have proliferated across the economy in recent years, with a rising number of goods and services targeting the gay community in what many Japanese describe as an \u201cL.G.B.T. boom.\u201dIt is a striking trend in a country where departures from the norm, sexual or otherwise, have long been something to keep hidden \u2014 especially at work. Being openly gay was something for niche transgressive pop stars; for the average gray-suited \u201csalaryman,\u201d it was all but unthinkable. And when it comes to the government, marriage for same-sex couples remains off limits.But a combination of evolving social attitudes and competition for talent is forcing businesses here to adapt. As Japanese companies expand overseas, and increasingly face off against Western businesses at home, they are having to change how they hire.\u201cIn Japan, the image of L.G.B.T. people is in transition, from invisible to open,\u201d said Ken Suzuki, who studies sexuality at Meiji University in Tokyo and is active in Japan\u2019s gay-rights movement.Yet the reality for gay Japanese workers is only starting to shift, and unspoken expectations of secrecy remain the norm. Mr. Nakamura said that his colleagues had been supportive, but that coming out at work was still seen as peculiar enough that his supervisors asked him to keep his company\u2019s name out of this article. He reckons that despite his employer\u2019s efforts to be more inclusive, he is still the only one of the firm\u2019s roughly 5,000 employees who is openly gay.Professor Suzuki said the prevailing attitude toward homosexuality in Japan had long been \u201cindifference rather than hate.\u201d Where traditionalists in the United States have sought to root out gays, for example, with anti-sodomy laws, \u201cin Japan, people just don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he said.\u201cAs far as the law is concerned, homosexuality doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Professor Suzuki said.Acceptance of this \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach is declining, however, as younger people insist on living more openly. Japan is also facing a painful shortage of labor, largely the result of low birthrates and limited immigration. That shortage is forcing employers to compete harder to attract workers, and advertising tolerance appeals to young people generally, not just sexual minorities.Kento Hoshi, a 23-year-old law school graduate, has seen that competition firsthand. He pitched his idea for Job Rainbow, an employment website aimed at gay people, in a business contest sponsored by Japanese tech companies two years ago. He won 1 million yen, or about $9,100 at the time, and set up the site with his sister.Job Rainbow initially only offered information and tips about companies perceived as gay-friendly, but today has 50,000 registered users and around 40 companies that pay to advertise job openings. Though it remains small compared with Japan\u2019s main job sites, Mr. Hoshi works on it full time, and its rapid expansion illustrates the changes underway here.Mr. Hoshi said he had been bullied for being gay at his all-boys middle school. On the internet, he read an article saying that around 5 percent of people were gay.\u201cI thought, statistically, there must be one more in my class,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt relieved.\u201dMr. Hoshi joined a group for gay, bisexual and transgender students while in college. But when it came time to look for jobs, he felt pressure to conform. \u201cI sometimes said I was part of an international relations club,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I told the truth, the interviews went nowhere.\u201dHe ended up taking a summer internship at Microsoft, where some of his Japanese colleagues were part of a company-supported network for gay employees. Outside of his small university circle, Mr. Hoshi said, it was the first time he had met openly gay Japanese.\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of role models,\u201d he said. But he believes things are changing. \u201cThree or four years ago, if you came out, people would say, \u2018Huh?\u2019 Now at least everyone knows what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dForeign companies are seen as easier places to be openly gay. And as Japanese companies expand, they are increasingly being pushed toward inclusiveness.Yusuke Kitamura runs the diversity and inclusion team at Nomura, Japan\u2019s largest brokerage firm. Nomura introduced policies to accommodate gay employees and their families after it bought the European and Asian operations of Lehman Brothers following Lehman\u2019s collapse in 2008.But so far, according to Mr. Kitamura, only a handful of its 14,000 staff members in Japan have registered same-sex partners for benefits, something he blamed on ingrained aversion among Japanese to standing out and seeming disruptive.Even if their symbolic value is great, the material rewards on offer are mostly small, meaning that employees who are reluctant to come out openly are unlikely to be swayed by them. Mr. Kitamura referred to a common custom whereby companies give employees cash gifts of 30,000 yen, or about $270, when they get married, a benefit that some businesses now extend to same-sex couples in established relationships.\u201cNo one\u2019s going to come out for 30,000 yen,\u201d Mr. Kitamura said. \u201cWe have a system in place. Now it\u2019s about changing the culture.\u201dThere are signs of that happening. This year, at the urging of an activist group led by Professor Suzuki, the northern city of Sapporo began issuing partnership certificates to same-sex couples, a first for a Japanese city. The move followed the introduction of a similar system in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo in 2015.The certificates carry no legal weight \u2014 in Japan, marriage law is determined by the national government, not local authorities \u2014 but they have provided a degree of official sanction to the emerging equality movement and brought some tangible benefits. Public housing authorities in Sapporo and Shibuya, for example, are required to recognize as spouses any tenants who have acquired the certificates.Still, the pace of progress has been slow. That is something Mr. Nakamura, the insurance worker, linked to Japan\u2019s general emphasis on conformity.\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that everyone has to line up in a neat row, not just when it comes to sexuality,\u201d he said.Mr. Nakamura said life at the office had been mostly normal since he came out. After his colleagues got over their initial surprise, many offered encouragement. He has been treated well, he said, with only a little bit of awkwardness.\u201cSometimes people can be overly conscious,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least people have stopped asking me if I have a girlfriend, or when am I going to get married.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the insurance company employee who came out as gay to his co-workers. He is Shunsuke Nakamura, not Shinsuke.An article on Oct. 14 about efforts by Japanese companies to create more gay-friendly work environments misstated the amount of prize money won by Kento Hoshi in a business contest. He won 1 million yen, not 10 million. The article also paraphrased incorrectly comments made by a representative for the brokerage firm Nomura about cash benefits offered to gay couples after marriage. While the benefit is offered by some Japanese companies, it is not offered by Nomura.Advertisement"}

Microsoft challenged the warrant in 2014, arguing that prosecutors could not force it to hand over its customer\u2019s emails stored abroad.\u201cHundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes \u2014 ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud \u2014 are being or will be hampered by the government\u2019s inability to obtain electronic evidence,\u201d the brief said.A ruling upholding the warrant, the company warned, would embolden foreign countries to seek the emails of Americans stored in the United States.Microsoft added that the Justice Department\u2019s position posed a threat to technology companies by requiring them to choose between complying with a warrant and disobeying foreign laws.\u201cThese conflicts can place U.S. companies in the untenable position of being forced to violate foreign privacy laws to comply with U.S. warrants,\u201d the company\u2019s brief said. \u201cAnd the growing privacy concerns of customers around the world mean that granting U.S. law-enforcement agencies that broad authority would hamstring U.S. companies\u2019 ability to compete in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.\u201dThe Supreme Court also agreed to decide whether American Express can stop businesses from steering customers toward competing credit cards.Retailers pay so-called swipe fees when customers use credit cards. American Express charges higher fees than Visa or Mastercard, meaning that merchants have good reason to prefer those other cards.In 2010, the Justice Department and 17 states sued several credit card companies, saying that their steering practices had violated the antitrust laws. Visa and Mastercard settled, but American Express fought the case.In 2015, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the United States District Court in Brooklyn ruled that contracts forbidding merchants to steer customers toward other forms of payment were an unlawful restraint of trade.The Second Circuit disagreed, ruling that Judge Garaufis had unduly focused on merchants\u2019 interests \u201cwhile discounting the interests of cardholders.\u201d\u201cThis approach does not advance overall consumer satisfaction,\u201d Judge Richard C. Wesley wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. \u201cThough merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction \u2014 and if a particular merchant finds that the cost of Amex fees outweighs the benefit it gains by accepting Amex cards, then the merchant can choose to not accept Amex cards.\u201dThe Justice Department agreed that the Second Circuit had gone astray.The department nonetheless opposed Supreme Court review, saying that the issues in the case deserved further consideration before the justices weighed in.\u201cConsistent with its usual practice of awaiting further percolation in the lower courts before taking up such novel legal issues,\u201d the brief said, \u201cthe court should deny review here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
